25|$|Despite this, the Albert Ground had {{significant}} advantages over Sydney’s existing cricket facilities. It was centrally located and featured good facilities for players and crowd alike. There was a grandstand {{in the north}} west corner and a pavilion ran around three sides of the ground.

25|$|This large office {{building}} in Walton Street was constructed in 1982 and designed by GMW Partnership. It has won awards for the its design with sloping blue mirrored facades. When first built it {{was thought to be}} a potential hazard to passing motorists, due to the sun reflecting from its glass surfaces: a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> were therefore planted alongside the main road to prevent dazzling.|$|E

25|$|However the 1901 Census records W.M. Scott aged {{seven years}} {{with his parents}} and no {{siblings}} close to the tannery again at 20 Stonefield Terrace, in the All Souls parish of north Leeds, Yorkshire, and only four streets away from the Scotts' previous home in Clayfield Street. It was a four-room corner house in a back-to-back row on the corner with Cambridge Road. This was a street of back-to-back houses, but is now a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> on a playing field. In the 1911 Census he was aged 17 years, he had no siblings {{and he was a}} lithographic artist apprentice, living with his parents in a back-to-back house at 49 Ganton Mount at Woodhouse, Leeds; the street is now rebuilt as modern houses. In 1911 his father was a journeyman joiner, and his mother a housewife. The 1911 census enumerator recorded that the house had eight rooms instead of the regular back-to-back four rooms, so no. 49 must have been a larger corner house.|$|E
25|$|MD 655 {{begins at}} a ramp from {{eastbound}} MD 28 (Norbeck Road) {{just east of}} Carrolton Road. The highway heads east as Old MD 28, a one-lane road that closely parallels the eastbound direction of MD 28, with the two roads separated by a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> MD 655 has two ramps to MD 28 and another ramp to the major highway. MD 655 veers away from MD 28 just west of both highways' intersections with MD 115 (Muncaster Mill Road). At the MD 655MD 115 intersection, which serves as MD 115's eastern terminus, MD 655 becomes two-way. The highway continues east until it is adjacent to the MD 28MD 97 intersection. There, the highway turns south to parallel the southbound lanes of MD 97 (Georgia Avenue), separated by two rows of trees. MD 655 very briefly has a center turn lane between Rosecroft Road and Rossmoor Boulevard, which provides access to MD 97 and Leisure World. The highway veers away from MD 97 but continues to parallel the major highway to its terminus at Carrolton Road. The roadway continues beyond a guardrail that restricts traffic to the three houses beyond before the pavement ends just north of Bel Pre Road.|$|E
500|$|Spencer Gore's {{painting}} Richmond Park, {{thought to}} have been painted in the autumn of 1913 or shortly before the artist's death in March 1914, was exhibited at the Paterson and Carfax Gallery in 1920. In 1939 it was exhibited in Warsaw, Helsingfors and Stockholm by the British Council as Group of Trees. It is now {{in the collection of the}} Tate Gallery under its original title but is not currently on display. [...] The painting is one of a series of landscapes painted in Richmond Park during the last months of Gore's life. According to Tate curator Helena Bonett, Gore's early death from pneumonia, two months before what would have been his 36th birthday, was brought on by his painting outdoors in Richmond Park in the cold and wet winter months. It is not certain where in the park the picture was made but a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> close to the pond near Cambrian Gate has a very close resemblance to those in the painting. Another Gore painting, with the same title (Richmond Park), painted in 1914, is at the Ashmolean Museum. His painting Wood in Richmond Park is in the Birmingham Art Gallery's collection.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the garden, from 1670, shows a very different layout. By this time the garden had been redesigned in a grid pattern with sixteen squares of grass separated by paths. The relentless expansion of the Palace of Whitehall, which was by now a sprawling jumble of structures, had hemmed in the Privy Garden behind walls and buildings on all sides. A high wall to the west separated it from The Street, the main thoroughfare {{at the south end}} of Whitehall that bisected the palace in a north-south direction. To the north, a range of buildings occupied by high-ranking courtiers separated it from the Pebble Court that lay behind the Banqueting House, while to the east the Stone Gallery and state apartments, used by the king's closest courtiers, blocked it off from the River Thames. The royal apartments were off the Stone Gallery and had a view of the Privy Garden, with a screen in place to prevent passers-by from seeing the naked king in his [...] bathtub. A <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> on the south side screened it from the Bowling Green, which had been an orchard in Henry VIII's time but was converted for leisure use after the Restoration. A terrace also separated the Privy Garden from the Bowling Green, but this was removed in 1673–4 and part of the Bowling Green was added to the garden.|$|E
