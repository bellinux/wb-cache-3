The {{goal is to}} predict the Total Organic carbon (TOC) in boreholes where the TOC core rock or TOC well-log measurement does not exist. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with three layers is implanted. The MLP input layer is constituted with five neurons corresponding to the natural Gamma ray, Neutron porosity and sonic P and S wave slowness. The hidden layer is composed with nine neurons and the output layer is formed with one neuron corresponding to the TOC log. Application to two horizontal wells drilled in Barnett shale formation where the well A {{is used as a}} pilot and the well B is used for propagation clearly shows the efficiency of the neural network method to improve the shale gas <b>reservoirs</b> <b>characterization.</b> The established formalism plays a high important role in the shale gas plays economy and long term gas energy production...|$|R
40|$|Modeling of {{limestone}} reservoirs is traditionally developed applying tectonic fractures concepts or planar discontinuities {{and has been}} simulated dynamically without considering nonplanar discontinuities as sedimentary breccias, vugs, fault breccias, and impact breccias, assuming that all these nonplanar discontinuities are tectonic fractures, causing confusion and contradictions in <b>reservoirs</b> <b>characterization.</b> The differences in geometry and connectivity in each discontinuity affect fluid flow, generating the challenge to develop specific analytical models that describe quantitatively hydrodynamic behavior in breccias, vugs, and fractures, focusing on oil flow in limestone reservoirs. This paper demonstrates the differences between types of discontinuities that affect limestone reservoirs and recommends that all discontinuities {{should be included in}} simulation and static-dynamic characterization, because they impact fluid flow. To demonstrate these differences, different analytic models are developed. Findings of this work are based on observations of cores, outcrops, and tomography and are validated with field data. The explanations and mathematical modeling developed here could be used as diagnostic tools to predict fluid velocity and fluid flow in limestone reservoirs, improving the complex <b>reservoirs</b> static-dynamic <b>characterization...</b>|$|R

30|$|Therefore, {{well logging}} tools with {{azimuthal}} resolution and remote-detecting functions are urgently required to invert the detailed formation {{information that is}} essential to geologic evaluations, <b>reservoir</b> <b>characterizations,</b> and oil-in-place assessments. To eliminate the azimuth ambiguity of single-well imaging, Zhang and Hu proposed a technique based on the pressure and displacement component, and they validated it by simulated examples (Zhang and Hu; 2014), whereas Gong et al. proposed a method using 3 C reception data to eliminate the 180 Â° azimuth ambiguity of dipole reflection imaging logging (Gong et al. 2015). However, data measured with current tools cannot be used with their method because only the vector receiver is capable of obtaining the displacement. Therefore, the method can only be verified after {{the development of a}} new acoustic logging tool. Qiao et al. proposed an acoustic phased-arc array transmitter with azimuthal directivity (Qiao et al. 2006, 2008, 2009); Che et al. numerically simulated the acoustic field in fluid-filled open holes, cased holes and formations generated by phased-arc array transmitters (Che and Qiao 2009; Che et al. 2010, 2014); and Wu et al. investigated the radiation characteristics of a phase-combined arc array transmitter that can be used in 3 D acoustic well logging (Wu et al. 2013). However, the above studies all focused on the transmitter itself and were relatively simple because they did not consider other sections, such as corresponding circuits and tool bodies.|$|R

Synthetic 2 D and 3 D numerical experiments are performed where various reservoir parameters, like permeability, porosity, reservoir structure, and aquifer characteristics, are updated using gravity and reservoir production data assimilation. The results show that history matching a gas field with pressure data only may provide highly non-unique solutions because several parameter combinations can explain the reservoir pressure behavior observed in the wells. Therefore, additional information is needed which can be provided by time-lapse gravimetry. It is demonstrated that a joint assimilation of pressure and gravity data can provide more constrained inverse solutions and result not only in improved gas and water production forecast, but also can give more accurate reservoir reserves evaluation and reservoir state description.

40|$|Problem statement: Wireline {{formation}} testing (also named Mini-DSTs) {{are gaining}} {{more and more}} popularity as a possible alternative to conventional well testing especially where there are major environmental and economical constraints. The increased offshore exploration activity, which often implies highly risky and huge operational costs, makes the conventional well testing less attractive in favor of other technologies that can provide {{some of the key}} dynamic information about the well-reservoir system through relatively quick and less expensive operations. The design phase is recognized {{to be one of the}} most critical aspects in order to guarantee an acceptable value of information in exploration scenarios where very limited data is available. The success of any mini-DST operation can be significantly compromised if two major issues are not addressed in the design phase: possibility to clearly identify the radial flow behavior and avoidance of noise in the pressure response due to the gauge resolution. Approach: The study consisted in the development of a new tool for mini-DST design to easily identify whether this technology can be successfully applied. The tool comprises dimensionless and dimensional charts, which are of general validity because they can be applied to any lithological environment and for any type of hydrocarbon. Results: Field applications proved the reliability of the charts: First of all the test durations were optimized to collect interpretable bottomhole pressures and to obtain valid <b>reservoir</b> <b>characterizations.</b> Besides, a cost saving effectiveness was achieved avoiding the acquisition of useless extra-data affected by noise due to gauge resolution. Conclusion/Recommendations: The use of the charts is strongly suggested at the early stage of decision making for new exploration/appraisal operations; they are a user-friendly tool for assessing the feasibility of a mini-DST test. Additionally, the charts are more versatile with respect to available commercial software in managing uncertainties of the major input parameters...|$|R
40|$|Marion Plateau is a Miocene cool-subtropical {{carbonate}} platform located in offshore northeastern Australia. It has two separate platforms that present different carbonate biotas and were developed at independent growth stages. At that {{time there was}} an icehouse affecting the glacioeustatic sea levels, and wave base currents impacted carbonate growth rates and platform geometries. However, {{the relation between the}} process involved in the deposition and later stages of the carbonates are not well understood. Marion Plateau carbonate dataset is considered an excellent scenario to develop and test the application of one and two-dimensional forward modelling. The methodology followed in this project involves sequence stratigraphic correlation of five sequence boundaries that denote lowstands, transgressive and highstands system tracts within a mega sequence during Middle Miocene using core data, seismic sections, electrical logs and dolomitization changes. This stratigraphic framework is a key output and is used during the execution of the study. Forward modelling is developed using Douglas formulation for one-dimensional and Dionisos software for two-dimensional models. The models are produced by the relation of eustasy levels, subsidence rate, carbonate production, water depth, and wave action. Models replicate sedimentation rates, facies distribution and carbonate geometries in line with the existent data of the location. As in all modelling processes, limitations and assumptions affect the expected results, which in this study is the ability of reproduce the stratigraphic thickness records. This study successfully shows that forward modelling provides an alternative to representing the interaction between carbonate processes and the carbonate strata geometries that can be obtained.
