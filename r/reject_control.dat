30|$|According to Perez et al. (2014), eye {{movement}} analysis {{can be better}} interpreted when coupled with additional tests to assess stimulus control. In their study, {{eye movement}}s were recorded while participants engaged in a simple simultaneous discrimination task with compound stimuli (e.g., a green triangle, the S+, and a red circle, the S-). So, during the test, there were two S+ (e.g., the triangle form e the green color) and two S- (e.g., the circle form e the red color). Results showed that participants chose more often the S+ component that which their eyes had fixated on more during training (e.g., the triangle form). Nevertheless, during the text, the second most-observed stimuli component was not the alternative S+ (i.e., the green color) but the S- related (i.e., the circle form). In this case, {{it was not possible}} to argue that only select or only <b>reject</b> <b>control</b> was established and additional probes for assessing select and <b>reject</b> <b>control</b> were necessary. Our experiment was the first to evaluate eye movements and behavioral probes in the investigation of the selection and rejection relations.|$|E
30|$|According to Carrigan and Sidman (1992), {{two main}} factors can {{modulate}} {{the learning of}} conditional relationships during MTS procedures. The first regards the pairing of stimuli during training, more specifically, whether the sample is related to S+ or S-. The second factor concerns the behavioral component that defines relationship between the sample and the comparison stimuli. A select control occurs when the sample relates to S+ and the established behavioral component is to choose (e.g., if A 1, then choose B 1). A <b>reject</b> <b>control,</b> in contrast, occurs when the sample relates to S- and the established behavioral component is “do not choose” or “reject” (e.g., if A 1, then reject B 2).|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the study}} by Johnson and Sidman (1993) {{is an example of}} the third {{experimental}} variation: each sample was related to a single S- stimulus and four S+ stimuli. Thus, given A 1, some trials had B 1 and B 2 as comparison stimuli, other trials had X 1 and B 2, and so on. Four conditional relationships were therefore led to selection control (i.e., if A 1, then choose B 1, X 1, X 2, or X 3), and only one conditional relationship led to rejection control (i.e., if A 1, do not choose B 2). Overall, this procedure more strongly fostered the <b>reject</b> <b>control,</b> since learning to reject B 2 was sufficient for obtaining correct responses on all trial types.|$|E

30|$|However, the low {{variability}} {{we observed}} in performance does not exclude {{the possibility of}} a relationship between the duration of eye fixation and the establishment of controlling by selection or rejection. For example, in terms of duration of eye fixation, it would be important to know whether other participants exhibiting a different pattern than that {{of the participants in the}} present experiment would achieve a high percentage of correct responses in probes evaluating select and <b>reject</b> <b>control</b> relationships. In a similar way, it would be important to know whether participants who performed poorly on tests would exhibit a pattern of eye fixation different from that of the present experiment. These questions require future studies in which experimental manipulations generate differential patterns of select and reject controlling relationships (for example, as suggested by Johnson and Sidman 1993) in order to assess whether such variability is related to patterns of eye fixation.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} 25 {{years since the}} {{publication}} of Sidman et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (1982) report on the search for symmetry in nonhuman animals. They attributed their nonhuman subjects 2 ̆ 7 failure to the absence of some critical experiences (e. g., exemplar training, control of location variables, and generalized identity matching). Since then, species ranging from rats to chimpanzees have been tested on symmetry, and the results have been equivocal. Twenty-four investigations of symmetry in nonhumans are reviewed to determine whether the underlying factors first addressed by Sidman et al. (1982) have been verified and whether new factors have been identified. The emergent picture shows that the standard procedures as typically implemented on a three-key apparatus are insufficient by themselves to produce emergent symmetry in nonhumans. Recent successful demonstrations of symmetry in sea lions and pigeons have clarified certain important stimulus control variables (i. e., select and <b>reject</b> <b>control)</b> and suggest avenues for future research. Reliable symmetry may be achievable with nonhumans if training and test procedures that encourage compatible stimulus-control topographies and relations are designed...|$|E
30|$|The {{experiment}} {{designed by}} Stromer and Osborne (1982) {{is an example}} of the use of new stimuli. Four adolescents with atypical development were taught to conditionally relate visual stimuli of two distinct sets (AB relations). Given A 1, the participants should choose the comparison B 1 and not choose the comparison B 2. Given A 2, they should choose the comparison B 2 and not the comparison B 1. After achieving a learning criterion, participants were exposed to symmetrical trials (BA relations) with the introduction of new stimuli to evaluate the establishment of control by selection and rejection. For example, given B 1, the comparisons could be A 1 and a new stimulus. Participants choosing A 1 would demonstrate that they had established the relationship between the sample and S+ (i.e., select control). On the other hand, given the same sample B 1, another comparison could be A 2 and a new stimulus. In this second case, participants choosing the new stimulus would demonstrate that they had established the relationship between B 1 and S- (i.e., <b>reject</b> <b>control).</b> In the study by Stromer and Osborne, participants exhibited a high percentages of correct responses in both types of trials, demonstrating that the initial procedure had established both selection and rejection controlling relationships.|$|E

30|$|The study {{carried out}} by McIlvane et al. (1987) {{is an example of}} the use of masks. Eight adults with typical {{development}} were trained on conditional relationships between nonsense words that were composed of three letters. Given the samples “CUG,” “VEK,” and “DAX,” the correct responses were “ZID,” “PAF,” and “BEH,” respectively. Each trial presented a word as the sample (e.g., “CUG”) in the center of a computer screen and another two words as comparison stimuli on the bottom of the screen (e.g., “ZID” and “PAF”). After participants learned the conditional relationships between the words, probe trials with masks were used to test selection and rejection relationships. Each probe trial presented a word as the sample (e.g., “CUG”) and, as comparison stimuli, a word and a mask or “empty” stimulus (e.g., “ZID” and “===” or “===” and “PAF”). In trials in which the S- was replaced by a mask, participants chose the words more frequently than the masks, thus demonstrating the establishment of the relationship between the sample and S+ (i.e., select control). In trials in which the S+ was replaced by a mask, participants more frequently chose the mask instead of the words, thus demonstrating a learned relationship between the sample and S- (i.e., <b>reject</b> <b>control).</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to normalizing microarray expression data. The novel feature is to unify the tasks of estimating normalization coefficients and identifying control gene set. Unification is realized by constructing a window function over the scatter plot defining the subset of constantly expressed genes and by affecting optimization using an iterative procedure. The structure of window function gates contributions to the control gene set used to estimate normalization coefficients. This window measures the consistency of the matched neighborhoods in the scatter plot and provides a means of <b>rejecting</b> <b>control</b> gene outliers. The recovery of normalizational regression and control gene selection are interleaved and are realized by applying coupled operations to the mean square error function. In this way, the two processes bootstrap one another. We evaluate the technique on real microarray data from breast cancer cell lines and complement the experiment with a data cluster visualization study.

40|$|Three {{tasks were}} {{employed}} to investigate the role of assembled phonology in beginning readers. In two proofreading tasks, children had more trouble finding pseudohomophone misspellings (stimuli with phonology identical {{to that of a}} word) than control misspellings (stimuli that do not share their phonology with a word). In a lexical-decision task, they had more trouble deciding that pseudohomophone misspellings were non-words than deciding that control misspellings were non-words. Finally, in a semantic-categorization task, children had more trouble rejecting pseudohomophone misspellings {{as a member of a}} designated category than <b>rejecting</b> <b>control</b> misspellings. Differences between more and less advanced readers occurred, but they need not be attributed to differential use of phonology in word recognition. Instead, they were explained in terms of a difference between reader groups in spelling-verification efficiency. The results of the present studies on beginning reading parallel studies on skilled reading by Van Orden et al. (1992). The main conclusion was that assembled phonology plays an important role in word recognition in beginning readers...|$|R

Here we demonstrate a unique pattern of cellular FN expression in rat recipients of cardiac allografts rendered tolerant in an infectious manner with either nondepleting CD 4 mAb or regulatory spleen cells. Unlike in <b>rejecting</b> <b>controls,</b> cellular FN in tolerant hosts was restricted to the graft vessels and no vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 or intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression could be found, supporting the role of FN in leukocyte sequestration at the graft site. The lack of myocardial FN in tolerant rats, despite dense macrophage infiltration, correlated with profound depression of Th 1 (interleukin- 2 and interferon-γ) cytokines. Treatment with CD 4 -depleting mAb prevented tolerance induction and restored myocardial expression of FN in parallel with marked increase in the expression of interleukin- 2 and interferon-γ mRNA/protein. Furthermore, connective segment- 1 peptide-facilitated adjunctive blockade of FN-α 4 β 1 interactions in recipients conditioned with CD 4 depleting mAb, significantly depressed intragraft expression of interleukin- 2 and interferon-γ mRNA/protein. Hence, the lack of FN associated with infiltrating leukocytes {{plays an important role}} in the maintenance of tolerance in transplant recipients by depressing local expression of Th 1 cytokines that otherwise facilitate acute graft rejection...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{previously}} documented {{an early}} (day- 2) interferon (IFN) -gamma accumulation in cardiac allografts of rats made tolerant by donor-specific blood transfusion (DSBT) {{but not in}} <b>rejecting</b> <b>controls.</b> This contrasted with the IFN-gamma peak seen later (day 5) in rejecting but not in tolerant rats. METHODS: To further examine the role of early intragraft IFN-gamma in DSBT-induced tolerance, we studied whether IFN-gamma up-regulation correlates with {{the magnitude of the}} DSBT effect and how IFN-gamma is influenced by interventions abrogating tolerance. RESULTS: The protective effect of DSBT depended upon the timing of administration: day- 12 DSBT induced indefinite graft survival; day- 6 DSBT gave a moderate, and day- 0 DSBT, no graft prolongation. IFN-gamma up-regulation correlated with the DSBT effect: it was maximal after day- 12 DSBT, intermediate after day- 6 DSBT, and absent after day- 0 DSBT. Tolerant splenocytes transferred tolerance into naive rats in a donor-specific manner, indicating that alloantigen-specific regulatory cells operate. Thymectomy prevented regulatory cells development, caused further amplification of intragraft IFN-gamma, and led to rejection, although graft survival was still prolonged. CONCLUSIONS: Day 2 intragraft IFN-gamma correlates with the DSBT protective effect. Thymectomy abrogates DSBT-induced tolerance, prevents regulatory cell development, and paradoxically causes further accumulation of intragraft IFN-gamma. These data indicate that DSBT has a stimulatory and a (thymus-dependent) inhibitory effect on early intragraft IFN-gamma. Intragraft IFN-gamma is beneficial, providing it occurs early and remains moderate. The role of intragraft IFN-gamma in tolerance and rejection depends upon the timing and the degree of production and perhaps the type of IFN-gamma producing cells (regulatory or effector). status: publishe...|$|R
