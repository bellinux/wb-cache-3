The 33, 000 <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> submitted to ECHA by European companies and representatives of non-European companies until end of May 2013 comprise many of good quality and, in {{a small number of}} isolated cases, clearly insufficient dossiers. Needless to say, insufficient <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> are unacceptable. This is also in the interest of those companies who do whatever they can to prepare correct dossiers. In relevant cases, ECHA can subsequently make additional demands, and the enforcement authorities in the member states have adequate possibilities for sanctions. They can make additional demands locally and/or impose sanctions (for administrative offences and criminal acts). However, clearly insufficient and unacceptable <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> should not be generalised and taken to refer to the industry in its entirety.

30|$|The {{first two}} REACH {{registration}} phases delivered data {{that should have}} increased the quality of SDS [23]. At the moment, this envisaged improvement is hindered by lack of experience, the use of instruments still under development, especially for exposure assessment (Eteam project [24]), lack of structured templates and lack of easily exchangeable formats for information exchange (under development: ESComXML) [25]. The rush to be ‘REACH-compliant’ to fulfil the minimum requirements of <b>registration</b> of <b>dossiers</b> on schedule and to prepare (e)SDS [23, 26] might {{have led to the}} submission of incomplete and incorrect <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> and the recommendation of inappropriate RMM. The focus of industry may shift to improving the quality of the <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> and SDS when these more time-consuming processes are completed. Whilst the eSDS is still at an early stage of implementation, the authors of this paper conclude that cooperation and improved awareness within the supply chain can improve the foundation for the safe handling of chemicals at workplaces.|$|R
30|$|The ongoing {{analysis}} of <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> {{should be considered}} and performed with sensitivity to the waste stage.

30|$|REACH {{requirements}} for substances, mixtures and articles {{do not apply}} to waste itself. “Nevertheless manufacturers and importers of substances, downstream users and potentially recipients of articles have a number of duties under REACH related to substances in waste.

30|$|As it is now, a {{framework}} for using the WoE approach needs to be developed further {{to agree on a}} common strategy among authorities and registrants under REACH. More experience is needed for its successful implementation and many open questions remain. The relevant ECHA guidance document (“How to report weight of evidence”) is focusing mainly on the technical issues of reporting a WoE approach in the <b>registration</b> <b>dossier.</b> Practical issues, case studies and standardized reporting formats need to be provided.|$|E
50|$|The {{relevant}} authorities perform substance evaluation {{when there is}} a reason to suspect that a substance presents a risk to human health or the environment (e.g. because of its structural similarity to another substance). Therefore, all <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> submitted for a substance are examined together and any other available information is taken into account.|$|R
30|$|To {{verify the}} quality and {{compliance}} of registrations, REACH introduced the instrument of dossier evaluation. Dossier evaluation is an important task of ECHA. One element of dossier evaluation is the examination of testing proposals (TPE) received with the <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers.</b> A dossier containing a testing proposal is automatically considered for dossier evaluation. The other element of the dossier evaluation is the compliance check with the possible outcomes: no administrative action needed, decisions, draft decisions for comments, and quality observation letters to inform the registrant about deficiencies of the dossier and to consider updating of the registration.|$|R

This is {{an extreme}} case, {{but there are many}} more {{substances}} in the database for which erroneous data have been submitted in the <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers.</b> A systematic chemical and toxicological assessment of these data is urgently needed, but the methods and procedures for that are not yet in place. This complex evaluation of a vast amount of data requires substantial experience in physical chemistry, environmental chemistry, toxicology, and ecotoxicology.|$|R
30|$|According to the REACH Regulation, ECHA publishes {{several items}} of {{information}} (inter alia from the <b>registration</b> <b>dossier)</b> on the Internet [4]. This {{is intended to}} improve the knowledge on the properties and the risk potential of substances. The baseline study [5], which was performed {{on behalf of the}} EU Commission (Eurostat), already proves that this is the case. Meanwhile, ECHA makes publicly available a much wider range of information concerning, inter alia, the identity of the registrant and a more detailed breakdown of tonnage bands.|$|E
30|$|Implementation in {{this phase}} is a {{learning}} process for companies and (competent) authorities - for both, the special requirements of a REACH dossier are new to most staff. Furthermore, the requirements for preparing a <b>registration</b> <b>dossier</b> are highly complex: in this exercise, ECHA guidance documents with several thousands of pages {{need to be taken}} into account and IT forms (IUCLID) with up to 15, 000 data fields need to be completed. In this situation, it would be astonishing if there were no mistakes or conflicting views, especially in the initial phase.|$|E
30|$|For this, the {{manufacturer}} and the importer have {{to register the}} chemicals they are bringing on the European market. The registration is obligatory for all chemicals that are sold in a volume bigger than 1, 000 kg/a (= 1 Mg/a).

To be precise, {{the structure of the}} dossier has to follow well defined requirements, which will not be explained in this article. More information is offered here [11, 12].|$|E
30|$|Most of the {{registrations}} {{submitted to}} ECHA didn’t fulfil {{the expectations of}} the authorities with regard to transparency and quality. To assure a safe use of chemicals, manufacturers, importers and downstream users need to take over the responsibility for compliance and quality of the <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> and the assessments including risk management. For the upcoming second registration deadline, registrants are requested to submit fully compliant dossiers. For many dossiers already submitted updating is required.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{a technique}} that has been applied for stimulation of conventional oil and gas wells in the US since many years.

In the US, shale gas has become an important energy resource. In the EU, there is limited experience {{in the use of}} these techniques and research/experimental drilling activities have been performed in some Member States where shale gas reservoirs are present. In this context, the EC's Joint Research Centre’s Institute for Health and Consumer Protection (JRC-IHCP) was asked by EC's DG Environment to perform an assessment of REACH <b>registration</b> <b>dossiers</b> of certain selected substances that may be connected with the use in hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs. The main goal of this task was to understand whether this type of use has been registered under REACH and eventually how industry is dealing with related exposure scenarios and exposure assessments.

30|$|As a {{consequence}} of the implementation of REACH, many problems described in the RISKCYCLE project would become relevant.

Currently, only the so-called first tranche of hazardous chemicals, and also chemicals with a market volume of over 1, 000 tons per annum have been registered. Further tranches will follow the next few years.|$|R
30|$|Guidance is {{also being}} {{improved}} based on knowledge from the workplace assessment of exposure and this is being triggered by on-going evaluation processes performed by ECHA and the member states. Evaluation is one instrument that will reveal and reduce data gaps and should reduce legal non-compliance of the type outlined in Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4 (columns 3, respectively). When a <b>registration</b> <b>dossier</b> is submitted to ECHA, it generally passes only an IT-supported accordance check which might not reveal incorrect information. A {{closer look at the}} registration dossiers is then carried out by ECHA on 5 % of the registrations via a formal dossier evaluation. The focus so far has been on the evaluation of toxicological assessment and environmental questions. ECHA's current approach shifts to a targeted approach, namely selecting specific points of concern. Considering occupational health and safety, it is desirable to enhance the emphasis on exposure and risk management in the future. However, the evaluation of exposure scenarios is difficult at the moment and in most cases has to be done manually. Exposure scenarios are submitted in the CSR in PDF format and {{are not part of the}} <b>registration</b> <b>dossier</b> that is submitted in a structured and IT-searchable format (IUCLID) [36].

Pigs are particularly sensitive to nitrite-induced methemoglobinemia because they have low levels of methemoglobin reductase, the enzyme required to reverse the effects of nitrite toxicosis. Over the last two years, a great deal of progress has been made towards developing a nitrite bait and a suitable bait delivery vehicle for feral pigs.
