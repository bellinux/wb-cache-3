5|$|Aerospace, steel, ship building, retail, services, construction, medicine, and {{manufacturing}} are Mobile's major industries. After experiencing economic decline for several decades, Mobile's economy began to <b>rebound</b> <b>in</b> the late 1980s. Between 1993 and 2003 roughly 13,983 new jobs were created as 87 new companies were founded and 399 existing companies were expanded.|$|E
5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the <b>rebound</b> <b>in</b> energy {{efficiency}} and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E

5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also <b>rebound</b> <b>in</b> 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 3 {{opened on}} June 27, 2012. The project was {{announced}} in January 2001 {{as a way to}} accommodate rapid growth in passenger traffic, including international traffic.

Terminal 3 cost $2.4 billion to build {{and is one of the}} largest public works projects in Nevada. It replaced Terminal 2, providing more international gates and a larger U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility. With its seven domestic gates, the terminal also eases congestion at Terminal 1.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 season {{seemed to}} mark a <b>rebound</b> <b>in</b> Zito's {{pitching}} performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended {{the season with}} an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 {{had it not been}} for his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.|$|E

5|$|In the Champions League, Messi scored {{twice and}} {{assisted}} on another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, {{now under the}} stewardship of Guardiola. His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA. Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so. Although Messi did not score, he participated {{in each of his}} side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the <b>rebound.</b> <b>In</b> addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{stayed at}} Cambridge for the 201617 season, with the {{campaign}} following a similar pattern to the previous year {{as he was in}} and out of the starting line-up. He made his first start a month into the new season, helping Cambridge win their first game of the season as they won 21 away at Newport County on 24 September 2016. Three days later, he scored the only goal of the game when he turned the ball home from close range after 65 minutes in a 10 victory against Yeovil Town. The win moved Cambridge off the bottom of the table. Roberts' return to the first-team coincided with an upturn in form for the Cambridgeshire side and he remained a permanent fixture in the centre of defence for the following five months of the season. He scored his second goal of the season courtesy of a 92nd minute equaliser in an eventual 42 extra-time FA Cup win at Dover Athletic on 17 November 2016, with Roberts playing all four FA Cup games as Cambridge would progress to the Third Round and face Leeds United live on BBC. His third and final goal of the campaign was a notable 93rd minute winner in a 32 win over Newport County in February 2017, scoring from a <b>rebound</b> <b>in</b> a game Cambridge had trailed by two goals. Roberts did not make an appearance beyond March 2017, and played 31 games in total during the season, scoring three times. At the end of the season, in May 2017, Cambridge announced their released and retained list, stating that Roberts had been placed on the transfer-list with a year remaining on his contract.|$|E
