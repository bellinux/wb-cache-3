40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{processing}} {{and evaluation of}} chemically retted kenaf bast (Hibiscus cannabinus) was carried out using sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphite. The bast of the kenaf plant was retted with 5 % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 5 % sodium sulphite (Na 2 SO 3) at 100 o C for 10 mins. The extracted fibres were subjected to bleaching with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Mercerization process was carried out on the <b>bleached</b> <b>fibres</b> {{in order to improve}} the quality of the fibres. The kenaf bast was converted into clean, lustrous, smooth and soft fibres using the retting, bleaching and mercerization processes. The effects of these treatments were further evaluated using a tensile strength machine and a viscometer. It was observed that the samples retted with Na 2 SO 3 and its corresponding <b>bleached</b> <b>fibre</b> had relatively high tensile strength and low viscosity values while those retted with NaOH and its corresponding bleached samples gave lower tensile strength and high viscosity values. The implication of this is that the samples retted with Na 2 SO 3 were slightly affected while those retted with NaOH were affected most. This was attributed to the inefficiency of NaOH in removing the impurities of the fibre completely and as such lead to lower tensile strength and high viscosity while the reverse is the case for Na 2 SO 3 retted and <b>bleached</b> <b>fibres.</b> The corresponding viscosity of mercerized fibre of NaOH retted samples was low whereas that of Na 2 SO 3 was high. From the results obtained, it indicates that Na 2 SO 3 is a better retting agent than NaOH...|$|R

40|$|Various {{combinations}} of laccases, xylanase and cellulase {{were used to}} biobleach cellulose fibres from eucalyptus. The Trametes villosa and Myceliophthora thermophila laccases were used in combination with violuric acid (VATvL system) and methyl syringate (MeSMtL system), respectively, as mediator. A dissimilar mode of action of the two systems was found: the VATvL treatment released both hexenuronic acids and lignin, whereas the MeSMtL released lignin alone. Pulp properties were further improved by applying the mediator before the enzyme during treatment. Pulp properties comparable to those provided by industrial TCF sequences were obtained by inserting a xylanase pretreatment before VATvL, but no significant effect was observed after the cellulase pretreatment.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} develop a variety of wound {{dressing}} materials, made from standard natural fibres, that have high absorption and non-adherent characteristics. Method: A total of 21 dressings were made using knitted and crochet technologies and their absorbency was tested. Five non-adherent recipes were selected {{from a range of}} chemical formulations and the optimised non-adherent finishes were applied to the four best dressings. Their absorbency and non-adherent properties were evaluated. Results: The study demonstrated that rib cotton (RC), rib viscose (RV), crochet cotton medium (CCM) and crochet viscose medium (CVM) dressings possess high absorption and that five finishing recipes, C+D, A+G, I, I+N and I+G, impart high absorption as well as non-adherent properties. The finish I+G is superior in imparting non-adherence to RV dressing, both in dry and moist conditions. This means that irrigation with water, saline or sodium citrate solution before removing the dressing from a wound is not needed. Conclusion: A number of novel knitted and crochet structures with enhanced absorbency have been designed for wound management using standard <b>bleached</b> <b>fibres.</b> Novel non-adherent finishes for the developed structures have been formulated for the developed dressings, and offer an alternative to existing non-adherent dressings...|$|R
40|$|Giant Panda {{waste was}} used as a source for {{isolation}} of lignocellulosic fibres and its subsequent characterization was done. Non-cellulosic components such as lignin, hemicellulose, and pectin were removed from the fibres by subsequently washing, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) treatment. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis showed that there were no significant variations in peak positions, signifying that the treatments did not affect the chemical structure of the fibres. The difference in peak intensity in treated fibres compared to untreated fibres indicated that hemicellulose and impurities on the fibre surfaces are partly removed by NaOH and NaOCl treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the natural structure of cellulose I polymorph was maintained irrespective of the treatment. X-ray analyses also showed that the treatments altered the crystallinity of the <b>fibres</b> where the <b>bleached</b> <b>fibres</b> had a higher crystallinity (28. 62 %) than that of untreated fibes (27. 60 %).

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} was to {{evaluate}} the surface characteristics of the pine fibres {{and its impact on the}} performance of fibre-cement composites. Lower polar contribution of the surface energy indicates that unbleached fibres have less hydrophilic nature than the <b>bleached</b> <b>fibres.</b> <b>Bleaching</b> the pulp makes the fibres less stronger, more fibrillated and permeable to liquids due to removal the amorphous lignin and its extraction from the fibre surface. Atomic force microscopy reveals these changes occurring on the fibre surface and contributes to understanding the mechanism of adhesion of the resulting fibre to cement interface. Scanning electron microscopy shows that pulp bleaching increased fibre/cement interfacial bonding, whilst unbleached fibres were less susceptible to cement precipitation into the fibre cavities (lumens) in the prepared composites. Consequently, bleached fibre-reinforced composites had lower ductility due to the high interfacial adhesion between the fibre and the cement and elevated rates of fibre mineralization.

The treatments involved for this preparation were delignification, bleaching and high-intensity ultra-sonication process to obtain nanofibre with high cellulose content and less than 100 nm diameter. Chemical composition analysis showed the influence of each process treatment on cellulose content of raw bast <b>fibre,</b> <b>bleached</b> pulp <b>fibre</b> and CNF(63. 67, 81. 12 and 91. 97 %, respectively).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of applied tech- nologies namely desugaring, grinding, and bleaching on the compositions (cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignins, and pectins), physicochemical properties (water-holding capacity (WHC), swelling capacity (SWC), oil-holding capacity (OHC)) and the colour of dietary fibre (DF) during the production of fibre concentrates from unusual cooked apple and pear pomaces. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and optical microscopy were also performed to monitor process-induced modifica- tion. All the processing conditions affected the compositions and physicochemical properties of DF. The bleaching treat- ment induced the greatest changes on DF producing yellow cellulose-rich fibre concentrates with improved WHC from 3. 2 to 10. 0 g/g and improved SWC from 4. 0 to 8. 8 ml/g. Otherwise, reduction of the particle size influenced hydration properties and colours of DF. WHC and SWC tended to increase with the particle size whereas smaller granulometric size increased the lightness of fibres. Desugaring increased the DF content in both pomaces by 1. 2 -fold with slight modifica- tion of apple insoluble dietary fibre ratio. Fibre concentrates had improved WHC and SWC up to 1. 4 -fold. All processes had no significant effect (p < 0. 05) on OHC of DF except with ultrafine apple fibre concentrates. Results showed that pro- cessing had overall positive effects on DF contents and hy- dration properties of pomaces from cooked fruits. <b>Bleached</b> <b>fibre</b> concentrates from apple pomace had the highest WHC (10. 0 g/g) whereas that of pear had the highest fibre content (89. 9 %).

30|$|Modification of <b>bleached</b> jute <b>fibre</b> {{was carried}} out by graft co-polymerization with the vinyl monomers, {{acrylonitrile}} and methacrylonitrile. A K 2 S 2 O 8 /FeSO 4 redox system was used in the presence of air. The graft yield and grafting efficiency increased with the increase of monomer, initiator and reaction time up to certain values, thereafter it decreased. This is due to the increasing rate of homopolymerization, rather than grafting, at the higher monomer concentration. The maximum graft yield with acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, under optimized conditions, was 19.78 and 43.15 %, respectively. The graft yield of methacrylonitrile is greater than that of acrylonitrile. This is due to the –CH 3 group present in methacrylonitrile. The inclusion of nitrile monomer onto the treated fibre was identified by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The surface morphology and thermal behavior of the modified fibre was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Thermogravimetric Analysis. Modification of jute fibre improved the thermal stability, breaking strength as well as dyeability of the fiber.|$|R

40|$|Acid/base {{and metal}} ion {{adsorption}} properties {{have been investigated}} {{for a range of}} chemically modified <b>bleached</b> Kraft <b>fibre</b> materials (pulps). The studies were performed via potentiometric titrations, Flame Atomic Absorbtion (and Emission) Spectroscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy and Extended X-ray Absorbtion Fine Structure measurements. As a result of a chemical modification procedure, the total concentration of acidic carboxylate groups in the fibre materials ranged between 43 and 590 μmol/g. The preferable surface potential model for modelling the ionic strength dependent acid/base properties of fibre materials with low charge densities, i. e. unmodified fully <b>bleached</b> Kraft <b>fibre</b> materials, was found to be the Basic Stern Model. For fibre materials with high total charge, ≳ 100 μmol/g, this model resulted in poor fits to data, and for such materials a number of Constant Capacitance Models, one at each ionic strength, must be recommended. With respect to metal ion adsorption, the results have indicated that the unspecific Donnan theory could correctly model the simultaneous adsorption of several metal ions, i. e. K+, Na+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and Cu 2 +, provided that the salt concentration in the fibre suspension is low. In suspensions of high salt concentration it was, however, found that this very same model strongly underestimated the adsorption of Ca 2 + and Cu 2 +. Here, the Donnan model had to be complemented by specific ion exchange equilibria. These results were corroborated by spectroscopic evidence of specific interactions between Cu 2 +-ions and fibres. The spectroscopic indication of a complex formed between two fibre surface carboxylate groups and one Cu 2 +-ion, agree with the specific ion exchange model. It was therefore concluded that specific metal ionfibre interactions cannot be neglected, especially at high salt concentrations. The interactions occurring between the polycation GaO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 127 + and fibre materials were studied by both adsorption and spectroscopic measurements. These indicate that GaO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 127 + is surprisingly stable in fibre suspensions and that intact GaO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 127 +- ions are strongly adsorbed onto the fibres. Also for this ion, specific interactions has to be considered, since the strong adsorption registered was too strong to be explained by Donnan equilibria.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation was to deepen the understanding of lignin uptake by cellulose fibres by systematic studies under well-controlled conditions, and to clarify {{its effect on the}} papermaking properties of the fibres. It was possible to gain some direct insight into lignin sorption mechanisms by a comprehensive approach including studies of lignin behaviour in the solution, adsorption measurements and surface chemistry examination, studies of lignin distribution in the fibres, as well as analysis of sheet technical properties. It was found that van der Waals' interactions between lignin and fibres in aqueous dispersion are very weak and do not overcome the mutual electrostatic repulsion. No lignin is adsorbed from aqueous lignin solutions onto pure cellulose fibres: lignin loosely attaches to <b>bleached</b> <b>fibres</b> by imbibition with solution and filtration effect, and can be washed away with water. However, in sheets lignin binds to the fibres: some lignin is distributed throughout the cell wall, but the major part is located in the layers formed between the fibres. Restrained drying is responsible for binding of trapped lignin to the fibrous mat. Irreversible adsorption may occur in the presence of cationic polymers. The course of adsorption depended on the sequence of polymer addition. Kraft lignin is adsorbed as a monolayer onto cationised surfaces. In the aqueous solutions lignin and cationic polymers (PDADMAC and cationic starch (CS)) form both soluble and insoluble complexes, which are cationic or anionic, depending on the lignin/cationic polymer charge ratio. The complexes adsorb on kraft pulp fibres (and mica), especially at low lignin/polyelectrolyte ratios, when the complexes are cationic, covering the surface with patches, films or blobs. The driving force for adsorption of lignin/cationic polymer complexes on chemical pulp fibres is primarily electrostatic: adsorption takes place as long as the fibre surface and the lignin are oppositely charged. Adsorption of complexes is highly dependent on the sequence of addition of lignin and cationic polymer. If the complexes are formed in solution prior to adsorption on the fibres there is a relatively sharp maximum in adsorption at cationic polymer/lignin ratios below the isoelectric point. If complexes are formed directly on the fibre surface (adsorption of lignin on fibres treated with cationic polymer) the isotherm reaches a plateau value. Adsorbed complexes are located on the outermost surface of the fibres, which leads to brightness losses. Papers made from fibers with adsorbed lignin complexes exhibit improved strength and water resistance. This could be utilized in the manufacture of packaging grades of paper. Lignin particles in the solution are elongated and are about 1  nm thick and 2. 5  nm wide. They adsorb onto cationised substrates in the form of individual granules, consisting of about 1200 primary lignin particles that are held together by strong cohesive forces. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Wettability and sorptivity {{improvements}} {{for different}} textile materials {{are the major}} tasks during textile finishing. In order to improve the sorption characteristics of a cellulose fabric, different pre-treatment processes are applied, usually washing, bleaching and mercerisation. Differences in the sorption properties of un-treated and pre-treated (washed and <b>bleached)</b> regenerated cellulose <b>fibres</b> were obtained using tensiometry and compared with the classical method for determining moisture adsorption. Results show that compared to raw fibres, viscose fibres have the highest moisture and the smallest contact angle whilst modal fibres have the biggest contact angle. Pre-treatment increases the sorption abilities and makes the material more accessible to Chemicals used in the finishing processes. Using the conventional method, it can be confirmed that fibres with the highest moisture have the smallest contact angle (tensiometry) ...|$|R
