We explore the role of various factors, including the radiative cooling parameter η = t_rad/t_coll (t_coll=R_c/v_c), evolutionary modifications on the cloud structure (by colliding clouds "evolved" through independent motion within the intercloud medium (WIM)), and the symmetry of the problem (by colliding initially identical clouds, evolved to different ages before impact). The presence of bow shocks and ram pressure from material in the cloud wake, developed during such evolution through the WIM, significantly alters these interactions {{with respect to the}} standard case of non-evolved clouds. In general, in our adiabatic collisions the clouds are disrupted and convert their gas into a few low density contrast clumps. By contrast, for symmetric radiative cases we find that the two clouds coalesce, with almost all the initial kinetic energy radiated away. On the other hand, for both adiabatic and <b>radiative</b> <b>collisions,</b> asymmetric collisions have a much greater tendency to disrupt the two clouds. Fragmentation of the clouds may occur, and instabilities are in general enhanced. In addition, radiative cooling is less efficient in our asymmetric interactions, so that those parts of the clouds that initially seem to merge are more likely to re-expand and fade into the WIM. Since the majority of real cloud collisions should be asymmetric for one reason or another, we conclude that most gasdynamical diffuse cloud collisions will be disruptive, at least in the absence of significant self-gravity or of a significant magnetic field.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} low frequency turbulence on Doppler spectral line shapes in magnetized plasmas. Low frequency refers here to fluctuations whose typical time scale is much larger than those characterizing the atomic processes, such as <b>radiative</b> decay, <b>collisions</b> and charge exchange. This ordering is in particular relevant for drift wave turbulence, ubiquitous in edge plasmas of fusion devices. Turbulent fluctuations are found to affect line shapes through both the spatial and time averages introduced by the measurement process.

Assuming the spectrometer acquisition time to be much larger than the turbulent time scale, an ordering generally fulfilled in experiments, allows to develop a statistical formalism.

Line wings are found to be affected by ion temperature or fluid velocity fluctuations, and can in some cases exhibit a power-law behavior.

In particular, the interaction energy of the kinks is calculated, and the collision of kinks in the presence of dissipation and a DC driving force is considered.

40|$|We {{have studied}} head-on {{collisions}} between equal-mass, mildly supersonic H I clouds (Mach number 1. 5 {{with respect to}} the background medium) through high-resolution numerical simulations in two dimensions. We explore the role of various factors, including the radiative cooling parameter, eta = tau(rad) /tau(coll) (tau(coll) = R-c/upsilon(c)), evolutionary modifications on the cloud structure, and the symmetry of the problem. Self-gravity is not included. Radiative losses are taken into account explicitly and not approximated with an isothermal adiabatic index gamma approximate to 1, which, in fact, leads to very different results. We assume a standard two-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model where clouds are characterized by a temperature T-c = 74 K and number density n(c) = 22 cm(- 3) and are in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding warm intercloud medium (WIM), with a density contrast chi = rho(c) /rho(i) = 100. In particular, we study collisions for the adiabatic (eta much greater than 1) and radiative (eta = 0. 38) cases that may correspond to small (R-c {{less than or equal to}} 0. 4 pc for an assumed WIM) or large (R-c similar to 1. 5 pc) clouds, respectively. In addition to a standard case of identical ''nonevolved'' clouds, we also consider the collision of identical clouds, ''evolved'' through independent motion within the intercloud gas, over one crushing time before collision. This turns out to be about the mean collision time for such clouds in the ISM. The presence of bow shocks and ram pressure from material in the cloud wake alters these interactions significantly {{with respect to the}} standard case. In some cases, we removed the mirror symmetry from the problem by colliding initially identical clouds ''evolved'' to different ages before impact. In those cases, the colliding clouds have different density and velocity structures, so that they provide a first insight on the behavior of more complex interactions. In our adiabatic collisions, the clouds are generally disrupted and convert their gas into the warm phase of the ISM. Although the details depend on the initial conditions, the two colliding clouds are converted into a few low-density contrast (chi similar to 5) clumps at the end of the simulations. By contrast, for symmetric radiative cases, we find that the two clouds coalesce, and there are good chances for a new massive cloud to be formed. Almost all the initial kinetic energy of the two clouds is radiated away during such collisions. On the other hand, for both adiabatic and <b>radiative</b> <b>collisions,</b> symmetry breaking leads to major differences. Most importantly, asymmetric collisions have a much greater tendency to disrupt the two clouds. Portions of individual clouds may be sheared away, and instabilities along the interfaces between the clouds and with the intercloud medium are enhanced. In addition, radiative cooling is less efficient in our asymmetric interactions, so that those parts of the clouds that initially seem to merge are more likely to reexpand and fade into the warm intercloud medium. Since the majority of real cloud collisions should be asymmetric for one reason or another, we conclude that most gasdynamical diffuse cloud collisions will be disruptive, at least in the absence of significant self-gravity or a significant magnetic fieldopen 272...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method of {{measuring}} extremely weak magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium prior to and during the epoch of cosmic reionization. The method utilizes the Larmor precession of spin-polarized neutral hydrogen in the triplet state of the hyperfine transition. This precession leads to a systematic change in the brightness temperature fluctuations of the 21 -cm line from the high-redshift universe, and thus the statistics of these fluctuations encode information about the magnetic field the atoms are immersed in. The method is most suited to probing fields that are coherent on large scales; in this paper, we consider a homogenous magnetic field over {{the scale of the}} 21 -cm fluctuations. Due to the long lifetime of the triplet state of the 21 -cm transition, this technique is naturally sensitive to extremely weak field strengths, of order 10 ^- 19 G at a reference redshift of ∼ 20 (or 10 ^- 21 G if scaled to the present day). Therefore, this might open up the possibility of probing primordial magnetic fields just prior to reionization. If the magnetic fields are much stronger, it is still possible to use this method to infer their direction, and place a lower limit on their strength. In this paper (Paper I in a series on this effect), we perform detailed calculations of the microphysics behind this effect, and take into account all the processes that affect the hyperfine transition, including <b>radiative</b> decays, <b>collisions,</b> and optical pumping by Lyman-α photons.

The study of non-linear optical processes such as multiphoton dissociation of molecules, resonance fluorescence, Raman scattering, and wave mixings, etc. is a subject of much current interest [1, 2] both theoretically and experi-ment&y.

40|$|The 21 -cm hyperfine line {{of atomic}} {{hydrogen}} (HI) is a promising probe {{of the cosmic}} dark ages. In past treatments of 21 -cm radiation it was assumed the hyperfine level populations of HI could be characterized by a velocity-independent ``spin temperature'' T_s determined by a competition between 21 -cm <b>radiative</b> transitions, spin-changing <b>collisions,</b> and (at lower redshifts) Lyman-alpha scattering. However we show here that, if the collisional time {{is comparable to the}} radiative time, the spin temperature will depend on atomic velocity, T_s=T_s(v), and one must replace the usual hyperfine level rate equations with a Boltzmann equation describing the spin and velocity dependence of the HI distribution function. We construct here the Boltzmann equation relevant to the cosmic dark ages and solve it using a basis-function method. Accounting for the actual spin-resolved atomic velocity distribution results in up to a 2 per cent suppression of the 21 -cm emissivity, and a redshift and angular-projection dependent suppression or enhancement of the linear power spectrum of 21 -cm fluctuations of up to 5 per cent. The effect on the 21 -cm line profile is more dramatic [...] its full-width at half maximum (FWHM) can be enhanced by up to 60 per cent relative to the velocity-independent calculation.

In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we study the asymmetry-driven resonant production of 7 keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter in the primordial Universe at temperatures T >&# 126; 100 MeV. We report final DM phase space densities that are robust to uncertainties in the nature of the quark-hadron transition. We give transfer functions for cosmological density fluctuations that are useful for N-body simulations. We also provide a public code for the production calculation. In the second part of the thesis, we study the instability of small-scale baryon pressure sound waves during cosmological recombination. We show that for relevant wavenumbers, inhomogenous recombination is driven by the transport of ionizing continuum and Lyman-alpha photons. We find a maximum growth factor less than &# 8776; 1. 2 in 10 7 random realizations of initial conditions. The low growth factors are due to the relatively short duration of the recombination epoch. In the third part of the thesis, we propose a method of measuring weak magnetic fields, of order 10 - 19 G (or 10 - 21 G if scaled to the present day), with large coherence lengths in the inter galactic medium prior to and during the epoch of cosmic reionization. The method utilizes the Larmor precession of spin-polarized neutral hydrogen in the triplet state of the hyperfine transition. We perform detailed calculations of the microphysics behind this effect, and take into account all the processes that affect the hyperfine transition, including <b>radiative</b> decays, <b>collisions,</b> and optical pumping by Lyman-alpha photons. In the final part of the thesis, we study the non-linear effects of tidal deformations of neutron stars (NS) in a compact binary. We compute the largest three- and four-mode couplings among the tidal mode and high-order p- and g-modes of similar radial wavenumber. We demonstrate the near-exact cancellation of their effects, and resolve the question of the stability of the tidally deformed NS to leading order. This result is significant for the extraction of binary parameters from gravitational wave observations. ...|$|R
40|$|Ultracold hybrid ion-atom traps {{offer the}} {{possibility}} of microscopic manipulation of quantum coherences in the gas using the ion as a probe. However, inelastic processes, particularly charge transfer can be a significant process of ion loss and has been measured experimentally for the Yb^+ ion immersed in a Rb vapour. We use first-principles quantum chemistry codes to obtain the potential energy curves and dipole moments for the lowest-lying energy states of this complex. Calculations for the radiative decay processes cross sections and rate coefficients are presented for the total decay processes. Comparing the semi-classical Langevin approximation with the quantum approach, we find it provides a very good estimate of the background at higher energies. The results demonstrate that radiative decay mechanisms are important over the energy and temperature region considered. In fact, the Langevin process of ion-atom collisions dominates cold ion-atom collisions. For spin dependent processes kohl 13 the anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and the second-order spin-orbit coupling can play important roles, inducing couplingbetween the spin and the orbital motion. They measured the spin-relaxing collision rate to be approximately 5 orders of magnitude higher than the charge-exchange collision rate kohl 13. Regarding the measured <b>radiative</b> charge transfer <b>collision</b> rate, we find that our calculation is in very good agreement with experiment and with previous calculations. Nonetheless, we find no broad resonances features that might underly a strong isotope effect. In conclusion, we find, in agreement with previous theory that the isotope anomaly observed in experiment remains an open question. Comment: 7 figures, 1 table accepted for publication in J. Phys.

40|$|While {{limited to}} low spatial resolution, the next {{generation}} low-frequency radio interferometers that target 21 cm observations during the era of reionization and prior will have instantaneous fields-of-view that are many tens of square degrees on the sky. Predictions related to various statistical measurements of the 21 cm brightness temperature must then be pursued with numerical simulations of reionization with correspondingly large volume box sizes, of order 1000 Mpc on one side. We pursue a semi-numerical scheme to simulate the 21 cm signal during and prior to Reionization by extending a hybrid approach where simulations are performed by first laying down the linear dark matter density field, accounting for the non-linear evolution of the density field based on second-order linear perturbation theory as specified by the Zel'dovich approximation, and then specifying the location and mass of collapsed dark matter halos using the excursion-set formalism. The location of ionizing sources and the time evolving distribution of ionization field is also specified using an excursion-set algorithm. We account for the brightness temperature evolution through the coupling between spin and gas temperature due to <b>collisions,</b> <b>radiative</b> coupling {{in the presence of}} Lyman-alpha photons and heating of the intergalactic medium, such as due to a background of X-ray photons. The hybrid simulation method we present is capable of producing the required large volume simulations with adequate resolution in a reasonable time so a large number of realizations can be obtained with variations in assumptions related to astrophysics and background cosmology that govern the 21 cm signal.

40|$|Turbulence models predict low droplet-collision {{rates in}} {{stratocumulus}} clouds, which should imply a narrow droplet size distribution and little rain. Contrary to this expectation, rain is often observed in stratocumuli. In this paper, we explore {{the hypothesis that}} some droplets can grow well above the average because small-scale turbulence allows them to reside at cloud top for a time longer than the convective-eddy time t *. Long-resident droplets can grow larger because condensation due to longwave <b>radiative</b> cooling, and <b>collisions</b> {{have more time to}} enhance droplet growth. We investigate the trajectories of 1 billion Lagrangian droplets in direct numerical simulations of a cloudy mixed-layer configuration that is based on observations from the flight 11 from the VERDI campaign. High resolution is employed to represent a well-developed turbulent state at cloud top. Only one-way coupling is considered. We observe that 70  % of the droplets spend less than 0. 6 t * at cloud top before leaving the cloud, while 15  % of the droplets remain at least 0. 9 t * at cloud top. In addition, 0. 2  % of the droplets spend more than 2. 5 t * at cloud top and decouple from the large-scale convective eddies that brought them to the top, with the result that they become memoryless. Modeling collisions like a Poisson process leads to the conclusion that most rain droplets originate from those memoryless droplets. Furthermore, most long-resident droplets accumulate at the downdraft regions of the flow, which could be related to the closed-cell stratocumulus pattern. Finally, we see that condensation due to longwave radiative cooling considerably broadens the cloud-top droplet size distribution: 6. 5  % of the droplets double their mass due to radiation in their time at cloud top. This simulated droplet size distribution matches the flight measurements, confirming that condensation due to longwave radiation can be an important mechanism for broadening the droplet size distribution in radiatively driven stratocumuli...|$|R
