The debate raised new heights after the controversial news about the cloned sheep, Dolly.

The debate is as such situated in a risk perspective, where the risks and threats are seen mainly as products of science and technology. The Norwegian legislative debate within the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) has resulted in a restrictive law, which forbid producing genetically identical individuals. I have analysed the political arguments through a religious, a scientific and an aesthetic ideal-typical position. The three ideal-types represent differentiated ways of debating and understanding risk posed by gene technology. The paradox is that the debate has a shared base, a shared political platform, among the politicians, which overlaps the ideal-typical distinctions.

On the basis of criticisms of language planning literature I additionally propose consideration of the sociology of development to provide tools for the analysis of society in sociolinguistics.

40|$|EN] United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has {{designated}} 12 chlorinated {{organic compounds}} as hazardous pollutants because of their negative impact on {{human health and the}} environment. Among them are some organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, dioxins and furans. Distribution of organochlorine pesticides (such as DDT and metabolites), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin-like compounds in the environment has gradually decreased {{since the end of the}} 70 s of the twentieth century because of their <b>restriction</b> <b>and</b> <b>prohibition.</b> But major problems such as pollution of ecosystems, food safety and potential adverse effects to human health from exposure to this group of substances remain. Because of their stability in the environment and their ability to bioaccumulate, organochlorine pollutants accumulate in the food chain in organisms, especially in animal fats, dairy products and fish. Among organochlorine contaminants are DDT and its metabolites, which adversely affect the central and peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, liver, causing skin irritation and allergic reactions. Negative health effects are expressed in liver damage and thyroid immunotoxicity, neurobehavioral abnormalities, reduced weight of newborns, reproductive toxicity. The problem of contamination of marine ecosystems with persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and their impact on biodiversity used to be the subject of research. In recent years the number of studies determine the concentrations of pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and other persistent organic pollutants in environmental samples, animal and plant organisms is constantly growing. Scientific studies have focused on determining the levels of contaminants in water species because lipophilic organochlorine compounds bioaccumulate in their tissues, in concentrations higher than those in the aqueous medium which inhabit. So fish and other aquatic organisms are used as bio-indicator of pollution of aquatic ecosystems. Edible products of animal origin, in particular fish and seafood are the main source of their entry into the human body. On the other hand, fish is valuable food for humans, because it contains proteins, vitamins and other essential nutrients, low levels of saturated fats and omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have a protective effect in the prevention of coronary heart disease. Due to health recommendations on fish consumption, it is important to determine the contribution of organochlorine contaminants such as pesticides and PCBs through dietary intake of fish and other marine organisms. The aim of the dissertation work is a study of content of residual organochlorine pesticides (DDT and its metabolites) in the Black Sea fish and assess the safety of the fish as food. Main tasks: 1. Sampling of various fish species from different regions. 2. Modification of the analytical procedure, developed for PCBs in foodstuffs of animal origin, for simultaneous determination of DDT and metabolites and PCBs in fish tissues. 3. Determining of the concentrations of DDT and its metabolites in the Black Sea fish, mussels, rapanas and freshwater fish. 4. Evaluation of the safety of the Black Sea fish as food by calculating the daily intake, risk quotient (RQ) and toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQ). Main conclusions of the thesis: 1. The research on organochlorine contaminants in different species of marine and freshwater fish were summarized and systematized. The data are used for comparison with the results obtained from this study. 2. Analytical procedure, developed for the determination of PCBs in foods is modified for simultaneous determination of PCBs, DDT and metabolites. The goal is the simultaneous determination of PCBs, DDT and metabolites, which saves time and expensive reagents. 3. For qualitative and quantitative determination of DDT and metabolites was used gas chromatography method. 4. The systematic study of 10 fish species was made for five years - from 2007 to 2011. The results are summarized: by areas of the catch - no significant difference between the values of DDT in fish samples from three regions of sampling. in years of sampling - there was observed a slight decrease in the concentrations of total DDT in 2010 and 2011. in seasons - there was no significant difference in the concentrations of DDT and metabolites in fish caught in the spring and autumn period. by fish species - there is a significant difference between the different types of fish such as average concentrations DDT for the entire period ranged from 20. 8 ng / g ww to 208. 5 ng / g ww. 5. The results show that the residual concentrations of DDT and its metabolites in all species tested decreased in the order p, p-DDE- p, p-DDD- p, p-DDT. DDT is found in very low concentrations, suggesting that the technical p,p-DDT is almost completely metabolized. 6. The content of DDT and metabolites in mussels and rapanas from the Black Sea coast is much lower than all studied fish species. 7. The comparison of the data with results from studies of other authors shows that the levels of contamination by DDT and metabolites in fish from the Bulgarian Black Sea coast are similar or lower than levels of the same species from the Black Sea, Marmara Sea and Mediterranean Sea. 8. In comparison, a survey was conducted on several freshwater fish. The DDTs residues in freshwater fish 23. 2 (mean value) were lower than concentrations in fish from Black Sea. 9. PCBs concentrations (other POPs) were determined in same fish species for comparison with the levels of DDT and its metabolites. In all species concentrations of DDTs are higher than those of the PCB. 10. Pollution of the Black Sea fish with PCBs is primarily due to indicator PCBs (from 7. 2 to 27. 3) with the lowest values were found in goby, and highest in shad. Highly toxic dioxin-like PCBs were in low concentrations (1. 4 to 9. 1). 11. The results for sum of indicator PCBs in all fish species did not exceed the recommended maximum level of 75. 12. Pollution indicator PCBs on the Black Sea fish is lower in comparison with data for PCBs in fish from other ecosystems. 13. The results for DDT and metabolites and PCBs were used to assess the safety of the fish as food. Calculated are: Daily intake of DDT and PCBs Risk quotient (RQ) Toxic equivalent concentration (TEQ) 14. Safety assessment shows that there is no risk to human health when consuming fish from Black Sea. Contributions of the dissertation work 1. For very first time in Bulgaria a systematical study on DDT and its metabolites DDE and DDD in various marine and freshwater fish was done. The study covers the period 2007 - 2011, as pollution was assessed by areas of the catch, by years of sampling, by seasons and by fish species. 2. Analytical procedure, developed for the determination of PCBs in foods, was modified for simultaneous determination of PCBs, DDT and metabolites in fish tissues. 3. An evaluation of the safety of fish as food based on the calculated daily intake and risk factor for DDT and PCBs and toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQ) of dioxin-like PCBs. Such an assessment of the Black Sea fish is done for very first time here. 4. The study has character of monitoring for the assessment of pollution in our region of the Black Sea. The results have contributed to the enrichment of the data on pollution of the Black Sea and their comparison with other marine ecosystems. /////////// /////////// [BG] Програмата за околна среда (UNEP) към Организацията на обединените нации е определила 12 хлорсъдържащи органични съединения като опасни замърсители поради тяхното отрицателно въздействие върху човешкото здраве и околната среда. Сред тях са някои хлорорганични пестициди, полихлорирани бифенили, диоксини и фурани. Разпространението на хлорорганични пестициди (като ДДТ и метаболити), полихлорирани бифенили (ПХБ) и диоксиноподобни съединения в околната среда постепенно намалява след края на 70 -те години на 20 век, поради тяхното ограничение и забрана. Но основните проблеми като замърсяването на екосистемите, безопасността на храните и потенциалните вредни ефекти за здравето на хората от експозицията на тази група вещества остават. Поради устойчивостта им в околната среда и способността им да биоакумулират, хлорорганичните замърсители се натрупват по хранителната верига в организмите, по-специално в животинските мазнини, млечните продукти и рибите. Проблемът за замърсяване на морските екосистеми с устойчиви органични замърсители (УОЗ) и влиянието им върху биоразнообразието продължава да бъде предмет на научните изследвания. През последните години броят на изследванията за определяне концентрациите на пестициди, полихлорирани бифенили, полихлорирани дибензо-р-диоксини и дибензофурани и други устойчиви органични замърсители в проби от околната среда, животинските и растителните организми непрекъснато нараства. Научните изследвания са насочени към определяне нивата на замърсители във водни животински видове, защото липофилните хлорорганични съединения биоакумулират в техните тъкани в концентрации по-високи от тези във водната среда, която обитават. Затова рибите и други водни организми се използват като биоиндикатор за замърсяването на водните екосистеми. Хранителни продукти от животински произход и особено риба и морски продукти са основният източник за попадането им в човешкия организъм. От друга страна рибите са ценна храна за хората, защото съдържат протеини, витамини и други есенциални нутриенти, ниски нива на наситени мазнини, както и омега - 3 полиненаситени мастни киселини, които имат защитен ефект в превенцията на коронарната болест на сърцето. Поради здравните препоръки относно консумацията на риба, е важно да се определи приносът на хлорорганични замърсители като пестициди и ПХБ чрез хранителен прием на риба и други морски организми. По този начин може да се направи оценка на безопасността и риска от консумация на риба и рибни продукти. Целта на дисертационната работа е изследване в динамика съдържанието на остатъчни хлорорганични пестициди (ДДТ и негови метаболити) в черноморски риби и оценка на безопасността на рибите като храна. Задачите за постигане на тази цел са: 1. Пробонабиране на различни видове черноморски риби от различни райони. 2. Модифициране на аналитична процедура, разработена за ПХБ в храни от животински произход, с цел едновременно определяне на ДДТ и метаболити и полихлорирани бифенили в рибна тъкан. 3. Определяне концентрациите на ДДТ и метаболити в черноморски риби, миди, рапани и сладководни риби. 4. Резултатите да се използват за оценка на безопасността на черноморските риби като храна. За целта да бъдат изчислени различни показатели - дневен хранителен прием, коефициент на риска (RQ) и токсични еквивалентни концентрации (TEQ). Основни изводи от дисертационния труд: 1. Обобщени и систематизирани са голяма част от изследванията за хлорорганични замърсители в различни видове морски и сладководни риби. Данните са използвани за сравнение с получените резултати от настоящото изследване. 2. Модифицирана е аналитична процедура, разработена за определяне на ПХБ в храни от животински произход. Като целта е едновременно определяне на ПХБ, ДДТ и метаболити, което спестява време и скъпи реактиви. 3. За качествено и количествено определяне на ДДТ и метаболити е използван газхроматографски метод, който е валидиран със сертифицирани референтни материали. 4. Направено е систематично изследване на 10 вида черноморски риби за съдържание на ДДТ и метаболити за петгодишен период от 2007 до 2011 г. Данните са обобщени: По райони на улов - съществена разлика не се наблюдава между стойностите на ДДТ в пробите риби от трите района на пробовземане. По години - наблюдава се известно намаляване на концентрациите за общо ДДТ през 2010 и 2011. По сезони - не се наблюдава значима разлика в концентрациите на ДДТ и метаболити в риби уловени през пролетния и есенния период. По видове риби - наблюдава се съществена разлика между различните видове риби като средните концентрации ДДТ за целия период са в интервала от 20. 8 до 208. 5. 5. Резултатите показват, че остатъчните концентрации на ДДТ и неговите метаболити при всички изследвани видове риби намаляват в реда р,р-ДДЕ - р,р-ДДД -р,р-ДДТ. ДДТ се открива в много ниски концентрации, което показва, че техническият р,р-ДДТ почти напълно е метаболизирал. 6. Съдържанието на ДДТ и метаболити в миди и рапани от черноморското ни крайбрежие е много по-ниско в сравнение с всички изследвани рибни видове. 7. Сравнението на получените данни с резултати от проучвания на други автори показва, че нивата на замърсяване с ДДТ и метаболити на рибите от българското черноморско крайбрежие са подобни или по-ниски, от нивата за същите видове риби от Черно море и съседните - Мраморно и Средиземно море. 8. За сравнение е направено изследване и на няколко вида сладководни риби. Съдържанието на ДДТ и метаболити е 23. 2 (средна стойност), което е по-ниско в сравнение с това при черноморските риби (средна стойност 84. 6). 9. Определено е съдържанието и на ПХБ (друг вид УОЗ) в рибите като е направено сравнение със съдържанието на ДДТ и метаболити. При всички видове риби концентрациите на ДДТ и метаболити са по-високи от тези за ПХБ. 10. Замърсяването на черноморските риби с ПХБ се дължи предимно на индикаторните ПХБ (от 7. 2 до 27. 3 ng/g ww) като най-ниски са стойностите при кая, а най-високи при карагьоз. Силно токсичните диоксиноподобни ПХБ са в много ниски концентрации (от 1. 4 до 9. 1 ng/g ww). 11. При всички видове риба резултатите за индикаторни ПХБ са много по-ниски от максимално допустимите стойности за индикаторни ПХБ в мускулно месо от риба и рибни продукти - 75. 12. Замърсяването с индикаторни ПХБ на черноморските риби е по-ниско в сравнение с данни за съдържание на ПХБ за риби от други региони на Черно море и съседните Мраморно, Средиземно и Адриатическо море. 13. Резултатите за съдържание на ДДТ и метаболити и ПХБ са използвани за оценка на безопасността на рибите като храна. Изчислени са: Дневен прием за ДДТ и ПХБ Коефициент на риска (RQ) - при всички видове риба изчисления RQ за ДДТ и ПХБ е много по-нисък от единица и показва, че няма риск при консумацията на риба. Токсични еквивалентни концентрации (TEQ) - TEQ за диоксиноподобните ПХБ за всички видове риби са по-ниски от максимално ниво от 6. 5 pg/g ww WHO-TEQ, определено в ЕС. 14. Оценката на безопасност показва, че няма риск за здравето на хората при консумация на черноморски риби. ПРИНОСИ 1. За първи път в България е направено систематично изследване за съдържанието на ДДТ и метаболитите ДДЕ и ДДД в различни видове морски и сладководни риби. Изследването обхваща периода 2007 - 2011 г като замърсяването е оценено по райони на улов, по години, по сезони и по видове риби. 2. Модифицирана е аналитична процедура, разработена за определяне на ПХБ в храни с цел едновременно определяне на ПХБ, ДДТ и метаболити. 3. Направена е оценка на безопасността на рибите като храна въз основа на изчислени дневен прием и коефициент на риска за ДДТ и ПХБ както и токсични еквивалентни концентрации (TEQ) на диоксиноподобни ПХБ. Подобна оценка на черноморските риби се прави за първи път у нас. 4. Изследването има мониторингов характер за оценка на замърсяването на нашия район на Черно море. Резултатите имат принос в обогатяване на данните за замърсяване на Черно море и сравняването им с други морски екосистеми...|$|E

40|$|Adoption is an {{institution}} {{as old as}} the world, created by the Roman law and present in law of almost every state. International adoptions have become popular {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century; surrogacy, although already used in ancient times – have become useful together with an artificial human reproduction methods. International adoptions and surrogacy are often regarded as wrong, associated with child trafficking and exploitation of women – hence the <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> <b>prohibitions</b> concerning them. Nevertheless, they are still serving the purpose of being a parent. That is why, despite the evil perception, they are considered useful – and therefore they are accepted and used. Will the greater popularity of surrogacy influence the number of international adoptions? Is it possible to introduce international regulation eradicating the risks associated with surrogacy? The article is an attempt to deal with these questions. kbkurluta@wp. plUniwersytet w Białymstok...|$|R
40|$|In this diploma thesis Prague Advertisement in the Interwar Period {{its author}} Ondřej Štěpánek {{deals with a}} so far almost {{neglected}} topic - advertisement in Prague in years 1918 - 1939. After outlining the development of advertisement in these two decades in the whole newly constituted state, the author focuses on regional specifics {{in the capital city}} that were set by local regulations. He mainly addressed the legality of individual advertising means, especially those in public spaces, and he also described producers of advertisement in Prague. The author concludes that advertisement made a large progress in the respective period, particularly during the late 1920 s and {{the first half of the}} 1930 s. Advertising companies had to deal with many <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> <b>prohibitions</b> brought by the new legislation. This diploma thesis provides new insight in the research of the advertisement history, especially in the area of the development of advertising agencies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the efficiency of lobbying in an environment of imperfect taxation. Under fiscal policy failure (i. e. lack of tax instruments), the allocation of resources is not Pareto optimal. The introduction of lobbying, in such a case, is found to enhance efficiency because contributions from lobbies substitute for the missing tax instruments. Furthermore, the efficiency gain from lobbying is shown to increase with inequality and lack of democracy. This finding implies that democratic governance and policies that reduce conflicts of interest in a society (i. e. policies that promote equality) might in some cases be more effective in controlling lobbying than direct <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> <b>prohibitions.</b> These results are obtained by modeling lobbying for taxes as a common agency game (menu auction). The standard description for this type of auctions is modified {{in a way that is}} consistent with imperfect taxation...|$|R

In many cases the Germans turned the remaining synagogues into storage facilities, workshops, places of entertainment, or ad-hoc prisons. Rabbis and other religious Jews were ordered to dance and sing in public with their beards cut or torn. Within weeks, Germans ordered all Polish Jews to register and the word [...] "Jude" [...] was stamped on their identity cards. Jews were placed outside the law and their lives were regulated by orders or edicts. Series of <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> <b>prohibitions</b> were introduced <b>and</b> brutally enforced. Jews were forbidden {{to walk on the}} sidewalks, use public transport, enter places of leisure, sports arenas, theaters, museums and libraries. On the street Jews had to lift their hat to passing Germans and contact between Jews and non-Jews was banned.|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{policy is}} an {{important}} spearhead of sustainable development. The more economic instruments {{can be incorporated into}} environmental protection policy, the more it will contribute to integration of industry within the environment and thus to sustainable development. In the past, Swiss environmental policy was primarily based on <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> <b>prohibitions.</b> In the last few years, intensive efforts have been made to reorient environmental policy. Here, economic instruments (incentive taxes, environmental management systems, agreements, cooperation, etc.) are playing an increasingly important role. Examples are the revision of the Federal Law relating to the Protection of the Environment and the message on a C 02 law. The report entitled "Sustainable Development in Switzerland, Strategy", approved by the Federal Council in 1997, contains eight fields of action. The principal field of action concerns the ecological tax reform. This involves creation within financial and tax policies of positive incentives for promoting employment and for achieving energetic and environmental objectives. ...|$|R
