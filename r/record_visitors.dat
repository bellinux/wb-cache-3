40|$|Background: Aloe reitzii var.   reitzii is a {{succulent}} with {{a restricted}} {{distribution in the}} montane grassland of eastern South Africa. It is a summer (late January–March) flowering succulent that grows on rocky outcrops at 1000 m– 1600 m, and the conspicuous inflorescences suggest a pollination system focused towards birds. Objectives: To understand more about the pollination biology of  A. reitzii var.   reitzii. Methods: Nectar standing crop (flower volume and concentration) {{and the proportion of}} plants flowering were recorded. Camera traps and observations were used to <b>record</b> <b>visitors</b> to  A. reitzii var.   reitzii inflorescences. Results: Nectar volume was 36 μL ± 27 μL per flower (range 6 μL– 93 μL;  n = 27) and concentration was 16. 5 % ± 1. 7 % (range 13. 5 % – 19. 5 %). Camera trap observations, where 18. 9 % of all plants were observed flowering, recorded the three bird species Cape Weaver,  Ploceus capensis, Malachite Sunbird,  Nectarinia famosa and Greater Double-collared Sunbird,  Cinnyris afer (60. 4 %, 27. 1 % and 12. 5 % of plant visits, respectively) visiting inflorescences. Conclusion: Because birds are important pollinators for many  Aloe species, it is assumed that the bird species detected visiting  A. reitzii var.   reitzii are similarly important pollinators. At least 10 invertebrate species and sengi (Elephantulus sp.) were also recorded as visitors to flowers, but they may be less important pollinators than specialist and generalist avian nectarivores. This study provides further insight into the pollination biology of a diverse, and ecologically important, succulent genus in Africa...|$|E

40|$|Solo show, New {{works that}} deepen and {{continue}} a sustained investigation through practice {{as to whether}} there is a contemporary value in the Romantic programme. This further investigation follows a new exhibition of recontextualised earlier works, John Hyatt: Novo Romantismo Inglês, MARCO - Museu de Arte Contemporânea de MS Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brasil, 18 Mar - 25 May 2014, a solo show of 19 oil paintings, organised by Instituto Plano Cultural, Brazil, that have previously toured UK, Portugal and Germany. Following that recontextualisation, research questions around Romanticism became the focus of this further inquiry resulting in original and previously unexhibited work. A pre-determined methodology for generating an automatic and unconscious process was designed to journey with the ‘inner eye’ (Wordsworth) facilitated by ‘going within’ in my battle with throat cancer. A theoretical and practical methodology is employed, derived from precedents in Romanticism and the esoteric tradition, married to aspects of Surrealism, especially autopoesis. Brushstrokes in repeating and diminishing double-helical patterns evoke Jungian archetypes. Robert Clark in The Guardian Guide said of this work, ‘His boldly daubed paintings are a refreshingly unstuffy yet disconcerting combination of neo-expressionist catharsis and unashamedly wacky, almost hackneyed, flights of fancy. ’ (p. 33 4 - 10 February 2017). The work is difficult for critical commentary as it deliberately politically challenges the expected forms of fashionable, contemporary ‘avant-garde’ art practice and courts populism with beauty to ask if there is still a radical force in Romanticism as a revolutionary reaction to the processes of industrialisation and the global exportation of Modernity. Public reaction is also tested via social media. Hyatt then exhibited the work at The Boo, October 2015, as a headline part of Rossendale Art Trail and his ongoing project to boost regional economy through art. The Trail recorded <b>record</b> <b>visitors</b> to the region. He also collaborated with Kope, London, to design and produce the works as a line of luxury fashion scarves...|$|E

The research could be divided into three steps; the first one concerns with GPS that can be used to record routes; the second one deals with interaction between tourists and cultural heritage through a system based on QR code; the third one is about GIS, used as tool for management, analysis and visualization of data flows. In the current research, the field of investigation refers both to the territorial scale of Turin - Milan axis, and to the local scale of small cities localized in the territories in between. The research has been applied to Turin - Milan infrastructural axis, with the aim to represent the relationships that can be established between mobility infrastructure and cultural heritage. Such relationships should be intended in terms of accessibility from mobility infrastructure (motorway exit, service areas, railways stations) to cultural heritage localized in the surrounding landscape. The richness of cultural heritage and landscape along the chosen infrastructural bundle represent a great opportunity for territorial development in terms of attractiveness, both for local inhabitants and for tourists. Nowadays, the use of tracking technologies can be applied to investigate tourist flows, behaviors of local inhabitants in the historic city centre, number of visitors in the city and so on. In this sense it is possible to apply these technologies, which are particularly relevant in urban studies, extending them to the territorial scale of the Turin - Milan region. The large amount of available geo-referenced data can be used in different ways and it is very potential for different kind of analysis: it is possible to show tourist flows in the territory, receive information about more visited places, obtain interaction from users and cultural heritage in terms of visitors opinion about the places, give information to tourists about cultural places, monitor the accessibility to the places, understand the use of means of transport and keep under control the impacts of tourism (social, cultural, environmental) on territory. Applications based on smartphones can be considered a powerful device for visitors but also for institutions that are involved in tourism and cultural heritage management. In fact, th...|$|E
