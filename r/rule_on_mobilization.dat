40|$|Why has the EU's {{promotion}} of Rule of Law (RoL) triggered different and largely surface-thin reforms across countries {{subject to a}} similar frame of enlargement in the Western Balkans (WB) ? We hypothesize that the domestic (non) enforcement of EU promoted <b>rules</b> depends <b>on</b> the <b>mobilization</b> of politically autonomous constituencies of change – organized advocacy groups and autonomous state institutions – which amount domestic accountability. The empirical investigation focuses on the prosecution of political corruption as empirical foci to assessing the travails of EU-promoted rules in the domestic context. Specifically, we trace the role of (1) EU's RoL promotion strategy, (2) political resistance and (3) domestic accountability in explaining different records of prosecution of political corruption in Albania and Croatia...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of implicit affect <b>on</b> effort <b>mobilization</b> in cognitive tasks. More specifically, this thesis focuses {{on the impact of}} implicit anger <b>on</b> effort <b>mobilization.</b> Although the psychological literature counts numerous studies exploring motivation processes and the impact of affective states on motivation, the majority of research has focused on the directional aspect of motivation, neglecting a second aspect of motivation: its intensity. Based on the Implicit-Affect-Primes-Effort model (IAPE, Gendolla, 2012), this thesis investigates {{the influence of}} implicit affect <b>on</b> effort <b>mobilization.</b> This model predicts that implicit anger stimuli, as implicit happiness stimuli, should activate knowledge about performance ease, resulting in experiences of lower subjective demand, which influences effort according to motivational intensity theory’s predictions <b>on</b> resource <b>mobilization</b> (Brehm & Self, 1989). Based on the IAPE model (Gendolla, 2012), this thesis presents a series of four studies investigating the impact of implicit anger <b>on</b> effort <b>mobilization...</b>|$|R
