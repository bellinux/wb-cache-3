40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the experimental bootstrapping {{of the development}} of broad-coverage finite-state morphological analysers for Xhosa, Swati and (Southern) Ndebele by using an existing prototype of a morphological analyser for Zulu. These languages are both morphologically complex and resource-scarce. The research question is whether bootstrapping is feasible across the language boundaries between these closely related varieties. The objective is an assessment of the recognition rates yielded by <b>the</b> Zulu morphological <b>analyser</b> for <b>the</b> three related languages. The strategy is to use bootstrapping techniques that consist of the following steps: applying <b>the</b> <b>analyser</b> to corpus data from all languages, identifying (types of) failures, and implementing the respective changes in <b>the</b> <b>analyser.</b> <b>The</b> results show that the high degree of shared typological properties and formal similarities among the Nguni varieties warrants a modular bootstrapping approach. Word forms in these languages that were recognized by <b>the</b> Zulu <b>analyser</b> were mostly adequately analysed. Therefore, the focus lies on providing the necessary adaptations based on an analysis of the failure output for each language. As a result, <b>the</b> development of <b>analysers</b> for Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele is considerably faster than the creation of the Zulu prototype. The paper concludes with comments on the feasibility of the experiment, and the results of the evaluation. ...|$|R

The source of samples for automatic sampling is commonly some kind of process such as a chemical process. Analysers which are connected to a process, and conduct automatic sampling, can be called online (or on-line) analysers or sometimes inline (or in-line) analysers. For inline analysis, a sensor can be placed in a process vessel or stream of flowing material to conduct the analysis. Another method of online analysis is allowing a sample stream to flow from the process equipment into an <b>analyser,</b> sometimes conditioning <b>the</b> sample stream in between such as reducing pressure or changing the sample temperature. Such sampling is typically for fluids (either liquids or gases). If the sample stream is not substantially modified by <b>the</b> <b>analyser,</b> it can be returned to the process.
