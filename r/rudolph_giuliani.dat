5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

25|$|Michael Bloomberg, {{formerly}} a Democrat, was elected as a Republican in 2001 and 2005, succeeding another Republican mayor, <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani,</b> elected in 1993 and 1997. Bloomberg left the Republican Party in 2008 {{and became a}} political independent.|$|E

25|$|The {{tradition}} of carriage horses in New York City was revived in 1935. The carriages {{have appeared in}} many films, and the first female horse and carriage driver, Maggie Cogan, appeared in a Universal newsreel in 1967. As such, they have become a symbolic institution of the city. After the September 11 attacks, in a much-publicized event, Mayor <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> went to the stables himself to ask the drivers {{to go back to}} work to help return a sense of normality.|$|E

25|$|A perp walk, {{or walking}} the perp, is a {{practice}} in American law enforcement of taking an arrested suspect through a public place, creating {{an opportunity for}} the media to take photographs and video of the event. The defendant is typically handcuffed or otherwise restrained, and is sometimes dressed in prison garb. Within the United States the perp walk is most closely associated with New York City. The practice rose in popularity in the 1980s under U.S. Attorney <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani,</b> when white-collar criminals were perp-walked.|$|E
25|$|Although Queens {{is heavily}} Democratic, it is {{considered}} a swing county in New York politics. Republican political candidates who do well in Queens usually win citywide or statewide elections. Republicans such as former Mayors <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> and Michael Bloomberg won majorities in Queens. Republican State Senator Serphin Maltese represented a district in central and southern Queens for twenty years until his defeat in 2008 by Democratic City Councilman Joseph Addabbo. In 2002, Queens voted against incumbent Republican Governor of New York George Pataki in favor of his Democratic opponent, Carl McCall by a slim margin.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, {{the stretch}} of Eighth Avenue that runs through Greenwich Village and its {{adjacent}} Chelsea neighborhood has been a center of the city's gay community, with bars and restaurants catering to gay men. In fact, New York City's annual gay pride parade takes place along the Greenwich Village section of Eighth Avenue. Also, along with Times Square, the portion of Eighth Avenue from 42nd Street to 50th Street was an informal red-light district in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s before it was controversially renovated into a more family friendly environment under the first mayoral administration of <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani.</b>|$|E

25|$|When Falcone's {{record of}} success and {{high-profile}} led to resentment from some quarters, he was not given the job he coveted as chief prosecutor in Palermo. The new incumbent did not accept that the hierarchical Mafia structure revealed by the Maxi Trial actually existed, and he attempted to force Falcone to work on cases of wife beating and car theft. Falcone became so frustrated that he spoke of resigning. During 1988 Falcone collaborated with <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani,</b> at the time U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in operations against the Gambino and Inzerillo families. Rumours impugning his integrity deeply troubled Falcone during this period.|$|E
25|$|The Executive Mansion was retaken by Democrats in 1974 and {{remained}} under Democratic control for 20 years under Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo. Latecentury Democrats became more centrist, including US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1977–2001) and New York City Mayor Ed Koch (1978–1989), while state Republicans began to align {{themselves with the}} more conservative national party. They gained power through the elections of Senator Alfonse D'Amato in 1980, Mayor <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> in 1993, and Governor George Pataki in 1994. New York remained {{one of the most}} liberal states. In 1984, Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to carry the state, although Republican Michael Bloomberg served as New York City mayor in the early 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The Bronx {{has often}} shown {{striking}} differences from other boroughs in elections for Mayor. The only Republican {{to carry the}} Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La Guardia in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican). The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005. The anti-war Socialist campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel, who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit citywide by 23.2% to 21.7%.|$|E

25|$|Homelessness {{became a}} serious problem during the 1980s, {{specifically}} {{in the last two}} of Edward Koch's three terms as mayor (1978–1990). The city outlawed discrimination against gay and lesbian people in such matters as employment and housing in 1986. In 1989, Koch was defeated by David Dinkins in the Democratic Party primary in his bid for a fourth term, and then Dinkins narrowly defeated Republican <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> in the general election to become the city's first-ever black mayor. Crime began a 15-year decline in 1990 during Dinkins's administration, but a combination of continued racial strife (such as that in the Crown Heights Riot in 1991), and an extremely weak economy (in January 1993 the city's unemployment rate reached 13.4 percent, the highest level of joblessness seen there since the Great Depression) caused Dinkins' popularity to seriously decline (including a threat by residents of Staten Island to secede from the city, where in a 1993 referendum, 65% voted to secede, but implementation was blocked in the State Assembly).|$|E
25|$|Following his {{departure}} from the New York City Police Department, he was employed by Giuliani Partners, a consulting firm formed by {{the former mayor of}} New York, <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani.</b> He served as {{a senior vice president at}} Giuliani Partners and as chief executive officer of Giuliani–Kerik LLC, an affiliate of Giuliani Partners. Kerik resigned from these positions in December 2004. In March 2005 he created The Kerik Group LLC, where he served as chairman until June 2009, consulting in crisis management and risk mitigation, counterterrorism and law enforcement, and jail/prison management strategies. He has served as an adviser and consultant to His Majesty King Abdullah II of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and to President Bharrat Jagdeo of the Republic of Guyana. He has overseen threat and vulnerability assessments for a ruling family in the United Arab Emirates and has also worked on crime reduction and national security strategies in Trinidad & Tobago and Mexico City, Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, {{as they did}} about the Democrats, about {{potential}} Republican candidates for President in 2008. In November 2006, Former New York City Mayor <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani</b> led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain. The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age {{and support of the}} unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies. Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place. Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Giuliani, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and Texas Representative Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively. McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements. In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul. MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Rudolph</b> <b>Giuliani's</b> {{first term}} as mayor the New York City Police Department, under Giuliani {{appointee}} Commissioner Bill Bratton, adopted an aggressive enforcement and deterrence strategy based on James Q. Wilson's Broken Windows research. This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping, and aggressive [...] "squeegeemen," [...] {{on the principle}} that this would send a message that order would be maintained and that the city would be [...] "cleaned up." ...|$|R
