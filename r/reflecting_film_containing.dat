40|$|A {{lightweight}} {{solar concentrator}} of the reflecting parabolic or trough type is realized via a thin <b>reflecting</b> <b>film,</b> an inflatable structural housing and tensioned fibers. The reflector element {{itself is a}} thin, flexible, specularly-reflecting sheet or film. The film is maintained in the parabolic trough shape {{by means of a}} plurality of identical tensioned fibers arranged to be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the parabola. Fiber ends are terminated in two identical spaced anchorplates, each containing a plurality of holes which lie on the desired parabolic contour. In a preferred embodiment, these fibers are arrayed in pairs with one fiber contacting the front side of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>film</b> and the other contacting {{the back side of the}} <b>reflecting</b> <b>film.</b> The reflective surface is thereby slidably captured between arrays of fibers which control the shape and position of the reflective film. Gas pressure in the inflatable housing generates fiber tension to achieve a truer parabolic shape...|$|R

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{with the objective}} of formulating TC <b>containing</b> fast dissolving <b>films</b> for local delivery to oral cavity. Various film forming agents, film modifiers and polyhydric alcohols were evaluated for optimizing the composition of fast dissolving films. The potential of poloxamer 407 and hydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin (HPBCD) to improve solubility of TC was investigated. Fast dissolving <b>films</b> <b>containing</b> hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), xanthan gum, and xylitol were formulated. Use of poloxamer 407 and HPBCD resulted in significant improvement in the solubility of TC. Fast dissolving <b>films</b> <b>containing</b> TC-HPBCD complex and TC-Poloxamer 407 were formulated and were evaluated for the in vitro dissolution profile and in vitro microbiological assay. <b>Films</b> <b>containing</b> TC-Poloxamer 407 exhibited better in vitro dissolution profile and in vitro antimicrobial activity as compared to the <b>films</b> <b>containing</b> TC-HPBCD complex. Effect of incorporation of eugenol on the in vivo performance of TC-Poloxamer 407 <b>containing</b> <b>films</b> was evaluated in human volunteers. Eugenol <b>containing</b> <b>films</b> improved the acceptability of TC-Poloxamer 407 films with respect to taste masking and mouth freshening without compromising the in vivo dissolution time...|$|R
