40|$|We have {{screened}} {{portions of}} the large intergenic region of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) genome for promoter activity in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and have identified an element that contributes to promoter activity in yeast but has negligible activity in plant cells when expressed in an agroinfiltration assay. A search of the yeast genome sequence revealed that the CaMV element had sequence similarity with the R region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the yeast Ty 1 retrotransposon, with significant statistical confidence. In plants, the same CaMV sequence {{has been shown to}} have an essential role in the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunt</b> mechanism of translation, as it forms the base of the right arm of the stem-loop structure that is required for the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunt.</b> Since the left arm of the stem-loop structure must represent an imperfect reverse copy of the right arm, we propose that the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunt</b> has evolved from a pair of LTRs that have become incorporated end to end into the CaMV genome...|$|R
40|$|The shunt model {{predicts that}} small ORFs (sORFs) within the {{cauliflower}} mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S RNA leader and downstream ORF VII are translated by different mechanisms, that is, scanning–reinitiation and shunting, respectively. Wheat germ extract (WGE) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) {{in vitro translation}} systems were used to discriminate between these two processes and to study the mechanism of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunt.</b> In both systems, expression downstream of the leader occurred via <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunt</b> {{under the control of}} a stable stem and a small ORF preceding it. Shunting ribosomes were also able to initiate quite efficiently at non-AUG start codons just downstream of the shunt landing site in WGE but not in RRL. The short sORF MAGDIS from the mammalian AdoMetDC RNA, which conditionally suppresses reinitiation at a downstream ORF, prevented shunting if placed at the position of sORF A, the 5 ′-proximal ORF of the CaMV leader. We have demonstrated directly that sORF A is translated and that proper termination of translation at the 5 ′-proximal ORF is absolutely required for both shunting and linear ribosome migration. These findings strongly indicate that shunting is a special case of reinitiation...|$|R

40|$|The {{prototype}} {{foamy virus}} (PFV) is a nonpathogenic retrovirus that shows promise as a vector for gene transfer. The PFV (pre) genomic RNA {{starts with a}} long complex leader that can be folded into an elongated hairpin, suggesting an alternative strategy to cap-dependent linear scanning for translation initiation of the downstream GAG open reading frame (ORF). We found that the PFV leader carries several short ORFs (sORFs), with the three 5 ′-proximal sORFs located upstream of a structural element. Scanning-inhibitory hairpin insertion analysis suggested a <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunt</b> mechanism, whereby ribosomes start scanning at the leader 5 ′-end and initiate at the downstream ORF via bypass of the central leader regions, which are inhibitory for scanning. We show that the efficiency of shunting depends strongly on {{the stability of the}} structural element located downstream of either sORFs A/A′ or sORF B, and on the translation event at the corresponding 5 ′-proximal sORF. The PFV shunting strategy mirrors that of Cauliflower mosaic virus in plants; however, in mammals shunting can operate {{in the presence of a}} less stable structural element, although it is greatly improved by increasing the number of base pairings. At least one shunt configuration was found in primate FV (pre) genomic RNAs...|$|R

Subsequent binding of the penton protein to host integrin entry receptors mediates internalization into the host cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the virus and fiber shedding. Some serotypes also seem to use macropinocytosis. Disruption of host endosomal membrane by lytic protein VI releases the viral capsid in the cytosol.

40|$|In eukaryotes, 40 S ribosomal {{subunits}} {{move from}} their recruitment {{site on the}} mRNA to the initiation codon by an as yet poorly understood process. One postulated mechanism involves <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunting,</b> in which ribosomal subunits completely bypass regions of the 5 ′ leader. For some mRNAs, shunting {{has been shown to}} require various mRNA elements, some of which are thought to base pair to 18 S rRNA; however, the role of base pairing has not yet been tested directly. In earlier studies, we demonstrated that a short mRNA element in the 5 ′ leader of the Gtx homeodomain mRNA functioned as a ribosomal recruitment site by base pairing to the 18 S rRNA. Using a model system to assess translation in transfected cells, we now show that this intermolecular interaction also facilitates <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunting</b> across two types of obstacles: an upstream AUG codon in excellent context or a stable hairpin structure. Highly efficient shunting occurred when multiple Gtx elements were present upstream of the obstacles, and a single Gtx element was present downstream. Shunting was less efficient, however, when the multiple Gtx elements were present only upstream of the obstacles. In addition, control experiments with mRNAs lacking the upstream elements showed that these results could not be attributed to recruitment by the single downstream element. Experiments in yeast in which the mRNA elements and 18 S rRNA sequences were both mutated indicated that shunting required an intact complementary match. The data obtained by this model system provide direct evidence that <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunting</b> can be mediated by mRNA–rRNA base pairing, a finding that may have general implications for mechanisms of ribosome movement...|$|E
40|$|Cis-acting signals {{regulate}} {{translation of}} viral RNAs to produce viral proteins {{at the appropriate}} levels and timing to maximize virus replication. Here we describe the cis-acting sequences that achieve this translational control via processes such as cap-dependent translation, leaky scan-ning to initiate translation at more than one start codon, <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunting,</b> cap-independent translation initiation controlled from the 5 ′ and/or 3 ′ untranslated region, poly(A) tail-independent translation initiation, stop codon readthrough, and ribosomal frameshifting. The secondary structures and, in some cases, tertiary structures of the RNA sequences that control these events are described. We also discuss the mechanisms of the translation events facilitated by the cis-acting signals, and how they mesh with the overall replication strategies of the diverse viruses that employ these mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The duck {{hepatitis}} B virus (DHBV) pregenomic RNA is a bicistronic mRNA encoding {{the core and}} polymerase proteins. Thirteen AUGs (C 2 to C 14) and 10 stop codons (S 1 to S 10) are located between the C 1 AUG for the core protein and the P 1 AUG that initiates polymerase translation. We previously found that the translation of the DHBV polymerase is initiated by <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunting.</b> Here, we assessed the biosynthetic events after shunting. Translation of the polymerase open reading frame was found to initiate at the C 13, C 14, and P 1 AUGs. Initiation at the C 13 AUG occurred through <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunting</b> because translation from this codon was cap dependent but was insensitive to blocking ribosomal scanning internally in the message. C 13 and C 14 are in frame with P 1, and translation from these upstream start codons led {{to the production of}} larger isoforms of P. We named these isoforms "pre-P" by analogy to the pre-C and pre-S regions of the core and surface antigen open reading frames. Pre-P was produced in DHBV 16 and AusDHBV-infected duck liver and was predicted to exist in 80 % of avian hepadnavirus strains. Pre-P was not encapsidated into DHBV core particles, and the viable strain DHBV 3 cannot make pre-P, so it is not essential for viral replication. Surprisingly, we found that pre-P is an N-linked glycoprotein that is secreted into the medium of cultured cells. These data indicate that DHBV produces an additional protein that has not been previously reported. Identifying the role of pre-P may improve our understanding of the biology of DHBV infection.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) pregenomic 35 S RNA translation occurs via nonlinear ribosome migration (ribosome shunt) and is mediated by an elongated hairpin {{structure in the}} leader. The replacement of the viral leader {{by a series of}} short, low-energy stems in either orientation supports efficient <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunting,</b> showing that the stem per se, and not its sequence, is recognized by the translation machinery. The requirement for cis-acting sequences from the unstructured terminal regions of the viral leader was analyzed: the 5 '-terminal polypyrimidine stretch and the short upstream open reading frame (uORF) A stimulate translation, whereas the 3 '-flanking region seems not to be essential. Based on these results, an artificial leader was designed with a stable stem flanked by unstructured sequences derived from parts of the 5 '- and 3 '-proximal regions of the CaMV 35 S RNA leader. This artificial leader is shunt-competent in translation assays in vivo and in vitro, indicating that a low-energy stem, broadly used as a device to successfully interfere with ribosome scanning, can efficiently support translation, if preceded by a short uORF. The synthetic 140 -nt leader can functionally replace the CaMV 35 S RNA 600 -nt leader, thus implicating the universal role that nonlinear ribosome scanning could play in translation initiation in eukaryotes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGene 3 b (ORF 3 b) in porcine {{transmissible}} gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) encodes a putative nonstructural polypeptide of 27. 7 kDa with unknown function that during translation in vitro {{is capable of}} becoming a glycosylated integral membrane protein of 31 kDa. In the virulent Miller strain of TGEV, ORF 3 b is 5 ′-terminal on mRNA 3 – 1 and is presumably translated following 5 ′ cap-dependent ribosomal entry. For three other strains of TGEV, the virulent British FS 772 / 70 and Taiwanese TFI and avirulent Purdue- 116, mRNA species 3 – 1 is not made and ORF 3 b is present as a non-overlapping second ORF on mRNA 3. ORF 3 b begins at base 432 on mRNA 3 in Purdue strain. In vitro expression of ORF 3 b from Purdue mRNA 3 -like transcripts did not fully conform to a predicted leaky scanning pattern, suggesting ribosomes might also be entering internally. With mRNA 3 -like transcripts modified to carry large ORFs upstream of ORF 3 a, it was demonstrated that ribosomes can reach ORF 3 b by entering at a distant downstream site in a manner resembling <b>ribosomal</b> <b>shunting.</b> Deletion analysis failed to identify a postulated internal ribosomal entry structure (IRES) within ORF 3 a. The results indicate that an internal entry mechanism, possibly in conjunction with leaky scanning, {{is used for the}} expression of ORF 3 b from TGEV mRNA 3. One possible consequence of this feature is that ORF 3 b might also be expressed from mRNAs 1 and 2...|$|E
