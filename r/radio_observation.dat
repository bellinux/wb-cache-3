50|$|The RATAN-600 is {{primarily}} operated as a transit telescope, {{in which the}} rotation of the Earth is used to sweep the telescope focus across the subject of observation. Radio frequency observations can be made in the frequency band 610 MHz to 30 GHz, though primarily in the centimetric waveband, with an angular resolution of up to 2 arcseconds. Observation of the Sun at radio wavelengths, in particular of the solar corona, has been a long-standing focus of the RATAN-600's scientific programme. It has also contributed to <b>radio</b> <b>observation</b> for the SETI project.

5000|$|While radio {{astronomy}} {{was developed in}} the 1930s, it was not until 1937 that any substantial evidence arose for the conclusive identification of an interstellar molecule - up until this point, the only chemical species known to exist in interstellar space were atomic. These findings were confirmed in 1940, when McKellar et al. identified and attributed spectroscopic lines in an as-of-then unidentified <b>radio</b> <b>observation</b> to CH and CN molecules in interstellar space. In the thirty years afterwards, a small selection of other molecules were discovered in interstellar space: the most important being OH, discovered in 1963 and significant as a source of interstellar oxygen, and H2CO (Formaldehyde), discovered in 1969 and significant for being the first observed organic, polyatomic molecule in interstellar space ...|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{powerful}} technique for detection of individual chemical species is radio astronomy, which {{has resulted in the}} detection of over a hundred interstellar species, including radicals and ions, and organic (i.e. carbon-based) compounds, such as alcohols, acids, aldehydes, and ketones. One of the most abundant interstellar molecules, and among the easiest to detect with radio waves (due to its strong electric dipole moment), is CO (carbon monoxide). In fact, CO is such a common interstellar molecule that it is used to map out molecular regions. The <b>radio</b> <b>observation</b> of perhaps greatest human interest is the claim of interstellar glycine, the simplest amino acid, but with considerable accompanying controversy. [...] One of the reasons why this detection was controversial is that although radio (and some other methods like rotational spectroscopy) are good for the identification of simple species with large dipole moments, they are less sensitive to more complex molecules, even something relatively small like amino acids.|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} basic {{characteristics}} of thermal gyroresonance (also known as cyclotron) emission from solar active regions, and show how <b>radio</b> <b>observations</b> combined with {{our understanding of}} the basic mechanism can reveal much of the magnetic and thermal structure of the corona over active regions. 1. Introduction Since the realization in the early 1960 s [Ginzburg & Zheleznyakov 1961; Kakinuma & Swarup 1962; Zheleznyakov 1962] that the strong radio emission observed from solar active regions was associated with gyroresonance opacity, <b>radio</b> <b>observations</b> have provided the only direct diagnostic of magnetic field strengths in the solar corona. It is a happy coincidence that the low harmonics of the range of magnetic field strengths found in the corona (up to 2500 G) correspond to the range of microwave frequencies (1 [...] 20 GHz) for which atmospheric transmission is not an issue and high spatial resolution <b>radio</b> <b>observations</b> are readily feasible.
