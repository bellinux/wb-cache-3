5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg <b>reflections</b> <b>in</b> the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E

Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends.

5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of <b>reflections</b> <b>in</b> each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to insert a glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Reflection</b> <b>in</b> action {{research}} {{is a complex}} matter, as is {{action research}} itself. In recent years, complexity science has regularly been called upon in order to more thoroughly understand the complexity of action research. The present article investigates the benefits that complexity science may yield for <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> action research. This article begins by explicating {{the sense in which}} the complexity of <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> action research involves the role of values and existential knowledge in education. The gap between theory and practice is also explored. On the basis of a number of common features of complex systems (heterogeneous, open, dynamic, non-linear, adaptive, and coadaptive), the sense <b>in</b> which <b>reflection</b> can be regarded as a complex system is discussed. To this end, the features of complex systems are translated into features of <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> action research, which, in turn, are illustrated with examples from recent publications on <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> action research. The aim of this analysis is to make <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> action research more understandable and manageable. In line with this, it is argued that room for insecurity and unpredictability, combined with an explicit consideration of reflection as a complex system, contributes to the use of complexity as a stimulus for new learnin...|$|R

We now discuss topologically closed subgroups of O(3).The whole O(3) is the symmetry group of spherical symmetry; SO(3) is the corresponding rotation group. The other infinite isometry groups consist of all rotations about an axis through the origin, and those with additionally <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the planes through the axis, and/or <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the plane through the origin, perpendicular to the axis. Those with <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the planes through the axis, with or without <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the plane through the origin perpendicular to the axis, are the symmetry groups for {{the two types of}} cylindrical symmetry. Note that any physical object having infinite rotational symmetry will also have the symmetry of mirror planes through the axis.|$|R
