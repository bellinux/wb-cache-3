5|$|The {{historic}} {{range of}} the springbok stretched across the dry grasslands, bushlands, and shrublands of south-western and southern Africa; springbok migrated sporadically in southern parts of the range. These migrations are <b>rarely</b> <b>seen</b> nowadays, but seasonal congregations can still be observed in preferred areas of short vegetation, such as the Kalahari desert.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} breeds on exposed and usually {{uninhabited}} islands which it visits only at night.

In Europe, it is <b>rarely</b> <b>seen</b> from land except in autumn storms.|$|E

5|$|A katipo bite {{produces}} the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no deaths {{have been reported}} since 1901. The katipo is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation is almost entirely devoid of dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known, despite being <b>rarely</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E

5|$|Persoonia lanceolata is <b>rarely</b> <b>seen</b> in cultivation, mainly due to {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its bright green hue {{is considered an}} attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis is <b>rarely</b> <b>seen</b> in cultivation, {{mainly because}} of {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E
5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The {{most common form of}} URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More <b>rarely</b> <b>seen</b> in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E

Among U.S. bird keepers that participated in a survey by APPMA in 2003/04, 39% had cockatiels, as opposed to only 3% that had (other) cockatoo species. The white cockatoos are more often encountered in aviculture than the black cockatoos. Black cockatoos are <b>rarely</b> <b>seen</b> in European zoos due to export restrictions on Australian wildlife but birds seized by governments have been loaned.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{this article}} the letters R,L and C are used with their usual {{meanings}} to represent resistance, inductance and capacitance, respectively.

Z is used for electrical impedance, any 2-terminal combination of RLC elements and in some sections D {{is used for the}} <b>rarely</b> <b>seen</b> quantity elastance, which is the inverse of capacitance.|$|E

There were also 24 types of spider, {{and the five}} ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined darter appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E
