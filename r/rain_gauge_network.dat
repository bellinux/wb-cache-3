40|$|AbstractA {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of a <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>network</b> is developed in this study. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first time}} a combination of geostatistical tools and factor analysis, along with a clustering technique, has been used to prioritize rain gauge stations in terms of information content over the study area. The whole study area is divided into homogeneous subregions and a conventional variance-based approach is implemented in each subregion to rank rain gauge stations. For this purpose, factor analysis coupled with ordinary block kriging is used to identify the number of homogeneous subregions, and then, ordinary point kriging is used to assign rain gauge stations to each subregion. The developed scheme is quite time-efficient as it is not sensitive to initial guesses on cluster centers, there is no need to specify the number of clusters in advance and, above all, it is highly relevant to the overall objective stipulated in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>network</b> design. The proposed methodology is implemented on real data set in the south west of Iran. The results show that the proposed approach compares well with existing paradigms in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>network</b> design and only six rain gauge stations are required to provide the necessary information. In particular, the measure of network accuracy lies somewhere in between the so called time consuming and more simplified approaches used in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>network</b> design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- <b>Rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>networks</b> {{are used}} to {{calibrate}} and validate quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) methods based on remote sensing, which {{may be used as}} data sources for hydrologic models. The typical approach is to adjust (calibrate) or compare (validate) the rainfall in the QPE pixel with the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> located within the pixel. The QPE result represents a mean rainfall over the pixel area, whereas the rainfall from the gauge represents a point, although it is normally assumed to represent some area. In most cases the QPE pixel area is millions of square meter in size. We hypothesize that some <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>networks</b> in environments similar to this study (i. e., tropical coastal), which provide only one <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> per remote sensing pixel, may lead to error when used to calibrate/validate QPE methods, and that consequently these errors may be propagated throughout hydrologic models.

40|$|The {{systematic}} underestimation {{observed in}} debris flow early warning thresholds {{has been associated}} with the use of sparse <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>networks</b> to represent highly non-stationary rainfall fields.

40|$|Rainfall {{data are}} a {{fundamental}} input for effective planning, designing and operating {{of water resources}} projects. A well-designed <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>network</b> is capable of providing accurate estimates of necessary areal average and/or point rainfall estimates at any desired ungauged location in a catchment. Increasing network density with additional rain gauge stations has been the main underlying criterion {{in the past to}} reduce error and uncertainty in rainfall estimates. However, installing and operation of additional stations in a network involves large cost and manpower. Hence, the objective {{of this study is to}} design an optimal <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>network</b> in the Middle Yarra River catchment in Victoria, Australia. The optimal positioning of additional stations as well as optimally relocating of existing redundant stations using the kriging-based geostatistical approach was undertaken in this study. Reduction of kriging error was considered as an indicator for optimal spatial positioning of the stations. Daily rainfall records of 1997 (an El Niño year) and 2010 (a La Niña year) were used for the analysis. Ordinary kriging was applied for rainfall data interpolation to estimate the kriging error for the network. The results indicate that significant reduction in the kriging error can be achieved by the optimal spatial positioning of the additional as well as redundant stations. Thus, the obtained optimal <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>network</b> is expected to be appropriate for providing high quality rainfall estimates over the catchment. The concept proposed in this study for optimal <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>network</b> design through combined use of additional and redundant stations together is equally applicable to any other catchment...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of dense}} <b>networks</b> of <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> {{to verify the}} skill of {{quantitative}} numerical precipitation forecasts requires bridging the scale gap between the finite resolution of the forecast fields and the point measurements provided by each gauge. This is usually achieved either by interpolating the numerical forecasts to the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> positions, or by upscaling the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements by averaging techniques. Both approaches are affected by uncertainties and sampling errors due to the limited density of most <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>networks</b> and to the high spatiotemporal variability of precipitation. For this reason, {{an estimate of the}} sampling errors is crucial for obtaining a meaningful comparison. This work presents the application of a stochastic rainfall downscaling technique that allows a quantitative comparison between numerical forecasts and <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements, in both downscaling and upscaling approaches, and allows a quanti- tative assessment of the significance {{of the results of the}} verification procedure...|$|R
40|$|We {{applied a}} Regional Climate Model (RCM) to {{simulate}} precipitation and snow cover over the Himalaya, between March 2000 and December 2002. Due to its higher resolution, our model simulates {{a more realistic}} spatial variability of wind and precipitation {{than those of the}} reanalysis of the European Centre of Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) used as lateral boundaries. In this region, we found very large discrepancies between the estimations of precipitation provided by reanalysis, <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> <b>networks,</b> satellite observations, and our RCM simulation. Our model clearly underestimates precipitation at the foothills of the Himalaya and in its eastern part. However, our simulation provides a first estimation of liquid and solid precipitation in high altitude areas, where satellite and <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>networks</b> are not very reliable. During the two years of simulation, our model resembles the snow cover extent and duration quite accurately in these areas. Both snow accumulation and snow cover duration differ widely along the Himalaya: snowfall can occur during the whole year in western Himalaya, due to both summer monsoon and mid-latitude low pressure systems bringing moisture into this region. In Central Himalaya and on the Tibetan Plateau, a much more marked dry season occurs from October to March. Snow cover does not have a pronounced seasonal cycle in these regions, since it depends both on the quite variable duration of the monsoon and on the rare but possible occurrence of snowfall during the extra-monsoon period...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{to study the}} precipitation dynamics with advanced and specific tools is an important task of the research activity addressing the understanding, the modeling, and the managing of rainfall events. Over the last years, the hydrology laboratory of the Department of Civil, Environmental, Aerospace Engineering, and Materials (DICAM) at the University of Palermo, has installed several instruments for the monitoring {{and the study of}} precipitation within the urban area of Palermo (Italy). The main instrument of this system is the X-band weather radar, which allows monitoring the precipitation fields with high resolution in space and time. This instrument is supported by a <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> <b>network</b> of 18 tipping bucket gauges spread over the observed area, a weight <b>rain</b> <b>gauge,</b> an optical disdrometer, and a weather station. The information provided by different devices can be combined in order to integrate different data and correct errors. In particular, the disdrometer is able to provide the drop size distribution (DSD) that is directly linked to the parameters used to transform radar reflectivity to precipitation estimates. Moreover, disdrometer observations can be used to classify the precipitation events. The <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> <b>network</b> data is used to apply a ground correction to the radar precipitation maps. Such an operation is useful to constrain the radar estimate to the observed ground precipitation value.
