Material and methods: For this purpose, we used twenty simulated root canals with 21 mm length and 30 degree angle, which {{were divided into two}} experimental groups according to curvature’s initial position: 8 mm (group A) and 12 mm (group B) short of the canal orifice. The canals were prepared using crown-down technique, and memory instrument was size # 30. For apical deviation analysis, before and after preparation, canals were filled with Indian ink and standardly photographed {{with the aid of a}} platform. After that, the images were manipulated by Adobe Photoshop® software, through superimposing pre- and post-operative images. Deviation occurrence was measured 1 mm short of working length and at the middle of the curvature by using the <b>ruler</b> <b>tool.</b> Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) with significance level set at 5 %. Results: Although group B showed a significantly greater deviation mean than group A, no significant interaction was verified between the analysis site and the experimental group. Conclusion: According to the present data, it could be observed that the smaller the curvature radius, the greater the deviation. Concerning to the analysis site, it could be noted that the area 1 mm short of working length presented a higher deviation than the point at the middle of the curvature...|$|E

40|$|The Interactive 3 D Mars Visualization system {{provides}} high-performance, immersive visualization of satellite and surface vehicle imagery of Mars. The software {{can be used}} in mission operations to provide the most accurate position information for the Mars rovers to date. When integrated into the mission data pipeline, this system allows mission planners to view the location of the rover on Mars to 0. 01 -meter accuracy with respect to satellite imagery, with dynamic updates to incorporate the latest position information. Given this information so early in the planning process, rover drivers are able to plan more accurate drive activities for the rover than ever before, increasing the execution of science activities significantly. Scientifically, this 3 D mapping information puts all of the science analyses to date into geologic context on a daily basis instead of weeks or months, as was the norm prior to this contribution. This allows the science planners to judge the efficacy of their previously executed science observations much more efficiently, and achieve greater science return as a result. The Interactive 3 D Mars surface view is a Mars terrain browsing software interface that encompasses the entire region of exploration for a Mars surface exploration mission. The view is interactive, allowing the user to pan in any direction by clicking and dragging, or to zoom in or out by scrolling the mouse or touchpad. This set currently includes tools for selecting a point of interest, and a <b>ruler</b> <b>tool</b> for displaying the distance between and positions of two points of interest.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to determine pigs’ location in their home pen in relation to an unknown female observer. A total of 79 pens housing 1, 817 ~ 6 wk old mixed sexed nursery pigs were used. An approachability test defined by Fangman et al. (2010) was used. The length of the nursery pen was measured with the Adobe Photoshop <b>ruler</b> <b>tool</b> from the pen gate located directly behind {{the midpoint of the}} observer’s back (defined as the dorsal medial point) to {{the opposite end of the}} pen 20 cm from the floor. A transparency was taped to the computer monitor and the home pen was divided into thirds and fourths. Pigs were then counted within the lines. A pig was considered in a section if both eyes and at least one complete ear were in front of the line. These results will be presented descriptively. Fewer pigs were in the section closest to the observer (6. 4 % vs. 2. 7 %; Figure 1) when the pen was divided into fourths. Pigs included in these closest sections to the observer were most likely to be classified as approaching. Regardless of how pens were divided up, more pigs were located in the furthest section away from the human observer (52. 9 and 41. 8 % respectively; Figure 2). The observer noted portioning the pen into fourths provided greater pig location accuracy. For example when the pen was sectoioned into thirds, a toal of 15 pigs could not be clearly alloacted to a section compared to only four pigs when the pen was divided into fourths. In conclusion dividing the pen into fewer sections resulted in a higher percentage of pigs being classified as approaching the observer, however the accuracy of being able to place pigs into sections was harder when the pen was divided into thirds...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} effects of {{autophagy}} deficiency induced by RPE-specific deletion of Atg 5 or Atg 7 in mice as a function of age. Methods: Conditional knockout mice with a floxed allele of Atg 5 or Atg 7 were crossed with inducible VMD 2 -rtTA/Cre transgenic mice. VMD 2 -directed RPE-specific Cre recombinase expression was induced with doxycycline feeding in the resulting mice. Cre-mediated deletion of floxed Atg 5 or Atg 7 resulted in RPE-specific inactivation of the Atg 5 or Atg 7 gene. Plastic and thin retinal sections were analyzed with light and electron microscopy for histological changes. Photoreceptor outer segment (POS) thickness in plastic sections was measured using the Adobe Photoshop CS 4 extended <b>ruler</b> <b>tool.</b> Autophagic adaptor p 62 /SQSTM 1 and markers for oxidatively damaged lipids, proteins, and DNA were examined with immunofluorescence staining of cryosections. Fluorescence signals were quantified using Image J software. Results: Accumulation of p 62 /SQSTM 1 reflecting autophagy deficiency was observed in the RPE of the Atg 5 (Delta RPE) and Atg 7 (Delta RP) E mice. 3 -nitrotyrosine, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), markers for oxidatively damaged proteins and DNA, were also found to accumulate in the RPE of these mice. We observed retinal degeneration in 35 % of the Atg 5 (Delta RPE) mice and 45 % of the Atg 7. RPE mice at 8 to 24 months old. Degeneration severity and the number of mice with degeneration increased with age. The mean POS thickness of these mice was 25 mu m at 8 - 12 months, 15 mu m at 13 - 18 months, and 3 mu m at 19 - 24 months, compared to 35 mu m, 30 mu m, and 24 aem in the wildtype mice, respectively. Early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) -like RPE defects were found in all the Atg 5 (Delta RPE) and Atg 7. RPE mice 13 months old or older, including vacuoles, uneven RPE thickness, diminished basal infoldings, RPE hypertrophy/hypotrophy, pigmentary irregularities, and necrosis. The severity of the RPE defects increased with age and in the mice with retinal degeneration. RPE atrophy and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) were occasionally observed in the Atg 5 (Delta RPE) and Atg 7 (Delta RPE) mice with advanced age. Conclusions: Autophagy deficiency induced by RPE-specific deletion of Atg 5 or Atg 7 predisposes but does not necessarily drive the development of AMD-like phenotypes or retinal degeneration...|$|E

Although such curves could be drawn freehand at the drafting board, shipbuilders often needed a life-size version {{which could not be}} done by hand. Such large drawings were done with the help of flexible strips of wood, called splines. The splines were held in place at a number of predetermined points, called [...] "ducks"; between the ducks, the elasticity of the spline material caused the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy of bending, thus creating the smoothest possible shape that fit the constraints. The shape could be tweaked by moving the ducks.|$|R

40|$|Pairs of Au {{nanoparticles}} {{have recently}} been proposed as “plasmon rulers” based on the dependence of their light scattering on the interparticle distance. Preliminary work has suggested that plasmon rulers {{can be used to}} measure and monitor dynamic distance changes over the 1 - to 100 -nm length scale in biology. Here, we substantiate that plasmon rulers can be used to measure dynamical biophysical processes by applying the ruler to a system that has been investigated extensively by using ensemble kinetic measurements: the cleavage of DNA by the restriction enzyme EcoRV. Temporal resolutions of up to 240 Hz were obtained, and the end-to-end extension of up to 1, 000 individual dsDNA enzyme substrates could be simultaneously monitored for hours. The kinetic parameters extracted from our single-molecule cleavage trajectories agree well with values obtained in bulk through other methods and confirm well known features of the cleavage process, such as DNA bending before cleavage. Previously unreported dynamical information is revealed as well, for instance, the degree of softening of the DNA just before cleavage. The unlimited lifetime, high temporal resolution, and high signal/noise ratio make the plasmon <b>ruler</b> a unique <b>tool</b> for studying macromolecular assemblies and conformational changes at the single-molecule level...|$|R
40|$|Y-plant is a 3 -dimensional plant {{architecture}} model {{developed with}} the objective of investigating the linkages between crown architecture and leaf and crown physiology. It is written in Borland Delphi for Windows-based PCs. The functional unit in Y-plant is a node to which a stem segment, a branch segment and/or a leaf supported via a petiole can be attached. A node is attached to a mothernode via a stem or branch segment, of a given angle, azimuth and length and diameter originating at the mother node. Leaf shapes are defined via coordinates for the leaf outline and are scaled to size according to the leaf length. The angle, azimuth, length and diameter of the petiole and the angle and azimuth of the lamina surface normal and azimuth of the midrib then specified leaf positions. In this way a crown with up to at least 10, 000 leaves can be reconstructed. Details of the reconstruction are in Pearcy and Yang (1996).
