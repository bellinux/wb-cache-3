40|$|Abstract. An {{algorithm}} {{to detect}} invisible <b>relevant</b> <b>persons</b> in a homo-geneous social network is studied with computer simulation. The network is {{effective as a}} model for contemporary inter-working terrorists where large hub persons do not exist. Absense of large hub persons results in that the observed communication flow is also homogeneous. Clues re-garding invisible <b>relevant</b> <b>persons</b> are hardly found in communication records. This task is, therefore, generally difficult. We demonstrate that our algorithm identifies the portion of the market baskets representing communication records, where invisible <b>relevant</b> <b>persons</b> are likely to be hidden, with good precision. ...|$|R
