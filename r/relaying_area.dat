A consortium of five Adriatic countries {{was set up in}} the framework of the Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance Adriatic Cross-border Cooperation Programme (IPA Adriatic CBC) 2007 - 2013 with the aim of collecting data and distribute information on harvesting and production in mollusc areas. A web-based geographical information system (GIS) application was developed to support the partners to manage data and to make these data available to final users, policy makers and to risk assessors. The GIS for the Strengthening of Centres for Aquaculture Production and Safety surveillance in the Adriatic countries (CAPS 2) is divided into two levels, the national and the supranational one, and it distributes spatial and epidemiological information coming from various data acquisition and management sites. The great innovation is the possibility for each country to use online drawing, modifying and change of the geographic areas according to national surveillance needs. Currently it hosts data coming from about 230 production and <b>relay</b> <b>areas</b> with more than 29, 478 laboratory tests performed on collected samples since August 2014.

During that period the identification of the viral agents was carried out by one step real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Escherichia coli according to ISO TS 16649 - 3 : 2005 standard method.

40|$|Numerous local {{incidents}} {{occur on}} road networks daily {{many of which}} may lead to congestion and safety hazards. If vehicles can be provided with information about such incidents or traffic conditions in advance, the quality of driving in terms of time, distance, and safety can be improved significantly. Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have recently emerged as an effective tool for improving road safety through the propagation of warning messages among the vehicles in the network about potential obstacles on the road ahead. This research has presented an effective warning data dissemination scheme which deploys relay strategy and concept of Region of Interest (RoI). A warning data message is characterized as spatio-temporal, implying that both the location {{and the time of}} an incident must be considered. Factors such as the type of warning message, the layout of the road network, the traffic density and the capacity of alternative roads are influential in determining the RoI in which the warning message needs to be propagated. In the developed scheme, the type of warning message is taken into account for the determination of the RoI so that the more severe the incident, the wider the RoI. In the selection of the relay point, the border <b>relay</b> <b>area</b> in which the relay point is placed, is adapted to the traffic density so that the higher the traffic density, the narrower the <b>relay</b> <b>area.</b> Traffic statistics are used to calculate the RoI, which is then enclosed in the warning message so that the message is not retransmitted beyond the RoI. Also, the responsibility for retransmitting the message is assigned to the relay node. The data is then disseminated effectively so that vehicles in areas unrelated to the incident are not informed. The primary objective of this research is to provide better understanding of the dissemination of warning data {{in the context of a}} vehicular network with the ultimate goal of increasing the possibility of using VANETs for safety applications...|$|R
50|$|The {{thalamus}} {{has multiple}} functions. It may {{be thought of}} as a kind of hub of information. It is generally believed to act as a relay between different subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. In particular, every sensory system (with the exception of the olfactory system) includes a thalamic nucleus that receives sensory signals and sends them to the associated primary cortical area. For the visual system, for example, inputs from the retina are sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn projects to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. The thalamus is believed to both process sensory information as well as relay it—each of the primary sensory <b>relay</b> <b>areas</b> receives strong feedback connections from the cerebral cortex.Similarly the medial geniculate nucleus acts as a key auditory relay between the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and the primary auditory cortex. The ventral posterior nucleus is a key somatosensory relay, which sends touch and proprioceptive information to the primary somatosensory cortex.|$|R

Nodes can be sleep {{to extend the}} lifespan of the network without compromising neither area coverage nor network connectivity. This paper addresses the area coverage problem with equal sensing and communicating radii. The goal is to minimize the number of active sensors involved in coverage task, while computing a connected set able to report to monitoring stations. Our solution is fully localized, and each sensor is able to make {{decision on whether to}} sleep or to be active based on two messages sent by each sensor. The first message is a “hello” message to gather position of all neighboring nodes. Then each node computes its own <b>relay</b> <b>area</b> dominating set, by taking the futhest neighbor as the first node, and then adding neighbors farthest to the isobarycenter of already selected neighbors, until the area covered by neighbors is fully covered. The second message broadcasts this relay set to neighbors. Each node decides to be active if it has highest priority among its neighbors or is a relay node for its neighbor with the highest priority.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} a subpopulation of neurons in the mouse parabrachial nucleus (PbN), a gustatory and visceral <b>relay</b> <b>area</b> in the brainstem, that project to the lateral hypothalamus (LH). We made injections of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (FG) into LH, resulting in fluorescent labeling of neurons located in {{different regions of}} the PbN. Mice were stimulated through an intraoral cannula with one of seven different taste stimuli, and PbN sections were processed for immunohistochemical detection of the immediate early gene c-Fos, which labels activated neurons. LH projection neurons were found in all PbN subnuclei, but in greater concentration in lateral subnuclei, including the dorsal lateral subnucleus (dl). Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) was observed in the PbN in a stimulus-dependent pattern, with the greatest differentiation between intraoral stimulation with sweet (0. 5 M sucrose) and bitter (0. 003 M quinine) compounds. In particular, sweet and umami-tasting stimuli evoked robust FLI in cells in the dl, whereas quinine evoked almost no FLI in cells in this subnucleus. Double-labeled cells were also found in the greatest quantity in the dl. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the dl contains direct a projection to the LH that is activated preferentially by appetitive compounds; this projection may be mediated by taste and/or postingestive mechanisms...|$|R

In anaesthetized spinalized rats electrical stimulation of RVLM elevated rCBF (laser-Döppler flowmetry) by 31 ± 6 %, reduced cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) by 26 ± 8 %, and synchronized the EEG, increasing {{the power of the}} 5 – 6 Hz band by 98 ± 25 %. Stimulation of a contiguous caudal region, the medullary cerebral vasodilator area (MCVA), had comparable effects which, like responses of RVLM, were replicated by microinjection of L-glutamate (5 nmol, 20 nl). Microinjection of NaCN (300 pmol in 20 nl) elevated rCBF (17 ± 5 %) and synchronized the EEG from RVLM, but not MCVA, while nicotine (1. 2 nmol in 40 nl) increased rCBF by 13 ± 5 % and synchronized the EEG from MCVA. In intact rats nicotine lowered arterial pressure only from MCVA (101 ± 3 to 52 ± 9 mmHg). Bilateral electrolytic lesions of MCVA significantly reduced, by over 59 %, elevations in rCBF and, by 78 %, changes in EEG evoked from RVLM. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of RVLM did not affect responses from MCVA. Anterograde tracing with BDA demonstrated that RVLM and MCVA are interconnected. The MCVA is a nicotine-sensitive region of the medulla that relays signals elicited by excitation of oxygen-sensitive reticulospinal neurons in RVLM to reflexively elevate rCBF and slow the EEG as part of the oxygen-conserving (diving) reflex initiated in these neurons by hypoxia or ischaemia...|$|R

40|$|The {{ring dove}} (Streptopelia risoria) expresses a stereotyped {{breeding}} cycle {{and has been}} used extensively as a laboratory animal model for studies of avian parental behaviour. Studies were undertaken to identify brain regions of the ring dove involved in the exprcssion of these behaviours, and to determine the central nervous function of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin and the neuropeptide VIP in incubation behaviour. Quantitative 2 -deoxyglucose (2 DG) autoradiography {{at the onset of}} incubation revealed an increase in uptake in the nucleus preopticus medialis (POM), nucleus tuberis (NT) and nucleus ovoidalis (Ov). Quantitative 2 DG autoradiography at late incubation and following treatment with exogenous prolactin revealed a generalised increase in 2 D 0 uptake in all areas of the brain studied. This effect may be explained by the proliferation of glial cells in response to an increase in the metabolic requirements of neurones involved in the co-ordination and execution of behaviours associated with the breeding cycle. A quantitative analysis of prolactin binding sites at late incubation demonstrated an increase in binding in the NT and a decrease in binding in the nucleus preopticus anterior (POA). Increases in prolactin binding in the NT may control prolactin secretion by the anterior pituitary and may be influenced by the down-regulation of binding sites in the POA. Intracerebroventricular treatment with VIP antiserum following nest deprivation failed to inhibit the resumption of incubatory behaviour after nest replacement, but was found to decrease food consumption. A study of the neuronal bonnections of the POA and NT revealed connections between these two nuclei and visual and auditory <b>relay</b> <b>areas</b> of the brain. These studies demonstrate that the POA and NT are involved in the onset and continuation of incubation behaviour in the ring dove, and that VIP is not the centrally acting factor responsible for the expression of this behaviour...|$|R
