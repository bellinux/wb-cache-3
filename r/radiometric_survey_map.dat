40|$|The dataset {{for this}} article {{contains}} the measured activity concentration of radionuclides and gamma-radiation dose rate obtained from the <b>radiometric</b> <b>survey</b> in Ota, Ado-Odo Local Government Area, Ogun State, Nigeria. The data were manually collected in fifty (50) locations using the Super SPEC RS- 125 spectrometer for about three (3) weeks in January, 2017. The descriptive statistical {{analysis of the data}} were equally explored for possible statistical relationships. The field dataset is made available publicly for further extended analyses that can provide insights into the safety status of the study area from radiological health concerns. The dataset could also serve as a significant baseline radiometric data for future epidemiology researches and monitoring initiative in Ota and its environs.
