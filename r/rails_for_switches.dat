50|$|The string {{attachments}} {{are fixed}} {{and there is}} no tensioning system. The steel thermal expansion over the seasons is absorbed by the modification of the tension stress in the string.As such there are no junction gaps in the <b>rail</b> except <b>for</b> <b>switches,</b> which are built similarly to railway switches.According to inventors, the system can utilize the most direct possible route, but it is possible to create curves by using intermediate supports which locally replace the string with steel structures.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified Dickson converter to achieve wide input range capacitive DC-DC converters. Several implementations are carefully studied and compared, {{which shows that}} the folding Dickson converter is the best choice, {{not only for its}} reduced dynamic losses, but also for its very regular structure and operation. Folding is achieved by merging the terminals of two or more flying capacitors, creating one equivalent flying capacitor. In this design, a four stage folding Dickson converter is implemented to achieve four different voltage conversion ratios. A Bootstrapped Gate Boost Converter (BGBC) is proposed which uses a bootstrapping technique to generate a floating <b>rail</b> <b>for</b> the flying <b>switches,</b> whose terminal voltages vary by large amounts depending on input voltage and VCR. The inherent operation of the Dickson topology is used by copying the voltage of the flying capacitors on a grounded capacitor in one phase, which can then be used to generate a floating 1. 2 V in the second phase. The converter has been implemented in a 90 nm technology, achieving a maximum output power of 50 mW, peak efficiency of 76. 6 % in the 2 : 1 conversion mode, and an average efficiency above 60 % over the entire Vin and Pout range. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{passenger}} cars were each two stories in height, each story being divided lengthwise into nine separate compartments, {{each of which}} seated comfortably four passengers, thus providing seats for 72 passengers in each car. Each compartment had its own sliding door, and all the doors on the same floor of the car were connected by rods {{at the top and}} bottom with a lever in convenient reach of the brakeman, by whom the doors are all opened and closed simultaneously. The compartments were each four feet wide and five feet long, the seats facing each other. Only one rail of the old single track was used, as only one guide rail had been erected, except at the ends of the route, <b>for</b> <b>switching</b> purposes, but the width of the cars and motor was such that it only required the erection of another guide <b>rail,</b> <b>for</b> the utilizing of the other track rail, to form a regular double-track road of the Boynton pattern.|$|R
