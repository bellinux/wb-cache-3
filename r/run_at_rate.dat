40|$|This paper investigates {{estimating}} exact imaging transformations accurately, reliably and efficiently. It {{is shown}} that in certain common computer vision situations the transformation required {{can be defined}} by {{a small number of}} parameters. Search is only required over these parameters, and consequently the search algorithms to estimate the transformation can be <b>run</b> <b>at</b> frame <b>rate,</b> without sacrificing robustness or accuracy. Performance is superior to often used approximations to these transformations. Two examples are illustrated: planar panoramic mosaicing, and augmented reality. Both applications <b>run</b> <b>at</b> frame <b>rate</b> on standard desktop machines, such as an SGI Indy or a PC. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} an arm attached to a rotating disc that moves at a controlled uniform speed. Unlike the crank, {{the arm of the}} mechanism <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> a different <b>rate</b> than the disc. By having the disc <b>run</b> <b>at</b> a different <b>rate</b> than the attached arm, productivity increases because the amount of time needed for a cut is reduced. The design of this mechanism specializes in vector calculus and the physical aspects of kinematics (study of motion without the effects of forces) and dynamics (study of forces that affect motion).|$|R
5000|$|There are no {{commonly}} used imaging systems that <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>rates</b> higher than 30 frame/s but lower than 48 Hz, so 48 Hz or higher is {{the de facto}} standard for high motion. The effects of high motion can be reduced or negated by converter lag when NTSC video is converted to PAL, or vice versa (a particular problem for coverage of international sporting {{events such as the}} Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup, for example); however, more recent motion adaptive converters can minimize this. Showscan's research indicates that an average of 66.7 frames per second is the upper limit of what the human eye can perceive, and higher frame rates have no further effect, except in reducing flicker.

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} interior {{permanent magnet}} (IPM) synchronous machine {{is characterized by}} two torque components: the PM torque and the reluctance torque. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the torque components of such a machine. Both integral- and fractional-slot windings are analyzed. To this aim different machine geometries, e. g slot and pole combinations, are considered. The impact of stator winding and rotor poles on the torque mechanism is evaluated, focusing on the correlation of the rotor geometry and the preponderance of one of the two torque terms. The results confirm that the rotor anisotropy play a fundamental rule on the machine features. Then is has to be to maximized since the reluctance torque is still present and relevant even if a fractional-slot wingding is adopted. In addition, the two torque components are analyzed when the machine <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> <b>rated</b> torque, as well as under overload operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} MARS symmetric-key encryption algorithm {{which is a}} new block cipher submitted to NIST for consideration as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). MARS supports 128 -bit blocks and a variable key size. It is designed {{to take advantage of}} the powerful operations supported in today's computers, resulting in a much improved security/performance tradeoff over existing ciphers. Specifically, in MARS we use a unique combination of S-box lookups, multiplications and data-dependent rotations. MARS has a heterogeneous structure, with cryptographic core rounds that are wrapped by simpler mixing rounds. The cryptographic core rounds provide strong resistance to all known cryptanalytical attacks, while the mixing rounds provide good avalanche and offer very wide security margins to thwart new (yet unknown) attacks. Our C implementation of MARS <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> <b>rates</b> of 85 Mbit/sec on a 200 MHz PowerPC, and 65 Mbit/sec on a 200 MHz Pentium-Pro. The cryptographi [...] ...|$|R
