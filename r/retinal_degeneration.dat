25|$|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of {{inherited}} <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Affected {{individuals}} also experience <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> {{caused by}} excess iron. The changes result in small opaque spots {{and areas of}} atrophy {{around the edges of}} the retina. These abnormalities usually do not affect vision but can be observed during an eye examination.|$|E
25|$|Sudden {{acquired}} <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> (SARD) is {{a disease}} in dogs causing sudden blindness. It can occur in any breed. The cause is unknown, but possibly involves either autoimmune disease, a toxin, or Cushing's disease. Symptoms include sudden permanent blindness, dilated pupils, and loss of the pupillary light reflex.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This paper {{examined}} {{the role of}} apoptosis in human <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> including pathologic myopia, age-related macular <b>degeneration,</b> serous <b>retinal</b> detachment, retinal lattice, and paving stone degenerations. METHOD: Thirty-seven enucleated human eyes with 1 of the above-mentioned <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> were studied by histopathology and by TdT-mediated biotin-dUTP nicked-end labelling (TUNEL) technique. RESULTS: Tunnel labelling characteristic DNA fragmentation of apoptosis was observed in photoreceptor cells in 2 of the 4 eyes with pathologic myopia and in 4 of 16 eyes with age-related macular degeneration, 2 of which were exudative and 2 of which were atrophic. However, only a few scattered photoreceptor cells were labelled in 4 of 8 eyes with serous retinal detachment secondary to malignant melanoma of the choroid. Moreover, none of the photoreceptors cells in the 4 eyes with <b>retinal</b> lattice <b>degeneration</b> and 6 eyes with <b>retinal</b> paving stone <b>degeneration</b> were labelled. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis is 1 of the important pathways of photoreceptor cell degeneration in pathologic myopia and age-related macular degeneration...|$|R
25|$|Additionally, animal models {{suggest that}} the retinal pigment {{epithelium}} fails to phagocytose the outer rod segment discs that have been shed, leading to an accumulation of outer rod segment debris. In mice that are homozygous recessive for <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> mutation, rod photoreceptors stop developing and undergo degeneration before cellular maturation completes. A defect in cGMP-phosphodiesterase has also been documented; this leads to toxic levels of cGMP.|$|E
25|$|Cat food is {{food for}} {{consumption}} by cats. Cats have requirements for their specific dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency. The amino acid taurine, for example, which is found within meat, is degraded during processing, so synthetic taurine is normally added afterwards. Long-term taurine deficiency {{may result in}} <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> loss of vision, and cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|MPS I S, Scheie syndrome, is the mildest form of MPS I. Symptoms {{generally}} {{begin to}} appear after age 5, with diagnosis most commonly made after age 10. Children with Scheie syndrome have normal intelligence or may have mild learning disabilities; some may have psychiatric problems. Glaucoma, <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> and clouded corneas may significantly impair vision. Other problems include {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} or other nerve compression, stiff joints, claw hands and deformed feet, a short neck, and aortic valve disease. Some affected individuals also have obstructive airway disease and sleep apnea. Persons with Scheie syndrome can live into adulthood.|$|E
50|$|Defects in {{this gene}} are {{associated}} with both central and peripheral <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations.</b> Some of the various phenotypically different disorders are autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, progressive macular degeneration, macular dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa digenic.|$|R
40|$|Heritable <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> {{dramatically}} affect individuals {{across the}} lifespan. Heritable degenerations with onset in childhood or young adulthood, {{such as the}} ABCA 4 - associated maculopathies, generally obey Mendelian segregation and are attributable to mutations within a single gene. <b>Retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> with onset in late adulthood, such as age-related macular degeneration, are usually influenced by a complex constellation of genetic and environmental factors. This thesis applies several complementary, high-throughput genotyping platforms to identify relationships between specific heritable retinal phenotypes and genetic variation. This findings of this thesis will aid {{in the development of}} guidelines for inclusion in retinal gene therapy trials and help physicians refine their prognoses based on genetic information...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the retinal pigment {{epithelium}} gene encoding RPE 65 are a cause of the incurable early-onset recessive human <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> known as Leber congenital amaurosis. Rpe 65 -deficient mice, a model of Leber congenital amaurosis, have no rod photopigment and severely impaired rod physiology. We analyzed retinoid flow in this model and then intervened by using oral 9 -cis-retinal, attempting to bypass the biochemical block caused by the genetic abnormality. Within 48 h, there was formation of rod photopigment and dramatic improvement in rod physiology, thus demonstrating that mechanism-based pharmacological intervention {{has the potential to}} restore vision in otherwise incurable genetic <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations...</b>|$|R
25|$|Mohini was {{checked for}} Chédiak-Higashi {{syndrome}} in 1960, {{but the results}} were inconclusive. This condition is similar to albino mutations and causes bluish lightening of the fur color, crossed eyes, and prolonged bleeding after surgery. Also, {{in the event of}} an injury, the blood is slow to coagulate. This condition has been observed in domestic cats, but there has never been a case of a white tiger having Chédiak-Higashi syndrome. There has been a single case of a white tiger having central <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> reported from the Milwaukee County Zoo, which could be related to reduced pigmentation in the eye. The white tiger in question was a male named Mota on loan from the Cincinnati Zoo.|$|E
25|$|Taurine is an {{essential}} dietary requirement for feline health, since house cats (and {{all members of the}} cat family) cannot synthesize the compound. The absence of taurine causes a cat's retina to slowly degenerate, causing eye problems and (eventually) irreversible blindness– a condition known as central <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration</b> (CRD), as well as hair loss and tooth decay. Decreased plasma taurine concentration has been demonstrated to be associated with feline dilated cardiomyopathy. Unlike CRD, the condition is reversible with supplementation. Taurine is now a requirement of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and any dry or wet food product labeled approved by the AAFCO should have a minimum of 0.1% taurine in dry food and 0.2% in wet food.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} genes that, when mutated, {{can cause the}} retinitis pigmentosa phenotype. Inheritance patterns of RP {{have been identified as}} autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and maternally (mitochondrially) acquired, and are dependent on the specific RP gene mutations present in the parental generation. In 1989, a mutation of the gene for rhodopsin, a pigment that plays an essential part in the visual transduction cascade enabling vision in low-light conditions, was identified. The rhodopsin gene encodes a principal protein of photoreceptor outer segments. Mutations in this gene most commonly presents as missense mutations or misfolding of the rhodopsin protein, and most frequently follow autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. Since the discovery of the rhodopsin gene, more than 100 RHO mutations have been identified, accounting for 15% of all types of <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> and approximately 25% of autosomal dominant forms of RP.|$|E

40|$|Photoreceptor degenerations {{initiated}} in rods or the retinal pigmented epithelium usually evoke secondary cone death and sensory deafferentation {{of the surviving}} neural retina. In the mature central nervous system, deafferentation evokes atrophy and connective re-patterning. It has been assumed that the neural retina does not remodel, {{and that it is}} a passive survivor. Screening of advanced stages of human and rodent <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> with computational molecular phenotyping has exposed a prolonged period of aggressive negative remodeling in which neurons migrate along aberrant glial columns and seals, restructuring the adult neural retina (1). Many neurons die, but survivors rewire the remnant inner plexiform layer (IPL), forming thousands of novel ectopic microneuromas in the remnant inner nuclear layer (INL). Bipolar and amacrine cells engage in new circuits that are most likely corruptive. Remodeling in human and rodent retinas emerges regardless of the molecular defects that initially trigger <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations.</b> Although remodeling may constrain therapeutic intervals for molecular, cellular, or bionic rescue, the exposure of intrinsic retinal remodeling by the removal of sensory control in <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> suggests that neuronal organization in the normal retina may be more plastic than previously believed.

40|$|Two {{patients}} with retinitis pigmentosa and glomerulonephritis are described. The patients were unrelated and had identical renal lesions, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. This {{may not be}} a chance association, and simple dip-stick urine analysis in {{patients with}} primary <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> may lead to earlier identification of renal disease...|$|R
25|$|Visual {{field and}} acuity tests measure {{and compare the}} size of the patient's field of vision and the clarity of their visual {{perception}} with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal pigment epithelium physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E
2500|$|Eye {{diseases}} {{are common in}} dogs. [...] Cataracts, canine glaucoma, and entropion are seen in dogs. [...] Canine-specific eye diseases include progressive retinal atrophy, Collie eye anomaly, sudden acquired <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration,</b> and cherry eye. [...] Injury to the eye can result in corneal ulcers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{looking at}} an animal model, the opsin {{transgene}} contains a truncated protein lacking the last 15 amino acids of the C terminus, which causes alteration in rhodopsin transport [...] to the outer segment and leads to <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration.</b> When the AAV2-CBA-GDNF vector is administered to the subretinal space, photoreceptor stabilized and rod photoreceptors increased and this {{was seen in the}} improved function of the ERG analysis. [...] Successful experiments in animals have also been carried out using ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and CNTF is currently being used as a treatment in human clinical trials.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} {{the role of}} EYS, a recently identified retinal disease gene, in families with inherited <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> in the Israeli and Palestinian populations. METHODS: Clinical and molecular analyses included family history, ocular examination, full-field electroretinography (ERG), perimetry, autozygosity mapping, mutation detection, and estimation of mutation age. RESULTS: Autozygosity mapping was performed in 171 consanguineous Israeli and Palestinian families with inherited <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations.</b> Large homozygous regions, harboring the EYS gene, were identified in 15 of the families. EYS mutation analysis in the 15 index cases, followed by genotyping of specific mutations in an additional 121 cases of inherited <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations,</b> revealed five novel null mutations, {{two of which are}} founder mutations, in 10 Israeli and Palestinian families with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). The most common mutation identified was a founder mutation in the Moroccan Jewish subpopulation. The ESTIAGE program produced an estimate that the age of the most recent common ancestor was 26 generations. The retinal phenotype in most patients was typical yet relatively severe RP, with an early age of onset and nonrecordable ERGs on presentation. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that EYS is currently the most commonly mutated arRP gene in the Israeli population, mainly due to founder mutations. EYS mutations were associated with an RP phenotype in all patients. The authors concluded that the gene plays only a minor role in causing other retinal phenotypes...|$|R
5000|$|Retinitis pigmentosa is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder, which affects 1 in 3,000 individuals [...] and affects between 50000 and 100000 {{people in the}} United States.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the use of}} stem cells (SCs) for regeneration of <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations.</b> Regenerative medicine intends to provide therapies for severe injuries or chronic diseases where endogenous repair does not sufficiently restore the tissue. Pluripotent SCs, with their capacity to give rise to specialized cells, are the most promising candidates for clinical application. Despite encouraging results, a combination with up-to-date tissue engineering might be critical for ultimate success. DESIGN: The {{focus is on the}} use of SCs for regeneration of <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations.</b> Cell populations include embryonic, neural, and bone marrow-derived SCs, and engineered grafts will also be described. RESULTS: Experimental approaches have successfully replaced damaged photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium using endogenous and exogenous SCs. CONCLUSIONS: Stem cells have the potential to significantly impact retinal regeneration. A combination with bioengineering may bear even greater promise. However, ethical and scientific issues have yet to be solved...|$|R
2500|$|Until recently, {{the medical}} {{literature}} did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders; however, genetic syndromes and genetic diseases are now being found to be related. [...] As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorders. [...] This emerging class of diseases are called ciliopathies. [...] The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell organelles, which are present in many cellular types throughout the human body. [...] The cilia defects adversely affect [...] "numerous critical developmental signaling pathways" [...] essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. [...] Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alstrom syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome and some forms of <b>retinal</b> <b>degeneration.</b> [...] It {{has been suggested that}} juvenile myoclonic epilepsy may be a ciliopathy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> {{encompass}} a {{large number}} of diseases in which the retina and associated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells progressively degenerate leading to severe visual disorders or blindness. <b>Retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> can be divided into two groups, a group in which the defect has been linked to a specific gene and a second group that has a complex etiology that includes environmental and genetic influences. The first group encompasses a number of relatively rare diseases with the most prevalent being Retinitis pigmentosa that affects approximately 1 million individuals worldwide. Attempts have been made to correct the defective gene by transfecting the appropriate cells with the wild-type gene and while these attempts have been successful in animal models, human gene therapy for these inherited <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> has only begun recently and the results are promising. To the second group belong glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). These <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations</b> have a genetic component since they occur more often in families with affected probands but they are also linked to environmental factors, specifically elevated intraocular pressure, age and high blood sugar levels respectively. The economic and medical impact of these three diseases can be assessed by the number of individuals affected; AMD affects over 30 million, DR over 40 million and glaucoma over 65 million individuals worldwide. The basic defect in these diseases appears to be the relative lack of a neurogenic environment; the neovascularization that often accompanies these diseases has suggested that a decrease in pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), at least in part, may be responsible for the neurodegeneration since PEDF is not only an effective neurogenic and neuroprotective agent but also a potent inhibitor of neovascularization. In the last few years inhibitors of vascularization, especially antibodies against vascular endothelial cell growth factors (VEGF), have been used to prevent the neovascularization that accompanies AMD and DR resulting in the amelioration of vision in a significant number of patients. In animal models {{it has been shown that}} transfection of RPE cells with the gene for PEDF and other growth factors can prevent or slow degeneration. A limited number of studies in humans have also shown that transfection of RPE cells in vivo with the gene for PEDF is effective in preventing degeneration and restore vision. Most of these studies have used virally mediated gene delivery with all its accompanying side effects and have not been widely used. New techniques using non-viral protocols that allow efficient delivery and permanent integration of the transgene into the host cell genome offer novel opportunities for effective treatment of <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Dystrophies and Progressive Retinal Atrophies PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} a novel early onset canine retinal disease, {{and evaluate}} the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene ABCA 4 as a potential candidate gene in this and other canine <b>retinal</b> <b>degenerations.</b> METHODS: <b>Retinal</b> disease was characterized ophthalmoscopically and electroretinographically in two pit bull terrier dogs and their purpose-bred descendants.

40|$|<b>Retinal</b> <b>degenerations,</b> {{regardless}} of the initiating event or gene defect, often result {{in a loss of}} photoreceptors. This formal deafferentation of the neural retina eliminates the intrinsic glutamatergic drive of the sensory retina and, perhaps more importantly, removes coordinated Ca CC-coupled signaling to the neural retina. As in other central nervous system degenerations, deafferentation activates remodeling. Neuronal remodeling is the common fate of all photoreceptor degenerations...|$|R
