40|$|Here we {{consider}} two phenomena {{in the vicinity}} of a black hole deformed by the tidal gravitational force of surrounding matter and by a strong magnetic field: equatorial motion of charged particles and the decay of a test scalar field. We were able to analyze both phenomena with analytical and simple numerical tools, which was unexpected given the low symmetry of the system. We show that both the tidal gravitational force and the magnetic field strongly enhance the release of the binding energy for the matter spiralling into the black hole. In the presence of the magnetic field, the left and <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> <b>rotations</b> of charged particles are not equivalent and for sufficiently large $|q| B$ there are stable anti-Larmor orbits very close to the event horizon, although Larmor orbits are only stable at some distance from the black hole. The larger the tidal force, the closer the innermost stable orbit to the black hole for both types of rotation. It was also shown that the real oscillation frequencies of the characteristic quasinormal modes are considerably suppressed by the tidal force.

40|$|International audienceHere we {{investigated}} how the tactile modality is used along with muscle proprioception in hand movement perception, whether these two sensory inputs are centrally integrated {{and whether they}} work complementarily or concurrently. The illusory <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rotations</b> induced in eleven volunteers by a textured disk scrolling under their hand in two directions at three velocities and/or by mechanical vibration applied to their wrist muscles at three frequencies were compared. The kinesthetic illusions were copied by the subjects on-line with their left hand. Results: 1) in all the subjects, tactile stimulation alone induced an illusory <b>hand</b> <b>rotation</b> {{in the opposite direction}} to that of the disk, and the velocity of the illusion increased non-linearly with the disk velocity: the highest gain (the illusion velocity to disk velocity ratio) occurred at the slowest disk rotation; 2) adding a consistent proprioceptive stimulus increased the perceptual effects, whereas adding a conflicting proprioceptive stimulus of increasing frequency gradually decreased the tactile illusions and reversed their initial direction; 3) under both consistent and conflicting conditions, only strong proprioceptive stimulation significantly affected the gain of the resulting illusions, whereas the largest gain always occurred at low tactile stimulation levels when the illusory movements were {{in the same direction as}} the tactile-induced illusion. Tactile information may equal or even override muscle proprioceptive information in the perception of relatively small, slow hand movements. These two somatosensory inputs may be integrated complementarily, depending on their respective relevance to the task of accurately perceiving one's own hand movements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

During further tests {{it was decided to}} introduce considerable dihedral at the wingtips to improve stability, but the H.231.01 which followed in May 1938 had dihedral increased over the whole wing span, and the unusual wingtip arrangement of the modified H.230 was eliminated.

The Hanriot H.232.01 had a single fin and rudder and was equipped with twin [...] Renault 6Q-02/03, (left and <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> propeller <b>rotation),</b> engines plus retractable landing gear. The H.232.02, which made its maiden flight in August 1938, introduced a redesigned cockpit. The aircraft was tested between October 1938 and May 1939.

40|$|For the fermion {{transformation}} in the space all books of quantum mechanics propose to use the unitary operator $\widehat{U}_{\vec n}(\varphi) =\exp{(-i\frac\varphi 2 (\widehat\sigma\cdot\vec n)) }$, where $\varphi$ is angle of rotation around the axis $\vec{n}$. But this operator turns the spin in inverse direction presenting the rotation to the left. The error of defining of $\widehat{U}_{\vec n}(\varphi) $ action is caused because the spin supposed as simple vector which is independent from $\widehat\sigma$-operator a priori. In this work it is shown that each fermion marked by number $i$ has own Pauli-vector $\widehat\sigma_i$ {{and both of them}} change together. If we suppose the global $\widehat\sigma$-operator and using the Bloch Sphere approach define for all fermions the common quantization axis $z$ the spin transformation will be the same: the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rotation</b> around the axis $\vec{n}$ is performed by the operator $\widehat{U}^+_{\vec n}(\varphi) =\exp{(+i\frac\varphi 2 (\widehat\sigma\cdot\vec n)) }$.

40|$|Turbulent flow {{characteristics}} and heat transfer performances of twisted tri-lobed tube (TIT) and twisted oval tube (TOT) with Reynolds number of 8000 - 21, 000 are experimentally compared {{in this research}} work, indicating that ITT provides better heat transfer performance and higher friction factor than TOT. Furthermore, numerical investigation {{of the influence of}} different geometrical parameters on heat transfer performance and {{flow characteristics}} for different twisted spiral tubes using computation fluid dynamics with a validated SST k-omega turbulence model is conducted. These geometrical parameters include different cross section shapes, twisted pitches, twisted direction and lobed numbers. The numerical result reveals that the tubes with larger diameters of out-scribed circle (D- 2) offer higher Nusselt number and friction factor. It is noted that the heat transfer performance and friction factor increase with the reduction of twisted pitch length P. It is also found that twisted tube with right-left hand rotation shows better heat transfer performance than the tube with <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>rotation.</b> In order to understand the heat transfer mechanism of the TTTs, streamlines, velocity and temperature distributions are also given. From the analysis it can be concluded that the heat transfer enhancement of ITTs is attributed to the helical flow and secondary flow induced by twisted curved tube wall. Radial velocity and tangential velocity are generated by centrifugal forces, leading to higher temperature gradients near the wall of lobed region inside twisted tube. Then the field synergy degree between velocity vector and temperature gradient is improved and the heat transfer is enhanced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The TMS-mapped {{representations}} of two intrinsic hand muscles, abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM), were quantified using a {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) mapping technique in 10 <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> and 6 left handed subjects. A 50 mm diameter figure eight coil was used. Stimulus sites were located using a latitude/longitude based coordinate system, stimulus intensity was threshold-adjusted and stimuli were applied during controlled low-level (10 %) voluntary contraction of the target muscles. Maps of the corticomotor representation were generated by fitting a continuously defined three dimensional function to the data obtained from stimulation at specific scalp sites, and projecting this function onto a two dimensional surface using a radial projection. It {{was found that the}} mapped {{representations of}} APB and ADM were large and overlapping but that there was a statistically significant separation of the two areas, the APB area being more laterally placed than the ADM area. The TMS-mapped representations of the two muscles showed no significant interhemispheric differences and were similar in left and <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> subjects. <b>Rotation</b> of the magnetic coil through 90 degrees resulted in medial shift and elongation of the TMS-mapped representations but there was no change in the relative positions of the two areas. The TMS-mapped representations were found to be very reproducible when mapping was repeated after intervals of up to 181 days. The present technique of TMS mapping allows the representation of individual hand muscles in the primary motor cortex to be reliably and reproducibly mapped and should prove useful for further studies of the physiology and pathophysiology of the motor cortex in man...|$|R
40|$|<b>Right</b> <b>Handed</b> (RH) <b>rotations</b> are not {{observable}} in {{the standard}} model (SM). The freedom is used to give the phenomenologically correct mass matrices all kind of different forms {{and this is one}} of the reasons for the proliferation of models for the fermionic masses. The SM must be however extended and in most extensions, RH currents appear at higher energy scales. At those energies the RH rotations are not irrelevant any more, they can affect neutrino oscillations, proton decay, baryon assymetry, R-parity violating interactions etc. We study possible implications of large RH mixing in GUTs. Those are interesting not only because large mixing induce large effects. They are intimately related to large lepton mixing in GUTs, via a relation between LH mixing of the leptons and the RH ones of the d-quarks,("d - ℓ duality") and can change considerably the branching ratios of proton decay. Observation of proton decay channels as well as neutrino oscillations will teach us about RH rotations and will reduce, therefore, considerably the freedom in the fermionic mass matrices. Some interesting examples are studied in detail. In particular a new E_ 6 model which realizes naturally a d - ℓ duality by mixing with exotic E_ 6 fermions.
