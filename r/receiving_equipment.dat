5|$|The U.S. Weather Bureau {{office was}} moved to 2nd floor of the {{original}} Boise Air Terminal Building at Gowen Field on December 19, 1939. All operations at the U.S. Federal building and the old Boise Airport were transferred to the new office by February 20, 1940. In addition to the surface weather observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, Radiosonde observations which began September 1, 1939 at the downtown airport, were moved to a small building north of the Boise terminal building at Gowen Field in 1940. A new balloon inflation building was built east of the terminal in October 1954 with a dome on top to hold the signal <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment.</b> The building {{was moved to}} the NIFC campus in August 1969 where it is still being used today. The temperatures and precipitation were taken near the airport terminal building through 1969 though they were moved periodically to accommodate the growing airport. The wind instrument was moved several times through 1969 {{from the top of the}} United Hanger to the top of the terminal building to field northwest of the runway. The office remained on the 2nd floor of the terminal building until June 1969.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} {{analogue}} signals had terminated, older <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment</b> {{was likely to}} require replacement or upgrade. This process was subsidised by the UK Government for those on low incomes. Contracts for this operation were awarded to BSkyB in the Border Television region. Upgrading of analogue <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment</b> required a Freeview set-top box (or other DVB-T capable digital receiver). Where an analogue TV recording device was in use this ideally would require a separate Freeview set-top box, to replicate the previous functionality of recording and watching different programme sources.|$|E

25|$|Flight testing {{began in}} May 1948 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, {{and was so}} {{successful}} that in June orders went out to equip all new B-50s and subsequent bombers with <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment.</b> Two dedicated air refueling units were formed on June 30, 1948: the 43d Air Refueling Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, and the 509th Air Refueling Squadron at Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico. The first ARS aircraft used FRL's looped-hose refueling system, but testing with a boom system followed quickly {{in the autumn of}} 1948.|$|E
25|$|Inspectors, who are An Post employees, {{visit the}} {{premises}} to verify if TV <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment</b> is present. If speedy payment of the licence {{is not made}} following an inspection, court proceedings are commenced by An Post. In 2002, the rate of licence-fee evasion was estimated at 12%. In the Dublin region in that year, approximately 21% of detected evaders were summonsed for prosecution (6,000 cases); approximately one third of these cases resulted in fines, averaging €174. Only 4% of fined evaders followed up three months later had purchased a licence. In 2012, there were 11,500 prosecutions, up 10% over 2011. Of those convicted, 242 were sent to jail, most for a few hours, six overnight. This compared with 49 jailed in 2008.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} of press publicity, leaflet drops, public {{meetings}} etc., captions started appearing on analogue broadcasts from the affected transmitters, warning viewers that the analogue service would shortly be switched off {{and that they would}} need to take action (for Whitehaven, the first large area to switch over, the captions started appearing some 5 months before the BBC Two analogue service was switched off). At about the same time, details of the Switchover Help Scheme were distributed. Although viewers who live outside existing Freeview reception areas were unable to test any digital <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment</b> they had bought at this early stage, test-screens on Ceefax (BBC One & Two) and Teletext (ITV & C4/S4C) page 284 made it possible to determine whether they were likely to need a new aerial or a signal amplifier to receive digital transmissions.|$|E

The theatre serves a dual purpose as the {{permanent}} home of a professional repertory company and a venue for visiting performers and festivals. It replaced the Century Theatre or [...] "Blue Box", which had spent 25 years in semi-retirement on a permanent lakeside site in Keswick, after a career of similar length as a mobile theatre.

500|$|WWV's {{primary purpose}} today (and {{for most of}} its existence) is to {{disseminate}} the [...] "official U.S. time" [...] (provided by government entities such as NIST and USNO) to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world. The time signals generated by WWV allow time-keeping devices such as radio-controlled clocks to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment. These time signals are used by commercial and institutional interests where accuracy is essential and time plays a vital role in daily operations - these include shipping, transport, technology, research, education, military, public safety and telecommunications. It is of particular importance in broadcasting, whether it be commercial, public, or private interests such as amateur radio operators. WWV provides a public service by making time information readily available at all hours and at no monetary charge (other than the cost of the <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment</b> itself).|$|E

500|$|In 1922, the {{publication}} Radio World {{stated that the}} cable's {{first two years of}} operation had been successful. [...] Also in 1922, Radio Broadcast boasted about the money saved by the cable as well as the ease of using it. [...] The cable itself was paid for using public funds, but it was the responsibility of ship owners to outfit their vessels with <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment.</b> Installation of the cable cost roughly $50,000 and the listening apparatus installed on each ship using the channel cost $1,200, compared with hourly costs of delays that ranged from $500 to $4,000. [...] Radio Broadcast expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft: [...] "...there is a future for the audio cable... Its fullest usefulness at American ports and elsewhere waits, however, on that large appreciation of radio devices for sea as well as air navigation which pilots, both on the sea and in the air, expect, but do not as yet demand." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{successful}} tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The minelayer Ord laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and armored cable, 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable. [...] The USS O'Brien was fitted with <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment</b> {{and attempted to}} follow the cable out of the Channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where {{a break in the}} cable prevented the signal from continuing. [...] The break in the cable was repaired, but {{over the course of the}} winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable. [...] Going back to the drawing board, engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable. [...] The Navy ordered 87,000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to proceed with}} the B.2 versions of the Vulcan was made in May 1956. It was anticipated that the first B.2 would be around the 45th aircraft of the 99 then on order. As well as being able to achieve greater heights over targets, it was believed that operational flexibility could be extended by the provision of in-flight refuelling equipment and tanker aircraft. The increasing sophistication of Soviet air defences required the fitting of electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment and vulnerability could be reduced by the introduction of the Avro Blue Steel stand-off missile, then in development. In order to develop these proposals, the second Vulcan prototype VX777 was rebuilt with the larger and thinner phase 2C wing, improved flying control surfaces and Olympus 102 engines, first flying in this configuration in August 1957. Plans were in hand to equip all Vulcans from the 16th aircraft onwards with in-flight refuelling <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment.</b> A B.1, XA903, was allocated for Blue Steel development work. [...] Other B.1s were used {{for the development of the}} BOl.6 (later Olympus 200), XA891; a new AC electrical system, XA893; and ECM including jammers within a bulged tail-cone and a tail warning radar, XA895.|$|E

500|$|The 46th {{production}} aircraft and first B.2, XH533, first flew in September 1958 fitted with Olympus 200 engines with [...] thrust, {{six months before}} the last B.1 XH532 was delivered in March 1959. Rebuilding B.1s as B.2s was considered but rejected over cost. Nevertheless, to extend the B.1's service life, 28 were upgraded by Armstrong Whitworth between 1959 and 1963 to the B.1A standard, including features of the B.2 such as ECM equipment, in-flight refuelling <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment,</b> and UHF radio. The second B.2, XH534, flew in January 1959. Powered by production Olympus 201 with [...] thrust, it was more representative of a {{production aircraft}}, being fitted with an in-flight refuelling probe and a bulged ECM tail cone. Some subsequent B.2s were initially lacking probes and ECM tail cones, but these were fitted retrospectively. The first 10 B.2s outwardly showed their B.1 ancestry, retaining narrow engine air intakes. Anticipating even more powerful engines, the air intakes were deepened on the 11th (XH557) and subsequent aircraft. Many of the early aircraft were retained for trials and it was the 12th B.2, XH558, that was the first to be delivered to the RAF in July 1960. Coincidentally, XH558 would also be the last Vulcan in service with the RAF, before being retired in 1992.|$|E

2500|$|As DAB {{requires}} {{digital signal}} processing techniques to convert from the received digitally encoded signal to the analogue audio content, {{the complexity of the}} electronic circuitry required to do this is higher. [...] This translates into needing more power to effect this conversion than compared to an analogue FM to audio conversion, meaning that portable <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment</b> will tend to have a shorter battery life, or require higher power (and hence more bulk). This means that they use more energy than analogue Band II VHF receivers. However, thanks to increased integration (radio-on-chip), DAB receiver power usage is getting closer to that of FM receivers. For example, NXP Semiconductors N.V. is producing both FM only and FM+DAB radio-on-chip, with similar power consumption.|$|E
