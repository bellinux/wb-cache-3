50|$|Small {{numbers of}} bighead {{spurdogs}} are caught incidentally by longliners fishing for <b>ruby</b> <b>snapper</b> (Etelis carbunculus) south of New Caledonia. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data {{to assess the}} conservation status of this species.|$|E
40|$|Previously {{unaccounted}} cryptic speciation requires revaluating species identification, {{particularly for}} fisheries assessment purposes. We describe a rapid and reliable method for distinguishing between phenotypically similar species that utilizes simple otolith morphometry (length, width, thickness and weight) {{with or without}} fish length, within a traditional canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). Data were subject to CDA in order to differentiate between the cryptic Etelis carbunculus (<b>ruby</b> <b>snapper)</b> and E. marshi (pygmy <b>ruby</b> <b>snapper).</b> A very high allocation success rate was achieved using otolith morphometry and fork length (99. 6 % for E. carbunculus and 100 % for E. marshi) or otolith morphometry only (98. 8 % for E. carbunculus and 100 % for E. marshi), which indicated the high discriminatory power of this method. The CDA successfully grouped samples {{of the same species}} collected from different locations in the eastern central Indian and South Pacific Oceans, indicating the robustness of this technique to discriminate between species, irrespective of their geographic range. This technique can be applied to archived otolith collections to confirm teleost species identification, and likely has broader applications for species identification involving extractive, diet or video-based studies...|$|E
40|$|The West Coast Inshore Demersal suite {{includes}} about 100 scalefish species {{which are}} caught {{by a number}} of different fisheries that operate in the West Coast Bioregion (WCB). The most important species of this suite are the West Australian Dhufish (Glaucosoma hebraicum) and Pink Snapper (Pagrus auratus). Substantial catches are also taken of other species from this suite, such as Red Throat Emperor (Lethrinus miniatus), Bight Redfish (Centroberyx gerrardi) and Baldchin Groper (Choerodon rubescens). The West Coast Offshore Demersal suite, which occurs in offshore waters (> 250 m), includes Eightbar Grouper Hyporthodus octofasciatus, Hapuku Polyprion oxygeneios, Blue-eye Trevalla Hyperoglyphe antarctica and <b>Ruby</b> <b>Snapper</b> Etelis carbunculus...|$|E
40|$|The West Coast Demersal Scalefish Fishery (WCDSF) {{includes}} mostly line-fishing operations by commercial, {{charter and}} recreational sectors. Up to about 100 species, {{mostly from the}} west coast inshore demersal scalefish suite, {{are caught in the}} fishery each year, with fishers in each sector primarily targeting West Australian Dhufish (Glaucosoma hebraicum) and Pink Snapper (Pagrus auratus). Substantial catches are also taken of other species in this suite, such as Baldchin Groper (Choerodon rubescens), Red Throat Emperor (Lethrinus miniatus) and Bight Redfish (Centroberyx gerrardi). A range of fish species is taken in offshore waters that belong to the west coast offshore demersal scalefish suite, including Eightbar Grouper Hyporthodus octofasciatus, Hapuku Polyprion oxygeneios, Blue-eye Trevalla Hyperoglyphe Antarctica and <b>Ruby</b> <b>Snapper</b> Etelis carbunculus...|$|E
40|$|The West Coast Demersal Scalefish Resource {{comprises}} inshore {{and offshore}} suites of demersal scalefish {{species that are}} exploited by different commercial fisheries and recreational and charter fishers that operate in the West Coast Bioregion (WCB). The West Coast Inshore Demersal suite occurs in waters 20 - 250 m deep with approximately 100 species of this suite caught by these fisheries. The most important species are the West Australian Dhufish (Glaucosoma hebraicum) and Pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) with other species captured including Redthroat Emperor (Lethrinus miniatus), Bight Redfish (Centroberyx gerrardi) and Baldchin Groper (Choerodon rubescens). The West Coast Offshore Demersal suite, which occurs in waters > 250 m deep, includes Eightbar Grouper Hyporthodus octofasciatus, Hapuku Polyprion oxygeneios, Blue-eye Trevalla Hyperoglyphe antarctica and <b>Ruby</b> <b>Snapper</b> Etelis carbunculus...|$|E
40|$|Deepwater {{tropical}} fisheries {{provide an}} important source of income and protein to Pacific and Indian Ocean coastal communities who are highly dependent on fish for food security. The development of quantitative assessments and management strategies for these deepwater fisheries has been hindered by insufficient biological and fisheries data. We examine the age-specific demography of the pygmy <b>ruby</b> <b>snapper</b> Etelis carbunculus, an important target species in tropical deepwater fisheries, across 90 ° of longitude and 20 ° of latitude in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Our results show that growth of E. carbunculus varies significantly between oceans and sexes and across latitudes in both oceans. Estimates of natural and fishing mortality were similar between oceans, but higher for females than males in both oceans. Evidence of greater fishing pressure on females than males is likely due to the larger size-at-age of females compared to males, assuming that selectivity of the fishing gear is related directly to fish size. Sex ratios were significantly female biased in both oceans despite this species being gonochoristic, and maturity schedules were similar between sexes in the Pacific Ocean. This species exhibits a protracted spawning season from mid-spring to autumn (i. e., October to May) in the Pacific Ocean. These results represent the first estimates of age-specific demographic parameters for E. carbunculus, and provide the foundation {{for the development of the}} first species-specific assessment models and harvest strategies for the species. Future stock assessment models for E. carbunculus should consider sex-specific demographic parameters and spatial variation in demography. Our results reveal substantial differences in biology between E. carbunculus and the giant <b>ruby</b> <b>snapper</b> E. sp., a cryptic congeneric species, and thus contribute to greater clarity in managing fisheries that are dependent on these two species. Furthermore, the improved information on the life history of E. carbunculus contributes to the broader sustainable management and improved food security for deepwater snapper fisheries in the Indo-Pacific region...|$|E
40|$|The Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery (WDTF) {{began in}} 1987 as an {{extension}} of the North West Slope Trawl Fishery (NWSTF) as operators extended their exploratory fishing for scampi and deepwater prawns. Following poor crustacean catches, the fishery evolved into a finfish trawl fishery of considerable species diversity (> 50 species; Moore et al. 2007 a). It is best classified as a byproduct/mixed fish species fishery due to the wide range of species taken in low volumes. In recent years, bugs have been targeted and now form the majority of the catch. According to logbooks, between a third and a half of the total catch is discarded. Of the discards, about a quarter is unidentified. The fishery is characterised by two distinct areas: north and south of 27 °S (Moore et al. 2007 a). The WDTF is open all year but operators generally have chosen to access the fishery on a part-time or opportunistic basis as an adjunct to other Commonwealth and State fisheries, particularly the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), and the Great Australian Bight Sector (GABTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). The Gross Value of Production (GVP) peaked at $ 2. 5 million in 2002 / 03 but has since declined dramatically in line with decreasing effort. The 2008 / 09 catch was from one fishing vessel and comprised only 28 t of <b>ruby</b> <b>snapper</b> and little else; the 2008 / 09 GVP was not disclosed because it was derived from less than five vessels (Wilson et al. 2010) ...|$|E
