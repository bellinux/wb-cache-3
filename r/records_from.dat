5|$|Because of its remote {{location}} and relative inaccessibility, climate records are poor. The nearest weather station, Potato Hill, {{has only been}} measuring precipitation since 1982 and temperatures since 1989. Temperature and precipitation <b>records</b> <b>from</b> Glenwood and Trout Lake, both considerably lower in elevation and farther from the mountain, are more complete and go back further, 1948 at Glenwood and 1924 at Trout Lake. Snowfall <b>records</b> <b>from</b> the three snow stations on Adams cover {{a number of years}} but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was monitored monthly from 1950-1976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor. It was upgraded in 1983 to report snow water equivalent and it was upgraded again in 2006 to report snow depth. The Council Pass station was monitored monthly from 1956-1978 and the Divide Meadow station was monitored monthly from 1962-1978. Divide Meadow was the most representative of the snow depth {{on the west side of}} Adams because it was the highest station on the flanks of the mountain.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, more {{administrative}} <b>records</b> <b>from</b> {{the period}} had become available to historians such as William Stubbs, Thomas Tout and J. C. Davies, who focused {{on the development of the}} English constitutional and governmental system during his reign. Although critical of what they regarded as Edward's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward II, which they perceived as positive developments. During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of <b>records</b> <b>from</b> the period in the last quarter of the 20th century. The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, John Maddicott and Seymour Phillips re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts. With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's early years, and Natalie Fryde's study of Edward's final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the King were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.|$|E
