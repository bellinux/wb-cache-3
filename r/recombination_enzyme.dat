A 2. 1 -kilobase-pair DNA fragment bearing the specific recombination site on the inverted repeats of pSR 1 was inserted at target sites on a single or two different chromosomes of S. cerevisiae by using integrative vectors. The cells were then transformed with a plasmid bearing the R gene of pSR 1, which encodes the site-specific <b>recombination</b> <b>enzyme</b> and is placed downstream of the GAL 1 promoter.

In bacteriophage λ vegetative recombination, Chi {{is fully}} active {{only when it}} is correctly {{oriented with respect to}} cos, the site that defines the ends of the packaged chromosome.

Our evidence suggests that correctly oriented cos is an activator of Chi. cos, as an activator, is (1) dominant over cos-, (2) active opposite an extensive heterology, (3) able to interact with Chi only when on the same (cis) chromosome, and (4) able to interact with Chi at distances as far as ≥ 20 kb.

Both contained a BA 3 -type minus {{origin of replication}} and an RSA-site, believed to constitute a site-specific recombination site. These two regions were more than 99 % homologous to the corresponding regions of the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB 110. Deleting the BA 3 -type minus origin resulted in the accumulation of {{a considerable amount of}} single-stranded DNA, both in L. lactis subsp. lactis and B. subtilis, indicating that this minus origin was functional in both bacterial species.

ScII {{and the other members}} of the emerging family of SMC 1 -like proteins are likely to be novel ATPases, with NTP-binding A and B sites separated by two lengthy regions predicted to form an alpha-helical coiled-coil. Analysis of the ScII B site predicted that ScII might use ATP by a mechanism similar to the bacterial recN DNA repair and <b>recombination</b> <b>enzyme.</b> ScII is a mitosis-specific scaffold protein that colocalizes with topoisomerase II in mitotic chromosomes.

40|$|Germline mis-sense {{mutations}} affecting {{a single}} BRCA 2 allele predispose humans to cancer. Here, we identify a protein-targeting mechanism disrupted by the cancer-associated mutation, BRCA 2 D 2723 H {{that controls the}} nuclear localization of BRCA 2 and its cargo, the <b>recombination</b> <b>enzyme</b> RAD 51. A nuclear export signal (NES) in BRCA 2 is masked by its interaction with a partner protein, DSS 1, such that point mutations impairing BRCA 2 -DSS 1 binding render BRCA 2 cytoplasmic. In turn, cytoplasmic mis-localization of mutant BRCA 2 inhibits the nuclear retention of RAD 51, by exposing a similar NES in RAD 51 usually obscured by the BRCA 2 -RAD 51 interaction. Thus, a series of NES-masking interactions localizes BRCA 2 and RAD 51 in the nucleus. Interestingly, BRCA 2 D 2723 H decreases RAD 51 nuclear retention even when wildtype BRCA 2 is present. Our findings suggest a mechanism for regulation of the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of BRCA 2 and RAD 51, and for its impairment by a heterozygous disease-associated mutation...|$|E

40|$|Cells {{carrying}} the thermosensitive nrdA 101 allele {{are able to}} replicate entire chromosomes at 42 °C when new DNA initiation events are inhibited. We investigated {{the role of the}} <b>recombination</b> <b>enzymes</b> on the progression of the DNA replication forks in the nrdA 101 mutant at 42 °C in the presence of rifampin. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), we demonstrated that the replication forks stalled and reversed during the replication progression under this restrictive condition. DNA labeling and flow cytometry experiments supported this finding as the deleterious effects found in the RecB-deficient background were suppressed specifically by the absence of RuvABC; however, this did not occur in a RecG-deficient background. Furthermore, we show that the RecA protein is absolutely required for DNA replication in the nrdA 101 mutant at restrictive temperature when the replication forks are reversed. The detrimental effect of the recA deletion is not related to the chromosomal degradation caused by the absence of RecA. The inhibition of DNA replication observed in the nrdA 101 recA mutant at 42 °C in the presence of rifampin was reverted by the presence of the wild-type RecA protein expressed ectopically but only partially suppressed by the RecA protein with an S 25 P mutation [RecA(S 25 P) ], deficient in the rescue of the stalled replication forks. We propose that RecA is required to maintain the integrity of the reversed forks in the nrdA 101 mutant under certain restrictive conditions, supporting the relationship between DNA replication and <b>recombination</b> <b>enzymes</b> through the stabilizatio...|$|R

In Escherichia coli mutants deficient for double-strand end processing, resolution of the HJ by RuvABC leads to fork breakage, a reaction that we can directly quantify. Here we used the HJ-specific resolvase RusA to test a putative role of the RuvAB helicase in replication fork reversal (RFR). We show that the RuvAB complex is required for the formation of a RusA substrate in the polymerase III mutants dnaEts and holD, affected for the Pol III catalytic subunit and clamp loader, and in the helicase mutant rep. This finding reveals that the <b>recombination</b> <b>enzyme</b> RuvAB targets forks in vivo and we propose that it directly converts forks into HJs. In contrast, RFR occurs in the absence of RuvAB in the dnaNts mutant, affected for the processivity clamp of Pol III, and in the priA mutant, defective for replication restart. This suggests alternative pathways of RFR...|$|E
40|$|In several well-characterized {{site-specific}} recombination systems {{it has been}} shown that, for efficient recombination, the two recombining sites must have identical DNA sequences across the region between the staggered points of exchange.

Our results indicate that identity of thfe two overlap regions is not sufficient for recombination. Although resolvase binds normally to the mutant site and induces the structural deformation characteristic of the wild-type recombination site, catalysis at the crossover point (cutting and rejoining of DNA strands) is effectively limited to just one of the two strands, allowing resolvase to act as a topoisomerase but not as a recombinational enzyme. © 1988 Nature Publishing Group...|$|E
40|$|With plant {{molecular}} biology entering the omics era, {{there is a}} need for simple cloning strategies that allow high throughput to systematically study the expression and function of large numbers of genes.

This induction of recombination was dependent on the presence of homology between the plasmid sequences and the chromosomes. We show evidence for the physical involvement of the plasmid in tripartite recombination events, and we propose models that can explain the interactions between the plasmid-borne and chromosomal-borne alleles. Our results suggest that the mitotic induction of recombination by DNA damage is due to localized initiation of recombination events, and not to a general induction of <b>recombination</b> <b>enzymes</b> in the cell...|$|R
40|$|Failure to {{stabilize}} and properly process stalled replication forks results in chromosome instability, {{which is a}} hallmark of cancer cells and several human genetic conditions that are characterized by cancer predisposition. Loss of WRN, a RecQ-like enzyme mutated in the cancer-prone disease Werner syndrome (WS), leads to rapid accumulation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen removal from chromatin upon DNA replication arrest. Knockdown of the MUS 81 endonuclease in WRN-deficient cells completely prevents the accumulation of DSBs after fork stalling. Also, MUS 81 knockdown in WS cells results in reduced chromatin recruitment of <b>recombination</b> <b>enzymes,</b> decreased yield of sister chromatid exchanges, and reduced survival after replication arrest. Thus, we provide novel evidence that WRN is required to avoid accumulation of DSBs and fork collapse after replication perturbation, and that prompt MUS 81 -dependent generation of DSBs is instrumental for recovery from hydroxyurea-mediated replication arrest under such pathological conditions...|$|R

A partial inhibition of Chi activation measured in A redgam mutant crosses was observed after treatment of wild-type cells with DNA-damaging agents including UV, mitomycin, and nalidixic acid. Inhibition of Chi activation was not {{accompanied by an}} overall decrease of recombination. A IexA 3 mutation which blocks induction of the SOS system prevented the inhibition of Chi activation, indicating that an SOS function could {{be responsible for the}} inhibition. Overproduction of the RecD subunit of the RecBCD enzyme from a multicopy plasmid carrying the recD gene prevented the induced inhibition of Chi activation, whereas overproduction of RecB or RecC subunits did not. It is proposed that in SOS-induced cells the RecBCD enzyme is modified into a Chi-independent <b>recombination</b> <b>enzyme,</b> with the RecD subunit being the regulatory switch key. The major pathway of homologous recombination in Esch-erichia coli relies on the RecA protein and the RecBCD enzyme (for reviews, see references 8 and 24).

We have used antibodies raised against the homologous human protein, HsRad 51, expressed in E. coli, to visualize the spatial distribution of the protein in mammalian somatic and meiotic cells. In cultured human cells, the HsRad 51 protein is concentrated in multiple discrete foci in the nucleoplasm; it is largely absent from cytoplasm and nucleoli. After treatment of cells with methyl methanesulfonate, ultraviolet irradiation, or 137 Cs irradiation, the percentage of cells with HsRad 51 protein immunofluorescence increases; the same cells show unscheduled DNA synthesis. Induction of Rad 51 foci is blocked by inhibitors of transcription. In mouse pachytene spermatocytes, the mouse homolog of Rad 51 protein is highly enriched in synaptonemal complexes that are formed between the paired homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. We conclude that the mammalian proteins homologous to yeast Rad 51 are involved in repair of DNA damage and recombinational repair during meiosis...|$|E

In the present study, the complete, unambiguous primary amino acid sequence of the peptide was obtained {{by a combination of}} both N-terminal sequencing of purified peptide and the complete sequence deduced from the structural gene harbored by plasmid I 4.

Coagulin and pediocin differed only by a single amino acid at their C terminus. Analysis of the genetic determinants revealed the presence, on the pI 4 DNA, of the entire 3. 5 -kb operon of four genes described for pediocin AcH and PA- 1 production. No extended homology was observed between pSMB 74 from P. acidilactici and pI 4 when analyzing the regions upstream and downstream of the operon.

In vivo studies have shown the mutagenicity of AAF and its derivatives in both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. N-AcO-AAF reacts in vitro with DNA leading mainly to the formation of a guanine adduct, N- 2 -(deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) -acetylaminofluorene (80 %) and to at least three minor adducts.

We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of Butyrivibrio plasmid pOM 1, which was isolated from B. fibrisolvens Bu 49. While it is very similar in size to the previously characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids pRJF 1 and pRJF 2, pOM 1 exhibits a restriction pattern which is quite distinct. Analysis of sequence data reveals that pOM 1 contains only two open reading frames of significant length (ORF 1 and ORF 2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. The protein encoded in ORF 1 shows homologies with Pre (plasmid <b>recombination</b> <b>enzyme)</b> proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The putative translation product of ORF 2, on the other hand, resembles Rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the Staphylococcus plasmid pSN 2 is a prototype. Unlike the other characterized-Butyrivibrio plasmids, pOM 1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. Experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pOM 1 has been used in {{the construction of a new}} Escherichia coli-B. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, pSMerm 1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into B. fibrisolvens harboring the pRJF 1 plasmid...|$|E

In recent years, fragment-based approaches have emerged as a new methodology in drug discovery; however, few examples of small molecules that are active against chemotherapeutic targets have been published. Herein, we describe the fragment-based approach of targeting the interaction between the tumour suppressor BRCA 2 and the <b>recombination</b> <b>enzyme</b> RAD 51; it makes use of a screening pipeline of biophysical techniques that we expect to be more generally applicable to similar targets. Disruption of this interaction in vivo is hypothesised to give rise to cellular hypersensitivity to radiation and genotoxic drugs. We have used protein engineering to create a monomeric form of RAD 51 by humanising a thermostable archaeal orthologue, RadA, and used this protein for fragment screening. The initial fragment hits were thoroughly validated biophysically by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR techniques and observed by X-ray crystallography to bind in a shallow surface pocket that is occupied in the native complex by the side chain of a phenylalanine from the conserved FxxA interaction motif found in BRCA 2.

We have used two complementary approaches to study {{the nature of the}} Tn 3 recombination region, res. Firstly, the DNA-binding sites for tnpR protein were determined in DNase I protection experiments. These identified a 120 -bp region between the tnpA and tnpR genes that can be subdivided into three separate protein-binding sites. Genetic dissection experiments indicate that few, if any, other sequences in addition to this 120 -bp region are required for res function. Moreover, we have shown that the two directly repeated res regions within a molecule are unequal partners in the recombination reaction: a truncated res region, which is unable to recombine with a second identical res region, can recombine efficiently with an intact res region. This demonstration, along with the observation that tnpR/res recombination acts efficiently on directly repeated res regions within a molecule but inefficiently both on inverted res regions in the same molecule and in the fusion reaction between res regions in different molecules, leads us to propose that one-dimensional diffusion (tracking) of tnpR protein along DNA is used to locate an initial res region, and then to bring a second directly repeated res region into a position that allows recombination between the res regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{unwinding}} of {{the parental}} DNA duplex during replication causes a positive linking number difference, or superhelical strain, {{to build up}} around the elongating replication fork. The branching at the fork and this strain bring about different conformations from that of (−) supercoiled DNA that is not being replicated. The replicating DNA can form (+) precatenanes, in which the daughter DNAs are intertwined, and (+) supercoils. Topoisomerases have the essential role of relieving the superhelical strain by removing these structures. Stalled replication forks of molecules with a (+) superhelical strain have the additional option of regressing, forming a four-way junction at the replication fork. This four-way junction can be acted on by <b>recombination</b> <b>enzymes</b> to restart replication. Replication and chromosome folding are made easier by topological domain barriers, which sequester the substrates for topoisomerases into defined and concentrated regions.

Hybridization analysis of DNA from 40 follicular lymphomas showed that the majority of t(14; 18) translocations occur on chromosome 18 DNA within 4. 2 kilobases of the cloned breakpoint. A DNA probe from this breakpoint-cluster region detects transcription products in the tumor cells from which it was cloned and in a B-lymphoma cell line containing a t(14; 18) translocation...|$|R
40|$|The hop 2 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{arrests in}} meiosis with {{extensive}} synaptonemal complex (SC) formation between nonhomologous chromosomes. A screen for multicopy suppressors of a hop 2 -ts allele identified the MND 1 gene. The mnd 1 -null mutant arrests in meiotic prophase, with most double-strand breaks (DSBs) unrepaired. A {{low level of}} mature recombinants is produced, and the Rad 51 protein accumulates at numerous foci along chromosomes. SC formation is incomplete, and homolog pairing is severely reduced. The Mnd 1 protein localizes to chromatin throughout meiotic prophase, and this localization requires Hop 2. Unlike <b>recombination</b> <b>enzymes</b> such as Rad 51, Mnd 1 localizes to chromosomes even in mutants that fail to initiate meiotic recombination. The Hop 2 and Mnd 1 proteins coimmunoprecipitate from meiotic cell extracts. These results suggest that Hop 2 and Mnd 1 work as a complex to promote meiotic chromosome pairing and DSB repair. The identification of Hop 2 and Mnd 1 homologs in other organisms suggests that the function of this complex is conserved among eukaryotes...|$|R
