5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in <b>refrigerated</b> trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be <b>refrigerated.</b> However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E

40|$|The {{cold air}} <b>refrigerating</b> {{machines}} are practically {{of the same}} age as the vaporisation-compression-type <b>refrigerating</b> machines, however, the former ones were put in actual operation only during the past decades. As the principal reason for it, their lower economi-cal efficiency can be considered. However, the vaporisation-compression-type <b>refrigerating</b> machines cause heavy pollution to the environment (gap of ozone layer problem), there-fore the interest in the cold air <b>refrigerating</b> machines has been greatly aroused lately. In the paper, the operation, theory and application possibilities of the cold air <b>refrigerating</b> machines are dealt with, especially considering the air- conditioning of motor vehicles. The improvement of the economy of cold air <b>refrigerating</b> machines is especially paid great attention in this paper. In addition, the possibilities of applying heat exchangers, as well as the cooling process of the operating-medium during compression with the help of liquid charge are examined...|$|R

5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly.

If <b>refrigerated</b> storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosperity}} of the stockyards was due to both the concentration of railroads {{and the evolution of}} <b>refrigerated</b> railroad cars. Its decline was due to further advances in post-World War II transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate trucking, made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards. At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.|$|E
