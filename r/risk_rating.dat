40|$|For all {{coal mining}} categories, data on coal mine fires during 1990 - 1999 have been {{reported}} as actual numbers and calculated values. 1. For each mining category, actual numbers include {{the total number of}} fires, fire injuries, employees' working hours, lost workdays, and coal production (for underground and surface mines only) for a 1 0 -year period (1 990 - 1999) and for five successive 2 -year periods with the 10 -year period. These numbers have also been reported by state (10 -year period). The actual number of fire fatalities has been reported by time period. Furthermore, actual numbers of fires for the five 2 -year periods {{have been reported}} by ignition source, method of detection and suppression, equipment involved, location, and burning material. Actual numbers of fire injuries per number of fires causing injuries and total fires have been reported by year, ignition source, equipment involved, and location. 2. For each mining category, the calculated values include the fire and injury <b>risk</b> <b>rates</b> during the 10 -year period and the five 2 -year periods. The fire <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> (Frr) values were calculated according to the USBM formula [Pornroy and Carigiet 19951. The injury <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> (Irr) values were calculated according to the MSHA formula [MSHA 1991 a, 1992, 1993, 1994 a, 1995 a, 1996, 1997, 1998 b, 1999 c, 20001. Also, <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> values for individual states (10 -year period) were calculated according to the above-mentioned formulas. Of note is that only the <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> values for the 10 -year and five 2 -year periods and <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> values for individual states with the highest number of fires and fue injuries were considered for comparison purposes. The fatality <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> values were not calculated because of the extremely small number of fire fatalities during the 1 0 -year period. 3. Calculations of <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> values are as follows: a. Fire <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> (Frr) value: Number of fires per million tons of coal produced [Pornroy and Carigiet 19951. b. Injury <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> (Irr) value: Number of fire injuries multiplied by 200, 000 working hours per total employees' working hours [MSHA 1991 a, l 992, 1993, 1994 a, 1995 a, 1996, 1997, 1998 b, 1999 c, 20001.

[...] The orange rating was the first the company had received, and {{was followed by a}} [...] "yellow" [...] medium <b>risk</b> <b>rating</b> the next August, which pertained to the factory where the fire occurred. On 25 November, a Walmart spokesman said he was [...] "so far unable to confirm that Tazreen is a supplier to Walmart nor if the document referenced in the article is in fact from Walmart"; the company subsequently terminated its relationship with Tazreen, stating that [...] "The Tazreen factory [...] was not authorized to produce merchandise for Walmart. A supplier subcontracted work to this factory without authorization and in direct violation of our policies." [...] Walmart critics claim that the company knew about unsafe conditions and blocked efforts to improve them. Documents found via email show that Walmart had subcontracted multiple clothing production orders through the Tazreen factory. According to The New York Times, Walmart {{played a significant role in}} blocking reforms to have retailers pay more for apparel in order to help Bangladesh factories improve their safety standards. Walmart director of ethical sourcing Sridevi Kalavakolanu asserted that the company would not agree to pay the higher cost, as such improvements in electrical and fire safety would be a [...] "very extensive and costly modification" [...] and that [...] "it is not financially feasible for the brands to make such investments." ...|$|E

40|$|Our primary {{objective}} was to estimate, by one year and five year intervals, maternal age specific <b>risk</b> <b>rates</b> for Down syndrome among whites and among other races from two different populations, metropolitan Atlanta and south west Ohio, using live birth and prenatally diagnosed cases ascertained during 1970 - 1989. The five year estimates were also calculated separately {{for each of the}} five four year periods during these 20 years. Additionally, we compared two different methods of estimating these <b>risk</b> <b>rates</b> by using a third population of whites, and compared two different statistical methods of smoothing the <b>risk</b> <b>rates.</b> The results indicate good agreement between the metropolitan Atlanta and south west Ohio estimates within races, but show a statistically significant difference between the two race categories. Because 86 % of live births in the "other races" category in the combined population are to blacks, these data may be seen as the first estimates of maternal age specific <b>risk</b> <b>rates</b> for Down syndrome among blacks calculated by one year intervals. We found excellent agreement in the <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> estimates among the five four year time periods, between the estimates obtained by using the two different methods of estimation, and between the estimates obtained using the two different methods of statistical smoothing. Our estimated <b>risk</b> <b>rates</b> for white women in their 20 s strongly reinforce those from previous studies currently being used for genetic counselling purposes. While we did find somewhat higher rates for women under 20, and increasingly higher rates for those over 30 years of age, these differences are not substantial. Thus, this study in general supports the <b>risk</b> <b>rates</b> estimated from data collected mostly during the 1960 s and 1970 s...|$|R

They were {{used to calculate the}} flood <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> with flood regulation of five key reservoirs, including the Meishan, Xianghongdian, Nianyushan, Mozitan, and Foziling reservoirs in the middle reach of the Huaihe River under different flood frequencies, the flood <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> with river course flood release under design and check floods for the trunk of the Huaihe River in conjunction with relevant flood storage areas, and the flood <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> with operation of the Linhuaigang Project under design and check floods. The calculated results show that (1) the five reservoirs can withstand design floods, but the Xianghongdian and Foziling reservoirs will suffer overtopping accidents under check floods; (2) considering the service of flood storage areas under the design flood conditions of the Huaihe River, the mean flood <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> with flood regulation of dykes and dams from Xixian to the Bengbu floodgate is about 0. 2, and the trunk of the Huaihe River can generally withstand design floods; and (3) under a check flood with the flood return period of 1 000 years, the <b>risk</b> <b>rate</b> of overtopping accidents of the Linhuaigang Project is not larger than 0. 15, indicating that it has a high flood regulation capacity.

To identify the factors literature was reviewed and to find the impact of them secondary data were collected from Nasdaq Dubai sukuk indices of the global sukuk market from 2005 to 2014 on a periodic monthly basis. Collected data were analyzed and found various factors namely interest <b>rate</b> <b>risk,</b> inflation <b>rate</b> <b>risk,</b> dollar <b>rate</b> <b>risk,</b> consumer confidence risk, maturity risk, credit risk, Shari‘ah compliance risk and liquidity risk.
