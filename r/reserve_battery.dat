25|$|By the First French Republic, {{artillery}} {{was recognized}} as one of the three main combat arms, alongside infantry and cavalry. During the Napoleonic era field artillery became the decisive element on many battlefields. At the crisis of the Battle of Wagram in 1809, Napoleon quickly formed a massed battery of 112 guns to fill a gap in his battle line. This stopped a dangerous Austrian attack in its tracks and helped to achieve victory. In 1800 French armies deployed about two artillery pieces per 1,000 soldiers. The ratio approached five guns per 1,000 by 1812 as the quality of French foot soldiers declined. Under Napoleon batteries usually included eight pieces and the 12-pounder was often employed in army and corps artillery reserves. A corps <b>reserve</b> <b>battery</b> often consisted of six 12-pounders and two howitzers. Another typical organization was four cannons and two howitzers. Napoleon lovingly called the 12-pounders his belles filles and increased their number. All field pieces had similar muzzle velocities but the 12-pounders had the greatest hitting power. They also made the most frightening sound when discharged. Another attribute was their greater range. Some 8-pounders were replaced in order to increase the proportion of 12-pounders. At the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 Napoleon had 600 artillery pieces or three guns per 1,000, but the victorious Allies used 900 guns on that field.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>reserve</b> <b>battery</b> can {{be stored}} unassembled (unactivated and {{supplying}} no power) {{for a long period}} (perhaps years). [...] When the battery is needed, then it is assembled (e.g., by adding electrolyte); once assembled, the battery is charged and ready to work. [...] For example, a battery for an electronic artillery fuze might be activated by the impact of firing a gun. The acceleration breaks a capsule of electrolyte that activates the battery and powers the fuze's circuits. Reserve batteries are usually designed for a short service life (seconds or minutes) after long storage (years). A water-activated battery for oceanographic instruments or military applications becomes activated on immersion in water.|$|E

2500|$|After {{arriving}} in Perth, Puckett took up playing baseball for the West Australian Press Club (generally known as simply [...] "Press"), effectively a sporting branch of his employer. The Sunday Times noted {{prior to the}} beginning of the season that Press would [...] "have as their pitcher Charlie Puckett, the outstanding baseballer in Australia". Puckett was selected to pitch for Western Australia at the 1938 Claxton Shield held in Perth, which marked the first occasion that the state would participate in the tournament. Although Western Australia was unsuccessful, he was awarded the Tom Smith Memorial Trophy as the best all-round player at the tournament, the third successive year he had won such an award in interstate competition. Continuing his form in the 1939 season, Puckett pitched a perfect game against Victoria Park, in one instance needing only ten pitched balls to strike out three batters. He once again was selected for the state team at the 1939 Claxton Shield, and at the tournament's end was selected as part of the <b>reserve</b> <b>battery</b> in an [...] "All-Australian" [...] teamâ€”the team was merely symbolic, and did not actually play any games. In the carnival, Puckett played a match against his younger brother, Jim, who was still based in South Australia. Local baseball competition was more subdued over the following years, owing to the war, and interstate competition was suspended until 1946. Puckett did not play at interstate level again, although he did play several games for a combined [...] "WA Army" [...] side against a United States Army side in 1942.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Reserve</b> <b>batteries</b> may be {{activated}} by addition of water, by adding electrolyte, by introducing a gas {{into the cell}} that is either the active cathode material {{or part of the}} electrolyte, or by heating a solid electrolyte to a temperature at which it becomes conductive. The missing element of the battery can be added before use in several ways. The battery can have water or electrolyte added manually, the battery can {{be activated}} when the system is dropped into the water (such as in a sonobuoy), or electrolyte can be stored in a capsule within the battery and released by mechanical means, an electrical trigger, or by spin or shock. A molten-electrolyte battery is activated by igniting a pyrotechnic heat source. The battery delivers current for a short time (seconds to a few minutes), but some thermal batteries can be stored ten years or more without deterioration. <b>Reserve</b> <b>batteries</b> remain uncommon in civilian applications because of their higher cost and relatively short life after activation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a micro power {{battery state of charge}} monitor. The novelty of this design lies in the extreme low power consumption and accurate prediction of the <b>battery</b> <b>reserve</b> time. The average current drawn is successfully limited to 60 ÂµA, which is significantly smaller than those in currently available devices. The proposed design predicts the <b>reserved</b> <b>battery</b> charge with an accuracy of 5 % under different discharge conditions. The automated learning scheme using software is utilized. Protection of the battery against excessive current drain and usage outside the specified temperature range is incorporated. This paper details the proposed technique adopted for power reduction. The battery temperature and current sensing circuits are normally in power down mode, they go into active mode for the microcontroller to take measurements. An ON/OFF ratio of 1 : 153 is achieved which results in power reduction by a factor of 59. 30. The average current requirement of the proposed design is reduced from 3302. 79 ÂµA to 55. 69 ÂµA with the adoption of power reduction approach. The proposed design has been tested on a NiMH, NiCd and Li-Ion battery packs and the experimental results confirm the utility of the proposed design 1.
