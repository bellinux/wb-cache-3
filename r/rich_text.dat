25|$|Opening a Word Document file in {{a version}} of Word {{other than the one}} with which it was created can cause {{incorrect}} display of the document. The document formats of the various versions change in subtle and not so subtle ways (such as changing the font, or the handling of more complex tasks like footnotes). Formatting created in newer versions does not always survive when viewed in older versions of the program, nearly always because that capability does not exist in the previous version. <b>Rich</b> <b>Text</b> Format (RTF), an early effort to create a format for interchanging formatted text between applications, is an optional format for Word that retains most formatting and all content of the original document.|$|E
25|$|The main, and obvious, {{advantage}} of consensus logos over sequence logos is {{their ability to}} be embedded as text in any <b>Rich</b> <b>Text</b> Format supporting editor/viewer and, therefore, in scientific manuscripts. As described above, the consensus logo is a cross between sequence logos and consensus sequences. As a result, compared to a sequence logo, the consensus logo omits information (the relative contribution of each character to the conservation of that position in the motif/alignment). Hence, a sequence logo should be used preferentially whenever possible. That being said, the need to include graphic figures in order to display sequence logos has perpetuated the use of consensus sequences in scientific manuscripts, even though they fail to convey information on both conservation and frequency. Consensus logos represent therefore an improvement over consensus sequences whenever motif/alignment information has to be constrained to text.|$|E
25|$|The second {{release of}} Word for Mac OS, shipped in 1987, was named Word 3.0 to {{synchronize}} its version number with Word for DOS; this was Microsoft's {{first attempt to}} synchronize version numbers across platforms.

Within a few months, Word 3.0 was superseded by a more stable Word 3.01, which was mailed free to all registered users of 3.0. After MacWrite Pro was discontinued in the mid-1990s, Word for Mac OS never had any serious rivals. Word 5.1 for Mac OS, released in 1992, was a very popular word processor owing to its elegance, relative ease of use and feature set.

25|$|So {{rather than}} treat {{the issue as}} a <b>rich</b> <b>text</b> problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of {{variation}} selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but {{also in terms of}} underlying meaning {{as in the case of}} a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.|$|E

2500|$|For a {{grapheme}} to {{be represented}} by various glyphs means that the grapheme has glyph variations that are usually determined by selecting one font or another or using glyph substitution features where multiple glyphs are included in a single font. Such glyph variations are considered by Unicode a feature of <b>rich</b> <b>text</b> protocols and not properly handled by the plain text goals of Unicode. However, when the change from one glyph to another constitutes a change from one grapheme to another—where a glyph cannot possibly still, for example, mean the same grapheme understood as the small letter [...] "a"—Unicode separates those into separate code points. For Unihan {{the same thing is}} done whenever the abstract meaning changes, however rather than speaking of the abstract meaning of a grapheme (the letter [...] "a"), the unification of Han ideographs assigns a new code point for each different meaning—even if that meaning is expressed by distinct graphemes in different languages. Although a grapheme such as [...] "ö" [...] might mean something different in English (as used in the word [...] "coördinated") than it does in German, it is still the same grapheme and can be easily unified so that English and German can share a common abstract Latin writing system (along with Latin itself). This example also points to another reason that [...] "abstract character" [...] and grapheme as an abstract unit in a written language do not necessarily map one-to-one. In English the combining diaeresis, [...] "¨", [...] and the [...] "o" [...] it modifies may be seen as two separate graphemes, whereas in languages such as Swedish, the letter [...] "ö" [...] may be seen as a single grapheme. Similarly in English the dot on an [...] "i" [...] is understood {{as a part of the}} [...] "i" [...] grapheme whereas in other languages, such as Turkish, the dot may be seen as a separate grapheme added to the dotless [...] "ı".|$|E
