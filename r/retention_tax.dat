40|$|Subnational fiscal autonomy-the {{basis for}} fiscal {{federalism}} in modern federations-is meant to serve two roles. First, local control over revenue collection is meantto provide {{a check on}} the capacity of central authorities to tax arbitrarily local capital. Second, <b>retention</b> of <b>taxes</b> raised locally is meant to establish incentives for subnational governmental authorities to foster endemic economic growth as a way of promoting local tax bases. But in the Russian Federation, fiscally autonomous regions have often resisted market-oriented reforms, the enactment of rules protecting private property, and the dismantling of price controls and barriers to trade. The authors find statistical evidence in support of the hypothesis that fiscal incentives of the Russian regions represent an important determinant of regional economic performance. The authors also seek to understand the conditions under which fiscal autonomy prompts regional growth and recovery, and the conditions under which it has adverse economic effects. They argue that the presence of"unearned"income streams-particularly in the form of revenues from natural resource production or from budgetary transfers from the central government-has turned regions dependent on these income sources into"rentier"regions. As such, governments in these regions have used local control over revenues and expenditures to shelter certain firms (natural resource producers or loss-making enterprises) from market forces. Using new fiscal data from 80 Russian regions from 1996 - 99, the authors test this central hypothesis in both single- and simultaneous-equation specifications. Their results indicate that <b>tax</b> <b>retention</b> (as a proxy for fiscal autonomy) has a positive effect on the cumulative output recovery of regions since the breakup of the Soviet Union. But they also find that this effect decreases as rentable income streams to regions increase.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Africa {{has been}} {{experiencing}} significant {{growth over the}} last few years, with many seeing Africa as the next investment destination. This increased growth in international trade and investment could broaden and deepen the tax base for African countries which could be a source of additional tax revenue. In particular, the SADC comprises a group of African countries which has as one of their common goals the promotion of sustainable and equitable economic growth. One possible way of achieving this goal could be through the use of effective tax treaties, allowing for greater <b>retention</b> of <b>taxing</b> rights over income flows from FDI, which could {{go a long way in}} deepening and broadening the tax base for the SADC countries. This could assist the SADC countries in promoting the growth and development of their economies. A greater <b>retention</b> of <b>taxing</b> rights over income by the SADC countries could be achieved through the use of the UN Model. This Model has primarily been designed to assist developing countries in retaining greater taxing rights over income in order to assist with their development and growth. Therefore, this dissertation has primarily focused on the use of and variation from the UN Model treaty clauses by a group of SADC countries in order to determine the extent of the application of the provisions of the UN Model in the SADC countries’ tax treaties. This analysis has specifically considered the distributive rules of the UN Model dealing with the most common forms of income that are likely to arise from FDI, namely: business profits, income from immovable property, dividends, interest, royalties, capital gains, income from employment and pensions. The focus has been on whether the SADC countries have been able to retain greater taxing rights over these forms of income by making use of the provisions of the UN Model. However, at the same time, the analysis also considered the provisions of the OECD Model, as it recognised that the OECD Model is one of the most widely used Models for negotiating tax treaties amongst both developed and developing countries. By considering the provisions of the OECD Model in this dissertation, it has allowed for a useful and meaningful analysis of any variations from the UN Model...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question whether}} the preferential treatment of retained earnings according to section 34 a EStG is suitable to achieve a comparable tax burden of partnerships and corporations. To calculate the tax burden on retained earnings requires {{the combination of the}} progressive personal income tax, the trade tax, which varies widely depending on the community and partnerships payments for interest, rent, leasing, and royalties, as well as the preferential tax rate. The resulting tax has to match the business tax rate of corporations, in order to <b>tax</b> <b>retentions</b> irrespective of the legal form. It turns out that, due to the specifics of the German local tax, the reduced tax rate has to be calculated individually. It can be shown {{that it is impossible to}} determine a reference value for all domestic companies. By introducing a "virtual principle of separation" (virtuelles Trennungsprinzip) we allow entrepreneurs to separate between the level of the firm and the ow ner of the firm, when retained earnings are to be taxed. The retained profit is taxed at the corporate income tax rate of 15 %, the solidarity surcharge of 5. 5 % and the trade tax rate; once the profit is distributed, it is taxed at the progressive personal income tax rate of the partner. business taxation; preferential treatment of retained earnings; principle of separation; trade tax...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} sought to {{identify}} {{the role of the}} mammillary bodies and their projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei for spatial memory. Rats with either selective, neurotoxic mammillary body lesions or discrete mammillothalamic tract lesions were tested on various spatial working memory tasks. Tests using the T-maze, radial-arm maze, and water maze were manipulated to compare three possible theories of mammillary body function by increasing proactive interference, increasing <b>retention</b> interval, and <b>taxing</b> the rapid processing of novel spatial stimuli. On T-maze alternation and radial-arm maze tasks, both lesion groups were initially impaired but seemed to recover. Transfer tests revealed, however, a more permanent change in performance, suggesting a failure to use distal (allocentric) cues. Consistent with this, both groups were also impaired at matching-to-place in the water maze and showed little improvement with practice. Nevertheless, once the lesion groups had been trained on a task, they were not affected differentially either by an increase of proactive interference or by retention intervals of up to 30 min. Although both mammillary body and mammillothalamic tract lesions resulted in similar impairments, the mammillothalamic tract group was the more affected when acquiring new spatial information. Together, these results suggest that mammillary body damage causes an encoding deficit when learning new spatial tasks, resulting in a suboptimal mode of performance, which may reflect a loss of directional heading information...|$|R
40|$|Many {{provisions}} of the U. S. tax code affect corporate decisions to pay out or retain earnings. Most studies of these effects have {{examined the effects of}} dividend and capital gains taxes on payouts. Relatively few studies have considered the effects of corporate <b>taxes</b> on <b>retentions.</b> In the early 1900 s, the United States experimented with several corporate <b>taxes</b> on <b>retentions.</b> These <b>taxes</b> increased the price of corporate retentions, thereby encouraging corporate payouts. This paper studies the response of corporations to the most significant of these experiments the Undistributed Profits Tax of 1936 - 1938. While the U. S. no longer directly <b>taxes</b> corporate <b>retentions,</b> our study provides empirical results relevant to two recent policy debates. First, to the extent that corporate payouts did respond significantly to a change in the corporate price of retentions, we can learn more about the implicit prices corporations place on internal funds. These estimates enable us better understand the effects of government policies designed to encourage corporate reinvestment. Second, our study provides evidence relevant to several recent proposals designed to resolve managerial agency problems. These proposals require managers to payout their "free" cash flows as a way of committing not to waste financial capital. The Undistributed Profits Tax of 1936 - 1938 had a similar goal. Its maximum marginal tax rate of 27 percent on corporate retentions gave managers strong incentives to pay out retained earnings. We study the effects of the Undistributed Profits Tax on corporate payouts using a panel data set on 26 large petroleum companies. These data have a number of advantages, {{not the least of which}} is the relative homogeneity of petroleum firms' investment opportunities. We find that on average corporate payout policies did respond significantly to the surtax in 1936, the first year of the tax. There was much less of a response in 1937, and practically none in the last year, 1938. The smaller payouts in 1937 and 1938 suggest that managers were able to find margins other than dividends through which they could reduce their tax burden. These other margins included the short-term manipulation of expenses and delays in recognizing revenues. These responses suggest that managers place a relatively high valuation on internal versus external funds. They also suggest that proposals that would require managers to payout free cash flows must resolve an important incentive problem [...] how to get managers to reveal fully what cash flows are "free. " Finally, our results document the importance of recognizing behavioral responses to taxes. That is, firms may respond to changes in relative tax prices by finding other margins by which they can reduce their tax burdens. ...|$|R
40|$|In this Article, I seek {{to respond}} to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{overture}} with a treatment of of subsidies under the dormant Commerce Clause that moves progressively from the general to the specific. Part I examines key Supreme Court cases to show that the basic question of whether state business subsidies are constitutional remains open and important. Part II then turns to how that question should be resolved, focusing on whether subsidies are fairly distinguishable from ostensibly equivalent, and concededly unlawful, discriminatory tax relief. The thrust of Part II is that both precedent and policy support the traditional, pre-West Lynn Creamer 2 ̆ 2 view that state subsidies almost always comport with the dormant Commerce Clause principle. In particular, Part II emphasizes that four considerations-rooted in form, fairness, federalism, and political processes-render subsidies less threatening to Commerce Clause values than economically comparable tax deductions, credits, and exemptions. Part III then addresses the major question that Part II leaves open: How should courts distinguish the ordinary subsidy that is constitutional from the exceptional subsidy that is not? Part III suggests that none of the opinions in West Lynn Creamery-in which an exceptional subsidy was struck downoffers much useful guidance on this critical question. As a result, Part IV offers an alternative analytical framework for distinguishing the constitutional grant-in-aid from the unconstitutional assault upon our 2 ̆ 2 federal free trade unit. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 In essence, this proposal calls upon courts to draw the line between permissible and impermissible subsidies by focusing on the same four factors already identified in Part II to distinguish ordinary subsidies from discriminatory tax breaks as a general matter. Accordingly, Part IV advocates an approach that asks whether the challenged subsidy-because of its linkage to a particular tax-shares the essential constitutional defects of a discriminatory tax break. Using the four factors, courts would consider the following: (1) whether, consistent with conventional property-based notions of fairness, the subsidy merely permits state residents to reap where they have sown; (2) whether invalidation of the subsidy frustrates the state 2 ̆ 7 s federalism based interest in experimenting with responses to distinctive local needs; (3) whether the same political dynamics that unduly encourage adoption and <b>retention</b> of discriminatory <b>tax</b> relief (i. e., reduced visibility, heightened risks of entrenchment, lowered administrative costs, and the like) mark the challenged subsidy scheme; and (4) whether the subsidy is part of a program that resembles in form a protective tariff or kindred types of unconstitutional discriminatory taxation...|$|R
