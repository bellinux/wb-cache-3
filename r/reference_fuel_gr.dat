40|$|This paper {{presents}} computations {{based on}} a semidetailed kinetic scheme for <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> (n-heptane and 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl-pentane) mixtures. Model results are compared with several experimental data previously appearing in the literature and with data presented {{here for the first}} time. New data, obtained in a pressurized flow reactor at 12. 5 atm, report the heat release and gas composition of various dilute, stoichiometric mixtures of primary <b>reference,</b> <b>fuels</b> and oxygen under fixed reaction time. New data from rapid compression machine experiments characterize cool flame phenomena in the low temperature range and define total ignition-delay times for stoichiometric mixtures of primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> and air mixtures at high octane number. The new data confirm that negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and hot ignition characteristics are a nonlinear function of octane number (ON). A previous kinetic model developed and tested for the oxidation of the individual pure <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> is shown to reproduce accurately the autoignition and the various oxidation characteristics of <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> mixtures in the earlier experiments, as well as in shock tubes and in a motored engine experiment. Moreover, the model is shown to unify the intrinsic information of the different experimental sources and data and provides a skeletal mechanism from which to derive and validate simpler empirical kinetic models for inclusion in engine design codes. Results also suggest that new studies and experiments are required for a deeper understanding of oxidation processes to include the effects of other molecular structure classes, particularly fuel additives (e. g., ethers, alcohols) and aromatics. © 1996 Combustion Institute...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} for estimating the octane index (OI), the {{research octane number}} (RON) and the motor octane number (MON) using ignition delay times from a constant volume combustion chamber with liquid fuel injection is proposed by adopting an ignition quality tester. A baseline data of ignition delay times were determined using an ignition quality tester at a charge pressure of 21. 3 bar between 770 and 850 K and an equivalence ratio of 0. 7 for various primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> (PRFs, mixtures of isooctane and n-heptane). Our methodology was developed using ignition delay times for toluene <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> (mixtures of toluene and n-heptane). A correlation between the OI and the ignition delay time at the initial charge temperature enabled the OI of non-PRFs to be predicted at specified temperatures. The methodology was validated using ignition delay times for toluene primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> (ternary mixtures of toluene, iso-octane, and n-heptane), fuels for advanced combustion engines (FACE) gasolines, and certification gasolines.

The experimental setup included a fuel injection system, a high-speed imaging system, and a droplet size measurement system. Spray images were taken by using a high-speed camera for spray angle and penetration analysis. Sauter mean diameter, Dv(10), Dv(50), Dv(90), and particle size distribution were measured using a laser diffraction technique. Results show that the injection process is very consistent for different runs and the time averaged spray angles during the measuring period are 103. 45 °, 102. 84 °, 102. 46 ° and 107. 61 ° for LN, WN, TPRF and PRF, respectively. The spray front remains relatively flat during the early stage of the fuel injection process. The peak penetration velocities are 80 m/s, 75 m/s, 75 m/s and 79 m/s for LN, WN, TPRF and PRF, respectively. Then velocities decrease {{until the end of}} the injection and stay relatively stable. The transient particle size and the time-averaged particle size were also analyzed and discussed. The concentration weighted average value generally shows higher values than the arithmetic average results. The average data for WN is usually the second smallest except for Dv 90, of which WN is the biggest. Generally the arithmetic average particle sizes of PRF are usually the smallest, and the sizes does not change much with the measuring locations. For droplet size distribution results, LN and WN show bimodal distributions for all the locations while TPRF and PRF shows both bimodal and single peak distribution patterns.

Based on weight change, the general corrosion of all individual coupons exposed in the vapor phase above <b>Reference</b> <b>Fuel</b> C and CE 20 a as well as all coupons immersed in <b>Reference</b> <b>Fuel</b> C was essentially nil (< 0. 3 {micro}m/y), with no evidence of localized corrosion such as pitting/crevice corrosion or selective leaching at any location. Modest discoloration was observed on the copper-based alloys (cartridge brass and phosphor bronze), but the associated corrosion films were quite thin and apparently protective. For coupons immersed in CE 20 a, four different materials exhibited net weight loss over the entire course of the experiment: cartridge brass, phosphor bronze, galvanized steel, and terne-plated steel. None of these exhibited substantial incompatibility with the test fluid, with the largest general corrosion rate calculated from coupon weight loss to be approximately 4 {micro}m/y for the cartridge brass specimens. Selective leaching of zinc (from brass) and tin (from bronze) was observed, as well as the presence of sulfide surface films rich in these elements, suggesting the importance of the role of sulfuric acid in the CE 20 a formulation.

For this purpose, this paper presents an auto-ignition investigation concerning the primary <b>reference</b> <b>fuels,</b> toluene <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> and diesel fuel, in order to study the effect of linear alkanes, branched alkanes and aromatics on the auto-ignition. The auto-ignition of these fuels has been studied at inlet temperatures from 25 to 120 degrees C, at equivalence ratios from 0. 18 to 0. 53 and at compression ratios from 6 to 13. 5, in order to extend the range of investigation and to assess the usability of these parameters to control the auto-ignition. It appeared that both iso-octane and toluene delayed the ignition with respect to n-heptane, while toluene has the Strongest effect. This means that aromatics have higher inhibiting effects than branched alkanes. In an increasing order, the inlet temperature, equivalence ratio and compression ratio had a promoting effect on the ignition delays. A previously experimentally validated reduced surrogate mechanism, for mixtures of n-heptane, iso-octane and toluene, has been used to explain observations of the auto-ignition process.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} properties of aviation fuels for spark-ignition engines is their knock rating. The CFR engine tests of fuels of 87 octane and above does not always correspond entirely to the actual behavior of these fuels in the airplane engine. A method is therefore developed which, in contrast to the octane number determination, permits a testing of the fuel under various temperatures and fuel mixture conditions. The following <b>reference</b> <b>fuels</b> were employed: 1) Primary fuels; isooctane and n-heptane; 2) Secondary fuels; pure benzene and synthetic benzine...|$|R
40|$|Preignition-limited {{performance}} daJa v:ere {{obtained on}} a s-upercharged CFR engine at tv;o sets of operating conditions over a 'IL-ide range of fuel-air ratios {{to determine the}} preignition characteristics for the follou:ing fire fuels: s-s <b>reference</b> <b>fuel,</b> S- 8 plus 4 ml TEL per gallon, AFD- 38 (140 -P), benzene, and diisobutylene. Jlaximum thermal-plug temperatures at con-stant intal. :e-air pressures v:ere also determined to correlate the preignition characteristics of each fuel with ·its ability to increase general engine-temperature lerels. Additional runs v:ere made to compare the preignition-limited performance of triptane, triptane plus 4 ml TEL per gallon, and AN-F- 28 R fuel. The res-ults indicated thatin the fuel-air-ratio range from 0. 070 to 0. 085, the relat-it·e order of the fuels according to increas-ing preignition-limited indicated mean effect-ire presB-ures wa-s diisobutylene, benzene, S- 8, AFD- 88, and S- 8 plus 4 ml TEL per gallon. The relati~:e order of the fuels for {{the two sets of}} operating ronditioM was not the same for all fuel-air ratios. The addition of tetraethyl lead to either S- 3 <b>reference</b> <b>fuel</b> or triptane raised the preignition-limited perjormanre. The plot of fuelfiow against air flow at the preignition limit for each fuel shows thar the data approximately follow two straight lines: o-ne for the rich-mixture region and one for the lean-mixture region. The respectiu slopes of tMse lines changed only slightly in the oorious preignitwn-limited runs...|$|R
