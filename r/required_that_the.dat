But individual matrix elements are frequently computed, especially for the Lie algebra (below).|$|E
5|$|During {{this entire}} period, BE1 was insolvent. The bank {{therefore}} <b>required</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire sales price of Hamar stadion {{be transferred to}} BG, even though NOK50 million {{was to go to}} the construction of Børstad Idrettspark (BIP). Therefore, Hamar Municipality decided to finance BIP to secure sufficient funding for Briskeby, essentially subsidizing Briskeby with a further NOK50 million. In 2007, BG paid NOK3.4 million in compensation to Ham-Kam for lost ticket sales during the construction time and for the club house, which would be demolished.|$|E

5|$|He was {{appointed}} Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation. During that time, any Fellow {{of a college}} at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest. However, {{the terms of the}} Lucasian professorship <b>required</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.|$|E
5|$|Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, {{where he}} went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball. Vocational had an {{unheated}} gym and no locker rooms, which <b>required</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team dress for games in a history classroom. Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by Parade magazine and won McDonald's All American honors. He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational's homecoming king. During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois' Lou Henson, DePaul's Joey Meyer and Michigan's Steve Fisher, Jannie Mae Howard did most of the questioning.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In {{the aftermath of the}} Shuttle Columbia accident, Congress <b>required</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress. By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).|$|E

On 4 May 1945, all of JG 1's surviving He-162s were formed into a special consolidated Intervention groups (Einsatzgruppen). However, on 5 May 1945, the war ended with Germany's surrender. The terms of the surrender <b>required</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe cease all operations.. Surviving JG 1 crews subsequently turned their He 162s over to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence <b>required</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> South Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the demilitarized zone, affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E

5|$|Silver half dimes {{had been}} struck {{from the early days}} of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, the Mint successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. When the Mint proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress <b>required</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coin be heavier than the Mint had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E

Although most of Zhao Ziyang's reforms were later themselves rescinded, concurrent PSC membership was not reintroduced until the 15th National Congress in 1997.|$|E

With the increased attendance and interest for hockey following the town's team playing in the top league, Storhamar started planning an indoor venue.|$|E

Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E

The executions of the recaptured POWs failed to break the men. The commanders, however, finally capitulated on 5 September when their men started to fall ill and die from dysentery. Upon signing the pledge, the men were allowed to return to the barracks buildings.|$|E

On 27 January 1999, the municipal council passed a resolution allowing the venue {{to be sold to}} the club for NOK7.9 million, with the official take-over date being 1 May. In addition, the company would pay NOK5.5 million to the municipality at a later date, after the venue had become profitable.|$|E
