5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman <b>recirculating</b> ball steering mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|E
5|$|Following {{additional}} touring in 2009, My Bloody Valentine dedicated {{their time}} to completing their third album. Rumours of a My Bloody Valentine box set, which had circulated amongst the public in April 2008 following a listing on HMV Japan's web site, began <b>recirculating.</b> In March 2012, {{after a number of}} reported delays, Sony Music Ireland announced the release of the compilation album EP's 1988–1991—a collection of the band's Creation Records extended plays, singles and unreleased tracks. The compilation album was released on 4 May 2012, alongside remastered versions of Isn't Anything and Loveless.|$|E
5|$|The Gulf Stream, {{together}} with its northern extension the North Atlantic Drift, is {{a warm and}} swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches {{to the tip of}} Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, <b>recirculating</b> off West Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{deep water}} masses (>1600 m) are <b>recirculated</b> within the Greenland Sea {{due to the}} Jan Mayen Fracture Zone. Here, the deep water {{encounters}} the Jan Mayen Ridge and are deflected eastward towards {{the interior of the}} Greenland Sea Gyre. The upper layers are able to pass into the waters north of Iceland unhindered. It {{is important to note that}} these <b>recirculated</b> deep water masses in the Greenland Sea Gyre will be <b>recirculated</b> into the EGC once again in the future near Fram Strait.|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of the factors which might {{influence}} firms' water recirculation decisions. This paper estimates an econometric model that accounts for potential self-selection bias and considers two facets of firms' recirculation behaviour: first, the discrete decision of whether to <b>recirculate</b> and, second, the decision of how much to <b>recirculate.</b> The model is estimated by applying the Heckman two-stage estimation procedure to data from Environment Canada's Industrial Water Use Survey. In the first stage, long run factors such as relative water scarcity and production technologies are found to influence the decision whether to <b>recirculate</b> water. In the second stage, the imputed prices of intake water and water recirculation {{as well as the}} scale of operations are found to influence the choice of the optimal quantity of water to <b>recirculate.</b> water demand, rericulation, Heckman...|$|R
2500|$|Much of the {{resulting}} breakdown products are <b>recirculated</b> in the body. The heme constituent of hemoglobin are broken down into iron (Fe3+) and biliverdin. The biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, which is released into the plasma and <b>recirculated</b> to the liver bound to albumin. [...] The iron is released into the plasma to be <b>recirculated</b> by a carrier protein called transferrin. [...] Almost all red blood cells are removed in this manner from the circulation before they {{are old enough to}} hemolyze. Hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a protein in plasma called haptoglobin, which is not excreted by the kidney.|$|R
5|$|The {{facility}} {{attempts to}} minimize its environmental impact through several mechanisms, including minimizing area usage. Energy consumption {{is reduced by}} using <b>recirculating</b> excess heat to melt snow and ice for drinking water and heating. Waste is minimized through purchase planning and recycling; the remaining waste is compressed and transported away from the Antarctic. Fuel is handled {{in such a way}} that even small spills are minimized. In 2016 a solar PV plant with 7.3 kilowatt peak has been installed on one of the roof tops. It serves as a pilot installation for the declared middle term target of reducing the oil consumption of the research station significantly, by extending the solar PV plant over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the <b>recirculating</b> ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E

40|$|A free {{electron}} laser (FEL) facility utilizing a <b>recirculated</b> superconducting radio frequency (SRF) electron linear accelerator (linac) provides the opportunity to achieve about 5 times greater photon energy than an unrecirculated linac facility of similar cost. An electron linac configuration utilizing a 4  GeV unrecirculated, SRF linac {{could be used to}} drive a FEL producing 5  keV photons. However, for a similar cost, a <b>recirculated</b> SRF linac system can deliver the 4  GeV electrons for photon energies of 5  keV and provide an upgrade path to photon energies of 25  keV.

25|$|Braking duties were {{handled by}} 11.3-inch discs {{up front and}} drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front {{suspension}} consisted of unequal-length control arms, coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar.

25|$|Unusually, two {{different}} steering systems {{were used for}} the E39, depending on the engine. Models with four-cylinder and six-cylinder models use rack and pinion steering, the first time this system has been used in a 5 Series. This system steers {{from the front of the}} axle.

25|$|In case of {{a sudden}} {{reduction}} of pipe diameter, without streamlining, the flow {{is not able to}} follow the sharp bend into the narrower pipe. As a result, there is flow separation, creating <b>recirculating</b> separation zones at the entrance of the narrower pipe.

25|$|Class I {{cabinets}} provide {{personnel and}} environmental protection but no product protection. In fact, the inward flow of air can contribute to contamination of samples. Inward airflow is maintained at a minimum velocity of 75ft/min(0.38 m/s). These BSCs are commonly used to enclose specific equipment (e.g. centrifuges) or procedures (e.g. aerating cultures) that potentially generate aerosols. BSCs of this class are either ducted (connected to the building exhaust system) or unducted (<b>recirculating</b> filtered exhaust back into the laboratory).|$|E
25|$|The front {{suspension}} {{is short}} and long control arms with coil springs; the rear suspension is a four-link design with coil springs. A torque-arm design rear suspension replaced the four-link design starting with the 1976 models. The Astre is a rear wheel drive vehicle with a live rear axle. Steering is of a <b>recirculating</b> ball type with a power assist option. The brake system features front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes. Power assist was optional starting in the 1975 model year.|$|E
25|$|Another very {{important}} reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of Legionella, including species that cause legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease, most notably L. pneumophila, or Mycobacterium avium. The various Legionella species are the cause of Legionnaires' disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to aerosols—the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources of Legionella include cooling towers used in open <b>recirculating</b> evaporative cooling water systems, domestic hot water systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply.
