We present a scheme for adding fault tolerance to an existing {{video conferencing}} server. The scheme is client-transparent so that it can be used by the installed base of clients. While the scheme is based on replication, the associated overhead is negligible since the backup does not process the media streams. Most previous work on fault-tolerant network services focused on transaction-oriented services. Video conferencing is an interesting test-case for applying fault tolerance for other types of services since it combines critical conference state that must be protected with media streams where limited data losses are acceptable.

40|$|Bohacek, Stephan K. A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) {{is a set}} of {{self-organizing}} wireless mobile nodes, which {{communicate with}} each other without any existing network infrastructure or centralized network management. Wireless communication over MANET follows a multi-hop manner, in which each node can be a transceiver or a router. MANET has spurred considerable research interests and applications in the felids of vehicle network, sensor network and tactical communication network. Tactical communication network works in a highly dynamic environment with the kinds of interferences and jammings, which can cause low packet delivery rates, long delays or even interruptions. Moreover, the effects may spread across multiple network protocol stacks, typically physical (PHY) layer and media access control (MAC) layer. Because of the interruptions and jammings, MANET routing algorithms must be robust enough to give <b>reliable</b> <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, since the end-to-end communications of MANET are achieved via multi-hop relays, the routing protocol is an essential factor that affects the overall performance of MANET. The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) is a routing protocol for MANET, which is built on the classical link state algorithm with multi-point relays (MPRs). OLSR {{has been shown to be}} suitable for large-scale dense wireless networks. In this thesis, we developed and implemented a game theory routing protocol (GTR) based on conventional OLSR for jamming environment.

Impacts of jamming on GTR and OLSR are studied. The results show that GTR has better overall performance, specifically lower end-to-end delay and higher packet delivery rate, over OLSR.

40|$|Abstract — Despite {{years of}} {{research}} and development, pioneering deployments of multihop wireless networks have not proven successful. The performance of routing and transport is often unstable due to contention-induced packet losses, especially when the network is large and the offered load is high. In this paper we propose RAIN, a <b>reliable</b> wireless <b>network</b> architecture for large-scale multihop wireless networks. A RAIN network enforces contention control by limiting the queue length at intermediate wireless routers to the minimum. To keep the queue short a RAIN network enforces congestion control through in-network implicit back-pressure. RAIN congestion control is built on wireless datalink layer mechanisms, e. g., mandatory per-frame acknowledgement and inter-frame backoff in popular CSMA/CA wireless transceivers, therefore very efficient and effective compared with those defined at the network or transport layer for the wired Internet. As {{a result of the}} built-in contention and congestion control, RAIN presents the end hosts a highly <b>reliable</b> <b>network</b> <b>service</b> model, even more reliable than that of the wired Internet. The end hosts only need to deal with packet losses due to router or routing failures. Therefore, the transport protocol can be significantly simplified. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} existing approach of adding more and more complexity to adapt TCP for multihop wireless networks. We propose the details of RAIN datalink layer protocol, and a simple transport protocol at the end hosts. Performance evaluation through intensive simulations shows that RAIN improves the throughput by up to 92 % and fairness by up to 48 %, with packet losses due to contention and congestion significantly reduced.

40|$|With the {{wireless}} media and ad hoc nodes operating both as routers and communication end-terminals, {{the ad hoc}} routing protocols {{are more prone to}} attacks than the network layer of fixed networks. Authenticated routing messages are a primary concern in the provisioning of a <b>reliable</b> <b>network</b> <b>service.</b> The scope of this dissertation has been network layer security in ad hoc networks intended for the operational scenario of emergency and rescue operations. The main objectives have been to investigate the applicability of existing security schemes for ad hoc networks, and to {{contribute to the development of}} resource efficient, yet robust and appropriate protection schemes. The majority of secure ad hoc routing protocols proposed so far, tend to focus on the protection techniques, rather than the computational cost and bandwidth consumption. Our work highlights the importance of taking these factors into consideration in the design of secure routing protocols. In addition, attention must be paid to the nature of routing control traffic and its discrepancies from ordinary application data. The thesis is based on our research published in four articles. Our contributions include a comprehensive survey of key management methods proposed for ad hoc networks and an evaluation of the applicability for initialization and maintenance of a protected <b>network</b> <b>service.</b> The applicability of identity-based public key schemes for protection of ad hoc routing information is also analyzed. Scalability remains an issue even with ID-based schemes that remove the need for bandwidth consuming certificate exchanges. A hybrid protection scheme is therefore proposed for the Optimized Link-State Routing protocol (OLSR). The protection scheme reduces both computational cost and bandwidth consumption by combining identity-based signatures with values from a hash chain.

Performance models in turn, require very accurate traffic models that have the ability to capture the statistical characteristics of the actual traffic on the network. Many traffic models have been developed based on traffic measurement data. If the underlying traffic models do not efficiently capture the characteristics of the actual traffic, the result may be the under-estimation or over-estimation of the performance of the network.

Understanding and measuring such end-to-end service performance is a challenging task. Current techniques include periodic sampling of service characteristics from strategic locations in the network and instrumenting Web pages with code that reports client-perceived latency back to a performance server. Limitations to these approaches include potentially nonrepresentative access patterns in the first case and determining the location of a performance bottleneck in the second. This paper presents EtE monitor, a novel approach to measuring Web site performance. Our system passively collects packet traces from a server site to determine service performance characteristics. We introduce a two-pass heuristic and a statistical filtering mechanism to accurately reconstruct different client page accesses and to measure performance characteristics integrated across all client accesses. Relative to existing approaches, EtE monitor offers the following benefits: i) a latency breakdown between the network and server overhead of retrieving a Web page, ii) longitudinal information for all client accesses, not just the subset probed by a third party, iii) characteristics of accesses that are aborted by clients, iv) an understanding of the performance breakdown of accesses to dynamic, multitiered services, and v) quantification of the benefits of network and browser caches on server performance.

Today, Internet is again moving toward more <b>reliable</b> and robust <b>network</b> <b>services</b> including QoS.

When multiple paths are selected, traffic transmission can be either flow-based or packet-based allocation to the multiple paths. The packet-based connection allocation usually shows a better load balancing effect and ease of flow management in the presence of network failures. However, it causes TCP segments to be distributed over delay-different multiple paths and to be delivered out-of-sequence. These out-of-sequence packet deliveries make TCP receiver generate many duplicate acknowledgments (ACKs), and TCP sender, in turn, misinterprets network congestion from the duplicate ACKs.
