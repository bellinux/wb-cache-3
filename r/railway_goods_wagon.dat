50|$|Class districts (Gattungsbezirke) were a {{classification}} system for <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> {{used by the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn (1920-1945) in Germany between the wars.|$|R
50|$|Open wagons form a {{large group}} of <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> {{designed}} primarily for the transportation of bulk goods that are not moisture-retentive and can usually be tipped, dumped or shovelled. The International Union of Railways (UIC) distinguishes between ordinary wagons (Class E/UIC-type 5) and special wagons (F/6). Open wagons often form a significant part of a <b>railway</b> company's <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> fleet; for example, forming just under 40% of the Deutsche Bahn's total <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> stock in Germany.|$|R

5000|$|Flat wagons (sometimes flat beds, flats or rail flats, US: flatcars), as {{classified}} by the International Union of Railways (UIC), are <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> {{that have a}} flat, usually full-length, deck (or 2 decks on car transporters) and little or no superstructure. By contrast, open wagons have high side and end walls and covered <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> have a fixed roof and sides. Flat wagons are often designed for the transportation of goods that are not weather-sensitive. Some flat wagons are able to be covered completely by tarpaulins or hoods and are therefore suitable for the transport of weather-sensitive goods. Unlike a [...] "goods wagon with opening roof", the loading area of a flat is entirely open and accessible once the cover is removed.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{standardise}} the <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> classes {{of the various}} German state railways (Länderbahnen), the German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband or DWV) issued regulations. The so-called Verbandsbauart (association) or DWV wagons, named after this association, were built from 1910 until {{the emergence of the}} Austauschbauart (interchangeable) wagons in 1927. Externally, the Verbandsbauart wagons looked very much like state <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons,</b> but they were equipped for considerably higher maximum loads of up to 20 tons. A total of 11 classes were defined by norms defined by master engineering drawings (Musterblättern). The wagons were built in numbers that today are hardly conceivable. The most important ones were the A2 and A10 Class wagons of which over 100,000 of each type were built. The Om Class A10 wagons were, including wagons of identical construction made by other nations, the most widespread <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> of all time and formed the major part of the German <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> fleet until the 1950s. Only then did they slowly disappear from the tracks. Many were also modified as part of the German <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> reconstruction programme.|$|R

However, also S is used for coaches and this doubles a <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> class. These are covered in detail in the article on UIC classification of <b>railway</b> coaches.Each <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> type is given a type number, whose first digit forms the fifth digit of the 12-digit UIC wagon number.|$|R
5000|$|The wagon {{with opening}} roof {{is a type}} of <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> that is, nowadays, defined and {{standardised}} by the International Union of Railways (UIC) as Class [...] "T". They are a large category of rail vehicle, predominantly used for the transport of hygroscopic bulk commodities such as cement, plaster, lime, potash and grain.|$|E

50|$|The German term Kriegsbauart (wartime class) {{refers to}} <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> classes that were {{developed}} during the Second World War for the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The {{start of the war}} was an arbitrary dividing line for the classification of goods wagons, and did not represent any technological change. In the period shortly before the war, goods wagons were already being designed from a military perspective. This was particularly true for the stake wagons of 1938, which are occasionally referred to as a 'pre-war class' (Vorkriegsbauart) of wagons.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 January a fire {{broke out}} in the melt-pot room, and efforts to put it out were under way when {{approximately}} [...] of TNT ignited at 6:52pm. The TNT plant was destroyed instantly, as were many nearby buildings, including the Silvertown Fire Station. Much of the TNT was in <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> awaiting transport. Debris was strewn for miles around, with red-hot chunks of rubble causing fires. A gasometer gasholder was damaged on Greenwich Peninsula, creating a fireball from [...] of gas; the holder was later repaired and remained until 1986. Several thousand pounds' worth of goods were also destroyed in nearby warehouses, estimated by the Port of London Authority to span [...] The chancel and church hall of the local church, St Barnabas', were destroyed, only to be replaced in 1926.|$|R
5000|$|The town {{later became}} an {{important}} centre for railway manufacturing. An early railway works was the Hopetown Carriage Works (est.1853) which supplied carriages and locomotives to the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The engineering firm of William and Alfred Kitching also manufactured locomotives in the 19th century. The town developed to have three significant works; the largest of these was the main line Darlington Works, whose main works were known as the North Road Shops which opened in 1863 and closed in 1966. Another was Robert Stephenson & Co. (colloquially: [...] "Stivvies"), who moved to Darlington from Newcastle upon Tyne in 1902, became Robert Stephensons & Hawthorns in 1937, were absorbed by English Electric around 1960, and closed by 1964. The third was Faverdale Wagon Works, established in 1923 and closed in 1962, which in the 1950s was a UK pioneer {{in the application of}} mass-production techniques to the manufacture of <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In British English, {{the word}} van refers to {{vehicles}} that carry goods only, on both roads and rails. What {{would be called}} a minivan in American English is called a people-carrier or MPV, or multi-purpose vehicle, and larger passenger vehicles are called a minibus. The Telegraph newspaper introduced the idea of [...] "White Van Man", a typical working class man or small business owner who would have a white Ford Transit, Mercedes Sprinter, or similar panel van. Today the phrase [...] "man and van" [...] refers to light removal firms normally operated by a sole business owner transporting anything from {{the contents of a}} whole house to just a few boxes. The word [...] "van" [...] also refers to <b>railway</b> covered <b>goods</b> <b>wagons,</b> called [...] "boxcars" [...] in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and the {{national}} leaders of India, there was a widespread and peaceful uprising against the British colonial rule of India. After {{a series of events}} that culminated in violent clashes between police and protesters, Martial law was introduced and the rebellion mostly crushed. The British packed 70 prisoners into a <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> at Tirur railway station to be sent to the Coimbatore jails. By the time they reached their destination 61 of the prisoners had died from suffocation. A monument to this notorious tragedy can be now seen in Tirur.|$|E
50|$|A covered goods wagon or van is a <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> {{which is}} {{designed}} for the transportation of moisture-susceptible goods and therefore fully enclosed by sides and a fixed roof. They are often referred to simply as covered wagons, {{and this is the}} term used by the International Union of Railways (UIC). Since the introduction of the international classification for goods wagons by the UIC in the 1960s a distinction has been drawn between ordinary and special covered wagons. Other types of wagon, such as refrigerated vans and goods wagons with opening roofs, are closely related to covered wagons from a design point of view.|$|E
50|$|Santragachhi or Santragachi is a {{neighbourhood}} of Howrah city in West Bengal, India. It has {{a railway}} station {{which serves as}} a railway junction for the South Eastern Railway. Santragachi is mostly a residential locality with a sizeable railway colony with some industries including a HLL, a privately owned <b>railway</b> <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> making unit. Santragachi is also popular for its large lake known as Santragachhi Jheel which attracts migratory birds such as lesser whistling duck in the winter months. Recent development of new Bus stand and Bus routes from Santragachi is making it a preferred change over point for prople travelling by railways to Kolkata, specially South Kolkata, via Vidyasagar Setu.|$|E
50|$|Covered <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> for {{transporting}} part-load or parcel {{goods are}} almost {{as old as the}} railway itself. Because part-load goods were the most common freight {{in the early days of}} the railway, the covered van was then the most important type of <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> and, for example, comprised about 40% of the German <b>railways</b> <b>goods</b> fleet until the 1960s. Since then however the open wagon and flat wagon have become more common. By contrast the covered <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> still forms the majority of two-axled wagons in countries like Germany, because the comparatively light freight does not routinely require the use of bogie wagons.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the <b>railway,</b> <b>goods</b> trains still ran at top speeds of only about 20 mph. However, the {{introduction}} of through brakes using air pipes (such as the Kunze-Knorr brakes in Germany) from the 1920s enabled higher speeds to be safely achieved. Modern <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> are authorised for speeds up to around 75 mph and in certain countries, wagons are increasingly equipped with GPS receivers and transponders which provide location monitoring as required. The Deutsche Bahn (DB) even has <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> cleared for high-speed rail travel at up to 100 mph. Because the braking distance of fast goods trains is longer than the separation between distant and home signals (as are Express Passenger trains), they may only run at high speeds of 150 mph with locos on routes with early signalling systems in the driver’s cab (LZB, FZB and ETCS).|$|R
50|$|Since 1922, the {{agreement}} for the mutual use of <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in international traffic (RIV) has regulated {{the exchange of}} <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in Europe and the Middle East. In addition, international <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> fleets were created in 1953 in Western Europe with the Europ-Verband and in 1964 in Eastern Europe with the Common <b>Goods</b> <b>Wagon</b> Park (OPW). During {{the second half of}} the 20th century, national <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> classes in Europe were increasingly replaced by Union internationale des chemins de fer (UIC) standard wagons. Since 1964, all <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in Germany, for example, have had to be classified using the UIC <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> classification system.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the state}} {{railways}} had been subordinated to {{the sovereignty of}} the German Empire in 1920, the Reich Railway Authority began in 1921 to group all <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> with the same or similar roles into so-called [...] "class districts" [...] (Gattungsbezirke). These were given the names of German cities, usually those with the HQ of a Reich railway division. This method of classifying <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> was first used in 1912 when the Bavarian <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were reclassified. The DR's <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> reclassification exercise began in 1922 and lasted until 1924. This did not just affected the Verbandsbauart <b>goods</b> <b>wagons,</b> but all <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> in the Deutsche Reichsbahn's fleet.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their own designs, Saxony also used only slightly modified Prussian <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> designs. After {{the foundation of the}} German State Railway Wagon Association in 1909 the standardised <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were procured, that were defined in 11 <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> templates.|$|R
50|$|In 1902 a short westward {{connection}} {{was made at}} Granton, serving Granton Gas Works. Joining in the Granton Harbour <b>railway</b> network, <b>goods</b> interchange with the Caledonian Railway also took place at Granton over the harbour lines, as for some decades the two companies had no direct connection in Edinburgh (other than the Haymarket connection which was unsuitable for <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> transfer due to congestion).|$|R
50|$|Since the Union of Private <b>Goods</b> <b>Wagon</b> Companies (Vereinigung der Privatgüterwagen-Interessenten (VPI)) {{was founded}} in 1921, the {{interests}} of private transport organisations in Germany (including <b>wagon</b> hire firms, <b>goods</b> <b>wagon</b> builders and repair firms, and owners of private sidings) has been jointly represented. The Union has around 100 members who own 50,000 <b>goods</b> <b>wagons.</b> In 2007, they transported 361000000 t of goods. Other countries have similar organisations.|$|R
50|$|The design {{drawings}} for <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> were of special importance. The wagons built to these specifications appeared {{in large numbers}} and formed {{the bulk of the}} German wagon fleet until well after the Second World War. The 1973 DR <b>Goods</b> <b>Wagon</b> Handbook still contained most of the DSV wagon classes as well as the former Prussian Class IId wagons. The most important types are listed in the following table. Note that group IIb are <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> based on old designs, IIc <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> under 15 ton maximum load and IId <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> with at least 15 tons maximum load. A-group wagons are those built to the standard drawings of the DSV. Wagons according to sheets with other nos. are special designs, of which some were also built in large numbers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>wagons</b> of welded {{construction}} (Güterwagen der geschweißter Bauart) {{were developed}} and {{built by the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn in Germany from 1933 to about 1945. With the introduction of welding technology in 1933 almost all wagon components were joined by welding and no longer by rivetting. This enabled <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> to be designed, for example, for higher speeds or for higher payloads {{through the use of}} different types of steel and other engineering changes, but their further development was so heavily influenced by the exigencies of the Second World War that, as early as 1939, the Deutsche Reichsbahn had to temper the design of <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> to the new economic circumstances. Because there were overlaps in the change from the Austauschbauart - <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> made with interchangeable components - to the new welded classes, the period of the changeover cannot be exactly defined. Several standard <b>goods</b> <b>wagons</b> and their classes are covered in other articles. <b>Goods</b> <b>wagons</b> built during the Second World War that were purely intended for military transport use, are covered under the article on Kriegsbauart - wartime classes.|$|R
