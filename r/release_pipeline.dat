40|$|Controlling {{black-grass}} {{in winter}} wheat production in northern Europe {{is an increasing}} problem because of more frequent winter crops and development of herbicide resistance in weeds. Alternative weed management strategies are needed, e. g., use of more competitive cultivars. Factors that increase cultivar competitiveness include early vigor and straw length, but also allelopathy. Therefore, the allelopathic properties of wheat cultivars included in the Swedish national list or in the <b>release</b> <b>pipeline</b> were investigated using a bioassay with herbicide-resistant and herbicide-sensitive black-grass as receiver plants. Wheat-rye translocation lines were also included in this screening to identify possible sources of high allelopathic activity. The bioassay results were followed up in two-year field trials. The results revealed large variations in allelopathic activity between cultivars. Most cultivars showed interference with both herbicide-sensitive and herbicide-resistant black-grass, although the allelopathic effect was lower on the herbicide-resistant biotype. Cultivars with high allelopathic activity gave only half the black-grass biomass of low allelopathic cultivars. Dinaro, a triticale (wheat-rye hybrid) cultivar and the new wheat cultivar Nimbus showed the highest allelopathy and inhibition of black-grass growth. Only a few wheat lines with rye chromatin, {{all or part of}} a rye chromosome, showed high allelopathy. Use of cultivars with high allelopathic activity can thus be important in integrated weed management of black-grass...|$|E
40|$|Available {{evidence}} and predictions suggest overall {{negative effects on}} agricultural production {{as a result of}} climate change, especially when more food is required by a growing population. Information on the effects of global warming on pests and pathogens affecting agricultural crops is limited, though crop–pest models could offer means to predict changes in pest dynamics, and help design sound plant health management practices. Host-plant resistance should continue to receive high priority as global warming may favor emergence of new pest epidemics. There is increased risk, due to climate change, to food and feed contaminated by mycotoxin-producing fungi. Mycotoxin biosynthesis gene-specific microarray is being used to identify food-born fungi and associated mycotoxins, and investigate the influence of environmental parameters and their interactions for control of mycotoxin in food crops. Some crop wild relatives are threatened plant species and efforts should be made for their in situ conservation to ensure evolution of new variants, which may contribute to addressing new challenges to agricultural production. There should be more emphasis on germplasm enhancement to develop intermediate products with specific characteristics to support plant breeding. Abiotic stress response is routinely dissected to component physiological traits. Use of transgene(s) has {{led to the development of}} transgenic events, which could provide enhanced adaptation to abiotic stresses that are exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is also associated with declining nutritional quality of food crops. Micronutrient-dense cultivars have been released in selected areas of the developing world, while various nutritionally enhanced lines are in the <b>release</b> <b>pipeline.</b> The high-throughput phenomic platforms are allowing researchers to accurately measure plant growth and development, analyze nutritional traits, and assess response to stresses on large sets of individuals. Analogs for tomorrow’s agriculture offer a virtual natural laboratory to innovate and test technological options to develop climate resilience production systems. Increased use of agrobiodiversity is crucial to coping with adverse impacts of global warming on food and feed production and quality. No one solution will suffice to adapt to climate change and its variability. Suits of technological innovations, including climate-resilient crop cultivars, will be needed to feed 9 billion people who will be living in the Earth by the middle of the twenty-first century...|$|E
40|$|Service Desk systems, {{which are}} also known as Helpdesk or issue {{tracking}} systems, provide the ability to track “requests for service”. Such systems are in common use in many different organisations tracking requests raised by external customers, internally or automatically. For such a system to be usable in many different domains it must provide for {{a high level of}} customisation allowing it to be tailored to the specific requirements of each environment. Current solutions that exhibit this flexibility are commercial products whilst those that are freely available being either inflexible or highly domain-specific. The purpose of this project is to define, design, and implement an extensible service desk system which could be customised or extended as required to make it applicable cross-domain and release this as free open-source software. A literature review was conducted covering aspects of service desks in general as well as techniques and methods used to build extensible systems and the common choices of implementation language. From an analysis of this review a set of high-level requirements and an overall system design were defined. An identified aspect of web-based multi user systems, ensuring updates to interface displays, was examined in detail. This included an experiment on the feasibility of using an alternative technique than regular polling for updates. From the high-level design a detailed set of designs for the software were created and then implemented in an iterative and incremental manner. A website and documentation were built to support dissemination of the software for which a specific set of <b>release</b> <b>pipeline</b> tools were implemented enabling packaging into “release versions” for general use including an installer. Ongoing functional testing through a created unit test framework was performed on new features as they were added and on existing features as a form of integration testing. An evaluation of the system {{in the form of an}} online questionnaire was completed and the results analysed. Feedback on the system was positive with a high proportion of respondents indicating they were satisfied with the system and would recommend it to others. A comparison of delivered features against the requirements analysis identified that all requirements of the system both for standard service desk function and relating to extensibility were met...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{open-source}} pipeline for face registration based on Gaussian processes {{as well as an}} application to face image analysis. Non-rigid registration of faces is significant for many applications in computer vision, such as the construction of 3 D Morphable face models (3 DMMs). Gaussian Process Morphable Models (GPMMs) unify a variety of non-rigid deformation models with B-splines and PCA models as examples. GPMM separate problem specific requirements from the registration algorithm by incorporating domain-specific adaptions as a prior model. The novelties of this paper are the following: (i) We present a strategy and modeling technique for face registration that considers symmetry, multi-scale and spatially-varying details. The registration is applied to neutral faces and facial expressions. (ii) We release an open-source software framework for registration and model-building, demonstrated on the publicly available BU 3 D-FE database. The <b>released</b> <b>pipeline</b> also contains an implementation of an Analysis-by-Synthesis model adaption of 2 D face images, tested on the Multi-PIE and LFW database. This enables the community to reproduce, evaluate and compare the individual steps of registration to model-building and 3 D/ 2 D model fitting.

40|$|Background: The Pathway Ontology (PW) {{developed}} at the Rat Genome Database (RGD), covers all types of biological pathways, including altered and disease pathways and captures the relationships between them within the hierarchical structure of a directed acyclic graph. The ontology allows for the standardized annotation of rat, and of human and mouse genes to pathway terms. It also constitutes a vehicle for easy navigation between gene and ontology report pages, between reports and interactive pathway diagrams, between pathways directly connected within a diagram and between those that are globally related in pathway suites and suite networks. Surveys of the literature {{and the development of}} the Pathway and Disease Portals are important sources for the ongoing development of the ontology. User requests and mapping of pathways in other databases to terms in the ontology further contribute to increasing its content. Recently built automated pipelines use the mapped terms to make available the annotations generated by other groups. Results: The two <b>released</b> <b>pipelines</b> – the Pathway Interaction Database (PID) Annotation Import Pipeline and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Annotation Import Pipeline, make available over 7, 400 and 31, 000 pathway gene annotations, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a risk assessment}} methodology for high-pressure CO 2 pipelines developed at the Health and Safety Laboratory {{as part of the}} EU FP 7 project CO 2 Pipehaz. Traditionally, consequence modelling of dense gas <b>releases</b> from <b>pipelines</b> at major hazard impact levels is performed using integral models with limited or no consideration being given to weather bias or topographical features of the surrounding terrain. Whilst dispersion modelling of CO 2 <b>releases</b> from <b>pipelines</b> using three-dimensional CFD models may provide higher levels of confidence in the predicted behaviour of the cloud, the use of such models is resource-intensive and usually impracticable. An alternative is to use more computationally efficient shallow layer or Lagrangian dispersion models that are able to account for the effects of topography whilst generating results within a reasonably short time frame. In the present work, the proposed risk assessment methodology for CO 2 pipelines is demonstrated using a shallow-layer dispersion model to generate contours from a sequence of release points along the pipeline. The simulations use realistic terrain taken from UK topographical data. Individual and societal risk levels {{in the vicinity of the}} pipeline are calculated using the Health and Safety Laboratory's risk assessment tool QuickRisk. Currently, the source term for a CO 2 release is not well understood because of its complex thermodynamic properties and its tendency to form solid particles under specific pressure and temperature conditions. This is a key knowledge gap and any subsequent dispersion modelling, particularly when including topography, may be affected by the accuracy of the source term...|$|R

40|$|The {{deployment}} {{of a complete}} {{carbon capture and storage}} chain requires a focus upon the hazards posed by the operation of pipelines transporting carbon dioxide (CO 2) at high pressure in a dense-phase (supercritical or liquid state).
