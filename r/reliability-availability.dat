40|$|The {{rationale}} behind the ITUR project (Basque word for “source”) is {{to perform a}} comparison between {{the different kinds of}} H − ion sources using the same beam diagnostics setup. In particular, a direct comparison will be made in terms of the emittance characteristics of Penning Type sources such as those currently in use in the injector for the ISIS (UK) Pulsed Neutron Source and those of volumetric type such as that driving the injector for the ORNL Spallation Neutron Source (TN, U. S. A.). The endeavour here pursued is thus to build an Ion Source Test Stand where virtually any type of source can be tested and its features measured and, thus compared to the results of other sources under the same gauge. It would be possible then to establish a common ground for effectively comparing different ion sources. The long term objectives are thus to contribute towards the building of minimum emittance, maximum performance, high <b>reliability-availability,</b> high percentage of desired particle production, stability and high brightness compact sources. The first phase of such a research programme which is financed through ministries of Industry and Education & Science [1] is well underway and consists on a test stand able to compare the emittance characteristics of both ECR proton and-H arc-discharge sources suc...|$|E
40|$|Fault {{tolerance}} to support mission life reliability {{is a key}} consideration in many system applications. Redundancy for defect tolerance, i. e., yeld enhancement, and wafer-level reliability enhancement have been standard practice {{since the advent of}} wafer scale technology. Korea [1], [21, [31, [4], [51 and others have shown how effective static redundancy techniques can bc for improving both yield and reliability. However, designers are often faced with the conflicting goals of maximizing system reliability and minimizing hardware. Not only are these two goals contradictory, but there is a point of diminishing return relative to the cost effectiveness of increasing system reliability at the expense of adding spare hardware. At ICWSI ' 93, Samson [6] presented an approach for optimizing real-time fault tolerance design in WSI via the <b>Reliability-Availability</b> Product. The approach was [xtsed upon the identification of fundamental optimization metrics, represented by simple product and quotient (reciprocal product) relationships, which extend traditional cost/benefit analysis to fault tolerance in VLSI and wafer scale architectures and systems [71. The Reliability-Hardware Quotient (RHQ) is an example of another fundamental composite metric which is useful for identifying the optimal design point in a VSLI or wafer scale system. In this paper, this metric is applied to the problem of optimizing a two-level distributed (parallel) processing architecture. In particular, a graphical optimization lechnique using the 3 D and contour plot features of Mathematica TM [81 is introduced which characterizes the trade space and identifies the optimum design point. The constraints of wafer scale technology can bc superimposed upon the optimal solution space either to identify the limits o [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies show}} that future human explorations {{missions}} are composed of multi-vehicle assemblies with interconnected electric power systems. Some vehicles are often intended to serve as flexible multi-purpose or multi-mission platforms. This drives the need for power architectures that can be reconfigured to support this level of flexibility. Power system developmental costs can be reduced, program wide, by utilizing {{a common set of}} modular building blocks. Further, there are mission operational and logistics cost benefits of using a common set of modular spares. These benefits are the goals of the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Modular Power System (AMPS) project. A common set of modular blocks requires a substantial level of standardization in terms of the Electrical, Data System, and Mechanical interfaces. The AMPS project is developing a set of proposed interface standards that will provide useful guidance for modular hardware developers but not needlessly constrain technology options, or limit future growth in capability. In 2015 the AMPS project focused on standardizing the interfaces between the elements of spacecraft power distribution and energy storage. The development of the modular power standard starts with establishing mission assumptions and ground rules to define design application space. The standards are defined in terms of AMPS objectives including Commonality, <b>Reliability-Availability,</b> Flexibility-Configurability and Supportability-Reusability. The proposed standards are aimed at assembly and sub-assembly level building blocks. AMPS plans to adopt existing standards for spacecraft command and data, software, network interfaces, and electrical power interfaces where applicable. Other standards including structural encapsulation, heat transfer, and fluid transfer, are governed by launch and spacecraft environments and bound by practical limitations of weight and volume. Developing these mechanical interface standards is more difficult but an essential part of defining physical building blocks of modular power. This presentation describes the AMPS projects progress towards standardized modular power interfaces...|$|E
40|$|Drought is a {{recurring}} event in Africa. The recent drought, affecting large swathes of {{eastern and southern}} Africa, is not exceptional. For many, drought is associated with food insecurity: rains fail; crops wither; food supplies dwindle; entitlement to food declines and people go hungry. The response, {{on the part of}} government and donors, is typically food aid ‘to save lives’. Yet food insecurity is not the only concern during drought, and is not an isolated concern. One of the principal aims of this report – a synthesis of over four years’ research – is to show how livelihoods are affected by declining access to food and water, with access to both linked in a number of important ways. Implications for policy, to protect livelihoods before lives are threatened, are highlighted. The report begins with a description of the evolution and scope of the project ‘Groundwater drought early warning for vulnerable areas’, and the rationale for working in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Chapter 2 then reviews key lessons learned from the 1991 – 92 southern Africa drought and, in particular, discusses which measures and policies were effective in meeting the water needs of rural populations. The Ethiopia study is described in more detail in Chapter 3, in terms of the methodology used for site selection, mapping and fieldwork exercises. Background information on the physical and socioeconomic characteristics of the area is also presented. Chapter 4 then discusses key findings, focussing on the mapping approach to water <b>reliability-availability</b> differentiation, and the village-level survey approach to water security analysis. Policy implications for water supply development and drought planning in Ethiopia are also discussed. Chapter 5 then pulls together (a) findings from the Ethiopia study, with (b) lessons learned from the 1991 – 92 southern Africa drought, and (c) more recent work on water and sustainable livelihoods, to make recommendations on drought planning, early warning, and development programmes more generally available. KEY MESSAGED 1. The impact of drought and the nature of livelihood vulnerability Droughts affect livelihoods {{in a number of different}} ways, cutting across sector perspectives and disciplines. Yet in many countries drought management − or more typically relief − focuses almost exclusively on the question of food needs. Other dimensions of vulnerability receive much less attention despite evidence that factors such as access to secure water can be a major problem. This reflects the organisation and remit of government and donor bureaucracies, rather than livelihood realities. Fundamental to understanding water security is an analysis of water availability, access and use. 2. Interdependencies between food and water security: Food and water security are related. Food security, for example, is an outcome of a set of vulnerabilities, dependent on how people gain access to production and exchange opportunities. This, in turn, is influenced by the broad expenditure, in time, labour or money, invested by households in gaining access to water. In many rural environments, moreover, domestic water is a production input, in garden irrigation, livestock watering, brewing and brick-making. Water insecurity can, therefore, affect − directly and indirectly − wider household production and income earning opportunities, as well as the quality and quantity of water consumption. 3. The need to incorporate an understanding of drought preparedness and early warning Maps depicting groundwater availability under drought conditions provide useful awareness raising and planning tools. At a national scale, however, they cannot provide the kind of local-level information on water availability, access and use that is necessary to plan water supply projects, or identify vulnerable groups. Investment in regional mapping, combined with local water security assessment, would provide both. By widening the scope of existing local-level food and/or poverty assessments to include simple indicators of water security, a clearer picture of livelihood security, and the interventions needed to support it, could be gained at little extra cost. Water supply interventions – rehabilitation, repair, well deepening, help with water transport – coordinated with food security/ asset rebuilding efforts, could help sustain income, production and consumption in the early stages of drought, or in the aftermath of a bad year...|$|E
