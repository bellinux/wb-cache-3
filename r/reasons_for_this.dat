5|$|The {{name of the}} {{lighthouse}} was changed in 1964 from Dhuheartach to the present form Dubh Artach. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> are not clear, although the latter is arguably easier to spell for anglophones.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} this species is quite restricted, it being {{confined}} to thorn acacia country in southern Ethiopia near Yavello (Javello), Mega, and Arero. It can be curiously absent from apparently suitable country near these areas; the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> are not apparent.|$|E
5|$|The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> drastic {{population}} reduction {{are thought}} to be due to agricultural improvements, abandonment of extensive management, and deforestation. As the area of the Gentiana cruciata, the food plant that the P. rebeli depends on, decreases, the P. rebeli population also decreases.|$|E

5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> have {{as much to do}} with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{deforestation}} {{has resulted}} in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; {{one of the main}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.|$|E
5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion of clay minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as diarrhoea. Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E

5|$|In 1907 {{the company}} was seeking to wind up the Aston Cantlow Mill Ball and Bearing Company Ltd.

Charles Henry Prideaux was appointed to represent the company on the liquidation committee for Leitner Electrical Company Ltd in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In {{some ways}} the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{fried chicken}} has stereotypically been {{associated}} with African-Americans. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> are various. Chicken dishes were popular among slaves before the Civil War, as chickens were generally the only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own. Minstrel shows and the film The Birth of a Nation led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|Several {{organisms are}} capable of rolling locomotion; however, true wheels and propellers—despite their utility in human vehicles—do not appear to play a {{significant}} role in the movement of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which function like corkscrews). Biologists have expounded on the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E
5|$|The disorganized {{nature of}} the British retreat {{demonstrated}} a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, {{to the surprise of}} some in his army, ordered a retreat {{all the way back to}} the south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> claims that the general must have panicked.|$|E

5|$|The {{onset of}} the Second World War {{demonstrated}} that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were a variety of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation.

5|$|Tornadoes kill {{an average}} of 179 people per year in Bangladesh, {{the most in the}} world. <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> include the region's high {{population}} density, poor construction quality, and lack of tornado safety knowledge. Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, the La Plata Basin area, portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand {{was one of}} the pioneers ofan emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> varied from Delaroche's depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those who were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E

5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended for very young readers, such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who Stopped to Help and The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E
5|$|By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a {{widespread}} holarctic species. Horse bones {{from this time}} period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America. Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival. Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.|$|E
