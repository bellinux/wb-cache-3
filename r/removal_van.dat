40|$|An {{electric}} motor driven centrifugal compressor to supply gas for further compression and reinjection on a petroleum production platform in the North Sea was examined.

Mixed hydrocarbon gas was chosen for the test to meet discharge temperature restrictions. The module was used as the test site.

Urbanization in the watersheds of cold-water streams threatens to degrade these valuable water resources. Since the temperature of these streams is typically maintained by significant amounts of groundwater recharge and riparian shading, the land cover con-version associated with urban development – replacement of crop-land, prairie, and forests with buildings, roads, lawns, and parking lots – has a negative impact, as these land-use changes can dramat-become hotter than natural surfaces due to lack of shading by veg-etation, and on a short time scale can produce warmer runoff to receiving streams during and after rainfall events.
