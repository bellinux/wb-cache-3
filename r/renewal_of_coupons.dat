Instead, managers generally examine a number of subsidiary measures such as: redemption rates, market share and the direct costs <b>of</b> the <b>coupon</b> promotion. A user-oriented computer model is presented for simulating the effect <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> promotions on sales and calculating net profitability. The model includes the actions of the manufacturer, retailers, and consumers. It takes into account three key phenomena of consumer response: the acceleration of product category purchases, the brand loyalty <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> redeemers, and repeat purchase effects. The model also incorporates the effects of retailer promotions that often accompany a coupon program.

40|$|Abstract — Motivated by {{the study}} of {{peer-to-peer}} file swarming systems à la BitTorrent, we introduce a probabilistic model <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> replication systems. These systems consist of users, aiming to complete a collection <b>of</b> distinct <b>coupons.</b> Users are characterised by their current collection <b>of</b> <b>coupons,</b> and leave the system once they complete their coupon collection. The system evolution is then specified by describing how users of distinct types meet, and which coupons get replicated upon such encounters. For open systems, with exogenous user arrivals, we derive necessary and sufficient stability conditions in a layered scenario, where encounters are between users holding the same number <b>of</b> <b>coupons.</b> We also consider a system where encounters are between users chosen uniformly at random from the whole population. We show that performance, captured by sojourn time, is asymptotically optimal in both systems as the number <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> types becomes large. We also consider closed systems with no exogenous user arrivals. In a special scenario where users have only one missing coupon, we evaluate {{the size of the}} population ultimately remaining in the system, as the initial number of users, N, goes to infinity. We show that this decreases geometrically with the number <b>of</b> <b>coupons,</b> K. In particular, when the ratio K / log(N) is above a critical threshold, we prove that this number of leftovers is of order log(log(N)). These results suggest that performance of file swarming systems does not depend critically on either altruistic user behavior, or on load balancing strategies such as rarest first. I...|$|R

40|$|Coupons are {{collected}} {{one at a}} time from a population containing n distinct types <b>of</b> <b>coupon.</b> The process is repeated until all n coupon have been collected and the total number of draws, Y, from the population is recorded. It is assumed that the draws from the population are independent and identically distributed (draws with replacement) according to a probability distribution X with the probability that a type i coupon is drawn being P(X = i). The special case where each type <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> is equally likely to be drawn from the population is the classic coupon collector problem. We consider the asymptotic distribution Y (appropriately normalized) as the number <b>of</b> <b>coupons</b> n → ∞ under general assumptions upon the asymptotic distribution of X.

Two normalizations of Y are considered, the choice of normalization depending upon whether or not a suitable Poisson limit exists for W(t).
