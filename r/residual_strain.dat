Thick composite cylinders were manufactured with wet impreg-nation of E-glass and graphite fibers in the epoxy resin systems. The radial stiffness and strength and the coefficients of thermal expansion were first measured. Hybrid two-ring composite rotors of glass and graphite fibers with equal thickness were manufactured for three different inner to outer radius ratios, i. e., 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5.

5000|$|The next crucial {{stage is}} load application. This {{issue has been}} widely {{investigated}} {{but there is no}} loading path universally adopted by the testing laboratories. It has to be said that the loading cycles mainly depend on the scope of the test and it is unrealistic to consider the possibility of elaborating a single loading path able to fulfil at the same time all the requirements imposed by the investigation of the initial behaviour, the service behaviour, the behaviour at breaking load and long term behaviour. This part of the procedure should provide a valid approach to the establishment of a load profile, describing the effects of the parameters involved, in order to fully investigate the material response according to the required repeatability.Since coated fabrics do not follow an elastic behaviour, once the stress is removed the sample maintains a certain level of permanent strain, a plastic deformation. This behaviour is known as <b>residual</b> <b>strain</b> and is present both in monoaxial and biaxial tests. The main value of <b>residual</b> <b>strain</b> is shown {{between the first and second}} load cycle, decreasing to zero after a number of cycles that depends on the material properties, the applied load and the time for which it has been applied. This is due to the creep of the yarns and the coating material and to the internal frictional effects. In order to obtain a realistic description of the material the strain should be measured within a unique load cycle, assuming equal to zero the strain at pre-stress. For this reason the loading cycle considered for the strain measure is generally preceded by identical cycles in a number sufficient to stabilise the sample response. In order to remove the <b>residual</b> <b>strain</b> previous researches considered adequate the application of five identical loading and unloading cycles, the TensiNet design guide consider three or five repetitions to be sufficient, depending on the testing protocol. While the Membrane Structures Association of Japan [...] prescribes the repetition of the cycles three times, but only for the 1:1 load ratio which separates the others. This offers several advantages in the comparison of readings carried out within the same test and with other tests.|$|E

This type of heterostructure is composed of an epitaxial magnetoelastic thin film grown on a piezoelectric substrate. For this system, application of a magnetic field will induce {{a change in the}} dimension of the magnetoelastic film. This process, called magnetostriction, will alter <b>residual</b> <b>strain</b> conditions in the magnetoelastic film, which can be transferred through the interface to the piezoelectric substrate. Consequently, a polarization is introduced in the substrate through the piezoelectric process. The overall effect is that the polarization of the ferroelectric substrate is manipulated by an application of a magnetic field, which is the desired magnetoelectric effect. In this case, the interface {{plays an important role in}} mediating the responses from one component to another, realizing the magnetoelectric coupling. For an efficient coupling, a high-quality interface with optimal strain state is desired. In light of this interest, advanced deposition techniques have been applied to synthesize these types of thin film heterostructures.

In the attempts of understanding strain adaptive phenomena within bones, different theoretical models have been proposed. Also, the existing literatures mostly follow the measurement of surface strains using strain gauges to experimentally quantify the strains experienced in the functional environment. In this work, we propose a novel idea of understanding site-specific functional adaptation to the prolonged load in bone on the basis of inherited <b>residual</b> <b>strains</b> and structural organization.

As the coating microstructure is complex, non-destructive characterization of <b>residual</b> <b>strain,</b> e. g. using neutron diffraction, provides a useful measure of through thickness strain profile without altering the stress field. This first detailed study using a neutron diffraction technique, non-destructively evaluates the through thickness strain measurement in nanostructured hydroxyapatite plasma sprayed coatings on a titanium alloy substrate (as-sprayed, heat treated, and heat treated then soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF)). The influence of crystallographic plane orientation on the <b>residual</b> <b>strain</b> measurement is shown to indicate texturing in the coating. This texturing is expected to influence both the biological and fracture response of HA coatings. Results are discussed in terms of the influence of heat-treatment and SBF on the residual stress profile for these biomedical coatings. The results show that the through thickness <b>residual</b> <b>strain</b> in all three coatings was different for different crystallographic planes but was on average tensile.
