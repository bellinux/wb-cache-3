Before 1972 the sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> had been generally above normal except {{in the early years of}} the 1960 s, since 1973 it has been below normal with a large yearly change.

On the Alaskan and the Siberian sides the sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> began to decrease slightly after about 1980. On the Canadian side, after a decrease of sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in the 1970 s, it has increased in the 1980 s. According to comparison between time series of sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> and that of meteorological data (height of 500 hPa isobar), a wide <b>area</b> of sea <b>ice</b> corresponded to low height of the 500 hPa isobar in the 1960 s and narrow area to high height in the 1980 s, but this correspondence was not good in the 1950 s and 1970 s.

40|$|Global {{warming is}} one of the most serious {{problems}} the earth is facing in the 21 st Century. In order to detect the sign of global warming, the importance of sea ice monitoring is increasing. Especially, sea ice thickness is an key parameter for understanding the heat flux of sea <b>ice</b> <b>area.</b> However, estimation of sea ice thickness with satellite remote sensing is not easy. In this study authors have examined the possibility of extracting thin sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> from remotely sensed data from space. The study was performed in the Sea of Okhotsk. Firstly, the possibility of estimating thin ice thickness with high resolution optical sensor RSI(IFOV = 8 m) on FORMOSAT- 2 satellite was examined. The comparison of RSI data with in situ measurement of ice thickness suggested the possibility of estimating sea ice thickness with RSI data for less than 20 cm under the cloudless and snow free condition. The correlation between RSI data and MODIS data(IFOV = 250 m) was also examined for the thin <b>ice</b> <b>area.</b> The result also suggested the possibility of extracting thin sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> from MODIS data. Based on these results, the authors have examined possibility of extracting thin sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> with passive microwave sensor AMSR-E by using thin <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> estimated with MODIS data as truth data. Since the horizontal polarization of 19 GHz are more sensitive to water than the vertical polarization of 19 GHz, the authors have utilized the polarization difference of 19 GHz for extracting thin sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> from AMSR-E data.

Though the mean sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> has decreased steadily in the period of satellite observations, a dramatic transition in the dynamics was initiated with the record low September <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in 2007. The change is much more pronounced in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle than in the annual mean <b>ice</b> <b>area.</b> The shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly constant for the whole observational record despite the general decline. A simple explanation, independent of the increased greenhouse warming, for the shape of the seasonal cycle is offered. Thus the dramatic climate change in arctic <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> is seen in the amplitude of the cycle and to a lesser extend the annual mean and the summer ice extend. The reason why the climate change is most pronounced in the amplitude is related to the rapid reduction in perennial ice and thus a thinning of the ice.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to {{the global}} warming, {{importance}} of monitoring sea ice distribution is increasing. Ice thickness {{is one of the}} most important parameters of sea ice. In thin <b>ice</b> <b>areas,</b> the heat flux of ice is strongly affected by the ice thickness difference. Thus, the extraction of thin <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> is quite important from global warming monitoring point of view. In 2014, the authors have developed an algorithm to detect thin <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in the Sea of Okhotsk using the brightness temperature data derived from the passive microwave radiometer AMSR 2 on board GCOM-W 1 satellite. The basic algorithm is to use the brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR 2 19 GHz polarization difference (V–H) vs 19 GHz V polarization. In this study, we have investigated the possibility of applying the thin ice algorithm to the Bering Sea. Since the Bering Sea is located in higher latitude than the Okhotsk Sea, some parameter tuning of the algorithm was expected. The authors have examined the parameter of the algorithm and have verified the result by overlaying the extracted thin <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> on simultaneously observed MODIS images taken under the cloudless weather condition.

The role of preconditioning of the ice cover versus intrinsic variations in determining sea ice conditions is examined using ensemble experiments initialized in January with identical ice–ocean–terrestrial conditions. Assessing the divergence among the ensemble members reveals that sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> exhibits potential predictability during the first summer and for winter conditions after a year. The <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> exhibits little potential predictability during the spring transition season.

40|$|Abstract. The {{surface wind}} field is an {{important}} factor controlling the surface mass balance of Antarctica. This paper focuses on the observed atmospheric circulation during summer of an Antarctic blue <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> in Queen Maud Land. Blue <b>ice</b> <b>areas</b> are characterised by a negative surface mass balance and henceforth provide an interesting location to study the influence of meteorological processes on large local mass balance gradients. During lapse conditions, synoptic forcing determines the surface-layer flow. No significant horizontal temperature gradient with coastal stations could be detected along isobaric surfaces, indicating weak or absent thermal wind. Observations performed at the coastal stations Halley and Georg von Neumayer show the pronounced effects of synoptic forcing. The surface winds in the valley of the blue <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> could be divided into two distinct flow patterns, occurring with about equal frequency during the experiment. Flow type I is associated with cyclonic activity at the coast, resulting in strong easterly winds, precipitation and drifting snow. Flow characteristics inside and outside of the valley are similar during these conditions. Flow type I/occurs when a high pressure system develops in the Weddell Sea, weakening the free atmosphere geostrophic winds. A local circulation is able to develop inside the valley of the blue <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> during these tranquil conditions. The transition from flow type II to flow type I is associated with front-like phenomena inside the valley. Some simple theoretical considerations show that surface-layer stability and the upper air geostrophic wind determine the surface flow direction in the valley. Finally, the influence of the observed circulation on the energy and mass balance of the blue <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> is discussed. 1...|$|R

The results imply a considerable role of long-term natural climate variations in the modern sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> decrease. Estimates of the possible probability’s changes of the dangerous events of strong winds and high waves in the Arctic basin and favorable navigation conditions for the Northern Sea Route in the 21 st century are made based on numerical model calculations. An increase of extreme wave height is found {{to the middle of the}} 21 st century for Kara and Chukchi Seas as a consequence of prolonged run length and increased surface winds. </span...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that increasing atmospheric CO 2 results in global warming, {{leading to a}} decline in polar sea <b>ice</b> <b>area.</b> Here, the specific question of whether there is a tipping point in the sea ice cover is investigated. The global climate model HadCM 3 is used to map the trajectory of sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> under idealised scenarios. The atmospheric CO 2 is first ramped up to four times pre-industrial levels (4 × CO 2 ), then ramped down to pre-industrial levels. We also examine the impact of stabilising climate at 4 × CO 2 prior to ramping CO 2 down to pre-industrial levels. Against global mean temperature, Arctic sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> is reversible, while the Antarctic sea ice shows some asymmetric behaviour – its rate of change slower, with falling temperatures, than its rate of change with rising temperatures. However, we show that the asymmetric behaviour is driven by hemispherical differences in temperature change between transient and stabilisation periods. We find no irreversible behaviour in the sea ice cover...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} age-structured model for two krill populations near the Antarctic Peninsula and {{estimate}} the relative recruitment events that reproduce observed trends in krill abundance and age structure. Estimates of recruitment in both regions show a nonlinear relationship between recruitment and sea <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> {{in the combined}} Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas from the previous winter and spring, with large recruitment events occurring over a narrow range of <b>ice</b> <b>area,</b> and minimal recruitment otherwise. This finding may allow for an adaptive approach in which future catch limits are adjusted based on predictions of biomass. This result also suggests that the ecosystem may change dramatically once average <b>ice</b> <b>area</b> drops below the recruitment threshold. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) {{is one of the}} most rapidly changing regions on the planet (Vaughn et al. 2003). Air temperatures warmed by over 3 uC and summer surface ocean temperatures warmed by over 1 uC over the past 50 years (Meredith and King 2005). Sea ice concentration also showed a decline, although the timing and magnitude of this decline remain debated. Based o...|$|R
