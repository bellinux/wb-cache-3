30|$|Flushing I/O <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> staging queues to {{dispatch}} queue BID-HDD dequeues the I/O <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> staging queues and enqueues them {{to dispatch}} queue. As discussed in Algorithm 2, BID dispatches the <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> the earliest marked staging queue and follows the marking sequence. The size of dispatch queue {{depends on the}} device driver specification and all the I/O <b>requests</b> <b>from</b> staging queue may not get dispatched at once. BID ensures that a staging queue is fully flushed before considering the next marked staging queue. This prevents multiplexing of I/O requests, thereby involves less movement of the disk arm to disjoint locations in the physical media.|$|R

5|$|Abandoned or rebellious villages were {{destroyed}} by Ibrahim Pasha's troops, which prevented their inhabitants from returning. Ibrahim's army razed 16 villages before taking Nablus. He also forced {{the heads of the}} Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. The absence of the traditional local leadership due to exile or execution left Palestine's urban population to be financially exploited by both the government and its local opponents. The imprisoned headmen of villages were replaced by their sons, although Ibrahim Pasha demoted them as nawatir (watchmen) instead of the higher-ranking title of mukhtar. Qasim's son Mahmud replaced him and the popularity of his father among the peasantry compelled the rural chiefs of Jabal Nablus to <b>request</b> <b>from</b> the government that Mahmud replace Sulaiman Abd al-Hadi as mutasallim of Nablus.|$|E

5|$|British {{military}} forces in Kenya were {{made aware of the}} revolution at 4:45am on 12 January, and following a <b>request</b> <b>from</b> the Sultan were put on 15 minutes' standby to conduct an assault on Zanzibar's airfield. However, the British High Commissioner in Zanzibar, Timothy Crosthwait, reported no instances of British nationals being attacked and advised against intervention. As a result, the British troops in Kenya were reduced to four hours' standby later that evening. Crosthwait decided not to approve an immediate evacuation of British citizens, as many held key government positions and their sudden removal would further disrupt the country's economy and government. To avoid possible bloodshed, the British agreed a timetable with Karume for an organised evacuation.|$|E
