5|$|The chapel is unrealistically small {{compared}} to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the Redemption. The panel {{is one of three}} surviving of van der Weyden's in which both Madonna and Child are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that the niche exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous with the edge of the painting, almost as part of the frame, a <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is thought to predate The Madonna Standing.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
5|$|Initially, BioWare {{denied that}} a PlayStation 3 version {{was in the}} works. Despite this, it was {{reported}} that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of code referencing the PlayStation 3. BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is a cross-platform, which is the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> includes PlayStation 3 code. Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses {{a modified version of the}} Unreal Engine 3 called Mass Effect 3 engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming Mass Effect 3. In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the PlayStation 3 controller. An option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.|$|E

5|$|Mongolia's central {{geographical}} {{position on}} the Asian continent was an important <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was able to play such {{a large role in}} the trade system. The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire. The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travellers on these routes. Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire. A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised. To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing, the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travellers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E

25|$|Next, Wentworth {{surveyed}} the major Catholic landowners in Leinster for similar treatment, {{including members of}} the powerful Butler dynasty. Wentworth's plans were interrupted by {{the outbreak of the}} Bishops Wars in Scotland, which eventually resulted in Wentworth's execution by the English Parliament and civil war in England and Ireland. Wentworth's constant questioning of Catholic land titles was one of the major causes of the 1641 Rebellion, and the principal <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was joined by Ireland's wealthiest and most powerful Catholic families.|$|E

25|$|Church doctrines {{teach that}} those who were once saved by God are {{completely}} detached from the sins they will ever commit {{in the future and}} guaranteed a path to heaven.

The church was held to be a cult by the conservative Christian denomination, the General Assembly of Presbyterian Churches, in 1992.

25|$|The Helwan-300 {{project was}} {{cancelled}} on May 1969. The real <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was cancelled {{remains a mystery}} {{but it can be}} inferred that the cancellation was due to many factors varying between technical, financial and political difficulties. The German engineers working on the design had to evacuate Egypt due to tensions with the Federal Republic of Germany, which led the development effort to stall. In order to fill the void created by the cancellation of this project, Egypt made close contacts with the Soviet Union and purchased aircraft instead of developing indigenous designs.|$|E
25|$|An {{instantaneous}} evaluation about {{intentions of}} an approaching person or subject based upon visual clues might have very strong connection with initial stages of biological evolution. The <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> happens so quickly inside our brains {{has to do with}} both risks and benefits subjected with any person or subject that is being encountered at very first time. The latency time of an entire evaluation process suggests a crucial adaption done by pre-historic creatures based upon their earlier experiences of encounters with strangers. Lesser time the process of identification takes, better are the chances of survival.|$|E
25|$|The {{central zone}} of Lofn (100120km in diameter) {{corresponds}} to the crater floor, which lies about 0.6km below the surrounding cratered plains. Lofn is a shallow crater as compared to other craters of similar size. This is the main <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is called a flat-floored or anomalous dome crater. Other examples of such craters are Doh and Bran. The hummocky terrain (rim) surrounding the floor consists of randomly distributed massifs as large as 50km and has mottled appearance at some places. The width of the rim unit varies from about 18km on the north-west side to more than 130km on the south-east side.|$|E

In 1999, he was commissioned {{to produce a}} sixty-second commercial for Kingdom Holding Company controlled by Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, nephew of the Saudi Arabian King Abdullah. The production involved the use of over 50 helicopters for an 18-week reconnaissance and shoot at multiple locations around the world, followed by a massive three months in post-production.

25|$|In Ireland the {{commencement}} of the Iron Age around 600 BC is generally believed {{to coincide with the}} first appearance in this country of Celtic-speaking peoples. There is little archaeological evidence to support the theory of a large-scale Celtic invasion (or series of invasions), but {{it is quite possible that}} small groups of migrants, highly skilled in the art of war and armed with superior iron weaponry, were powerful enough to gain a foothold in the island and eventually succeeded in subjugating or absorbing the pre-Celtic natives; in the 12th century of the Common Era small bands of heavily armed Anglo-Normans did just this, so there is no conceivable <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> could not also have happened in the pre-Christian era.|$|E
