[...] His articles and reviews have appeared in the Huffington Post; the Journal of Transatlantic Studies; the Journal of American History; Geography of Religions and Belief Systems; the Journal of Historical Sociology; Human Resource Development Quarterly; and the SBS (Swiss Business School) Journal of Applied Business Research, among others. The conceptual framework Vann uses to analyze the relationship between belief systems and spaces, including nations and towns is called geotheology (the general relationship between the worship of the divine and spaces, including nations). Geotheology is a concept conceived by geographer John Kirtland Wright (1891-1969). [...] <b>Recognizing</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> Wright’s taxonomy in describing how people view the forces of nature as mechanisms through which divine agents deliver punishments and rewards on wayward or deserving people, Vann added geotheomisthosis (earth, God, reward) and geotheokolasis (“earth, God, punishment”). To capture the ways in which secular people see human environmental interactions, Vann coined geokolasis (earth punishes) and geomisthosis (earth rewards). In addition to work in the area of geotheology, Vann has also contributed insights into the interface between history and geography, as well as issues related to overpopulation and environmental hazards. [...] Vann obtained his Ph.D. in Historical Geography, dually awarded by the faculties of Church History and Earth and Geographical Sciences, from the University of Glasgow and also holds a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in adult education with a focus in community development from the University of Arkansas. He received an M.S. in Geography from Western Kentucky University and a B.S. in Social Sciences from Tennessee Technological University. He also received an A.S. from Roane State Community College and was selected for their 2012 Outstanding Alumni award. Although a distant relative of Cherokee Chief James Vann and comedian Will Rogers, Professor Vann’s early life was typical of poor families living in southern Appalachia in the mid-twentieth century. He was born Barry Walker, son of a single mother, in Clinton, Tennessee, on March 30, 1960. The home in which his family lived did not have plumbing, and heat was provided by wood fuel or coal burned in a stove. His parents were Dorothy A. Voyles (b. 1935) and Harry Mack Vann Jr. (1935-2010), but he was raised by Rufus (1912-1995) and Vernedith Voyles (1919-1999), his maternal grandparents. Vann did, however, live at times with his mother, stepfather, and four siblings in Detroit, Michigan. According to Vann in an interview on “Science Fantastic” in 2012, it was his childhood experiences traveling to and from his mother’s neighborhood in Detroit that inspired him to become a geographer. At age 14, Vann sought out his birth father and, with his consent, took his surname at age 20. Professor Vann and his wife Amy have two children, Sarah and Preston.|$|E

40|$|Background. Published work on {{knowledge}} in regional anaesthesia {{has focused on}} competence, for instance by identifying numbers of procedures required to achieve competence, or by defining criteria for successful performance of blocks. We aimed to define expertise in regional anaes-thesia and examine how it is acquired. Methods. We observed anaesthetists performing 15 regional anaesthetic blocks and analysed the resulting transcripts qualitatively and in detail. Results. Expertise in regional anaesthesia encompasses technical fluency but also includes non-cognitive skills such as handling of the patient (communicating, anticipating and minimizing discomfort) and <b>recognizing</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> safe practice (particularly deciding when to stop trying to insert a block). Such elements may be underplayed by the experts who possess them. Focusing on {{a small number of}} regional anaesthetic procedures in detail (as is standard with such qualitative analytical approaches) has also allowed us to develop a model for the acquisition of expertise. In this model, trainees learn how to balance theoretical and practical knowledge by reflection on their clinical experiences, an iterative process which leads to the embedding of knowledge in the expert’s personal repertoire of individual techniques. Conclusions. Expertise in regional anaesthesia extends beyond competence at technical per-formance; non-cognitive elements are also vital. Further work is needed to test our learning model, and the hypothesis that learning can be enhanced by deliberate promotion of the tacit elements of ‘expertise ’ we have described...|$|E
