40|$|The {{conformation}} of the head-to-tail cyclic analogue of bradykinin in DMSO {{was investigated}} by nmr.

A fourth, incomplete set of <b>resonances</b> <b>was</b> <b>detected</b> but not assigned. The three major conformers differ in the conformation at the three X-Pro bonds present. From nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra, three sets of interproton distances were derived and used in NOE-restrained distance geometry calculations. The resulting structures were refined by energy minimization to yield families of structures. Conformer I is characterized by the presence of two type VIb beta-turns between Arg(1) and Gly(4) and between Phe(5) and Phe(8).

30|$|Peculiar radar echoes {{due to the}} {{acoustic}} <b>resonance</b> <b>were</b> <b>detected</b> in periods 1, 2 and 3 indicated in Fig. 2. Their Doppler velocities oscillate with periods of about 2 – 4 min (Fig. 10). In particular, when clear 3 -min oscillations were observed during 1750 – 1830 JST, there appeared almost simultaneously rather irregular, wavy structures in TEC {{to the south of}} the radar FOV. The 3 -min oscillation region had an E-W wavelength of about 400 km and apparently moved westward at about 1.6 km/s. Using 1 -s sampling TEC data, Saito et al. (2011) have found that the TEC spectrum had a dominant peak at 222 s and two minor peaks at 188 s and 268 s caused by {{the acoustic}} resonance, in line with our results. According to Saito et al.

Quartz substrates showed resonances up to 580 GHz, silicon membrane stub resonances reach as high as 480 GHz. An observed resonance at 560 GHz is probably a substrate effect from the membrane.
