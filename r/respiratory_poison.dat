40|$|Several {{thousand}} plant species, {{including many}} economically important food plants, synthesize cyanogenic glycosides and cyanolipids. Upon tissue disruption, these natural products are hydrolyzed liberating the <b>respiratory</b> <b>poison</b> hydrogen cyanide. This phenomenon of cyanogenesis accounts for numerous cases of acute and chronic cyanide poisoning of animals including man. This article reviews information gathered {{during the past}} decade about the enzymology and molecular biology of cyanogenesis in higher plants. How compartmentation normally prevents the large-scale, suicidal release of HCN within the intact plant is discussed. A renewed interest in the physiology of these cyanogenic compounds has revealed that, in addition to providing protection for some species against herbivory, they may also serve as storage forms for reduced nitrogen...|$|E

The antibiotic compound was extracted from the cells and isolated in pure form by crystallization.

The intravenous LD 50 was 1. 0 mg/kg in white mice, whereas the intraperitoneal LD 50 was 1. 50 ± 0. 19 mg/kg. Animals receiving an intraperitoneal injection displayed an incoordination of the hind limbs and impaired reflexes before showing signs of respiratory distress.

The kinetics of chrysobactin-mediated iron transport were determined to have apparent Km and Vmax values of about 30 nM and of 90 pmol/mg. min, respectively. Isomers of chrysobactin and analogs with progressively shorter side chains mediated ferric iron transport as efficiently as the native siderophore, which indicates that the chrysobactin receptor primarily recognizes the catechol-iron center.

40|$|Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a light-powered proton pump {{identified}} by community sequencing of ocean samples. Previous studies have established the ecological distribution and enzymatic activity of PR, but {{its role in}} powering cells and participation in ocean energy fluxes remains unclear. Here, we show that when cellular respiration is inhibited by depleting oxygen or by the <b>respiratory</b> <b>poison</b> azide, Escherichia coli cells expressing PR become light-powered. Illumination of these cells with light coinciding with PR's absorption spectrum creates a proton motive force (pmf) that turns the flagellar motor, yielding cells that swim when illuminated with green light. By measuring the pmf of individual illuminated cells, we quantify the coupling between light-driven and respiratory proton currents, estimate the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of PR (103 photons per second/nm 2), and show that light-driven pumping by PR can fully replace respiration as a cellular energy source in some environmental conditions. Moreover, sunlight-illuminated PR+ cells are less sensitive to azide than PR− cells, consistent with PR+ cells possessing an alternative means of maintaining cellular pmf and, thus, viability.

Two of the strains produced an enzymatically active anaerobic sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase that accumulated in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cells.

Although sulfide is a <b>respiratory</b> <b>poison,</b> {{it is also a}} potent reductant. Geukensia demissa gill mitochondria can use sulfide as a respiratory substrate for ATP production, and the gills of this species exhibit sulfide-supported oxygen consumption that matches the energy demand of ciliary beating. Here, we demonstrate (i) that the major product of G. demissa gill sulfide oxidation is thiosulfate and (ii) that the rate of sulfide oxidation also matches the cellular energy demand, resulting in a ratio near unity of oxygen consumed to sulfide oxidized at both low and high ciliary beat Summary frequencies. A value for this ratio of unity is consistent with electrons from sulfide oxidation entering the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In the gills of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis from sulfide-free conditions, this ratio is 3 – 5 times higher, indicating an uncoupling of oxygen consumption from sulfide oxidation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} metabolic inhibitors and {{light on the}} gliding movement of the hormogonia of the cyanobacterium Nostoc cycadae were examined. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>poisons</b> (sodium cyanide, sodium azide) stopped the movement in the dark, but not in light.

The inhibitory effect of monoiodoacetic acid (MIA) on the gliding movement in light was restored by adding DCMU, suggesting that the gliding movement in light is linked to a cyclic electron flow involving photosystem I, not to a noncyclic electron flow involving photosystem II. This was then proved by experiments on the effects of selected wavelengths of light on the movement; light absorbed by chlorophyll was found to accelerate the movement, but that absorbed by phycobilins did not. The proton-conducting uncouplers carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) immediately abolished the movement.

Non-energy-dependent uptake of 45 -Ca by log-phase cells of Bacillus subtilis occurs under two conditions: at 0 C or in the {{presence}} of m-chlorophenyl carbonylcyanide hydrazone. Similar uptake, but quantitatively less, occurs with Escherichia coli cells under the same conditions. Membrane vesicles prepared from B. subtilis or E. coli accumulate 45 -Ca by a process that does not depend on added energy sources and is not inhibited by the <b>respiratory</b> <b>poison</b> cyanide. The properties of calcium transport in all cases is consistent with carrier-mediated, facilitated transport with specificity Ca- 2 + greater than Sr- 2 + greater than Mn- 2 + greater than Mg- 2 +. Upon transfer of cells from 0 C to 20 C, pre-accumulated 45 -Ca is released. Heat-killed cells do not accumulate 45 -Ca and calcium is released by cells upon addition of toluene (under conditions that do not cause visible lysis).

Cells of C. neoformans that were grown on a non-mannitol-generating carbon source, such as peptone or xylose, were able to convert glucose to mannitol only after a prolonged lag period {{in the presence of}} glucose. It was concluded that the enzymes of the mannitol biosynthetic pathway were not constitutively expressed but were induced in response to glucose or to a glucose metabolite.

These cells had been treated with digitonin to permeabilize their plasma membranes and thereby ensure that only intracellular Ca 2 + buffering mechanisms were active. When placed in a medium with a cation composition resembling that of the cytosol, cells rapidly took up Ca 2 + as measured by a Ca 2 +-specific minielectrode. Two Ca 2 + steady states were observed. A lower level of around 120 nM required ATP-dependent Ca 2 + uptake and was probably determined by the endoplasmic reticulum. The higher steady state (approx. 800 nM), seen only {{in the absence of}} ATP, was shown to be due to mitochondrial activity. IP 3 specifically released Ca 2 + accumulated in the ATP-dependent pool, but not from mitochondria, since Ca 2 + release was demonstrated {{in the presence of the}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>poison</b> antimycin. The IP 3 -induced Ca 2 + release was rapid, with 50 % of the response being seen within 15 s. The apparent Km was 0. 5 microM and maximal concentrations of IP 3 (2. 5 microM) produced a peak Ca 2 + release of 10 nmol/mg of cell protein, which was followed by re-uptake. A full Ca 2 + response was seen if sequential pulses of 2. 5 microM-IP 3 were added at 20 min intervals, although there was a slight (less than 20 %) attenuation if the intervening period was decreased to 10 min. These observations could be related to the rate of IP 3 degradation which, in this system, corresponded to a 25 % loss of added 32 P label within 2 min, and a 75 % loss within 20 min.

Motility and oxygen consumption were quantitatively inhibited in a reversible manner by specific <b>respiratory</b> <b>poisons,</b> suggesting that gliding velocity {{was linked to}} electron transport activity. Arsenate had little influence on the number or rate of gliding filaments, despite a 95 % decrease in the concentration of intracellular adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP). At concentrations of cyanide or azide that abolished gliding movement, cells possessed a level of ATP {{that should have been}} sufficient to allow motility. Proton-conducting uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, such as carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and tetrachlorosalicylanilide, strongly inhibited locomotion yet did not suppress respiratory activity or intracellular ATP sufficiently to account for their effect on movement. Inhibition of motility by CCCP (but not by tetrachlorosalicylanilide) was partially reversed by sulfhydryl compounds. However, unlike CCCP, inhibition of motility by p-chloromercuribenzoate, a known sulfhydryl-blocking reagent, was associated with a corresponding reduction in respiratory activity and ATP content of cells. Protein synthesis was not blocked by concentrations of CCCP inhibitory for motility, indicating that utilization of existing ATP in this energy-requiring process was not impaired.

40|$|Growth factors promote cell {{survival}} and proliferation by activating signal transduction pathways {{that result in}} progression through the cell cycle and differential gene expression. Uptake of simple sugars needed for basal cell metabolism, and for macromolecular synthesis necessary for cell growth and proliferation, is thought to follow {{as a consequence of}} signal transduction to the nucleus. However, in the presence of inhibitors of DNA synthesis and respiration, growth factors can still promote cell survival responses in the short term, raising the possibility that they may also regulate critical membrane and cytosolic processes necessary for cell survival. We have tested this hypothesis directly by investigating the role of the haemopoietic growth factor, interleukin- 3 (IL- 3), in the regulation of glucose transport in the bone marrow-derived cell line, 32 D. We show that IL- 3 promotes glucose transport by actively maintaining the affinity of the plasma membrane, glucose transporter for glucose (Km 1. 35 +/- 0. 15 mM, n = 4). Withdrawal of IL- 3 for 1 h resulted in reduced affinity for glucose (Km 2. 96 +/- 0. 28 mM, n = 4) without an associated change in Vmax. Furthermore, glucose transporter molecules as the cell surface, as determined by cytochalasin B binding to isolated plasma membranes, did not differ significantly between control and IL- 3 -treated cells. Inhibition of DNA synthesis with mitomycin C or with the <b>respiratory</b> <b>poison,</b> sodium azide, did not affect the ability of IL- 3 to promote glucose transport. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and erbstatin extensively inhibited control and IL- 3 -stimulated glucose transport, some preference of IL- 3 -stimulated glucose transport, some preference for IL- 3 -stimulated responses being observed at low inhibitor concentrations. The light-activated protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C, also inhibited control and IL- 3 -stimulated glucose transport but without preference for IL- 3 responses. Additionally, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, orthovanadate, stimulated control and IL- 3 -dependent glucose transport by 50 - 80 % while the protein kinase A inhibitor, KT 5720, inhibited glucose transport by about 20 % at plateau values. These results indicate that IL- 3 is involved in continuous maintenance of glucose transporter activity by a mechanism that involves tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C, and demonstrate that this activation is not dependent on respiration or signal transduction to the nucleus...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) {{over the past}} decade has witnessed continued expansion, and it is now recognised as a powerful analytical technique. In Chapter 1 the concepts of CE are introduced and the various separation modes available to CE are discussed. Combinatorial Chemistry is a technique that is rapidly re-shaping the drug discovery process. This novel and cost-effective approach is capable of synthesising vast numbers of chemical variants all at one time, followed by the screening of these molecules for their bio-activity. This growing interest in combinatorial chemistry by the pharmaceutical industry has influenced the {{development of}} new analytical techniques for the analysis of such complex molecules. In Chapter 2 a CE method was developed for the separation of NSG-peptoid combinatorial libraries. In total, six libraries were examined. The separation power and versatility of CE makes it an ideal tool for the analysis of such libraries. A particular attraction is the ease with which the selectivity can be manipulated to bring about the efficient separation of these libraries. Chapter 3 discusses a CE method for the separation and analysis of products and intermediates of L-Dopa oxidation with Diode Array Detection (DAD). L-Dopa {{is one of the most}} important pre-cursors in the melanogenesis pathway. In this study both the tyrosinase enzyme and sodium periodate were used to catalyse several key steps in this pathway. Because of the instability of several of the intermediates formed, the detection and isolation of these compounds has remained problematic. Herein the advantages offered by CE are discussed and comparisons made with spectroelectrochemical techniques. Cyclic voltammetry and chrononcoulometric methods were used for the characterisation of the final polymeric product, melanin, and its utility as a sensor/biosensor assessed. Recent advances in biosensor development are discussed in Chapter 4, in particular, for the detection and monitoring of toxins. The suitability o f electroactive redox polymers as artificial mediators is examined and the concepts of charge propagation through such polymers. Recent trends have been to ‘wire’ a redox enzyme to an electrode via the use of these redox polymer chains. The development of a ‘reagentless’ immobilised enzyme inhibition sensor for respiratory poisons is described in Chapter 5. This system was based on the co-immobilisation of tyrosinase and a redox polymer, [Os(bpy) 2 (PVT) ioCl]Cl (OsPVI), where bpy is the 2, 2 ’-bipyridine ligand and the (PVI) io is poly-N-vinylimidazole indicating a ratio of co-ordinated redox sites to free pendant groups of 1 : 10. The hydrogel enzyme electrode allows ‘reagentless’ sampling of the enzyme activity by electrochemicaliy ‘switching on’ the enzymatic reduction of oxygen through electrochemical reduction of the immobilised osmium redox couple. This tyrosinase based sensor is capable of detecting any modulator of enzyme activity. Both homogenous and heterogeneous enzyme inhibition were investigated. The <b>respiratory</b> <b>poison</b> azide, which inhibits the tyrosinase enzyme, was selected as a model inhibitor to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. It is envisaged that this system can be extended for the detection of other inhibitors of tyrosinase such as cyanide. Finally, Chapter 6 discusses the conclusions reached during the course of this research and looks at possible areas for future research...|$|E

However, the conclusion given by the authors that the smoke grenade is "another source of phosgene poisoning " is hereby questionned. During combustion of pyrotechnic mixtures of zin...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of 2 -keto-D-gluconate (alpha-D-arabino- 2 -hexulopyranosonic acid; 2 KGA) in vesicles prepared from glucose-grown Pseudomonas putida occurs by a saturable process with a Km of 110. 0 +/- 2. 9 microM and a Vmax. of 0. 55 +/- 0. 04 nmol X min- 1 X (mg of protein) - 1. The provision of phenazine methosulphate/ascorbate or L-malate {{leads to an}} accumulation of intravescular 2 KGA, {{a decrease in the}} Km value to 50 +/- 2. 1 microM and 35 +/- 2. 9 microM respectively and no change in the Vmax. In the presence of electron donors the {{transport of}} 2 KGA is inhibited by the <b>respiratory</b> <b>poisons</b> antimycin A, rotenone and the uncoupler 2, 4 -dinitrophenol. 2 KGA transport is also competitively inhibited by 4 -deoxy- 4 -fluoro- 2 -keto- or 3 -deoxy- 3 -fluoro- 2 -keto-D-gluconate with Ki values of 50 microM and 160 microM respectively. The carrier system for 2 KGA is repressed in vesicles from cells grown on succinate. Such vesicles transport 2 KGA by non-specific physical diffusion with a Km value of infinity in the absence or presence of electron donors. Vesicles from glucose or succinate grown cells, in the presence of phenazine methosulphate/ascorbate at pH 6. 6, generate a proton-motive force (delta p) of approx. 140 mV. The delta p, composed of proton gradient (delta pH) and a membrane potential (delta psi), is collapsed in the presence of dinitrophenol. Based on the results obtained with valinomycin, nigericin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, the active transport of 2 KGA at pH 6. 6 is coupled predominately to the delta pH component of delta p...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{status of}} the {{androgen}} receptor in prostate cells was studied by incubation of rat ventral prostate with radioactive 17 β-hydroxy- 5 α-androstan- 3 -one (5 α-dihydrotestosterone) in the presence and absence of <b>respiratory</b> <b>poisons</b> and inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis and also by isotope chasing of the radioactive androgen–receptor complexes. The androgen receptor in the prostate appears {{to go through a}} dynamic process of recycling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus as well as an inactivation process. The radioactive androgen–receptor complex, however, is maintained at a constant level for at least 2 h during incubation at 37 °C, {{even in the absence of}} new protein synthesis, suggesting that early androgen actions may not require a depletion of a major portion of cellular receptor. In the presence of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, the androgen receptor is rapidly deactivated (half life, 2 min). The inactive receptor can be reactivated efficiently by an energy-dependent process, even in the absence of protein synthesis. Receptor binding of androgen and nuclear chromatin binding of the androgen–receptor complex are fast processes; half-maximum binding can be achieved within 1 and 10 min respectively. On the contrary, the overall process of the release of the receptor complex from nuclear chromatin and its reappearance in the cytosol fraction has a long half life of about 70 min. This slow process may reflect the involvement of the steroid–receptor complex in a time-consuming mechanism that is essential for hormone responses. Actinomycin D can increase the nuclear receptor level by 50 % or more. This increase is not due to a decrease in the rate of receptor release from nuclei or to inhibition of DNA degradation by the antibiotic...|$|R
40|$|Background: In Korea, {{a healthy}} 36 -year-old man {{developed}} acute interstitial pneumonitis soon after inhaling a waterproofing spray {{which he had}} applied at home to his outdoor jacket. Objectives: The objectives {{of this study were}} to review cases of varying degrees of <b>respiratory</b> toxicity and <b>poisoning</b> in connection with the use of waterproofing spray and summarize major reasons for cases of poisoning. Methods: We searched articles reporting on a combination of a waterproofing agent and/or respiratory symptoms, including acute respiratory syndrome, lung injury, pneumonia, pulmonary toxicity, and respiratory disease. Results: We reviewed a number of cases of varying degrees of <b>respiratory</b> toxicity and <b>poisoning</b> resulting from inhalation of waterproofing spray containing fluorocarbon co-polymer, solvents and propellants reported in a variety of countries. The literature searches concluded that among the ingredients of waterproofing agents, fluorinated polymer may cause acute respiratory health effects. Conclusion: Environmental policy should be implemented in order to prevent consumers from using household and industrial products including waterproofing agents. In addition, a national surveillance system should b...|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{within minutes}} of {{ingestion}} of the poisoned shellfish, paranesthesia of the oral region and fingertips are noticed. This gradually proceeds to the neck, arms, legs and toes, together with general muscular incoordination. Patients can start feeling numb, due {{to which it is}} hard to make voluntary movements. Also symptoms as dizziness, weakness and incoherence can occur. In the final stage of the <b>poisoning,</b> <b>respiratory</b> distress and full muscular paralysis occur, usually between 2 and 12 hours after ingestion.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{and characteristics of}} amperometric enzyme-based biosensors for environmental monitoring are described in detail in Chapter 1. The concept of enzyme inhibition is also outlined including detailed theoretical evaluation of inhibitor type. The inhibition {{of one or more}} enzymes in a metabolic pathway can have detrimental effects in vivo. Inhibitors range from food constituents, pesticides, halide, azide and cyanide compounds, drug and related therapeutic agents, <b>respiratory</b> <b>poisons,</b> oxides and peroxides. In Chapter 2 the use of screen printing is described as a disposable tyrosinase based biosensor for the monitoring of selected inhibitors. The characterisation and attractive performance of single use inhibitor biosensor strips is presented. Exploitation of mushroom tissue electrodes for the convenient monitoring of tyrosinase inhibitors is also outlined, including detailed elucidation of inhibitor type using native tyrosinase enzyme. Tyrosinase as a polyphenol oxidase is also an ideal candidate for the biosensing of phenolic compounds. The use of several hydrocarbon pasting liquids for improved tyrosinase-based carbon paste phenol biosensors is demonstrated in Chapter 3. Much interest has evolved in recent years on the use of sol-gel glasses in sensor manufacturing. Chapter 4 addresses this area with a sol-gel carbon composite electrode as an amperometric detector for catecholamines in liquid chromatography. An example of a sol-gel amperometric biosensor for the analysis of phenolics is also described. The most recent advancement in amperometric biosensing models, has been the proposed use of cytochrome P 450 enzyme for environmental monitoring. Cytochrome P 450 s are heamthiolate monooxygenase enzymes that result in the hydroxylation {{of a wide range of}} substances. This novel biosensing technique is presented in Chapter 5 in relation to the encapsulation of the P 450 enzyme along with membrane vesicles, within a methyltriethoxysilane gel. The behaviour of this biosensor for the analysis of polyaromatic hydrocarbons is evaluated. The thesis concludes in Chapter 6 with a critical assessment of the work performed there-in, along with suggestions for future work...|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{sensitive}} detection {{of chemical and}} biological warfare agents, including nerve gases, is of great interest especially after the tragic events of September 11, 2001. All nerve agents belong chemically to the organophosphorus compound group, which {{is among the most}} toxic of known substances. 1 The nerve agent, either as a gas, as an aerosol, or as a liquid, enters the body through inhalation or through the skin. Poisoning may also occur through consumption of liquids or foods contaminated with nerve agents. If a person is exposed to a high concentration of nerve agent, for example, 200 mg sarin/m 3, death may occur within a couple of minutes when the agent is absorbed through the <b>respiratory</b> system. <b>Poisoning</b> takes longer when the nerve agent enters the body through the skin or through consumption. In recent years, microcantilevers have been used as a platform for the development of many novel physical, chemical, an...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis has {{for decades}} been {{the leading cause}} of death, worldwide, {{originating}} from merely one infectious matter i. e. the bacilli Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). It is killing approximately 1. 5 million people every year. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 2 billion people might be infected by this specific bacterium, and that there emerges about 9 million new, active cases of TB each year. The aim with this thesis is to elucidate the possibilities and the difficulties with two new drugs against susceptible and resistant, latent and replicating strains of M. tuberculosis. A search for relevant articles on Pub Med, through the university library, was undertaken and approximately 35 articles were found. These articles were read; facts were sorted out and used for this paper. Figures were found through Creative Commons. The two new drugs discussed in this paper are TMC 207 and PA- 824. They have two different mechanisms of action, and additionally and most importantly, that differ from the drugs used as first-line and second-line options. TMC 207 targets the mycobacterial ATP synthase. PA- 824, a pro-drug, targets the cell wall synthesis and in addition causes <b>respiratory</b> <b>poisoning,</b> through the release of nitric oxide. The different mechanisms are vital in order to combat emerging resistance, due to various missense mutations in specific genes in the bacilli. The bactericidal activity of the drugs against mycobacteria is high, promising a successful cure for MDR (multi drug resistant) /XDR (extensively drug resistant) patients. The median survival is 4. 1 years for MDR patients and 2. 9 years for XDR patients, with currently available treatments. This is noticeably worse than some cancer prognoses. Perhaps with these drugs there is even a possibility of shortening the treatment time. The adverse events are mild to moderate, for both drugs. This is another additive advantage, since the toxicity of the drugs will be minimal and hopefully tolerable, and most importantly will bring about treatment commitment and the sought elimination of the disease. However, as with all new drugs the outcomes are still to be proven in real settings, the complex fields (in low- and middle income countries, with difficult TB cases), and with complicated cases (e. g. HIV co-morbidity) during a longer period of time. Reporting and evaluating the outcomes is crucial, since whatever is displayed from the drug consumption and the effects of it can lead to alterations in regimens, doses and treatment commitment...|$|R
40|$|A mutant of Escherichia coli K- 12 lacking {{pyruvate}} dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase {{was used}} to study the transport of pyruvate by whole cells. Uptake of pyruvate was maximal in mid-log phase cells, with a Michaelis constant for transport of 20 microM. Pretreatment of the cells with <b>respiratory</b> chain <b>poisons</b> or uncouplers, except for arsenate, inhibited transport up to 95 %. Lactate and alanine were competitive inhibitors, but at nonphysiological concentrations. The synthetic analogs 3 -bromopyruvate and pyruvic acid methyl ester inhibited competitively. The uptake of pyruvate was also characterized in membrane vesicles from wild-type E. coli K- 12. Transport required an artificial electron donor system, phenazine methosulfate and sodium ascorbate. Pyruvate was concentrated in vesicles 7 - to 10 -fold over the external concentration, with a Michaelis constant of 15 microM. Energy poisons, except arsenate, inhibited the transport of pyruvate. Synthetic analogs such as 3 -bromopyruvate were competitive inhibitors of transport. Lactate initially {{appeared to be a}} competitive inhibitor of pyruvate transport in vesicles, but this was a result of oxidation of lactate to pyruvate. The results indicate that uptake of pyruvate in E. coli is via a specific active transport system...|$|R
