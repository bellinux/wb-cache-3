He then started importing Siemens boden frasen from Germany. In 1932, Kelsey incorporated using the new company name <b>Rototiller,</b> Inc. and the [...] "Rototiller" [...] trademark (Kelsey didn't coin the name 'Rototiller' it was already being used in Europe). The operation was moved to Long Island City, NY. and SIMAR from Switzerland was added to the line. Carl Kelsey designed, patented and made several improvements to the SIMAR and Siemens machines because of the different American soils versus the European soil that had been farmed for many more centuries. One major improvement was a shock absorber to reduce tine spring return bounce. In 1934 Kelsey and <b>Rototiller,</b> Inc. introduced its first rotary tiller of its own design, the Model AA All-American.

5000|$|Rototiller: The small <b>rototiller</b> is {{typically}} propelled forward via a (1-5 horsepower or 0.8-3.5 kilowatts) petrol engine rotating the tines, {{and do not}} have powered wheels, though they may have small transport/level control wheel(s). To keep the machine from moving forward too fast, an adjustable tine is usually fixed just behind the blades so that through friction with deeper un-tilled soil, it acts as a brake, slowing the machine and allowing it to pulverize the soils. The slower a <b>rototiller</b> moves forward, the more soil tilth can be obtained. The operator can control the amount of friction/braking action by raising and lowering the handlebars of the tiller. Rototillers often do not have a reverse as such backwards movement towards the operator could cause serious injury. While operating, the <b>rototiller</b> can be pulled backwards to go over areas that were not pulverized enough, but care must be taken to ensure that the operator does not stumble and pull the <b>rototiller</b> on top of himself. Rototilling is much faster than manual tilling, but notoriously difficult to handle and exhausting work, especially in the heavier and higher horsepower models. If the rototiller's blades catch on unseen subsurface objects, such as tree roots and buried garbage, it can cause the <b>rototiller</b> to abruptly and violently move in any direction.|$|E

50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: <b>rototillers,</b> moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} effects of adding certain selected petroleum products to field soils at widely separated geographical locations under optimum conditions for biodegradation were studied. The locations selected for study of soil biodegradation of six oils (used crankcase oil from cars, used crankcase oil from trucks, an Arabian Heavy crude oil, a Coastal Mix crude oil, a home heating oil no. 2, and a residual fuel oil no. 6) were Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Corpus Christi, Texas. The investigative process, covering a period of 1 year at each location, was conducted in 14 fields plots (1. 7 by 3. 0 m) to which the oils were added in a single application {{at a rate of}} 11. 9 m 3 / 4 X 10 (3) m 2. One-half of the plots at each location were fertilized, and the incorporation of the oils and fertilizers was accomplished with <b>rototillers</b> to a depth of 10 to 15 cm. Concentrations of all oils decreased significantly at all locations. The average reduction ranged from 48. 5 to 90. 0 % depending upon the type of oil and location. Rates of degradation did not exceed 2. 4 m 3 / 4 X 10 (3) m 2 per month. Compositional changes in the oil with time were investigated using silica gel fractionation, gas chromatography, and ultraviolet absorbance. With the possible exception of the two fuel oils, the compositional changes were generally in the same direction for all of the oils. The silica gel fractionation and gravimetric data on residual oils show that all classes of compounds were degraded, but the more polar type degrade more slowly. Analysis of runoff water, leachate, and soils indicated that at the concentration applied no oil less was observed from these plots via water movement. No significant movement of lead compounds added to the soils in the used crankcase oils was observed. Significant increases in hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were demonstrated in all treated plots using either the pure hydrocarbon, n-hexadecane, or the applied oils as the growth substrate. These increases were usually sustained throughout the year. Significant increases in hydrocarbon-utilizing fungi were not demonstrated by the plating technique used. The concentrations of residual oils or their oxidation products were of sufficient magnitude in the treated plots, 9 months after application, to cause significant inhibition of plant growth.

40|$|Vegetable {{farming is}} an {{intensive}} practice that typically relies on several tillage passes to prepare fields for production. Repeatedly tilling the soil, however, is unsustainable {{and has been}} shown to decrease soil structure and organic matter while increasing erosion rates. A 3 -year experiment was conducted in a mixed vegetable production system in southern New England to determine how crop yield, weed abundance, and soil health were affected by conservation tillage practices. Three conservation tillage systems were compared to conventional tillage to determine the effects on yields of six vegetable crops, weed abundance, and soil health. Six 50 m planting beds were created within each treatment with the four middle rows planted to vegetable crops. In every treatment group, six vegetable crops were grown. These included tomato, cabbage, carrot, melon, cucumber, and lettuce. Two of the four rows were planted with the tomato and cabbage crops while melon / cucumbers, and lettuce / carrots were planted together in the remaining rows. Drip tape, with 30 cm emitter spacing, was used to irrigate to each crop in each treatment at a rate of 2. 54 cm per week. All vegetables received one line of drip tape except the carrot / lettuce row, in which two lines were used. Crops were fertilized at recommended rates using organic fertilizers applied at planting and through fertigation. To determine the conservation tillage treatments effects on yield, marketable yields were harvested throughout the season. Marketable yield totals were used to establish kg·ha- 1 estimates for all crops in all years. These estimates were used to gauge the conservation tillage treatments 2 ̆ 7 ability to produce yields comparable to the conventional treatment. Due to large amount variability across replications, marketable yields were transformed using a log(x) + 1 transformation to normalize the data. To determine differences in weed abundance among treatments, counts were taken four times in both the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Tallies determined total weed populations and species compositions within each treatment. In 2012, dried biomass measurements were collected for broadleaf and grass weeds, in addition to cover crops. Soil samples were collected in April every year and sent to the Cornell Nutrient Analysis Laboratory for the comprehensive Soil Health Test to measure the effects of the treatments on soil health. Additionally, in 2011 and 2012 soil respiration and nitrate levels were measured biweekly during the growing season. Six 15 cm soil cores were collected from four locations in each replication of each treatment. The soil was dried and then analyzed for soil respiration and nitrate levels The conventional tillage (CT) system was managed as follows: In the spring, fall seeded (123 kg·ha- 1) winter rye was incorporated using a moldboard plow and disked twice. Weeds within the treatment were controlled with tractor-mounted and walk-behind <b>rototillers.</b> In the fall, plots were disked twice before seeding winter rye. Establishment of the rolled crimped zone builder (RCZB) treatment: After the fall vegetable harvest, the plots were plowed and disked prior to seeding the winter rye with a seed drill. The winter rye was seeded at a rate of 123 kg·ha- 1. In the spring, when the rye reached anthesis, it was rolled and crimped. A zone builder was then used to strip till planting beds into the treatment. The winter rye seeding rate was increased to 184 kg·ha- 1 in 2012 after a low biomass of winter rye was observed in 2011. The winter rye biomass was expected to provide adequate weed control between the strip tilled rows throughout the season. Hand weeding was used to control weeds in the strip-tilled rows. Raised planting beds and a cover crop mixture of perennial ryegrass (27. 20 kg·ha- 1) and Dutch white clover (2. 72 kg·ha- 1) seeded in the aisles between the beds made up the PLM treatment. Post harvest, the raised beds were seeded with winter rye (123 kg·ha- 1). The following spring, the rye was mowed and the beds were rototilled with a walk-behind tiller to prepare them for planting. A walk behind mower was used to control weeds between the beds, while hand weeding was used in the planted rows. The crimson clover (CC) treatment was established as follows: The plots were plowed and disked twice before planting the vegetable crops. Following vegetable crop planting, crimson clover seed was mixed with pelletized lime at a 1 : 2 ratio and seeded at a rate of 25 kg·ha- 1 using a drop seeder. Mowing was used to prevent the crimson clover from competing with the vegetables. Hand weeding was used to control weeds that the cover crop was unable to control. Yield, weed abundance, and soil health analysis results varied by treatment. Redroot pigweed, crabgrass, purslane, and lady 2 ̆ 7 s thumb were the most abundant weeds in our fields. Soil respiration rates, nitrate levels, and soil health test results found the active carbon, nitrate, and biological activity in our soils to be lacking. Individual results between treatments varied. CT - Vegetable yields were consistently higher than or equal to the other treatment yields over all three years. Weed abundance in 2011 was not significantly different from the other treatments, however, an additional tillage pass in 2012 reduced the weed populations by 42...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the effectiveness of four methods of incorporating the herbicide trifluralin into the soil, and to determine the interaction between depth of incorporation of trifluralin and depth of weed seed germination. Field experiments on green and dry peas were established in Oregon and Idaho. Trifluralin, applied at four rates, was incorporated by a <b>rototiller,</b> tine-tooth harrow, spike-tooth harrow or double-disked, prior to planting. At time of harvest, yields were taken and plots were evaluated for weed control. On dry peas, only the tine-tooth harrow gave unsatisfactory incorporation of trifluralin. Increasing the rate of trifluralin, regardless of the method of incorporation, reduced the yield of dry peas, indicating injury. On green peas, both the double-disk and <b>rototiller</b> satisfactorily incorporated trifluralin. However, yields from the <b>rototiller</b> plots were slightly less than those from the disk plots. No injury was noted with increasing rates of trifluralin. Greenhouse experiments were conducted at Corvallis to determine the effect of increasing the depth of incorporation and depth of weed seed germination on the herbicidal activity of trifluralin. Trifluralin, applied at three rates, was incorporated to four depths and planted at three depths to pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.). Pigweed was not affected when planted below the trifluralin-treated zone. Only pigweed plants whose roots grew into the trifluralin were controlled. Shoot uptake appeared to be more effective than root uptake by barn-yardgrass. When trifluralin was incorporated over 1. 5 inches, weed control was reduced, indicating a dilution effect.

40|$|Introduction One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems arising with operation of the conventional rototillers is severe vibration of the machine handle which is transmitted to the user’s hands, arms and shoulders. Long period exposure of the hand-transmitted vibration may cause various diseases such as white finger syndrome. Therefore in this study, vibrations of a new type of <b>rototiller</b> with ridged blades were investigated at the position of handle/hand interface in different working conditions. Finally, the maximum allowable exposure time to the <b>rototiller</b> users in continuous tillage operation was obtained according to ISO 5349 - 1. Materials and Methods Experiments were carried out in one of the farms with silty clay soil texture, located in Sari city, Mazandaran province, Iran. Vibration measurements were performed according to ISO 5349 - 1 and ISO 5349 - 2 standards in two different modes, including in situ mode and tillage mode. Vibrational parameters were obtained in three blade rotational speeds, i. e., low speed (140 - 170 rpm), medium speed (170 - 200), and high speed (200 - 230). Blade rotational speed varied by changing engine speed using the throttle control lever. In each experiment, different vibrational values were individually recorded in three directions (x, y, and z). Experimental design and data analysis were performed in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications using the SPSS 16 software. Results and Discussion Based on the obtained results in this study, the RMS of acceleration increased by increasing in rotational speed for all of the conducted experiments. The reason is that number of cutting per unit of time and consequently the frequency of changing in the dynamic forces exerting on the blades dramatically increases with increasing the rotational speed of the blades. Noteworthy is that in most cases the variation of acceleration in the tillage mode showed similar trend with vibrational values in the idling mode. This represents a significant contribution of the combustion engine in vibration of the examined <b>rototiller.</b> Meanwhile, contribution of the engine in the total measured vibration was more than 50...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} crop production and conserve the soil from degradation, through mechanical manipulation of the soil, field experiments were conducted in cropping season of 2001 - 2003 to {{study the effects of}} tillage systems on performance of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), weed density, and tillage economics. The tillage methods evaluated were: mouldboard plough (MT), reduced tillage with <b>rototiller</b> (RTR) and disc (RTD). While not statistically significant, the highest wheat grain yield was recorded for RTR the least for RTD according to the average of the two of years. RTR tillage system recorded a mean increase in wheat grain yield of about 6 and 11 % over MT and RTD, respectively. Weed density was significantly higher for the RTD and the least for the MT in the two year of study. Mean weed populations recorded for the tillage systems were: RTR, 44 weeds m - 2; MT, 39 weeds m - 2; RTD, 61 weeds m - 2. RTR resulted in the highest gross margin with the least obtained for RTD. Considering the fact that the northwest of Turkey has about 15 % of country`s wheat production amount, RTR system can easily be adopted for increasing and economic crop production...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{irrigation}} on {{the efficacy of}} nematicides on Meloidogyne incognita race 1 population densities, yield of sweet corn, and the carry-over of nematicidal effect in the squash crop were determined in a sweet corn-squash-vetch cropping system for 3 years. Fenamiphos 15 G and aldicarb 15 G were applied at 6. 7 kg a. i. /ha and incorporated 15 cm deep with a tractor-mounted <b>rototiller.</b> Ethylene dibromide (EDB) was injected at 18 kg a. i. /ha {{on each side of}} the sweet corn rows (total 36 kg a. i. /ha) at planting for nematode control. Supplemental sprinkler irrigation (1. 52 - 4. 45 cm), applied in addition to natural rainfall (4. 60 - 10. 80 cm) within l 0 days after application of nematicides, did not affect nematicide efficacy against M. incognita or yield of sweet corn. Soil treatment with fenamiphos, EDB, and aldicarb increased the number and total weight of sweet corn ears and the weight per ear each year over untreated controls (P ≤ 0. 05). All nematicides provided some control of M. incognita on squash planted after sweet corn, but yields were consistently greater and root-gall indices lower on squash following sweet corn treated with fenamiphos than other nematicides...|$|E
40|$|The {{study in}} which {{different}} soil tillage methods (conventional, reduced and zero tillage) and control methods of narrow leaved weeds were compared {{was carried out in}} dry farming conditions in Diyarbakır during growing season of the years 2004 - 2005. The weeds density, yield and yield components of lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) were investigated. A significant difference was found between the herbicide applied (HER- 1) and herbicide free groups (HER- 2) (p< 0. 05) in terms of biological yield, harvest index, number of pods and seed per plant but {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups in the plant height, thousand kernel weight and branch number per plant. The results showed that weed is the most important yield constraining factor in lentils and that grain yield decreased by about 25 % in applications which do not include narrow leaved weed control. Although the 12 different tillage techniques applied significantly influenced the density of weed per unit, stubble coating (residue cover) rate and lentil output (emergence), they had no significant effect on other features. The highest crop yield (200. 9 kg/da) was obtained with the plough in summer + <b>rototiller</b> after rainfall + late planting (YP+YSR+TE) conventional tillage system and the lowest crop yield (108. 9 kg/da) was obtained with the herbicide-free, no-till and seeding by direct drill (IDTE) method...|$|E
