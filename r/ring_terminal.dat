The genus is characterised by having slender males and slender or semi-obese females, pharynx with a weak non-muscular median bulb, a terminal bulb containing the pharyngeal glands, female with a single gonad having a quadricolumella and post-uterine sac; male with arcuate spicules and the bursa arising 1 - 2 anal body diam. anterior to the cloacal aperture and extending nearly to the tail tip, and does not induce galls, only foliar chlorosis. The species is characterised by having a short, robust stylet with conus forming ca 40 % of stylet length and three well developed rounded knobs, secretory/excretory pore opening posterior to the nerve <b>ring,</b> <b>terminal</b> bulb abutting the intestine, and tail tip of variable form.

40|$|South Carolina Electric & Gas (SCE&G) submits {{this letter}} in {{accordance}} with the requirements of 10 CFR 21. 21 (a) (2) as a final report of an identified defect which was potentially associated with a substantial safety hazard. During the monthly surveillance test STP 0125. 002 A on 12 / 21 / 00, the "A " diesel generator experienced load swings during unloading. Replacement of the Woodward Governor EGA unit eliminated the load swing problem. Following removal of the EGA unit, an on-site bench test and inspection was performed. Although the EGA successfully passed the bench test, the inspection identified some questionable solder joints on the stability potentiometer (pot). This pot has three <b>ring</b> <b>terminal</b> connections through which wire leads are looped and then soldered. One of the connections had the wire lead looped through it, but did not appear to have any solder on it. It was suspected that if contact between the lead and terminal were intermittent on the stability pot, then the output signal from the EGA would be erratic and cause load swings and instability, as was experienced on 12 / 21 / 00. Since all of the pots in an EGA were replaced during refurbishment by Power Control Services (PCS) of Engine Systems, Inc. (a Woodward governor nuclear supplier), adequate soldering of the pot terminals during a previous refurbishment was questioned. The EGA was sent to PCS for inspection, testing and refurbishment to determine if it caused the problems experienced during the surveillance testing. ~j 3 ~gj/c 7...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} proposed earlier for ZnCl₂ terpyridyl {{has been}} refined by least squares techniques. Though no basic {{differences in the}} trigonal biprymidal stereochemistry about the zinc atom have been found, significant departures from planarity have been detected within the terpyridyl ligand. A crystal structure analysis of Sn₂Me₄Cl₄ terpyridyl has confirmed that it is monochloro bismethyl 2, 2; 2 ” terpyridyl tin(IV) trichloro bismethyl stannate(IV) and is therefore made up of tin-based 5 -coordinate anions and 6 -coordinate cations. The 5 -coordinate anion is trigonal bipyramidal in shape, with two methyl groups and one chlorine atom in the equatorial plane, apical positions being occupied by chlorine atoms. The 6 -coordinate cation has a distorted octahedral shape. Nitrogen atoms of the terpyridyl group, the tin atom and the chlorine atom all make up one plane. Two trans methyl groups {{are linked to the}} tin atoms by bonds approximately normal to this plane. A phase showing variable composition in the range P₄ 8 ₅ to P₄S₆. ₉ is found from crystal structure analysis to be made up of molecules isostructural with P₄S₇. Explanation of the variable composition is provided by the partial absence of some of the terminal sulphur atoms. A crystal structural analysis of the compound P₂S₆Br₂ has established the presence of a new six membered ring.

40|$|Excited state ultrafast {{conformational}} reorganization {{is recognized}} as an important phenomenon that facilitates light-induced functions of many molecular systems. This report describes the femtosecond and picosecond conformational relaxation dynamics of middle-ring and <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> twisted conformers of the acetylene pi-conjugated system bis(phenylethynyl) benzene, a model system for molecular wires. Through excitation wavelength dependent, femtosecond-transient absorption measurements, {{we found that the}} middle-ring and <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> twisted conformers relax at femtosecond (400600 fs) and picosecond (2024 ps) time scales, respectively. Actinic pumping into the red flank of the absorption spectrum leads to excitation of primarily planar conformers, and results in very different excited state dynamics. In addition, ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopic studies revealed the vibrational mode dependent relaxation dynamics for different excitation wavelengths. To corroborate our experimental findings, DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations were carried out. The FranckCondon simulation indicated that the vibronic structure observed in the electronic absorption and the fluorescence spectra are due to progressions and combinations of several vibrational modes corresponding to the phenyl ring and the acetylenic groups. Furthermore, the middle ring torsional rotation matches the room-temperature electronic absorption, {{in stark contrast to the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> torsional rotation. Finally, we show that the middle-ring twisted conformer undergoes femtosecond torsional planarization dynamic, whereas the <b>terminal</b> <b>rings</b> relax on a few tens of picosecond time scale...|$|R
