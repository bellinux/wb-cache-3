50|$|<b>Robalzotan</b> (NAD-299, AZD-7371) is a {{selective}} antagonist at the 5-HT1A receptor. It {{was shown to}} completely reverse the autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of serotonin release induced by the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like citalopram in rodent studies. It was subsequently investigated by AstraZeneca as a potential antidepressant but like many other 5-HT1A ligands was discontinued. Later on it was researched for other indications such as irritable bowel syndrome but was dropped once again.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist <b>robalzotan</b> (NAD- 299) and the 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist NAS- 181 ((R) -(+) - 2 -(3 -morpholinomethyl- 2 Hchromen- 8 -yl) oxymethyl-morpholine methanesulfonate) on cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in the rat brain in vivo. The extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh), glutamate (Glu) and GABA were monitored by microdialysis in the frontal cortex (FC) and ventral hippocampus (VHipp) in separate groups of awake rats. <b>Robalzotan</b> (0. 3; 1 and 3 µmol/kg s. c.) caused a dose-dependent increase of extracellular ACh levels in the rat FC to a maximal value of about 210 - 280 % of controls at the highest dose. ACh concentrations returned to the normal levels within 120 min. Similarly, in the VHipp, both <b>robalzotan</b> given at a dose of 3 µmol/kg s. c., {{and to a lesser extent}} another 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635 (1. 5 µmol/kg s. c), elevated the ACh levels to about 220 % and 160 %, respectively. Further, the potency of <b>robalzotan</b> to increase cholinergic transmission in the FC was compared to that of a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (Aricept, E 2020). Donepezil, given at it dose of I mg/kg s. c., increased the cortical extracellular levels of ACh to a maximum of about 350 % of the control values, thereafter the ACh concentrations returned to the normal levels within 80 min. The AUCs calculated for 80 min after the administration of <b>robalzotan</b> (3 µmol/kg) or donepezil (1 mg/kg) indicated that cortical ACh levels increased by a similar degree, although the effective time-course of donepezil was somewhat shorter. In the following microdialysis study, the effects of local administrations of <b>robalzotan</b> into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) on the frontocortical ACh release were examined in the awake rats. <b>Robalzotan,</b> injected locally into the NBM at doses of 6 and 18 nmol/rat caused a dose-dependent increase of cortical extracellular ACh concentrations. The maximal ACh increase was observed between 20 - 40 min after the drug administration, reaching 217 % of control values at a higher dose. However, the ACh levels maintained elevated during the entire post-injection sampling period (180 min). <b>Robalzotan</b> (75 or 100 µM perfused locally into the FC or VHipp showed only a moderate and delayed effect, increasing the ACh levels by about 30 %. These results suggest that cholinergic afferents to the FC are under tonic inhibitory control of 5 -HT 1 A heteroreceptors in the NBM and the cholinomimetic effect of <b>robalzotan</b> is probably associated with increased firing rates of cortical (and possibly also hippocampal) afferents. Additionally, the effect of locally perfused <b>robalzotan</b> on ACh release in the frontal cortex could be indirectly mediated, for example via the blockade of inhibitory 5 HT 1 A heteroreceptors located on the pyramidal cells projecting in a feedback loop to the NBM. The purpose of the final study {{was to investigate the}} effects of the 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist NAS 181 ((R) -(+) - 2 (3 -morpholinomethyl- 2 H-chromen- 8 -yl) oxymethyl-morpholine methanesulfonate) on cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurotransmission in the rat brain in vivo. NAS- 181 (1; 5 or 10 mg/kg, s. c.) caused a dose-dependent increase in ACh levels, reaching the maximal values of 500 % (FC) and 230 % (VHipp) of controls at 80 min postinjection. On the contrary, NAS- 181 injected at doses of 10 or even 20 mg/kg s. c. had no effect on basal extracellular levels of Glu and GABA in these areas. In summary, the present findings indicate that ACh neurotransmission in the frontal cortex and ventral hippocampus, the brain structures strongly implicated in cognitive function, is under tonic inhibitory control of the 5 -HT 1 A heteroreceptors in the nucleus basalis and medial septum/diagonal band areas and the 5 -HT 1 B heteroreceptors most likely localized at the terminal areas. It is concluded that the selective or combined 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonists may represent a potentially new alternative in the treatment of pathologies characterized by a cholinergic deficit in the central -nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{administration}} of the muscarinic-receptor antagonists atropine and scopolamine produces cognitive deficits in humans, nonhuman primates and rodents. In humans, these deficits resemble symptoms of dementia seen in Alzheimer's disease. The passive avoidance (PA) task {{has been one of}} the most frequently used animal models for studying cholinergic mechanisms in learning and memory. The present study examined the ability of two selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonists WAY 100635 and NAD- 299 (<b>robalzotan)</b> and two acetylcholinesterase (ACNE) inhibitors tacrine and donepezil to attenuate the impairment of PA retention caused by the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine in the rat. Although demonstrating differences in their temporal kinetics, both WAY 100635 and NAD- 299 attenuated the impairment of PA caused by scopolamine (0. 3 mg/kg s. c.). Donepezil did not block the PA deficit caused by the 0. 3 mg/kg dose of scopolamine, but it prevented the inhibitory effects of the 0. 2 mg/kg dose of scopolamine. In contrast, tacrine was effective vs both the 0. 2 and 0. 3 mg/kg doses of scopolamine. These results indicate that (I) a functional 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonism can attenuate the anterograde amnesia produced by muscarinic-receptor blockade, and (2) the ACNE inhibitor tacrine and donepezil differ in their ability to modify muscarinic-receptor-mediated function in vivo. These results suggest that 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonists may have a potential in the treatment of cognitive symptoms in psychopathologies characterized by reduced ACh transmission such as Alzheimer's disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Galanin {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout {{the central nervous system}} with multiple and diverse biological roles. In the rat, galanin-like immunoreactivity is expressed in a population of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT, serotonin) neurons in the dorsal raphe (DR) with extensive projections to the forebrain areas e. g., hippocampus. The major aim of the thesis was to study in vivo, whether porcine galanin can modulate 5 -HT transmission with focus on 5 -HT 1 A receptors associated with the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. This analysis was performed at both the pre- and postsynaptic level of the DR projection using behavioural, neurochernical and molecular approaches. The effects of porcine galanin were examined in the adult male rat following intraventricular (i. c. v.) administration. Galanin given i. c. v. to the rat 10 min or 2 h prior to training, dose-dependently (0. 3 - 3 nmol) attenuatedthe deficit in passive avoidance (PA) induced by the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 2 mg/kg) mediated via activation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in cortico-limbic brain regions. The shortterm(10 min) and prolonged (2 h) reduction in the postjunctional 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated response at I ter i. c. v. galanin was not associated with changes in the mRNA levels or agonist binding properties of cortico-limbic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. These results suggest that an acute increase of galanin transmission in vivo can counteract limbic 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated responses without significantly affecting gene expression or binding properties of 5 -HT 1 A receptors. In the DR, galanin (3 nmol/rat) increased the KD values of 5 -HT 1 A receptors at 10 min but not 2 It and 5 h after administration while an increase in the Bmax values was seen at 2 h but not at 10 min and 5 h after administration. The mRNA levels of 5 -HT 1 A receptors and of galanin in the DR were significantly decreased at 2 h but not 5 h after galanin. These findings provide evidence for time-dependent, modulatory actions of galanin on 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the DR, possibly partly via galanin- 5 -HT 1 A receptor interactions (formation of galanin/ 5 -HT 1 A receptor heteromeric complexes) and partly via galanin transduction mechanisms in the DR. Galanin given i. c. v. was found to produce a long-lasting (> 5 h) reduction in basal 5 -HT release in the ventral hippocampus. The inhibitory effect of galanin was related to a galanin receptor activation (blocked by a galanin receptor antagonist M 35) at the level of DR. I. c. v. galanin 2 h after administration decreased mRNA levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (the rate limiting enzyme in synthesis) in the DR. 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 3 mg/kg, s. c.) caused a reversible reduction of extracellular 5 -HT levels which was almost completely blocked by i. c,v. galanin (0. 5 nmol and partially by 0. 15 nmol). Thus, although both galanin and 8 -OH-DPAT alone reduced basal hippocampal 5 -HT release, their simultaneous administration did not exhibit any synergistic effects. Galanin also attenuated S-OH-DPAT induced hypothermia and locomotor activity in rats, functional effects mediated via postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in neuroantomical different projections. Antidepressant drug action has been related to desensitisation of somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. The ability of three " 5 -HT related drugs" to alter 5 -HT 1 A receptors was examined after repeated treatments (14 days). Fluoxetine (a 5 -HT uptake blocker) treatment significantly increased the KD values in dorsal raphe, CA 1 and dentate gyrus (DG). 8 -OH-DPAT, did not affect the KD values in any of the areas tested while <b>robalzotan</b> (a 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist) increased the KD values in the DR. Both 8 -OH- DPAT and <b>robalzotan</b> but not fluoxetine decreased the Bmax values of the postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the DG and CAI areas of the dorsal hippocampal formation without affecting the Bmax values of these receptors in the DR. Furthermore, fluoxetine and <b>robalzotan</b> but not 8 -OH-DPAT treatment also increased the mRNA levels of the 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the CAI area without affecting the mRNA levels of the 5 -HT 1 A receptors in DG and DR. None of the treatments changed the mRNA levels of the neuropeptide galanin, which coexists with 5 -HT in the DR. The results from the forced swim test (FST) showed that all three drugs tested caused "antidepressant-like" effects. The modulatory actions on 5 - HT 1 A receptors caused by the three " 5 -HT related drugs", can be interpreted as a result of enhanced 5 -HT transmission. Furthermore, the anti depre ssant- like effects in the FST appear to involve multiple adaptive changes in 5 -HT 1 A receptor mechanisms. In conclusion, the present studies have shown that galanin is a potent in vivo inhibitor of mesencephalic cortico-limbic 5 -HT neurotransmission involving strong interactions between galanin and 5 -HT 1 A receptors. In view of these findings, galanin antagonists may represent a new therapeutic principle in depression...|$|E
