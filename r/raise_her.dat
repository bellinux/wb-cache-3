In 1948, the family moved again to 12 Ardwick Road (also in Speke) which was part of a new estate in the suburbs of Liverpool. The frequent moves to better areas were Mary's idea, as she wanted to <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> children in the best neighbourhood possible.|$|E

5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.|$|E
5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E

One of the most important themes of The Heart of a Woman is motherhood, as Angelou continues to <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> son. The book ends with her son leaving for college and Angelou looking forward to newfound independence and freedom.|$|E

5|$|The Senghenydd {{explosion}} {{remains the}} worst mining disaster in Britain. The deaths of 440 men {{on a small}} community had a devastating effect; 60 victims were younger than 20, of whom 8 were 14 years old; 542 children had lost their fathers and 205 women were widowed. The impact on individual households was great: 12 homes lost both a father and son, 10 homes lost two sons each, while {{the death of one}} father and son left an 18-year-old daughter to <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> 6 siblings alone; another woman lost her husband, 2 sons, a brother and her lodger.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} that, Theoktistos and Sergios Niketiates were sent on a {{campaign}} to recover Crete, which had been conquered in the 820s by Andalusian exiles. The expedition at first went well, as the Byzantine army landed and took control {{over most of the}} island, confining the Andalusians to their capital, Chandax. At this juncture, Theoktistos heard a rumour that in his absence, Theodora intended to <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> brother Bardas to the imperial throne. He hastily abandoned the army under Niketiates and returned to Constantinople, only to find the rumours false. Once in Constantinople, news arrived of an invasion of Asia Minor by Umar al-Aqta, emir of Malatya. Theoktistos was sent at the head of an army to confront him, but the resulting Battle of Mauropotamos ended in a Byzantine defeat. At the same time, the expeditionary corps left in Crete was defeated and almost annihilated by the Andalusians, who killed Niketiates.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ruler}} of the other {{dimensional}} realm Outworld, Shao Kahn, conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter Kitana alive and <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered Shang Tsung to bring to life a more vicious and loyal version of Kitana that could take her place if necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from Baraka's race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena {{would be used to}} spy on her and to ensure her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and elite personal assassins, although Mileena grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her.|$|E
