40|$|DNA {{ligation}} is {{an essential}} step in DNA replication, repair and recombination. Mammalian cells contain three DNA Ligases that are not interchangeable although they use the same catalytic reaction mechanism. To compare the recruitment of the three eukaryotic DNA Ligases to <b>repair</b> <b>sites</b> in vivo we introduced DNA lesions in human cells by laser microirradiation. Time lapse microscopy of fluorescently tagged proteins showed that DNA Ligase III accumulated at microirradiated sites before DNA Ligase I, whereas we could detect only a faint accumulation of DNA Ligase IV. Recruitment of DNA Ligase I and III to <b>repair</b> <b>sites</b> was cell cycle independent. Mutational analysis and binding studies revealed that DNA Ligase I was recruited to DNA <b>repair</b> <b>sites</b> by interaction with PCNA while DNA Ligase III was recruited via its BRCT domain mediated interaction with XRCC 1. Selective recruitment of specialized DNA Ligases may have evolved to accommodate the particular requirements of different repair pathways and may thus enhance efficiency of DNA repair...|$|R

It is unknown exactly where this town is located, but there are a multitude of Spanish speaking residents within it and the town is surrounded by tropical ocean water (as seen in the introduction). Most 30-minute episodes contain two stories. They typically begin with Manny and the tools interacting in Manny's repair shop.

[...] and then the Tools shout [...] "We fix it!" [...] After hearing who needs help where, Manny and the Tools sing [...] "Hop Up, Jump In" [...] while the Tools hop into his tool box. In most episodes when Manny and the Tools leave for the repair, they see Mr. Lopart with his pet cat Fluffy in front of his candy store. Mr. Lopart would try to do something on his own without any prior experience. Manny offers him to help but Mr. Lopart says that he doesn't need any help, after Manny and the Tools leave the item Mr. Lopart was building would malfunction and cause a mess.

40|$|SummaryChromatin {{organization}} is compromised during the repair of DNA damage. It remains unknown how {{and to what}} extent epigenetic information is preserved in vivo. A central question is whether chromatin reorganization involves recycling of parental histones or new histone incorporation. Here, we devise an approach to follow new histone deposition upon UV irradiation in human cells. We show that new H 3. 1 histones get incorporated in vivo at <b>repair</b> <b>sites.</b> Remarkably we find that H 3. 1, which is deposited during S phase, is also incorporated outside of S phase. Histone deposition is dependent on nucleotide excision repair (NER), indicating that it occurs at a postrepair stage. The histone chaperone chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF- 1) is directly involved in the histone deposition process in vivo. We conclude that chromatin restoration after damage cannot rely simply on histone recycling. New histone incorporation at <b>repair</b> <b>sites</b> both challenges epigenetic stability and possibly contributes to damage memory...|$|R

40|$|Objective: An {{end-to-end}} nerve <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> {{always has}} {{the risk of}} rupture and nerve healing failure. In observing the nerve healing site and nerve anastomosis after surgery, here, a new simple and cost-effective technique, and ldquo;Nerve <b>Repair</b> <b>Site</b> Marking and rdquo; (NRSM), is defined. Methods: During primary or secondary nerve repair, to see {{the continuity of the}} <b>repair</b> <b>site,</b> a new technique was employed - NRSM. After coaptation of the nerve at any site of the body and when repairing under tension, 1 cm proximal and 1 cm distal of the suture site, the epineurium was marked with a titanium hemoclip. During the first 6 weeks post-surgery, X-rays of the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> were taken every week and the distance between the hemoclips was measured. Results: Since 2006, in 23 patients, 25 nerves underwent end-to-end repair (brachial plexus and peripheral nerves), was conducted under tension and if there was the risk of rupture of the <b>repair</b> <b>site,</b> NRSM was employed. All patients were followed up with X-ray of the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> every week, especially during the first 4 weeks {{and at the end of}} 6 weeks. If the patients lived far away from the clinic, they sent their <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> X-rays. Only one patient had rupture of the <b>repair</b> <b>site,</b> and it was just after surgery and repaired immediately. Conclusion: To get the best results following end-to-end nerve repair, nerve continuity must continued, though there is always the risk of rupture at the <b>repair</b> <b>site.</b> As ultrasonography and MRI can be utilized to examine the <b>repair</b> <b>site,</b> they are not helpful in brachial plexus repairs, are expensive and can be time-consuming when employed with peripheral nerves.

40|$|The {{reported}} {{incidence of}} aortic aneurysm after surgical repair or balloon angioplasty for aortic coarctation varies widely. To determine {{the incidence of}} aneurysm formation after surgery, preoperative and postoperative cineangiograms from 65 patients who underwent operation at age 1. 5 ± 3. 4 years were examined. Repair included a prosthetic patch in 14 patients, end to end anastomosis in 28 and subclavian flap in 23. Aneurysm was documented by change in contour or irregularities in contour at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> or by abnormal dimensions at the <b>repair</b> <b>site,</b> defined by {{the ratio of the}} widest measurement at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> to the measurement of the aorta at the diaphragm. An aneurysmal bulge above the ductus diverticulum was identified in 14 (23 %) of 60 patients preoperatively; the area showed no change 4. 72 ± 4. 07 years after surgery. Significant changes at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> were seen in only three patients, all of whom had Dacron patch repair. One patient had a change in contour at the <b>repair</b> <b>site,</b> one had an abnormally high <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> to diaphragmatic aorta ratio and one had a progressive increase in this ratio. Thus, during childhood years, 3 (5 %) of 65 patients were diagnosed as having aneurysm at the surgical <b>repair</b> <b>site.</b> In conclusion, 1) comparison with preoperative cineangiograms, especially for aneurysmal bulges above the ductus arteriosus, is essential before an aneurysm can be attributed to coarctation repair by any technique, and 2) aneurysm developed only in patients subjected to Dacron patch repair...|$|E

40|$|A {{specialized}} nucleotide {{excision repair}} pathway known as transcription-coupled repair (TCR) counteracts the toxic effects of DNA damage in transcriptionally active genes. The clustering of active genes into gene-rich chromosomal domains {{predicts that the}} sites of TCR are unevenly distributed through the genome. To elucidate the genomic organization and chromosomal localization of TCR, we isolated DNA fragments encompassing TCR-mediated <b>repair</b> <b>sites</b> from UV-C irradiated xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells, which can only repair the transcribed strand of active genes. This DNA {{was used as a}} molecular probe to visualize TCR in normal metaphase spreads by reverse fluorescence in situ hybridization. Whereas DNA <b>repair</b> <b>sites</b> in normal human cells are evenly distributed through the genome, TCR is highly localized at specific chromosomal domains. Particularly, clusters of TCR sites were identified at early-replicating gene-rich bands and telomeric regions of several chromosomes. High gene-density chromosomes such as chromosome 19 and the GC-rich domains of several chromosomes (T bands) are preferential locations of TCR. Our results demonstrate that the intragenomic localization of TCR resembles the uneven distribution of the human transcriptome, CpG islands, and hyperacetylated histones, enforcing the basic link between DNA repair, transcription, and nuclear organization in a complex genome...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This {{study used}} {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the morphology and pathophysiology of aneurysm formation after patch angioplasty for {{coarctation of the aorta}}. BACKGROUND. Late aneurysm formation at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> is a well known and frequent complication after patch angioplasty. However, because the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved, postoperative outcome is unpredictable and adequate follow-up difficult. METHODS. Seventy-three of 85 patients with patch angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta were screened for aneurysm formation. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in all 33 patients with an aneurysm, and results were compared with those for 13 control patients and 10 normal subjects. Mean (+/- SD) time between operation and MRI was 12. 0 +/- 2. 0 years. Aneurysm was defined as the ratio of the diameter of the aorta at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> to the diaphragmatic aorta > or = 1. 5. Hypoplasia of the transverse arch and recoarctation at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> were defined as a ratio < 0. 9. Transverse arch ratios on MRI were compared with those on preoperative cineangiography and the pressure gradient between the patient's right and left arm. RESULTS. All 33 patients with an aneurysm had a hypoplastic transverse arch. The 13 patients with a normal ratio at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> had a normal transverse arch ratio (chi square, p < 0. 0001). Logarithmic regression showed a significant negative correlation (r = 0. 62) between the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> and transverse arch ratios. A significant pressure difference between the patient's right and left arm was found in patients with versus those without aneurysm (p = 0. 0009). No significant difference was found between transverse arch ratios on preoperative cineangiography and postoperative MRI (mean 0. 014 +/- 0. 1, p = 0. 4). CONCLUSIONS. Aneurysm formation at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> is highly related to hypoplasia of the transverse arch. Sufficient catch-up growth of a hypoplastic transverse arch is rare after late patch angioplasty. Dynamic phenomena, such as flow acceleration and turbulence, originating in a narrow transverse arch, may contribute to aneurysm formation at the <b>repair</b> <b>site</b> after patch angioplasty. status: publishe...|$|E
