5|$|The British government's {{principal}} {{interest in}} Japan was to renew pre-war trade concessions, and to secure new ones; it was {{particularly interested in}} the port city of Kobe. The Americans blocked these attempts. Robertson clashed repeatedly with Lieutenant General Sir Charles Gairdner, the official representative of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Gairdner was nominally senior in <b>rank</b> <b>to</b> Robertson until March 1947, when Robertson was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, backdated to January 1944. Robertson resisted Gairdner's requests for BCOF aircraft for personal purposes.|$|E

5|$|After {{months of}} speculation, on May 23, 1994, Top Rank {{successfully}} purchased the franchise for $152.5 million {{with the intention}} of relocating it to New Orleans. The purchase occurred following an agreement between Top Rank and Timberwolves ownership that allowed Top <b>Rank</b> <b>to</b> purchase the franchise if no local ownership groups were found by May 20, 1994. On June 6, 1994, Top Rank officially filed the paperwork to the NBA seeking to relocate the Timberwolves to New Orleans for the 1994–95 NBA season. The filings also identified Fred Hofheinz as the sole Top Rank stockholder, with Houston lawyer John O'Quinn and stockbroker Robert Higley serving as the team's major partners.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{brothers}} received initial {{support from the}} government, the Soviet Union officially protested the airport on 5 November 1958. They claimed {{it could be used}} as an air force base—and thus would be a violation of the Svalbard Treaty—and pointed out that planning was partially financed with American military funding and that Gunnar was a military officer. From then on the Norwegian government started actively opposing the airport. At first they asked the company to cease operations, then asked the American military to cut funding. They also instructed all government-owned companies to not allow an airport to be built on their ground. The government also used Gunnar's military <b>rank</b> <b>to</b> hinder him, to limited extent, from pursuing the plans. The Aviation Act, which required all airports to have a concession to operate, came into effect from 1961, effectively stopping the plans.|$|E
5|$|As a young officer, Rowell {{served at}} Gallipoli but was invalided back to Australia with typhoid fever in January 1916. The {{end of the}} war found Rowell junior in <b>rank</b> <b>to</b> his contemporaries with more {{distinguished}} war records, but he managed to catch up in the post-war period. Rowell spent five years with the British Army or at British staff colleges, establishing valuable contacts with his British counterparts. In 1939 he was appointed {{chief of staff of the}} 6th Division and later I Corps, serving in that capacity in the Battle of Greece and the Syria-Lebanon campaign. In 1942 he commanded I Corps in the Kokoda Track campaign but was sacked. His subsequent rise to become Chief of the General Staff demonstrated that the circumstances of his dismissal in 1942 were indeed extraordinary.|$|E

During the Austro-Turkish War (1787-1791), he fought with distinction, earning the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 15 November 1788. He {{was named to}} the nobility as a Freiherr in December 1788. In 1789 he raised a freikorps, which soon reached a {{strength}} of 3,000 men in 12 companies of infantry and 4 squadrons of hussars. During the Austro-Turkish War, Vukassovich served as freikorps' acting commander with the rank of Major, and was then promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel).|$|E
5|$|Eustathios {{was then}} {{appointed}} as strategos {{of the border}} theme of Charsianon, a position notably inferior in <b>rank</b> <b>to</b> that of the Anatolics that he had held previously.

There he received the return to imperial service {{of a number of}} Armenian lords, Melias, the three brothers Baasakios, Krigorikios and Pazounes, and Ismael, who were established as march-wardens along the Empire's eastern border. Of them, Melias in particular would go on to become the founder of the theme of Lykandos and one of the main Byzantine leaders in the wars against the Arabs over the next 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's organised, bookish intellect {{served him}} well as he began setting up {{different}} SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy. The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual respect. In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police. That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler {{to the rank of}} SS-Obergruppenführer, equal in <b>rank</b> <b>to</b> the senior SA commanders. Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.|$|E
