5|$|The University of Chicago Library system {{encompasses}} six libraries {{that contain}} {{a total of}} 11 million volumes, the 9th most among library systems in the United States. The university's main library is the Regenstein Library, which contains {{one of the largest}} collections of print volumes in the United States. The Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, built in 2011, houses a large study space and an automated book storage and <b>retrieval</b> <b>system.</b> The John Crerar Library contains more than 1.4million volumes in the biological, medical and physical sciences and collections in general science and the philosophy and history of science, medicine, and technology. The university also operates a number of special libraries, including the D'Angelo Law Library, the Social Service Administration Library, and the Eckhart Library for mathematics and computer science. Harper Memorial Library no longer contains any volumes; however it is, in addition to the Regenstein Library, a 24-hour study space on campus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of his 37th lap Bernhard {{reported}} a front-left puncture to his pit crew after driving over debris. He had difficulty turning into the track's right-hand turns and fell to fourth place behind di Grassi and Tréluyer. The tyre degraded further which damaged his car's bodywork, but he cautiously returned to the pit lane for a replacement front nose, and Webber took over his position. Strakka Racing's entry struck the Porsche's tyre carcass which became lodged in its right-front wheelarch but continued. Webber slowed with a punctured front-left tyre, causing him to return to the pit lane where he pushed back into his garage for ten-minute bodywork repairs. Then his front-axle energy <b>retrieval</b> <b>system</b> was changed, forcing Webber to remain in his garage for more than one hour. The second round of green flag pit stops began after 90 minutes. The No. 7 Audi and the No. 5 Toyota had cosmetic alterations to their rear-ends and the former vehicle was taken over by Fässler. The first Toyota, driven by Davidson, kept the lead after the pit stops. The first full course caution was shown when Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin was hit by Dolan in the No. 38 G-Drive vehicle and went backwards into the Stavelot tyre barrier at a high rate of speed. His car flipped over but he was unhurt. Marshals were required to repair the damaged barrier, and removed debris from the track.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{information}} <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> {{is one of}} the greatest challenges for information science specialists, because determining the performance of a system depends on judgment of the relevance of documents provided by the system to the user's information needs, and it has its own complexities. New <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> due to the dynamic nature of the Web are very different compared with traditional <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems.</b> Web information <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of ranking results are divided into two groups: The ranked retrieval results and unranked <b>retrieval</b> sets. Each <b>system</b> has a different evaluation criteria and scales. In this paper, criteria for evaluating information <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> is reviewed for the ranked retrieval results (including precision and recall curves, interpolated precision, the 11 -point interpolated precision average, Mean Average Precision, precision at K, R-precision, ROC curve cumulative gain and normalized discounted cumulative gain), and the unranked retrieval sets (including precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy) is introduced separately.

40|$|Multi aisle {{automated}} {{storage and}} <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> correspond to multiple picking aisles {{served by a}} single storage and retrieval machine. These systemsare used in practice when the need for pallet places is high and the throughput capacity is relatively low. Therefore, considerable savings of initial investment costs due to single aisle systems can be achieved using such systems. The objective of the presented study is to develop analytical travel time models for multi aisle automated storage and <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> considering the operating characteristics of the storage and retrieval machine. With the proposed analytical travel time models, average travel time of the storage and retrieval machine, from which the performance of multi aisle automated storage and <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> can be evaluated is determined. A simulation model of multi aisle automated storage and <b>retrieval</b> <b>systems</b> was developed to compare the performances of the proposed analytical travel time models.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the influences that Information <b>Retrieval</b> <b>Systems</b> such as online Search Engines and Databases have on designers' early searching strategies. The study involves the observation of designers transforming early design language into query 'keyword' language for the operation of Information <b>Retrieval</b> <b>Systems</b> and how this transition causes a shift in early design exploration. This transformation is referred to in this research as the CLASS activity; Converting Language from Abstract Searching to Specific. Findings show a common pattern across the activity of both professional and advanced student designers.
