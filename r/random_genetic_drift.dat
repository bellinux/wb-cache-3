5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed {{in the absence of a}} valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>drift,</b> natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of genetic mutations neither assist, change the appearance of, nor bring harm to individuals. Through {{the process of}} genetic drift, these mutated genes are neutrally sorted among populations and survive across generations by chance alone. In contrast to genetic drift, natural selection is not a random process because it acts on traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction. Natural selection and <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> are constant and dynamic parts of life and over time this has shaped the branching structure in the tree of life.|$|E
25|$|CPV2 is a non-enveloped {{single-stranded}} DNA virus. The {{name comes}} from the Latin parvus, meaning small, as the virus is only 20 to 26 nm in diameter. It has an icosahedral symmetry. The genome is about 5000 nucleotides long. CPV2 continues to evolve, {{and the success of}} new strains seems to depend on extending the range of hosts affected and improved binding to its receptor, the canine transferrin receptor. CPV2 has a high rate of evolution, possibly due to a rate of nucleotide substitution that is more like RNA viruses such as Influenzavirus A.

25|$|Though {{relatively}} few mutations are advantageous, {{those that are}} {{play an important role}} in evolutionary changes. Like neutral mutations, weakly selected advantageous mutations can be lost due to <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>drift,</b> but strongly selected advantageous mutations are more likely to be fixed. Knowing the DFE of advantageous mutations may lead to increased ability to predict the evolutionary dynamics. Theoretical work on the DFE for advantageous mutations has been done by John H. Gillespie and H. Allen Orr. They proposed that the distribution for advantageous mutations should be exponential under a wide range of conditions, which, in general, has been supported by experimental studies, at least for strongly selected advantageous mutations.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} genetic drift was first {{introduced}} {{by one of the}} founders in the field of population genetics, Sewall Wright. His first use of the term [...] "drift" [...] was in 1929, though {{at the time he was}} using it in the sense of a directed process of change, or natural selection. Random drift by means of sampling error came to be known as the [...] "Sewall–Wright effect," [...] though he was never entirely comfortable to see his name given to it. Wright referred to all changes in allele frequency as either [...] "steady drift" [...] (e.g., selection) or [...] "random drift" [...] (e.g., sampling error). [...] "Drift" [...] came to be adopted as a technical term in the stochastic sense exclusively. Today it is usually defined still more narrowly, in terms of sampling error, although this narrow definition is not universal. Wright wrote that the [...] "restriction of [...] "random drift" [...] or even [...] "drift" [...] to only one component, the effects of accidents of sampling, tends to lead to confusion." [...] Sewall Wright considered the process of <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> by means of sampling error equivalent to that by means of inbreeding, but later work has shown them to be distinct.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effective}} {{population size}} (N'e) {{was defined by}} Sewall Wright, who wrote two landmark papers on it (Wright 1931, 1938). [...] He defined it as [...] "the number of breeding individuals in an idealized population that would show {{the same amount of}} dispersion of allele frequencies under <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> or the same amount of inbreeding as the population under consideration". It is a basic parameter in many models in population genetics. N'e is usually less than N (the absolute population size).|$|E

Introgression and interspecific {{competition with the}} smaller and darker colored native brush rabbit (S. bachmani) were considered unlikely explanations for observed small size and light color in introduced cottontails. Seasonal differences in rainfall between Ohio and Oregon were suggested as a possible selective force because of the apparent effect of rainfall on population dynamics of Nuttall's cottontails (S. nuttallii). <b>Random</b> processes (<b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> and an unrepresentative founding population) could not be rejected as possible causes for both small body size and light pelage color.

50|$|Dembski {{asserts that}} one can {{effectively}} estimate a positive value which is a universal probability bound. The existence of such a bound would imply that certain kinds of random events whose probability lies below this value can be assumed not to {{have occurred in the}} observable universe, given the resources available in the entire history of the observable universe. Contrapositively, Dembski uses the threshold to argue that the occurrence of certain events cannot be attributed to chance alone. Universal probability bound is then used to argue against random evolution. However evolution is not based on <b>random</b> events only (<b>genetic</b> <b>drift),</b> but also on natural selection.|$|R
40|$|Understanding natural selection's {{effect on}} genetic {{variation}} {{is a major}} goal in biology, but the genome-scale consequences of contemporary selection are not well known.

Host-associated selection affecting the genome acted on both a known colour-pattern trait as well as other (unmeasured) phenotypes.

In the high line, recombination between Gl and Sb was increased from 14. 8 percent to about 30 percent in twelve generations, when a plateau was apparently reached. Realized heritability was 0. 12. The absence of a response to selection for low recombination is attributed mainly to <b>genetic</b> <b>random</b> <b>drift,</b> and partially to directional dominance and directional gene frequencies. Natural selection was found to act against increases of recombination above a level of about twenty percent in the measured interval. High recombination tended to be recessive to low recombination.

40|$|A {{genome-wide}} map {{of single}} nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and a pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between their alleles are being established in three main ethnic groups. An important question is the applicability of such maps to different populations within a main ethnic group. Therefore, we have developed high-resolution SNP, haplotype and LD maps of vitamin D receptor gene region in large samples from five populations. Comparative analysis reveals that the LD patterns are identical in all four European populations tested with two small regions of 1. 3 and 5. 7 kb at which LD is disrupted completely resulting in three block-like regions over which there is significant and extensive LD. In an African population the pattern is similar, but two additional LD-breaking spots are also apparent. This LD pattern suggests combined action of recombination hotspots and founder effects, but cannot be explained by <b>random</b> recombination and <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> alone.

40|$|The {{effective}} size {{of populations}} (Ne) determines whether selection or <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> is the predominant force shaping their genetic structure and evolution. Populations having high Ne adapt faster, as selection acts more intensely, than populations having low Ne, where <b>random</b> effects of <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> dominate. Estimating Ne for various steps of plant {{virus life cycle}} {{has been the focus}} of several studies in the last decade, but no estimates are available for the vertical transmission of plant viruses, although virus seed transmission is economically significant in at least 18 % of plant viruses in at least one plant species. Here we study the co-dynamics of two variants of Pea seedborne mosaic virus (PSbMV) colonizing leaves of pea plants (Pisum sativum L.) during the whole flowering period, and their subsequent transmission to plant progeny through seeds. Whereas classical estimators of Ne could be used for leaf infection at the systemic level, as virus variants were equally competitive, dedicated stochastic models were needed to estimate Ne during vertical transmission. Very little <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> was observed during the infection of apical leaves, with Ne values ranging from 59 to 216. In contrast, a very drastic <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> was observed during vertical transmission, with an average number of infectious virus particles contributing to the infection of a seedling from an infected mother plant close to one. A simple model of vertical transmission, assuming a cumulative action of virus infectious particles and a virus density threshold required for vertical transmission to occur fitted the experimental data very satisfactorily. This study reveals that vertically-transmitted viruses endure bottlenecks as narrow as those imposed by horizontal transmission. These bottlenecks are likely to slow down virus adaptation and could decrease virus fitness and virulence. [br/] [br/] Author Summary Short generation times and high mutation rates are the hallmarks of virus. They favor their fast adaptation as illustrated by their ability to overcome natural as well as man-made barriers such as host resistance or drug treatments. However, such a fast adaptation could be slowed down when <b>genetic</b> <b>drift,</b> which introduces <b>random</b> sampling effects in the evolution of virus populations, is important. Whether <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> or selection dominates depends on the effective size of populations (Ne). Ne has been estimated for several steps of plant virus infectious cycle, such as horizontal transmission by insects and the colonization of plant cells and tissues. However, although economically important, no estimate of Ne during vertical transmission of viruses, i. e. the infection of plant progenies from parental plants, is available. Here, we report that Pea seedborne mosaic virus (PSbMV), a seed transmitted virus infecting pea crops, undergoes very drastic <b>genetic</b> <b>drift</b> during vertical transmission, with an average number of infectious virus particles contributing to the infection of a seedling from an infected mother plant close to one. Such bottlenecks, as narrow as those imposed by horizontal transmission, could slow down virus adaptation and should be taken into account to improve plant protection strategies...|$|R

An assessment of multilocus linkage disequilibrium revealed temporal and geographic variation in the occurrence of random mating among the four populations.
