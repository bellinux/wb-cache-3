2500|$|On November 23, Green Party presidential {{candidate}} Jill Stein launched a public fundraiser {{to pay for}} <b>recounts</b> <b>in</b> Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, asserting that the election's outcome had been affected by hacking in those states; Stein did not provide evidence for her claims. Changing the outcome of these three states would make Clinton the winner, and this would require showing that less than 60000 votes had been counted for Trump which should have been counted for Clinton. Stein filed for a <b>recount</b> <b>in</b> Wisconsin on November 25, after which Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias stated that their campaign would join Stein's <b>recount</b> efforts <b>in</b> that state and possibly others [...] "in order to ensure the process proceeds {{in a manner that}} is fair to all sides."

5|$|Dustbin Baby is a BBC {{television}} film directed by Juliet May, based on Jacqueline Wilson's 2001 {{novel of the}} same name. It was first broadcast on BBC One on 21 December 2008. The film stars Dakota Blue Richards as April, a troubled teenager who was abandoned in a dustbin as an infant, and Juliet Stevenson as Marion Bean, April's adoptive mother. David Haig stars as Elliot, Marion's friend and colleague. The screenplay was written by Helen Blakeman, and the film was produced by Kindle Entertainment. Dustbin Baby deals with themes including maternal bonding, bullying, and youth crime. The story revolves around April running away on her fourteenth birthday, while Marion searches for her. April's life is <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> flashbacks as she meets people and visits places that are significant to her.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's 1905 {{predictions}} were verified experimentally {{in several}} ways {{in the first two}} decades of the 20th century, as <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> Robert Millikan's Nobel lecture. However, before Compton's experiment showed that photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that electromagnetic radiation itself might be particulate. (See, for example, the Nobel lectures of Wien, Planck and Millikan.) Instead, there was a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as Compton scattering, where it was much more difficult not to ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the observed results.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology {{culminates in}} the Trojan War, fought between Greece and Troy, and its aftermath. In Homer's works, {{such as the}} Iliad, the chief stories have already taken shape and substance, and {{individual}} themes were elaborated later, especially in Greek drama. The Trojan War also elicited great interest in the Roman culture because {{of the story of}} Aeneas, a Trojan hero whose journey from Troy led to the founding of the city that would one day become Rome, as <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> Virgil's Aeneid (Book II of Virgil's Aeneid contains the best-known account of the sack of Troy). Finally there are two pseudo-chronicles written in Latin that passed under the names of Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} text, Mohini {{is referred to}} as simply an enchanting, female form of Vishnu. In later versions, Mohini is described as the maya (illusion) of Vishnu. Later still, the name of the avatar becomes Mohini from {{the original}} phrase describing his deliberate false appearance (mayam ashito mohinim). Once the Mohini legend became popular, it was retold, revised, and expanded in several texts. The tales of Mohini-Vishnu also increased among devotional circles in various regions. The same expanded Mahabharata version of the story is also <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> the Bhagavata Purana in the 10th century CE. Here, Mohini becomes a formal avatar of Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|Keshi's legend is <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> {{the tenth}} Book of the Bhagavata Purana (between 500 CE - 1000 CE).

In an attempt to avoid his death, Kamsa sends a series of demons to Gokula, where Krishna is staying with his foster-parents. After Krishna kills the bull demon Arishta, the divine sage Narada confirms to Kamsa that Krishna is his sister Devaki's child and that the girl-child that Kamsa had killed, mistaking her for the child of Devaki, {{was in fact the}} daughter of Yashoda, Krishna's foster-mother. Infuriated at hearing this, Kamsa calls the demon Keshi and orders him to kill Krishna and his brother Balarama.|$|E

5|$|Possibly as {{a result}} of Eystein's activities, King David granted half of Caithness to Harald's cousin, Erlend Haraldsson. The result, as <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> the Orkneyinga Saga, was a {{political}} struggle which ended with Erlend's murder in 1154. Rognvald too was killed, in 1158. Svein Asleifsson was again heavily involved in this dynastic conflict. In 1153 King David died, to be succeeded by his young grandson, Malcolm IV. King Eystein too died in a war with his brothers Ingi and Sigurd which left Ingi the sole surviving son of Harald Gilli. As a result, by 1158 Harald Maddadsson was undisputed Earl of Orkney, with neither the King of Scots nor the King of Norway in any position to contest his power.|$|E

5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E

5|$|Important rituals {{such as the}} {{dedication}} of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the Maya death gods. In AD 738, the vassal king K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil of Copán {{and a few days}} later he ritually decapitated him; The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual ballgame reenacting the victory of the Maya Hero Twins over the gods of the underworld. Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled. The Hero Twins myth <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> the Popol Vuh relates how one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.|$|E
5|$|In the Market Square {{stands the}} Gothic St. Mary's Basilica (Kościół Mariacki).

From the church's main tower a trumpet call (hejnał mariacki), is sounded every hour. The melody, {{which used to}} announce the opening and closing of city gates, ends unexpectedly in midstream. According to legend, the tune was played during the 13th-century Tatar invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack. He was shot by an archer of the invading Tatar forces whilst playing, the bugle call breaking off {{at the moment he}} died. The story was <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> a book published in the late-1920s called The Trumpeter of Krakow, by Eric P. Kelly, which won a Newbery Award.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} {{form of the}} myth was <b>recounted</b> <b>in</b> the Metamorphoses of Ovid, and the story {{was the subject of}} the most famous work (now lost) of the poet Helvius Cinna. Several alternate versions appeared in the Bibliotheca, the Fabulae of Hyginus, and the Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis, with major variations depicting Myrrha's father as the Assyrian king Theias or depicting Aphrodite as having engineered the tragic liaison. Critical interpretation of the myth has considered Myrrha's refusal of conventional sexual relations to have provoked her incest, with the ensuing transformation to tree as a silencing punishment. It has been suggested that the taboo of incest marks the difference between culture and nature and that Ovid's version of Myrrha showed this. A translation of Ovid's Myrrha, done by English poet John Dryden in 1700, has been interpreted as a critique of the society of that day linking Myrrha to Mary II and Cinyras to James II.|$|E
