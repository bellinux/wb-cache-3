40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to enhance the nutritive value and improve digestibility of sugarcane bagasse by alkali treatment method using urea. Urea at a level of 10 % dry matter of bagasse was dissolved in water and mixed with bagasse. The mixture was divided into four equal portions and was stored in sealed plastic bags for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. Crude protein increased significantly in the treated bagasse compared with raw and ensiling for 28 days increased crude protein to 10. 4 % compared with 2. 18 % of the <b>raw</b> bagasse. <b>Neutral</b> Detergent Fiber (NDF) degradation of treated bagasse increased significantly (P< 0. 05) compared with raw bagasse. The increase in degradation rate was maximum for the ensiling period of four weeks. Cell wall compounds decreased with the increase of the ensiling period, and reached a maximum at day 28 of ensiling. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|The quality {{deterioration}} of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) tail meat was monitored during ice storage. The K-value started at 0. 7 % and reached {{a value of}} 39. 7 % on day 14. Muscle pH followed a sigmoidal pattern that reached a plateau on day 6. Bacterial load and trimethylamine (TMA) increased only after a lag phase to reach considerable levels by day 14 (5. 3 log cfu and 10. 2 mg (100 g) − 1, respectively). These analytical data were compared with sensory data. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that laboratory measures were correlated positively with the smell strength of cooked product (increasingly strong) and negatively with the smell character of raw and cooked product (sour-ammoniacal in <b>raw</b> and <b>neutral</b> in cooked products), flavour and aftertaste (both increasingly bland–bitter). The effects of icing delays {{on the quality of}} tail meat were also evaluated. Changes in K-values, microbial load, muscle pH and TMA indicated that the delay to icing should be no more than 4 h (at 16 °C) to ensure that quality is not compromised during subsequent post-harvest storage...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an industrial process for stabilising sewage sludge (SS) with lime and evaluates {{the viability of}} the stabilised product, denominated <b>Neutral,</b> as a <b>raw</b> material for the cement industry. Lime not only stabilised the sludge, raised the temperature of the mix to 80 - 100 Â°C, furthering water evaporation, portlandite formation and the partial oxidation of the organic matter present in the sludge. Process mass and energy balances were determined. Neutral, a white powder consisting of portlandite (49. 8 %), calcite (16. 6 %), inorganic oxides (13. 4 %) and organic matter and moisture (20. 2 %), proved to be technologically apt for inclusion as a component in cement raw mixes. In this study, it was used instead of limestone in raw mixes clinkerised at 1400, 1450 and 1500 Â°C. These raw meals exhibited greater reactivity at high temperatures than the limestone product and their calcination at 1500 Â°C yielded clinker containing over 75 % calcium silicates, the key phases in Portland clinker. Finally, the two types of <b>raw</b> meal (<b>Neutral</b> and limestone) were observed to exhibit similar mineralogy and crystal size and distribution. Â© 2011. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
60|$|First. The brick should neither {{be of the}} white, nor {{the very}} dark red, kind. The white is worse than useless as a color: its cold, <b>raw,</b> sandy <b>neutral</b> has neither warmth enough to relieve, nor gray enough to {{harmonize}} with, any natural tones; it does not please the eye by warmth, in shade; it hurts it, by dry heat in sun; it has none {{of the advantages of}} effect which brick may have, to compensate for the vulgarity which it must have, and is altogether to be abhorred. The very bright red, again, is one of the ugliest warm colors that art ever stumbled upon: it is never mellowed by damps or anything else, and spoils everything near it by its intolerable and inevitable glare. The moderately dark brick, of a neutral red, is to be chosen, and this, after a year or two, will be farther softened in its color by atmospheric influence, and will possess all the advantages we have enumerated. It is almost unnecessary to point out its fitness for a damp situation, not only as the best material for securing the comfort of the inhabitant, but because it will the sooner contract a certain degree of softness of tone, occasioned by microscopic vegetation, which will leave no more brick-red than is agreeable to the feelings where the atmosphere is chill.|$|R
30|$|Whereas {{crude and}} {{unadjusted}} analyses suggested {{an association of}} colloids with adverse outcome, a stepwise adjustment for baseline and progress covariables indicates {{that the use of}} colloids per se did not affect the risk of mortality. Moreover, the association of colloids with AKI disappeared after multivariable adjustment. In subgroup analyses, the adjusted risk of AKI was lower in patients treated with colloids per se or HES 130 / 0.4. In the subcohort of patients admitted without severe sepsis, there was also a trend towards reduced ICU mortality with colloids per se or HES 130 / 0.4. The most important finding of the present study is that the effects of colloids turned from seemingly adverse in the <b>raw</b> data to <b>neutral</b> or potentially beneficial after multivariable analyses. This contradicts findings from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). One main reason for this may be the timing and dose of colloid use being different from the RCTs as detailed below.|$|R
40|$|Biomass is {{currently}} a promising renewable and potentially <b>neutral</b> <b>raw</b> material in relation to global warming. Modified and pelletized fast-growing grey alder (Alnus incana) wood was used as precursor for activated carbon preparation by physical activation with superheated steam under a self-generated atmosphere. The impact of the relative moisture content before pelletization in the range 4 - 12 % on the mechanical properties of pellets and on the developed porous structure of the obtained carbons were studied for 90 min of activation time at the 850 oC of temperature. Modified grey alder wood was treated for 2 h at 180 oC and obtained pellets mechanical properties as well as surface properties of the activated carbons were dependent on a combined effect of the conditions employed. As optimal carbonization temperature selected 600 oC, because the prepared activated carbons characterize with the highest bulk density, yield and micropore content from the total pore volume...|$|R
40|$|Establishment of a {{bio-based}} {{economy has been}} recognised {{as one of the}} key issues for sustainable development For future developments renewable resources will play a key role as CO 2 <b>neutral</b> <b>raw</b> material for sustainable industrial production to curb depletion of fossil resources. Options to fully exploit the potential of renewable resources as industrial chemical feedstock imply different interdependent routes. In this paper, the various scenarios how to achieve a {{bio-based economy}} are discussed. ranging, from the traditional 'complex route' via chemical conversion, to shifting to a glucose-based economy (C 6) or transformation of biomass into C 1 or C 2 chemical building blocks, following the approach of the petrochemical industries. For each scenario, an integrated chain approach is essential. All aspects need to be addressed from food security. food safety, 'green' energy production and development of sustainable non-food products for industry, to waste management, recycling and disposal. The emerging, strategies require combined efforts from both science and commercial enterprise, facilitated by governmental legislation and should be based upon a broad public support.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} the influence of hydrodensified nanosilica particles on the binding of water by milled plant <b>raw</b> materials in <b>neutral</b> and acidic media. Flowers of Hibiscus sabdariffa and Calendula officinalis were used as the model materials. According to the microphotographs and low temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopy data, the silica film forms on the surface of the milled plant particles, and it can significantly influence their hydration. According to the suggested scheme, some of the water from the inner cavities of plant raw materials moves (as evidenced by the decreasing radius of water-filled pores) to the zone of contact of the composite components (the radius of clusters of adsorbed water increases). In studies of desorption of active substances from milled medicinal herbs and their composites by the initial and hydrodensified nanosilica, it has been shown that the formation of a composite significantly reduces the rate of desorption. Minimal desorption is observed in composites containing hydrodensified nanosilica. The studied composite systems are promising for biomedical researches...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing {{expressions}} is a {{key part}} of human social interaction; Processing of facial expression information is largely automatic in humans, but it is a non-trivial task for a computational system. The purpose of this work is to develop computational models capable of differentiating between a range of human facial expressions. Here we use two sets of images, namely: Angry and <b>Neutral.</b> <b>Raw</b> face images are examples of high dimensional data, so here we use some dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis and Curvilinear Component Analysis. We preprocess the images with a bank of Gabor filters, so that important features in the face images are identified. Subsequently the faces are classified using a Support Vector Machine. We also find the effect size of the pixels for the Angry and Neutral faces. We show {{that it is possible to}} differentiate faces with a neutral expression from those with an angry expression with high accuracy. Moreover we can achieve this with data that has been massively reduced in size: in the best case the original images are reduced to just 6 dimensions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Biomass is {{currently}} a promising renewable and potentially <b>neutral</b> <b>raw</b> material in relation to global warming. Grey alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench) wood was chosen for research. Carbonization (slow pyrolysis) of the granulated modified grey alder wood is a standard pre-treatment method for physical activation to obtain valuable high-quality granular activated carbon for cleaning of gaseous emissions. Relative ratios of the main carbonization products of lignocellulosic materials (charcoal, liquid condensate and uncondensable gases) are strongly influenced by the physical and chemical characteristics of the raw materials. It {{is very important to}} achieve high charcoal yields and retain the mechanical properties of the obtained carbonized and activated modified wood granules. Recently, extensive research has been carried out in the field of the biomass thermal decomposition behavior during pyrolysis. Hydrothermally treated grey alder wood has not been investigated {{from this point of view}} until now. Therefore, the purpose of the investigation is to examine the effect of the hydrothermal treatment time of grey alder wood on the thermal stability of granulated modified grey alder wood carried out in a thermogravimetric/mass spectroscopic (TG-MS) system and a thermogravimetric analysis apparatus (TGA). The behaviour of hydrothermally treated wood during pyrolysis is completely different from that of the initial grey alder wood. By modification of grey alder wood, the cellulose and lignin content increases due to decreasing of the hemicellulose content. A comparison between the hydrothermally treated and initial grey alder wood shows that, at first, decomposition starts at higher temperatures (228 and 214 oC, respectively), the maximum of thermal decomposition is reached at a higher temperature (347 and 336 oC, respectively), the hemicellulose shoulder in the TGA peak disappears, and the yields of char are more than twice higher (35 and 12 %, respectively). The initial and modified (treatment time 1 h and 2 h) grey alder wood was studied also by simultaneous TG-MS in an inert argon atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 oC min- 1. It is found that gaseous emissions such as H 2 O, CO 2 and CO are the main products formed during pyrolysis for all samples. The differences in the gas formation were found to be due to their differences in the composition of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. The major part of those emissions is formed during the thermal decomposition of cellulose at a temperature of 350 - 450 oC. The formation of C 2 H 2 + and C 2 H 3 + shows that crosslinking by recombination and polycondensation reactions (formation of the so-called “pseudolignin”) occurs between cellulose and lignin during pyrolysis. The temperature intervals of the formation of these organic compound fragments are similar to those for the CH 4 forming temperature, which means that the highest charcoal yields are obtained from modified wood with the highest cellulose and lignin content comparing to the case of the initial grey alder wood. It is demonstrated by thermogravimetric and mass spectroscopic analysis that the grey alder wood after hydrothermal treatment is thermally more stable than the initial material, and the charcoal yield increases with increasing treatment time. The pellets after carbonization retain their mechanical properties and are an excellent raw material for production of high-density granular activated carbon...|$|R
