40|$|Plasma {{cells secrete}} IgM {{only in the}} {{polymeric}} form: the C-terminal cysteine of the mu heavy chain (Cys 575) is responsible for both intracellular <b>retention</b> and <b>assembly</b> of IgM subunits. Polymerization is not quantitative, and part of IgM is degraded intracellularly. Neither chloroquine nor brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits degradation, suggesting that this process occurs in a pre-Golgi compartment. Degradation of IgM assembly intermediates requires Cys 575 : the monomeric IgMala 575 mutant is stable also when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport is blocked by BFA. Addition of the 20 C-terminal residues of mu to the lysosomal protease cathepsin D is sufficient to induce pre-Golgi retention and degradation of the chimeric protein: the small amounts of molecules which exit from the ER are mostly covalent dimers. By contrast, when retained by the KDEL sequence, cathepsin D is stable in the ER, indicating that retention {{is not sufficient to}} cause degradation. Replacing the C-terminal cysteine with serine restores transport through the Golgi. As all chimeric cathepsin D constructs display comparable protease activity in vitro, their different fates are not determined by gross alterations in folding. Thus, also out of its normal context, the mu chain Cys 575 plays a crucial role in quality control, mediating <b>assembly,</b> <b>retention</b> and degradation...|$|R
40|$|A general {{scenario}} is proposed {{to understand the}} evolutionary transitions {{that lead to the}} emergence of higher level systems through the assembly of independent components. First, multilevel emergence is reviewed in general as the result of variation and selective <b>retention</b> of <b>assemblies.</b> It is emphasized that when the components are dissipative (e. g. living systems) the process is complicated by the on-going competition for scarce resources between the agents. While there is a selective pressure to achieve synergy, and thus avoid conflict, competition remains potentially present, leading to the free rider problem. To tackle this problem, a control must evolve to suppress conflict. This can be achieved by an exploiter (e. g. parasite) evolving to become a cultivator of the collective. The “exploiter ” {{does not need to be}} an external invader, but can be a distributed mode of interaction or “aspect system” of the collective, that may co-opt external support. The detailed {{scenario is}} as follows: 1) a collective of agents interacts, constituting an interaction medium; 2) the medium coordinates the interactions, becoming a conflict mediator; 3) the mediator establishes active control over the agents, becoming a goal-directed manager. These proposed stages of an evolutionary transition are used to analyse a variety of concrete examples, including physical selforganization, spatial partioning of competing agents in biology, and the evolution of markets...|$|R
30|$|However, the QCR is {{fragile and}} easily broken by {{stretching}} and bending [[9]]. Therefore, a retention mechanism {{is required to}} affix the QCR to avoid detrimental horizontal forces [[10]-[14]]. Moreover, the retention mechanism {{plays an important role}} in efficiently transmitting external loads to the QCR. Fabrication of the <b>retention</b> mechanism and <b>assembly</b> process are complicated; miniaturization of the retention mechanism is quite difficult. Additionally, the sensor output is not linear owing to a gap between the retention mechanism and the QCR, and therefore, preload must be applied to the QCR to obtain linear output. In our previous work, a screw mechanism was used to apply preload to the retention mechanism [[13],[14]]. This increased the number of sensor parts and further complicated assembly. In addition, to achieve further miniaturization and improvements in the sensor sensitivity, conventional machining processes are not feasible owing to the small size of the sensor elements.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{hippocampus}} {{is a key}} brain circuit for spatial memory, and the spatially-selective {{spiking of}} hippocampal neuronal assemblies is thought to provide a mnemonic representation of space. Here we show that remembering newly-learnt goal locations requires the NMDA receptor-dependent stabilization and enhanced reactivation of goal-related hippocampal assemblies. During spatial learning, place-related firing patterns in the CA 1, but not CA 3, region of the rat hippocampus were reorganized to represent new goal locations. Such reorganization did not occur when goals were marked by visual cues. The stabilization and successful retrieval of these newly-acquired CA 1 representations for behaviorally-relevant places was NMDAR-dependent and necessary for subsequent memory <b>retention</b> performance. Goal-related <b>assembly</b> patterns associated with sharp wave/ripple network oscillations, during both learning and subsequent rest periods, predicted memory performance. Together, {{these results suggest that}} reorganization and reactivation of assembly firing patterns in the hippocampus represent the formation and expression of new spatial memory traces...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphogenesis}} of many enveloped viruses, {{in which}} viral nucleocapsid complex interacts with envelope (E) protein, {{is known to}} take place at various sites along the secretory pathway. How viral E protein retains in a particular intracellular organelle for assembly remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated determinants in the E protein of dengue virus (DENV) for its <b>retention</b> and <b>assembly</b> in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A chimeric experiment between CD 4 and DENV precursor membrane/E constructs suggested that the transmembrane domain (TMD) of E protein contains an ER retention signal. Substitutions of three nonhydrophobic residues at the N terminus of the first helix (T 1) and at either the N or C terminus of the second helix of the TMD with three hydrophobic residues, {{as well as an}} increase in the length of T 1, led to the release of chimeric CD 4 and E protein from the ER, suggesting that short length and certain nonhydrophobic residues of the TMD are critical for ER retention. The analysis of enveloped viruses assembled at the plasma membrane and of those assembled in the Golgi complex and ER revealed a trend of decreasing length and increasing nonhydrophobic residues of the TMD of E proteins. Taken together, these findings support a TMD-dependent sorting for viral E proteins along the secretory pathway. Moreover, similar mutations introduced into the TMD of DENV E protein resulted in the increased production of virus-like particles (VLPs), suggesting that modifications of TMD facilitate VLP production and have implications for utilizing flaviviral VLPs as serodiagnostic antigens and vaccine candidates...|$|R
40|$|The XV- 15 Tilt Rotor Research Aircraft {{has just}} {{completed}} the first series of flight tests with the Advanced Technology Blade (ATB) rotor system. The ATB are designed specifically for flight research and provide the ability to alter blade sweep and tip shape. A number of problems were encountered from first installation through envelope expansion to airplane mode flight that required innovative solutions to establish a suitable flight envelope. Prior to operation, the blade retention hardware had to be requalified to a higher rated centrifugal load, because the blade weight was higher than expected. Early flights in the helicopter mode revealed unacceptably high vibratory control system loads which required a temporary modification of the rotor controls to achieve higher speed flight and conversion to airplane mode. The airspeed in airplane mode was limited, however, because of large static control loads. Furthermore, analyses based on refined ATB blade mass and inertia properties indicated a previously unknown high-speed blade mode instability, also requiring airplane-mode maximum airspeed to be restricted. Most recently, a structural failure of an ATB cuff (root fairing) <b>assembly</b> <b>retention</b> structure required a redesign of the assembly. All problems have been addressed and satisfactory solutions {{have been found to}} allow continued productive flight research of the emerging tilt rotor concept...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} two rat mAbs that recognize different subunits {{of the human}} fibroblast fibronectin receptor complex and have used them to probe the function of this cell surface heterodimer. mAb 13 recognizes the integrin class 1 beta polypeptide and mAb 16 recognizes the fibronectin receptor alpha polypeptide. We tested these mAbs for their inhibitory activities in cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and matrix assembly assays using WI 38 human lung fibroblasts. mAb 13 inhibited the initial attachment {{as well as the}} spreading of WI 38 cells on fibronectin and laminin substrates but not on vitronectin. Laminin- mediated adhesion was particularly sensitive to mAb 13. In contrast, mAb 16 inhibited initial cell attachment to fibronectin substrates but had no effect on attachment to either laminin or vitronectin substrates. When coated on plastic, both mAbs promoted WI 38 cell spreading. However, mAb 13 (but not mAb 16) inhibited the radial outgrowth of cells from an explant on fibronectin substrates. mAb 16 also did not inhibit the motility of individual fibroblasts on fibronectin in low density culture and, in fact, substantially accelerated migration rates. In assays of the assembly of an extracellular fibronectin matrix by WI 38 fibroblasts, both mAbs produced substantial inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition of matrix assembly resulted from impaired retention of fibronectin on the cell surface. Treatment of cells with mAb 16 also resulted in a striking redistribution of cell surface fibronectin receptors from a streak-like pattern to a relatively diffuse distribution. Concomitant morphological changes included decreases in thick microfilament bundle formation and reduced adhesive contacts of the streak-like and focal contact type. Our results indicate that the fibroblast fibronectin receptor (a) functions in initial fibroblast attachment and in certain types of adhesive contact, but not in the later steps of cell spreading; (b) is not required for fibroblast motility but instead retards migration; and (c) is critically involved in fibronectin <b>retention</b> and matrix <b>assembly.</b> These findings suggest a central role for the fibronectin receptor in regulating cell adhesion and migration...|$|R
