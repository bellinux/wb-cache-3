40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONUterine <b>rupture</b> after hysteroscopic septum {{resection}} {{is a rare}} complication, and its frequency {{is reported}} to be approximately 1 – 2. 7 %. Uterine perforation and monopolar resection during hysteroscopy are well-known risk factors for subsequent uterine <b>rupture</b> during pregnancy. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present a case of recurrent uterine <b>ruptures</b> during consecutive pregnancies in a patient who had undergone hysteroscopic septum resection for recurrent pregnancy loss. DISCUSSIONRecurrent uterine <b>rupture</b> due to hysteroscopic septum resection in pregnancy is a very rare condition. In the present case we noted that the first two uterine <b>ruptures</b> resulted from uterine contractions; however, the third <b>rupture</b> occurred spontaneously and earlier in gestation. As each uterine <b>rupture</b> occurred earlier than the <b>rupture</b> in the previous gestation, a history of uterine <b>rupture</b> during pregnancy should raise provider suspicion about the possibility of earlier uterine <b>rupture</b> recurrence. CONCLUSIONUterine <b>rupture</b> may occur in pregnancies after hysteroscopic resection of the uterine septum. However, if a patient has a history of uterine <b>rupture</b> during previous pregnancies, the risk of uterine <b>rupture</b> may increase for earlier gestational ages in subsequent pregnancies. The patient must be informed about both the risks of uterine <b>rupture</b> during pregnancy after hysteroscopic septum resection and that recurrent <b>ruptures</b> may occur at earlier gestational weeks than during previous pregnancies...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Uterine <b>rupture</b> at {{delivery}} is a severe life threatening complication for both matter and the newborn. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine the frequency of total number uterine <b>rupture</b> within the deliveries, to perceive circumstances and causes that lead to <b>rupture,</b> to establish perinatal and maternal mortality and to present our therapeutic procedure. Methods. In the group of 37 <b>ruptures</b> at 59 660 deliveries from the period 1991 - 2000 included in this retrospective study we analyzed age, level of education, gestational age, parity, previous caesarian section and other operations on uterus, time of diagnosing <b>rupture,</b> grade and place of <b>rupture,</b> use of Syntocinon and Prostaglandin at delivery, perinatal and maternal mortality, as well as therapeutic procedures at <b>rupture</b> that occurred. Results. The highest influence on uterine <b>rupture</b> in our group had been exerted by previous caesarian section and myomectomy in relation 33 : 4. Incomplete uterine <b>ruptures</b> were more frequent, 26 (70. 27 %), in relation to complete ones, 11 (29. 75 %). The most frequent place of uterine <b>rupture</b> was the front wall, 34 (91. 89 %), two <b>ruptures</b> occurred on the fundus and one on the back wall. The most frequently applied therapeutic procedures were <b>rupture</b> suture in 31 (83. 78 %) cases, and in six (l 6. 22 %) cases hysterectomy.

40|$|Bond <b>rupture</b> is an {{experimental}} methodology {{that is used}} to augment a conventional mass balance biosensor. A good point-of-care biosensor is fast, reliable, simple, cost-effective, and detects low concentrations of the target analyte. Biosensor development is a multidisciplinary field and bond <b>rupture</b> testing is of technical interest to many groups. The Bond <b>rupture</b> methodology endows a mass probe with the ability to discern bond strength. The recognition of specific bonds by mass loading is separated from erroneous non-specific binding by a probe of the force between the analyte and the transducer. Bond <b>rupture</b> is achieved by acoustic excitation of the point of attachment. The force is incremented gradually until <b>rupture</b> occurs. The advancement of bond <b>rupture</b> biosensors beyond the lab requires improved understanding of the mechanisms of bond <b>rupture</b> by base excitation, the transducers, and the supporting hardware. Bond <b>rupture</b> has traditionally been used in conjunction with the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). There exists, however, a variety of sensors and transducers to which the bond <b>rupture</b> methodology could be applied. The time, cost and experience required for comprehensive investigation of all avenues is prohibitive.

40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically {{the passage}} of spontaneous, dynamic in-plane shear <b>ruptures</b> from initiation to their final <b>rupture</b> speed, using very fine grids. By carrying out more than 120 simulations, we identify two different mechanisms controlling supershear transition. For relatively weaker faults, the <b>rupture</b> speed always passes smoothly and continuously through the range of speeds between the Rayleigh and shear wave speeds (the formerly considered forbidden zone of <b>rupture</b> speeds). This, however, occurs {{in a very short}} time, before the <b>ruptures</b> reach the compressional wave speed. The very short time spent in this range of speeds may explain why a jump over these speeds was seen in some earlier numerical and experimental studies and confirms that this speed range is an unstable range, as predicted analytically for steady state, singular cracks. On the other hand, for relatively stronger faults, we find that a daughter <b>rupture</b> is initiated by the main (mother) <b>rupture,</b> ahead of it. The mother <b>rupture</b> continues to propagate at sub-Rayleigh speed and eventually merges with the daughter <b>rupture,</b> whose speed jumps over the Rayleigh to shear wave speed range. We find that this daughter <b>rupture</b> is essentially a “pseudorupture,” in that {{the two sides of the}} fault are already separated, but the <b>rupture</b> has negligible slip and slip velocity. After the mother <b>rupture</b> merges with it, the slip, the slip velocity, and the <b>rupture</b> speed become dominated by those of the mother <b>rupture.</b> The results are independent of grid sizes and of methods used to nucleate the initial <b>rupture...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe 2007 Mw 6. 6 Niigata‐ken Chuetsu‐Oki {{earthquake}} {{implies a}} complex fault mechanism. Several surveys suggest {{the possibility of}} two main segments crosscutting each other at their center (i. e., a northern segment dipping to the northwest and a southern segment dipping to the southeast). We modeled the dynamic <b>rupture</b> propagation numerically along the inferred segmented fault system using a boundary integral equation method (BIEM). The possibility of <b>rupture</b> transfer is numerically demonstrated, and two <b>rupture</b> modes are described. Simultaneous <b>rupture</b> transfer along the overlapping part is possible only under a high‐stress load; however, this <b>rupture</b> mode yields an excessively high slip value. Otherwise, where regional stress is relatively low but pore pressure is high enough to govern the <b>rupture</b> criterion (described as the low frictional coefficient case in this study), the <b>rupture</b> transfer to the other segment does not occur until <b>rupture</b> terminates on the first segment regardless of the crosscutting distance between the two segments. In this case, at the central crosscutting part, a possible <b>rupture</b> scenario is that <b>ruptures</b> occur sequentially in different directions: first a southbound <b>rupture</b> on the northwest‐dipping segment, then a northbound <b>rupture</b> triggered on the southeast‐dipping segment a few seconds later. The simulated <b>rupture</b> scenario on crosscutting faults can be strongly influenced by a preexisting fault structure determined by Miocene rifting during an opening stage of the Sea of Japan and the subsequent shortening of the crust.

40|$|Background—Subclinical {{episodes of}} plaque {{disruption}} followed by healing {{are considered a}} mechanism of increased plaque burden. Detailed pathological studies of healed <b>ruptures,</b> however, are lacking. Methods and Results—We identified acute and healed <b>ruptures</b> from 142 men who died of sudden coronary death and performed morphometric measurements of plaque burden, luminal stenosis, and smooth muscle cell phenotype. Healed <b>ruptures</b> were found in 61 % of hearts and were associated with healed myocardial infarction, increased heart weight, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Multiple healed <b>rupture</b> sites with layering were frequently found in segments with acute and healed rupture; the percent area luminal narrowing increased with increased numbers of healed sites of previous <b>rupture.</b> The underlying percent luminal narrowing for acute <b>ruptures</b> (mean 79615 %) exceeded that for healed <b>ruptures</b> (mean 66614 %, P 50. 0001), and the area within the internal elastic lamina was significantly less in healed <b>ruptures</b> than in acute <b>ruptures,</b> when segments were grouped by distance from the ostium. Healed <b>ruptures</b> favored the accumulation of immature smooth muscle cells at repair sites, with a cellular proliferation index of 0. 4060. 09 %, {{significantly higher than the}} index at the sites of <b>rupture</b> (P 50. 008).

40|$|Seismic inversions {{show that}} {{earthquake}} risetimes {{may be much}} shorter than the overall <b>rupture</b> duration, indicating that earthquakes may propagate as self-healing, pulse-like <b>ruptures.</b> Several mechanisms for producing pulse-like <b>ruptures</b> have been proposed, including velocity-weakening friction, interaction of dynamic <b>rupture</b> with fault geometry and local heterogeneity, and effect of bimaterial contrast. We present experimental results on <b>rupture</b> mode selection in laboratory earthquakes occurring on frictional interfaces, which were prestressed both in compression and in shear. Our experiments demonstrate that pulse-like <b>ruptures</b> can exist {{in the absence of}} a bimaterial effect or of local heterogeneities. We find a systematic variation from crack-like to pulse-like <b>rupture</b> modes with both (1) decreasing nondimensional shear prestress and (2) decreasing absolute levels of shear and normal prestress for the same value of nondimensional shear prestress. Both pulse-like and crack-like <b>ruptures</b> can propagate with either sub-Rayleigh or supershear <b>rupture</b> speeds. Our experimental results are consistent with theories of <b>ruptures</b> on velocity-weakening interfaces, implying that velocity-weakening friction plays an important role in governing the dynamic behavior of earthquake <b>ruptures.</b> We show that there is no measurable fault-normal stress decrease on the fault plane due to the nucleation procedure employed in experiments, and hence, this is not a factor in the <b>rupture</b> mode selection.
