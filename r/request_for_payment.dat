You, as well as Mr. Emerson and Sir James Flash, have won large sums from Mr. Cotter, and the fact that the IOUs he gave you were found on Mr. Emerson points very strongly to their being in confederacy with you in the matter; at any rate, they point so strongly that, whether a jury would convict or not on the evidence that we shall be able to lay before them, there can be no question whatever as to what the opinion of men of honor will be. These IOUs are in our hands. Mr. Cotter does not desire to pursue the case; he will, however, refuse absolutely to pay those IOUs, and in doing so he will have the approval of all honorable men. That being so, the IOUs are absolutely useless to you, and if you will agree to my tearing them up now, he has most kindly consented to let the matter drop in your cases." ...|$|E

Since then, the Malaysian embassy in the Philippines issues a cheque in the amount of 5,300 ringgit (US$1,710 or about 77,000 Philippine pesos) to the legal counsel of the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu every year in keeping with the terms.

5000|$|Harkins {{found that}} there was no legal grounds for the {{government}} to pay Paul, and that even under the wider Congressional concept of [...] "broad moral principles of right and justice", there were not equitable grounds for payment to Paul.

He stated that under the traditional theory of equity, there was no action possible, as equity deals with things [...] "such as reformation of contracts, or mandamus orders to government officials who have failed to follow statutory commands", and this was a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of money. Even under the broader theory of equity as a [...] "moral action", Harkins did not find a duty to pay him additional funds.

50|$|Song {{attempted}} to make arrangements to travel to South Korea in May 2000 to attend memorial events commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Gwangju uprising. According to the North Korean-affiliated Zainichi Korean newspaper Choson Sinbo, he refused conditions placed on him by the South Korean National Intelligence Service, which included a demand that he make a written pledge to respect South Korean law; as a result, his plans to attend the memorial collapsed. In 2001, North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop asserted that Song was actually {{a member of the}} Workers' Party of Korea's Politburo under the alias Kim Chol-su. In response, Song initiated a lawsuit against Hwang in the Seoul 16th District Court, alleging that Hwang's statements constituted libel. Song did not return to the South for this case; his lawyer An Sang-un appeared in court on his behalf. A court ruling in August 2001 recognised that Hwang's statement had no basis in fact, but denied Song's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of damages; the following month, Song announced that he would not appeal the ruling, as he was satisfied with the court's affirmation that he was not Kim Chol-su.|$|E
50|$|During this time, Paul made {{substantial}} {{efforts on}} behalf of the ASNA to ensure the natives received money for the land of the Arctic Slope that was being sold to various oil concerns, culminating in the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA), which provided over forty-six million dollars and several million acres of land to the natives in compensation for their land claims. It also provided for the attorneys who had assisted the natives in preparing their claims to receive up to 1.9 million dollars if they filed a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> within one year of the law's passage. Paul claimed he was due over 10 million dollars, later reducing the claim to 5.9 million and then having a court find the amount at 3.6 million. However, during the distribution of the 1.9 million dollars, Paul was only paid two-hundred seventy-five thousand dollars and continued to seek further remuneration, filing a suit in 1974 in Alaska against ANSA and the cities he had contracted with. This resulted in a judgment for twenty-thousand dollars to Paul. Paul then filed a claim in the Western District of Washington for the same claim in 1976, only to have the court dismiss it in light of the statute of limitations.|$|E
5000|$|On July 20, 2016, in a seven-count {{indictment}} {{returned by}} a federal grand jury, Dr. Carl Reddix, an ob/gyn and owner of Heath Assurance LLC, was charged with paying bribes and kickbacks to Epps in return for contract awards with the MDOC and for-profit prison operators. The attorney for Reddix said Epps demanded bribe payments, an assertion also made by other defendants. The medical contracts for four for-profit Mississippi prisons held by Wexford Health Sources were sequentially taken from Wexford and subsequently awarded to Reddix. In 2008, his company received a contract to [...] "provide inmate health care services" [...] at the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility; it was renewed in 2011. Transfers of contracts for East Mississippi Correctional Facility and Marshall County Correctional Facility from Wexford to Health Assurance followed in 2012. The fourth and final contract was awarded in 2013 for Wilkinson County Correctional Facility. Judge Wingate recused himself from trying the Reddix case, which was reassigned to Judge Daniel Gordon. In a plea bargain, on May 3, 2017, Reddix, {{who was accused of}} paying over $170,000 in bribes, pleaded guilty to a single count of bribery, but his sentencing was postponed until September, with the defense challenging the prosecutors <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of $1.27 in restitution.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{government}} {{agreed to}} pay compensation for the damaged property {{but not for the}} actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>payments.</b> In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.|$|R
