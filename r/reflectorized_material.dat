40|$|It {{is shown}} that retroreflectorized {{materials}} are excellent {{for increasing the}} visibility of obstacles and therefore that they can increase traffic safety. There is {{a great variety of}} <b>reflectorized</b> <b>material</b> available, and therefore a reasonable selection can be made for any application. There are, however, gaps in information about reflectorized materials. Due to this and also due to technical developments in the design and the fabrication of reflectorized materials, it often happens that very different specifications are formulated for similar applications. Also many of the (legal) specifications are much lower than can be obtained with the modern materials available now. It is therefore concluded: (1) to make functional specifications for the retroreflectorized materials for the different applications; (2) to classify retroflective materials in order {{to see if there are}} suitable materials for all applications; (3) to develop materials for application areas for which no materials are available at the moment; and (4) to make international accepted specifications for the light reflecting characteristics of retroflectors and reflectorized materials...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} an inquiry into the design of number plates made of <b>reflectorized</b> <b>materials.</b> The possibilities of identification especially by means of photography were taken into account. It appeared that too much contrast could be avoided by means of a colour filter and a favourable mounting of camera and flash apparatus. As regards the influence of reflecting number plates on the visibility and the estimation of distance and speed of the vehicle some alternative solutions were also discussed...|$|R
