40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sialoliths (salivary gland stones) are calcified {{obstructions}} {{that occur}} in the salivary gland or duct. Sialolith is the most common disease of the salivary glands. Majority of the sialoliths occur in the submandibular gland and can be observed at almost any age. For the diagnosis of sialolith, conventional radiography, ultrasonography and computed-tomography can be used together with clinical examination. CASE REPORT: In the first case, <b>radiopacities</b> were seen under the right mandibular corpus and in the left mandibular angulus region on panoramic radiographs of a 66 -year-old female patient. Ultrasonographic evaluation showed these <b>radiopacities</b> to be sialoliths. The patient had no other symptom and was, therefore, followed periodically. The second case was a 61 -year-old male patient; in the intraoral examination, hard masses were detected in the left submandibular gland region and no salivary flow was observed in the left Wharton duct. <b>Radiopacities</b> were seen on panoramic and mandibular occlusal radiographs. On ultrasonography, these appeared to be sialoliths and were removed intraorally by excision. The third case was a 55 -year-old female patient applied to our clinic with pain on the right cheek and ear while eating. In the intraoral examination, inflammation was detected in the right Stenon duct. On ultrasonography, sialolith and infected parotid gland with heterogeneous echogenicity were noticed. The sialolith was removed surgically under general anesthesia. CONCLUSION: Application of appropriate imaging techniques is important for the diagnosis of sialolith. The diagnosis and treatment of sialolith requires multidisciplinary clinical approach...|$|R

The definitive cause of type 2 TRs is unknown, but histologically destruction of the cementum and other mineralized tissue of the tooth root by odontoclasts is seen. It occurs secondary to the loss of the protective covering of the root (the periodontal ligaments) and possibly to a stimulus such as periodontal disease and the release of cytokines, leading to odontoclast migration. However, FORLs can develop in the absence of inflammation. The natural inhibition to root resorption provided by the lining of the root may be altered by increased amounts of Vitamin D, in cats supplied by their diet.|$|E

A total of 496 patients (232 girls and 264 boys; mean age 11. 2 years, SD 2. 33) were randomly selected from the Orthodontic Clinic at the Faculty of Odontology, University of Malmo, Sweden. All radiographic examinations were performed between 1999 and 2003 at the Department of Oral Radiology, Faculty of Odontology, University of Malmo, Sweden. Two independent examiners analyzed the radiographs for abnormalities and diagnoses of pathology. However, caries and findings related to the orthodontic treatment plan, such as eruption disturbances and missing or supernumerary teeth, were not recorded. All radiographs with positive findings were reexamined by a third examiner, a specialist registrar in oral radiology. A total of 56 findings in 43 patients (8. 7 %) were recorded, and significantly more findings were detected in girls (P =. 007). The most common findings were <b>radiopacities</b> (idiopathic sclerosis) in alveolar bone (n = 22), thickening of mucosal lining in sinus maxillaris (n = 15), and periapical inflammatory lesions (n = 10).

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the frequencies of idiopathic osteosclerosis (IO) and condensing osteitis (CO) in a Turkish patient population with respect to age and sex, in addition to shape, localization, and the dental relationship of IO and CO lesions. Patients and methods: A retrospective study was performed using panoramic radiographs of 6, 154 patients ranging in age from 5 to 69 subjected to dental treatment. Descriptive characteristics of <b>radiopacities,</b> including shape, localization, and dental relationship were recorded. The Chi-squared test was used. Results: There were 238 <b>radiopacities</b> detected, 185 IO lesions in 150 (2. 44 %) subjects (96 female, 54 male and mean age: 26. 2), and 53 CO lesions in 50 (0. 81 %) subjects (27 female, 23 male and mean age: 32. 8). Both IO and CO lesions were found to be higher in number among females when compared to males. However, this difference was statistically significant only for IO lesions (p< 0. 001). The frequency of IO lesions was found to be significantly higher in the 3 rd and 4 th decades of life (20 - 39 years) than in other decades (p< 0. 001). On the other hand, the frequency of CO lesions was the similar in the age ranges of 20 - 39 years and 40 - 69 years, and its frequency in these periods was statistically higher than in the 1 st and 2 nd decades of life (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Our results point to the low IO and CO frequency among the Turkish population. In addition, our findings support the theory that IO lesions are developmental variations of normal bone architecture unrelated to a local stimulant and CO lesions could be considered reactive formations related to teeth with severe caries, restoration, or pulpitis...|$|R

40|$|The <b>radiopacity</b> of {{esthetic}} restorative materials {{has been}} established as an important requirement, improving the radiographic diagnosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the <b>radiopacity</b> of six restorative materials using a direct digital image system, comparing them to the dental tissues (enamel-dentin), expressed as equivalent thickness of aluminum (millimeters of aluminum). Five specimens of each material were made. Three 2 -mm thick longitudinal sections were cut from an intact extracted permanent molar tooth (including enamel and dentin). An aluminum step wedge with 9 steps was used. The samples of different materials were placed on a phosphor plate together with a tooth section, aluminum step wedge and metal code letter, and were exposed using a dental x-ray unit. Five measurements of radiographic density were obtained from each image of each item assessed (restorative material, enamel, dentin, each step of the aluminum step wedge) and the mean of these values was calculated. <b>Radiopacity</b> values were subsequently calculated as equivalents of aluminum thickness. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant differences in <b>radiopacity</b> values among the materials (P< 0. 0001). The <b>radiopacity</b> values of the restorative materials evaluated were, in decreasing order: TPH, F 2000, Synergy, Prisma Flow, Degufill, Luxat.

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} the infJuence of three epoxy resin-based sealers with distinct <b>radiopacities</b> on the observers' {{ability to detect}} root canal filling voids during radiographic analysis. Material and methods: The root canais of 48 extracted maxillary canines were prepared and divided into three groups. Each group was laterally condensed with one sea/er (AH P/usâ¢, Acrosea/Â® o r a non-radiopaque sealer), and a longitudinal void was simulated in half of the specimens from each group (n=S). Buccolingual radiographs were obtained and randomly interpreted for voids by a radiologist and an endodontist in a blinded fashion. Teeth were cut and inspected under a microscope to confirm the position of void. Differences in sensitivity and specificity between groups and examiners were compared using the Fisher's Exact and McNemar tests, respectively (a=O. OS). Results: Significantly lower sensitivity leveis (p<O. OS) were observed in the coronal portion of fillings performed with both radiopaque sealers. Specificity va/ues for AcrosealÂ® were significantly higher (p<O. OS) in the coronal and apical portions of fillings. Conclusions: The type of root canal sealer can affect the observers' ability to detect root canal filling voids during radiographic analysis of upper single-rooted teeth...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) {{associated}} with odontoma {{has been described}} as a new entity with overlapping features of adenomatoid-like structures and odontoma. Presentation of the case: We report the second case of AOT {{associated with}} odontoma in the posterior maxillary region. A 22 -year-old patient presented expansion of the vestibular and palatine cortical wall of maxilla. Radiographic examination and computed tomography confirmed erosion of maxillary walls, root resorption, displacement of a neighboring tooth and <b>radiopacities</b> within the lesion. Histopathological analysis showed a cystic cavity lined by odontogenic epithelium, organized as duct like structures and tubular dentin. The diagnosis established was AOT associated with odontoma. Discussion: As fewer cases have been described, the aim of this study is to report clinical behavior and evolution of adenomatoid odontogenic tumor associated with odontoma, as it have not yet been described and its origin is not completely established. The hamartomatous or neoplastic origin of this tumor is under debate. Conclusions: Therefore, it is necessary similar cases to be published to increase the knowledge about the clinical behavior and evolution of this tumor, to enable such lesions to be more clearly defined in the next classification of odontogenic tumors...|$|R
40|$|Many {{investigators}} {{recommended a}} routine radiographic examination for the edentulous cases before denture treatment. Panoramic radiographs obtained from inactive files of 212 patients -of both sexes- who required {{treatment in the}} college of dentistry KSU. The radiographs were meÂ¬ticulously examined. The plan {{of this study was to}} examine panoramic radiographs of edentulous patients with emphasis on the incidence of five entities; root fragments, impacted teeth, radioÂ¬lucencies, <b>radiopacities,</b> and foreign bodies. Of the 212 panoramic radiographs examined, 180 were free of positive findings, and 32 (J 5. 1 %) have shown positive findings,eighteen patients (8. 5 %) had one or more remaining root fragments, and this entity was statistically significant from the other enÂ¬tities. Three patients (1. 4 %) demonstrated impacted teeth. Five patients (2. 4 %) demonstrated radioÂ¬pacities, two patients (1. 9 %) demonstrated radiolucencies. The radiographs of four patients (1. 9 %) demonstrated foreign bodies. The results of this study have proved the necessity of performing rouÂ¬tine radiographic examination of the jaws for all edentulous patients before constructing complete dentures. It also indicates the need for a better extraction technique together with the use of radioÂ¬graphs before and after extraction. King Saud Universit...|$|R
