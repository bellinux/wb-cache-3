An instrument that imposes a negative obligation on another tenement will normally be a <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant,</b> although there are exceptions [...] - [...] the right to light, capable of being an easement, acts to prevent the owner of the servient tenement from acting inconsistently with it.|$|R
25|$|Though other {{techniques}} to maintain housing segregation had been used, by 1927 the political leaders of Chicago began to adopt racially <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants.</b> The Chicago Real Estate Board promoted a racially <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant</b> to YMCAs, churches, women's clubs, PTAs, Kiwanis clubs, chambers {{of commerce and}} property owners' associations. At one point, as much as 80% of the city's area was included under <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Supreme Court held [...] "the <b>restrictive</b> racially-based <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> are not, {{on their}} face, invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment." [...] Private parties may {{abide by the}} terms of such a <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant,</b> but they may not seek {{judicial}} enforcement of such a covenant, as that would be a state action. Such state action would be discriminatory so the enforcement of a racially-based <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant</b> in a state court would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} multiple {{issues surrounding}} {{the use of}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> {{as a basis for}} opposing the construction of cellular towers. Given the current proliferation of cell towers, and the frequent failure of zoning and land use regulations to address such construction in a comprehensive fashion, opponents of such towers often must turn to other options if they wish to avoid placement of towers in their neighborhoods. As a predicate for the discussion of a number of common <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants,</b> and their potential application to cell towers, the article addresses {{the question of whether the}} Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempts reliance on <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> in this context. The article also considers standing to enforce covenants and the potential application of waiver since wireless service providers are likely to locate towers in areas where other towers or similar structures have already been built. The article concludes that federal law should not preempt state law causes of action such as those which might be based on <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> and suggests that <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> may be a useful option for opponents of cell towers...|$|R

50|$|In Canada, {{governmental}} authorities may use <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> {{as well as}} zoning. For instance, {{the city}} of Calgary's requirement that buildings in the general vicinity of Calgary International Airport be under a certain height is registered against virtually every title in the northeast quadrant {{of the city as}} a <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant,</b> not as a zoning by-law.|$|R
40|$|Do bank debtholders {{discipline}} excessive risk taking? I {{investigate this}} question by examining how a bank's incentives to take risks affect offering yield spreads and <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> in their debt contracts. Results suggest that bank charter values, which determine a bank's risk taking incentives, significantly affect the likelihood of <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> in bank debt contracts. This effect is most pronounced during the 1980 s, when greater competition and relatively less stringent regulation increased the severity of moral hazard problems in the U. S. banking industry. Overall, {{the results suggest that}} an important channel for market investors to discipline bank risk taking is through writing <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> in bank debt...|$|R
50|$|The US Supreme Court {{disagreed}} {{and held}} that since {{some of the}} neighborhood landowners (46%) comprising the class of the prior lawsuit {{did not support the}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant,</b> the previous decision that the covenant was valid could not apply to all members of that class. In other words, it was erroneous to allow the 54% of neighborhood landowners who had supported the <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant</b> to represent the interests of the 46% who were against it. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that the <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenant</b> could be contested in court again, even though some of the parties involved may have been included in the prior class of neighborhood landowner.|$|R
50|$|Anti-semitic {{residential}} segregation {{was also}} prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s, and was accomplished through <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants.</b> These were agreements among owners of properties to not sell or rent {{to members of}} certain races, including Jews, or were clauses registered against deeds by land developers that restricted ownership based on racial origin. At the time, <b>restrictive</b> <b>covenants</b> could be enforced by the courts.|$|R

Another story suggests that there is a requirement that a place of worship must be maintained perpetually on the site, and thus there is supposedly a chapel in one of the towers to comply.
