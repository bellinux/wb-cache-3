40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the two- and {{three-dimensional}} nonlinear water waves generated by a steady or oscillating pressure distribution acting at the free surface of a running stream on water of finite depth h. The solutions of the corresponding linearized problems become singular depending on the relative values of the water depth, frequency, and {{the speed of the}} applied pressure leading to a resonant phenomenon. When the applied oscillatory pressure distribution moves at a <b>resonant</b> <b>speed,</b> the finite amplitude response is governed by the forced nonlinear Schrödinger (fNLS) equation. Under certain circumstances, the generated wave disturbance may not reach a steady state; in particular, for deep water, a steady state is never attained. For the case of a two-dimensional wave generated by a localized steady pressure moving at a <b>resonant</b> <b>speed,</b> the generated waves are actually of bounded amplitude and are governed by a forced Korteweg–de Vries (fKdV) equation subject to appropriate asymptotic initial conditions. A computational study of the forced KdV equation reveals that a series of solitons is generated in front of the pressure distribution. On the other hand, for the case of the three-dimensional waves induced by a localized steady pressure traveling at a <b>resonant</b> <b>speed,</b> the nonlinear response is governed by a forced Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (fKP) equation. In order to extend the range of applicability of the Boussinesq-type equations in the theory of water waves, the modified Boussinesq equations are derived in terms of the velocity potential on an arbitrary elevation and the free surface displacement...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{focuses on}} the {{theoretical}} analysis, design, fabrication and characterization of a small Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid damper. It can be potentially applied to a horizontal axis, front-loading washing machine. In such washing machines, although washing cycle is slow, spin cycle is much faster. During acceleration from washing cycle to spin cycle, the tub passes through its <b>resonant</b> <b>speed</b> requiring relatively high damping. On the other hand, high damping results in increased force transmission to the housing and noise at high-speed spin cycle. Controllability of the MR fluid damper allows adjustment of damping requirements for different cycles and helps to reduce the noise at high speed spin cycle while limiting the tub motion at resonance.

In particular, how soil-structure interaction may a ect the critical or <b>resonant</b> <b>speeds</b> and the associated vibratory amplitudes is evaluated in detail. Resonance in beams, due to the circulation of equidistant loads, is highly influenced by the free vibration response that every single load leaves after traversing the structure. On this basis a numerical investigation is carried out analysing the e ects of the wave propagation problem on the free vibration response of simply-supported beams {{in a wide range}} of travelling speeds. To this end a coupled three-dimensional boundary element-finite element model formulated in the time domain is used to reproduce the soil and structural behaviour, respectively. A catalogue of bridge deck typologies is defined, covering lengths, associated linear masses and fundamental frequencies that may experience high levels of transverse accelerations under resonant conditions, for nowadays existing trains and design speeds. Lengths ranging from 12. 5 to 25 m are evaluated, along with fundamental frequencies covering most common typologies. A homogeneous soil is considered with shear wave speeds in the interval 150 to 365 m / s. From the single load free vibration parametric analysis conclusions are derived regarding the conditions of maximum free vibration and cancellation of the deck response.

Results from the measurements of the system unbalance response are presented for three cases: centered journal, offcentered journal at 30 % and 60 % of the radial clearance. Different masses of unbalance are used for each case. All the experiments were performed at room temperature and at an oil inlet pressure of 6. 9 kPa. The cascade plots of the unbalance response show no trace of asynchronous vibrations. However, the last case studied Ooumal offcentered at 60 % of the radial clearance) showed a supersynchronous vibration tracking the unbalance response at about twice the rotational speed.

40|$|LecturePg. 71 - 86. With {{turbine rotors}} of low shaft {{elasticity}} (large diameter and small bearing span) {{the increase in}} amplitude at the first point of shaft resonance in the speed range is generally slight. Consequently no particular {{attention is paid to}} this point of resonance either at the rotor design stage or during operation of the turbine. However, if a two-cylinder condensing turbine has {{to be replaced by a}} single-cylinder machine of similar high efficiency, it is necessary to have a drum-type rotor of large bearing span and small diameter in the region of the first drum stages, and large diameter in the region of the low-pressure stages. This type of rotor has a markedly higher shaft elasticity compared with the rotors of the two-cylinder machine. A rotor of this type was recently built and put into service. This paper describes the rotor and gives its calculated dynamic characteristics. Since operation in the vicinity of the first <b>resonant</b> <b>speed</b> is of greatest interest the paper describes the test results for the properly balanced condition, and for the artificially heavily unbalanced condition. The shaft vibration values measured during the test-run are compared with the assessment criteria for rotor dynamic performance used at present. In order to obtain valid theoretical statements for even more slender rotors, the shaft elasticity was systematically increased in theoretical calculations (by increasing the bearing span). The effects of the shaft elasticity on the magnitude of the resonant speeds, the maximum vibration amplitudes and the stability limit (oil whip) are described. In its original form, the drum-type rotor studied here has only one output shaft coupling. For even higher turbine powers, however, heavy couplings on both shaft ends are necessary. In order to examine the dynamic behavior of these rotors, the original rotor was fitted with an extra mass at the usually free shaft-end to simulate a second coupling. For this rotor, the same calculations and measurements were carried out in the overspeed testing pit as were for the original rotor. The results are given and discussed.

40|$|The {{vibration}} of turbomachinery blades is {{an important}} phenomenon to understand, observe and predict and {{is the reason for}} developing a tip timing measurement system. Vibration leads to High Cycle Fatigue (HCF), which limits blade durability and life. HCF can result in blade failure, having expensive consequences for the engine involved. The traditional method for monitoring blade vibration under test conditions is to use blade mounted strain gauges. However, strain gauges are costly and time consuming to install. They have a limited operating life as they are subjected to the harsh on-engine conditions. Only a limited number of blades can be monitored with strain gauges as the number that can be used is limited by the number of channels in the slip ring or telemetry. They can also interfere with the assembly aerodynamics. Consequently non-intrusive alternative techniques such as tip timing are sought. Capacitance probe based clearance measurement systems see widespread use in turbomachinery applications to establish rotor blade tip clearance. This thesis reports investigations into an alternative and additional use in aero-engine rotor blade tip timing measurement for these commercially available systems. Tip clearance is of great importance in the gas turbine industry; this is clear from the fact that gas turbine efficiency has an inverse relationship with tip clearance. Large tip clearance leads to large leakage flows, hence low efficiency, thus the common use of the capacitance probe clearance measurement technique in monitoring turbomachinery. Optical systems have been successfully used to measure rotor blade tip timing on test rigs with several optical probes mounted equally spaced around the turbomachine casing. However, there are practical problems associated with mounting such monitoring systems on in-service jet engines. Optical probes require high maintenance to keep the lenses clean, probably incorporating a purge air system to keep the lenses from fouling. Such impracticalities and added weight make it unlikely that an optical probe based tip timing system will be fitted on an in-service engine in the foreseeable future. In this thesis the scope for a dual use sensor to measure both turbomachinery tip clearance and tip timing is investigated. Since it is impractical to measure blade tip clearance with an optical probe, then the obvious choice for such a sensor is a capacitance probe. Therefore, a commercially available FM capacitance probe based blade tip clearance measurement system is used in a series of tip timing practical investigations. The equipment and instrumentation designed, assembled and produced to facilitate this investigation is documented. These include the development of an optical once per revolution sensor and the design of an independent vibration measurement system based on blade mounted strain gauges. Through an extensive body of experimental work the practicalities in this alternate use of the tip clearance measurement equipment have been assessed. System responses pertaining to tip timing measurement have been investigated, characterised and quantified. The accuracy by which tip timing can be measured using the system has been reported through the findings of an experimental programme carried out on a full-sized, low-speed compressor. Specifically, dual capacitance probe tip timing derived vibration amplitudes have been compared to those derived from blade mounted strain gauge signals. Sources of error have been identified and quantified. Amplitudes were found to agree within the calculated error bands. Instantaneous resonant blade vibrations measured through single capacitance probe tip timing have been correlated with strain gauge derived vibration levels. This has also been done as the rotor traverses blade <b>resonant</b> <b>speed.</b> In this case the vibration phase change across resonance expected from theory was successfully detected through tip timing. Also, the accuracy by which blade time of arrival can be determined by using capacitance probe tip timing has been assessed using a precision OPR sensor and a non-vibrating compressor rotor blade. The characteristics of a DC capacitance probe based clearance measurement system's response to movement in 3 D space in proximity to a blade tip have been mapped.

Series compensation is an established means of enhancing the power transfer capability of existing transmission lines and is being increasingly considered for integrating large wind power plants. However, series compensated transmission lines may cause subsynchronous resonance (SSR) in turbine-generators, which can lead to electrical instability at subsynchronous frequencies and potential turbine-generator shaft failures. This thesis deals primarily with the potential of subsynchronous resonance in induction generator based wind farms connected to series compensated lines. Two types of Induction Generators - single cage and double cage, are considered to develop a state space model of the overall wind farm system. Eigenvalue analyses followed by participation factor analysis and sensitivity studies are performed over a wide range of operating conditions. These analyses include variations in the size of wind farm, wind power output, and series compensation levels. The potential for SSR in a wind farm is examined through a comprehensive small signal analysis. A novel equivalent circuit analysis is also presented in this thesis for investigating the impact of fault at wind farm terminals based on the <b>resonant</b> <b>speeds</b> of wind turbine generators. Both eigenvalue analysis and equivalent circuit studies are validated through electromagnetic transient simulations carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC software. These studies are conducted for both modified IEEE First SSR Benchmark systems and Second SSR Benchmark systems, and with three different commercially available wind turbine generators. It is found that induction generator effect based SSR may be experienced with large wind farms even at realistic levels of series compensation. This thesis proposes a STATCOM to alleviate SSR in such series compensated wind farms. Two STATCOM controllers are proposed and their performances compared. A detailed SSR study is also conducted to examine the impact of HVDC lines on Induction Generator Based wind farms. However, it is concluded that HVDC converter controller may not have the potential for torsional interaction with IG based wind farms.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1988 The {{interaction}} of long equatorial Rossby waves with mean zonal currents {{in the ocean}} is investigated in a continuously stratified finite difference numerical model. The model allows for realistic specification of the mean state including both vertical and meridional shear of the mean flow. In addition to stretching of wave scales expected from slowly varying wave theory, one effect of strongly sheared mean flows is to cause meridional scattering of wave energy. This scattering, which cannot be treated by slowly varying theory, causes wave energy input at the surface in an equatorially confined structure to be sent poleward. This scattering of wave activity, depicted by reflection of the Eliassen-Palm flux off the mean shear, causes structural changes to the no-flow wave solutions. As a result, for realistic mean flows, wave energy appears at higher latitudes and a shadow zone occurs below the Equatorial Undercurrent in the near equatorial zone. The lateral shear of the Undercurrent also causes equatorward focusing of wave energy input at higher latitudes. The case of westward flow shows that the changes in <b>resonant</b> phase <b>speeds</b> and wave structures can be very large. Due to the scattering nature of rapidly varying flow, {{the presence of an}} equatorially confined critical layer does not preclude the radiation of wave activity into the deep ocean as it does for the Kelvin waves (McPhaden et al., 1986). However, wave activity which reaches the deep ocean does so at higher latitudes. The wave induced mean accelerations for both the resting ocean and for an eastward Undercurrent in this model are dominated by frictional dissipation of wave energy and, therefore, are relatively weak. The induced accelerations for westward flows, where (c-U) → O, show behavior similar to Kelvin waves in eastward flow in that large divergences of the EP flux exist leading to large momentum transfers from wave to mean states. The primary difference from the Kelvin waves is that the wave-induced residual circulation is important locally and leads to significant accelerations. These accelerations are primarily due to Coriolis torque with a lesser contribution from the residual advection of mean momentum...|$|R
40|$|Two {{state of}} the art finite element {{reduction}} techniquespreviously validated against the direct finite element method,one based on classical modal analysis and another based oncomponent mode synthesis, are applied for efficient mistunedfree vibration and forced response analysis of several bladeddisk geometries. The methods are first applied to two testcases in order to demonstrate the differences in computationalefficiency as well as to validate the methods againstexperimental data. As previous studies have indicated, nonoticeable differences in accuracy are detected for the currentapplications, while the method based on classical modalanalysis is significantly more efficient. Experimental data(mistuned frequencies and mode shapes) available for one of thetwo test cases are compared with numerical predictions, and agood match is obtained, which adds to the previous validationof the methods (against the direct finite element method). The influence of blade-to-blade coupling and rotation speedon the sensitivity of bladed disks to mistuning is thenstudied. A transonic fan is considered with part span shroudsand without shrouds, respectively, constituting a high and alow blade-to-blade coupling case. For both cases, computationsare performed at rest as well as at various rotation speeds. Mistuning sensitivity is modelled as the dependence ofamplitude magnification on the standard deviation of bladestiffnesses. The finite element reduction technique based onclassical modal analysis is employed for the structuralanalysis. This reduced order model is solved for sets of randomblade stiffnesses with various standard deviations, i. e. MonteCarlo simulations. In order to reduce the sample size, thestatistical data is fitted to a Weibull (type III) parametermodel. Three different parameter estimation techniques areapplied and compared. The key role of blade-to-blade coupling,as well as the ratio of mistuning to coupling, is demonstratedfor the two cases. It is observed that mistuning sensitivityvaries significantly with rotation speed for both fans due toan associated variation in blade-to-blade coupling strength. Focusing on the effect of one specific engine order on themistuned response of the first bending modes, it is observedthat the mistuning sensitivity behaviour of the fan withoutshrouds is unaffected by rotation at its resonant condition,due to insignificant changes in coupling strength at thisspeed. The fan with shrouds, on the other hand, shows asignificantly different behaviour at rest and resonant speed,due to increased coupling under rotation. Comparing the twocases at <b>resonant</b> rotor <b>speeds,</b> the fan without shrouds is lessor equally sensitive to mistuning than the fan with shrouds inthe entire range of mistuning strengths considered. This thesis 9 ̆ 2 scientific contribution centres on themistuning sensitivity study, where the effects of shrouds androtation speed are quantified for realistic bladed diskgeometries. However, also the validation of two finite elementreduction techniques against experimental measurementsconstitutes an important contribution. NR 2014080...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The primary aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the fundamental acoustic properties of several cementitious materials, the influence of mix design parameters/constituents, and finally the effect of the physical and mechanical properties of cementitious material concrete/mortar on the acoustic properties of the material. The main objectives were: 	To understand the mechanism of sound production in musical instruments and the effects of the material(s) employed on the sound generated; 	To build upon previous research regarding selection of the tested physical/mechanical properties and acoustic properties of cementitious materials; 	To draw conclusions regarding the effect of different constituents, mix designs and material properties upon the acoustic properties of the material; 	To build a model {{of the relationship between the}} acoustic properties of a cementitious material and its mix design via its physical/mechanical properties. In order to meet the aim, this research was conducted by employing the semi-experimental (half analytical) method: two experimental programmes were performed (I and II); a mathematical optimization technique (least square method) was then implemented in order to construct an optimized mathematical model to match with the experimental data. In Experimental Programme I, six constituents/factors were investigated regarding the effect on the physical/mechanical and acoustic properties: cementitious material additives (fly ash, silica fume, and GGBS), superplasticizer, and basic mix design parameters (w/c ratio, and sand grading). 11 properties (eight physical/mechanical properties: compressive strength, density, hardness, flexural strength, flexural modulus, elastic modulus, dynamic modulus and slump test; and three acoustic properties: <b>resonant</b> frequency, <b>speed</b> of sound and quality factor (internal damping)) were tested for each constituents/factors related mortar type. For each type of mortar, there were three cubes, three prisms and three cylinders produced. In Experimental Programme I, 20 mix designs were investigated, 180 specimens produced, and 660 test results recorded. After analysing the results of Experimental Programme I, fly ash (FA), w/b ratio and b/s ratio were selected as the cementitious material/factors which had the greatest influence on the acoustic properties of the material; these were subsequently investigated in detail in Experimental Programme II. In Experimental Programme II, various combinations of FA replacement level, w/b ratios and b/s ratios (three factors) resulted in 1122 test results. The relationship between these three factors on the selected 11 properties was then determined. Through using regression analysis and optimization technique (least square method), the relationship between the physical/mechanical properties and acoustic properties was then determined. Through both experimental programmes, 54 mix designs were investigated in total, with 486 specimens produced and tested, and 1782 test results recorded. Finally, based upon well-known existing relationships (including, model of compressive strength and elastic modulus, and the model of elastic modulus and dynamic modulus), and new regressioned models of FA-mortar (the relationship of compressive strength and constituents, which is unique for different mixes), the optimized object function of acoustic properties (speed of sound and damping ratio) and mix design (proportions of constituents) were constructed via the physical/mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} thesis {{there is}} listed characteristics of circular saw blades, their distribution, influence of construction adjustments on final behavior of blade {{in the process}} of machining, problematic of oscillation of blades a mutual interaction among quality of machined surface, noise and dust. The thesis covers the problems of oscillation of circular saw blades as when idling and operating - the cutting process; and by the use of three circular saw blades with different construction modifications. These aforementioned construction measures are also compared to each other due to the implementation of standard construction saw blades not only from the perspective of oscillation, but also {{from the perspective of the}} roughness of the machined surface and the analysis of wood waste generated during cutting and noise. In the theoretical part there is an analysis of available literature and scientific theses. It outlines the particular publications devoted to methods of determining the shapes of oscillation, determining critical, <b>resonant</b> and recommended <b>speed,</b> blade constructions, including possible modifications, the theory of cutting saw blades including determining the size and shape of the splints and the effects of noise on the work environment. An important part of this work is methodology involving direct measurements for detection of unstable states of discs (resonance and critical speed. In this section it is further evaluated measuring of the oscillation of the test saw blade and verification of the proposed methodology with a different and practiced, commonly known method, so called cold shapes: The author also seeks to explore and determine the effect of different tooth pitch and method of execution of slots along with soundproofing grooves on noise levels, the resulting quality of the machined surface of various wood. The generated waste is then analyzed for splitting wood particles in particular size group with the percentage of each chip. The results of the experiment are in discussion confronted with the available scientific theses, taking into account with normal operating conditions, of which the conclusion is drawn...|$|R
40|$|Confocal {{microscopy}} {{has become}} an invaluable tool in biology and the biomedical sciences, enabling rapid, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution optical sectioning of complex systems. Confocal microscopy is routinely used, for example, to study specific cellular targets 1, monitor dynamics in living cells 2 - 4, and visualize the three dimensional evolution of entire organisms 5, 6. Extensions of confocal imaging systems, such as confocal microendoscopes, allow for high-resolution imaging in vivo 7 and are currently being applied to disease imaging and diagnosis in clinical settings 8, 9. Confocal microscopy provides three-dimensional resolution by creating so-called "optical sections" using straightforward geometrical optics. In a standard wide-field microscope, fluorescence generated from a sample is collected by an objective lens and relayed directly to a detector. While acceptable for imaging thin samples, thick samples become blurred by fluorescence generated {{above and below the}} objective focal plane In contrast, confocal microscopy enables virtual, optical sectioning of samples, rejecting out-of-focus light to build high resolution three-dimensional representations of samples. Confocal microscopes achieve this feat by using a confocal aperture in the detection beam path. The fluorescence collected from a sample by the objective is relayed back through the scanning mirrors and through the primary dichroic mirror, a mirror carefully selected to reflect shorter wavelengths such as the laser excitation beam while passing the longer, Stokes-shifted fluorescence emission. This long-wavelength fluorescence signal is then passed to a pair of lenses on either side of a pinhole that is positioned at a plane exactly conjugate with the focal plane of the objective lens. Photons collected from the focal volume of the object are collimated by the objective lens and are focused by the confocal lenses through the pinhole. Fluorescence generated above or below the focal plane will therefore not be collimated properly, and will not pass through the confocal pinhole 1, creating an optical section in which only light from the microscope focus is visible. (Fig 1). Thus the pinhole effectively acts as a virtual aperture in the focal plane, confining the detected emission to only one limited spatial location. Modern commercial confocal microscopes offer users fully automated operation, making formerly complex imaging procedures relatively straightforward and accessible. Despite the flexibility and power of these systems, commercial confocal microscopes are not well suited for all confocal imaging tasks, such as many in vivo imaging applications. Without the ability to create customized imaging systems to meet their needs, important experiments can remain out of reach to many scientists. In this article, we provide a step-by-step method for the complete construction of a custom, video-rate confocal imaging system from basic components. The upright microscope will be constructed using a resonant galvanometric mirror to provide the fast scanning axis, while a standard <b>speed</b> <b>resonant</b> galvanometric mirror will scan the slow axis. To create a precise scanned beam in the objective lens focus, these mirrors will be positioned at the so-called telecentric planes using four relay lenses. Confocal detection will be accomplished using a standard, off-the-shelf photomultiplier tube (PMT), and the images will be captured and displayed using a Matrox framegrabber card and the included software.
