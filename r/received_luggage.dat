50|$|The airport's sole 220000 sq ft {{passenger}} terminal {{is divided into}} two parts: International and Domestic with a boarding bridge in each. The International part of the terminal is larger than the Domestic one due to higher number of passengers. The building is also divided into two floors: The lower floor is used for checking in, boarding or getting off small planes and <b>receiving</b> <b>luggage</b> while the upper floor is used for boarding or getting off large planes only.|$|R

50|$|A handful {{were further}} repainted into Greater Manchester PTE livery, some regaining their TSO trailer and <b>receiving</b> {{additional}} <b>luggage</b> racks {{dedicated to the}} new Manchester Airport services. Once class 323 units were in service, the 305s were gradually withdrawn, but a few retained on Hadfield services until track alignment was performed in 1997, allowing the longer bodied Class 323's to negotiate the sharp curves at Dinting station. The surviving units also occasionally turned up on other local services around Manchester, with the last 305 to work out of Stoke-on-Trent believed to be 305506 on 22 May 2000 on the 20:57 to Manchester.|$|R

50|$|Retractable hardtops {{can vary}} in {{material}} (steel, plastic or aluminum), {{can vary from}} two to five {{in the number of}} rigid sections and often rely on complex dual-hinged trunk (British: boot) lids that enable the trunk lid to both receive the retracting top from the front and also <b>receive</b> parcels or <b>luggage</b> from the rear - along with complex trunk divider mechanisms to prevent loading of luggage that would conflict with the operation of the hardtop.|$|R
50|$|The {{contract}} for handling the baggage for attendees {{of a national}} convention of the Epworth League in San Francisco was given to a non-union company. During the prior year, a union company was hired during another convention in San Francisco to handle the baggage, but many attendees did not <b>receive</b> their <b>luggage</b> until {{they were ready to}} leave town. Tens of thousands of attendees were projected to attend, and the Drayman's Association was hoping to avoid a similarly embarrassing episode. However, the non-union company given the contract was unable to fulfill its obligations and sought the assistance of firm controlled by the newly organized Brotherhood of Teamsters. The union refused to work on a job with non-union men. In response, the Draymen's Association, under pressure from the Employers' Association, locked out the city's unionized teamsters on July 21. They were hoping to break the power of the teamsters' union.|$|R
5000|$|Lost <b>Luggage</b> <b>received</b> {{mixed reviews}} upon release. Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz {{wrote in a}} 1982 issue of the {{magazine}} Electronic Games that Lost Luggage did not have [...] "the spark of greatness". While they praised the game for shifting away from [...] "the typical SF shoot-out" [...] and {{said that it was}} [...] "solid" [...] and [...] "playable", they remarked on its plain-looking graphics and said that [...] "even the greatest concept cannot make a great game when it isn't blended with an outstanding type of play action." [...] Writing for Video, Kunkel and Katz commented on the game's [...] "incredibly cute touches", but suggested that Apollo may have better [...] "scrimped on the frills" [...] in favor of additional gameplay challenges. A reviewer for the magazine TV Gamer recommended the game for children, but felt that seasoned video game players would enjoy Kaboom! more. More positive opinions were from Videogaming Illustrated, which described the game as the most charming of Apollo's releases, and Texas Monthly, which described it as a [...] "fiendish little amusement." ...|$|R
50|$|On Day 1, Housemates Marco, Ahmed, Jason, Daniel, Stuart, Victor, Vanessa, Emma, Kitten, Michelle, Shell and Nadia {{entered the}} house. The Housemates {{were not allowed}} to bring their luggage into the house with them, and it was later {{revealed}} that one Housemate would not <b>receive</b> their <b>luggage</b> throughout their entire stay in the house. On Day 2, the Housemates were individually called to the Diary Room, and had to nominate the Housemate they felt was least deserving of their suitcase; Kitten was selected, receiving seven votes total. Kitten chose not to go in the Diary Room and vote, thus automatically selected herself. Only five Housemates did not vote for Kitten; Nadia and Ahmed voted for Michelle, Emma voted for Victor, Daniel voted for Marco and Stuart voted for Ahmed. That same night, it was revealed that an eviction would occur that week, however, the evicted Housemate would not actually be evicted, but would be able to watch the Housemates before returning to the house. On Day 5, the Housemates moved the alcohol fridge into the bedroom, and were reprimanded by Big Brother. Following this, Kitten received a second warning, and it was revealed that an eviction would occur should she break another. On Day 6, Kitten received her third strike for painting the mirrors in the house. Housemates were not told when the eviction would be, or who would be evicted. On Day 8, it was revealed that Kitten had been expelled from the house, and had to immediately leave. Kitten refused to leave the house, thus Big Brother revealed that the grand prize of £100,000 would decrease by £1,000 for each minute Kitten spent in the house. Kitten left the house only a minute later, though she lost the group £9,000, despite the rule being they would lose £1,000 per minute. This brought the grand prize to a total of £91,000.|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this article is to feature {{information}} to assist transplant providers in their day-to-day practice of fielding questions or avoiding emergencies related to the general well-being of patients after solid organ transplantation. As we all know, the transplant specialist is not only a “specialist ” but also a “jack-of-all-trades ” when it comes to assessing common childhood complaints, answering questions related to infectious exposures, and counseling regarding safe travel. For patients that have numerous or vital medications, traveling can be particularly cumbersome and failure to plan appropriately can result in significant health problems for the patient or frustration for the transplant program handling the “medication emergency” from afar. CAR TRAVEL Most medications need to be protected from heat and light, especially liquid preparations. The car is generally not the best place to store them. It is better to take the medications out of the car and with you or package them such that the medications are not exposed to temperature extremes. If medications require cooler temperatures or refrigeration they may be packed in a cooler with a frozen “ice-like pack, ” as long as the medication does not directly come in contact with the ice pack. Actual ice should never be used as this may melt and cause problems. AIRPLANE TRAVEL When traveling via airplane, patients should always keep their medications in their carry-on baggage, eliminating the concerns of lost baggage. As it can take up to several days to <b>receive</b> lost <b>luggage,</b> keeping medications with them prevents missed doses. Additionally, overseas flights or travel delays may result in the need to take a scheduled dose during the flight. It is important to keep as close to the usual dosing interval as possible despite time zone changes so that too many or too few medications are not taken within a 24 -hour time period. Medications should be labeled with a professionally printed label identifying the medication and the manufacturer’s name. 1, 2 The best way to do this is using the original prescription label from the patient’s pharmacy. The medication must match the name on the passenger’s ticket...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2015, on {{application}} by the parties, Smith recused himself {{from being the}} judge in long running multi-party proceedings between various airlines. The judge's personal luggage, together with that of other passengers, had failed to arrive in London after a flight from Florence. Smith corresponded with {{the chief executive of}} British Airways (BA), suggesting that BA may have taken a deliberate decision not to carry the passengers' luggage and that this may have been in order to make additional profit from the conveyance of cargo on that flight. A number of the parties to the litigation applied for Smith to recuse himself from further part in the case. During the hearing, Smith repeatedly asked counsel for BA what had happened to his <b>luggage,</b> <b>receiving</b> the response that the proceedings were not appropriate for dealing with a personal dispute. [...] In due course Smith agreed to recuse himself. [...] In his judgment of 22 July 2015 he set out a detailed account of the occasion when the luggage went missing, and suggested that the true issue in the case was that the missing luggage gave rise to issues which were similar to some of the allegations in the case which he had to try, so that (if they were correct) {{he would have had to}} recuse himself. He said that he would continue his investigation into the luggage issue [...] "in a private capacity ... with the vigour for which I am known".|$|R
