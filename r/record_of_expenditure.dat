40|$|This {{research}} considers {{accounting for}} post-earthquake recovery in New Zealand. New Zealand’s most devastating earthquakes {{are considered to}} be the Murchison earthquake of 1929, the Napier/Hawke’s Bay earthquake of 1931 and the Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 – 11. At the time of the Murchison and Napier earthquakes, government accounting information was an ex post <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Contemporary government accounting in New Zealand is accrual based and comprehensive, and so accounting information has played a more prominent role in the management of Christchurch’s earthquake recovery. Apart from evidencing the significant change to government accounting, an historical comparison of accounting {{in the context of the}} Murchison and Napier earthquakes vis-à-vis the Christchurch earthquakes indicates the extent of change in the interplay between national and local government in New Zealand. The relationship between national and local government, though legally unchanged, has become more complex, but the financial reports do not reveal this complexity.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the cost and}} impact of a centrally-driven quality improvement initiative in four UK mental health communities. Methods: Total costs in year 1 were identified using documentation, a staff survey, semi-structured interviews and discussion groups. Few outcome data were collected within the programme so thematic {{analysis was used to}} identify the programme’s impact within its five broad underlying principles. Results: The survey had a 40 % response. Total costs ranged between £ 164, 000 and £ 458, 000 per site, plus staff time spent on workstreams. There was a very hazy view of the resources absorbed and poor <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> and activity. The initiative generated little demonstrable improvements in service quality but some participants reported changes in attitudes. Conclusions: Given the difficult contexts, short time-scales and capacity constraints, the programme’s lack of impact is not surprising. It may, however, represent a worthwhile investment in cultural change which might facilitate improvements in how services are delivered...|$|R

As a result, it is unclear what constitutes maintenance and what marks substantial construction work; however, Richard Eales, who wrote the 2006 English Heritage guidebook, suggests that there were two periods of building, when sums spent were larger than usual: £54 in 1204–1207 and £67 in 1210–1212.

40|$|A country’s health {{information}} system (HIS) {{is expected to}} produce information {{on the distribution of}} population health, its determinants and the health system response which is crucial for evidence-based policymaking. However, HIS are often weak in low- and middle-income countries. India is rapidly undergoing an epidemiological transition with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries now accounting for {{a large proportion of the}} disease burden. This thesis examined the data available on NCDs and injuries in India in order to inform further development of India’s HIS. Data available on some aspects of each of the five domains of {{health information}} – risk factors, morbidity, service provision, health expenditure and mortality – were assessed using a variety of methods. The findings led to the following recommendations: i) validated measures of NCD risk factor prevalence, NCD and injury morbidity, and NCD and injury intervention coverage should be included in the current large-scale periodic population surveys; ii) measures of out-of-pocket payments for health from population surveys require validation and triangulation with other <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> and; iii) police data on road traffic crash fatalities require standardisation, streamlining and periodic evaluation for data quality. In order to address these and other data gaps, a systematic approach is required to improving the HIS in India. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

It was {{probably}} finished before Corbeil died in 1138 and definitely before 1141, when Robert, Earl of Gloucester, was imprisoned there during the Anarchy of King Stephen's reign. It is likely that after the keep was built there was no further building activity in the 12thcentury, although the structure was maintained. Though held by the Archbishops of Canterbury under the king, the monarch was still responsible for financially supporting the castle. Continuous <b>records</b> <b>of</b> royal <b>expenditures</b> known as [...] "Pipe Rolls" [...] began in the reign of HenryII, and included in the rolls are details <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> on Rochester Castle's upkeep. During the 12thcentury, these were generally small figures, but in 1172–1173 more than £100 was spent on the castle, coinciding with the rebellion of HenryII's sons. Following the fall of Normandy in 1204 to the French forces of King PhilipII, King John increased his expenditure on the castles in south-east England in preparation for a possible invasion. Amongst these was Rochester and in 1206 John spent £115 on the castle's ditches, keep, and other structures. Under England's Angevin kings royal castles in south-east England were invested in to protect the country from invasion; Rochester was one of the most important.|$|R

The feature of mechanization of rice farming in Taiwan is characterized by contract farming. The study case is a typical example of large scale operation of the "long-distance" type contract work. Features of contract farming are as follows. The first is introduction of imported, large and high-performance machines. The second is the operation of "long-distance" type, covering a travel distance of over 100 km. The third is the different charge settings for the neighboring country and the local town.
