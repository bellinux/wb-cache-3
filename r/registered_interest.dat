2500|$|There {{have been}} a number of plans in the past for relocation. The first, {{reported}} in 2001, was to relocate to a proposed 43,000-seat stadium at Pickett's Lock intended for the 2005 World Athletics Championships to be held in London. However, the stadium was never built as the government deemed the project too expensive, and the venue of the games was eventually moved to Helsinki. Over the next few years various other schemes were suggested, including a relocation to the rebuilt Wembley Stadium (which finally opened in 2007). On 1 October 2010, ostensibly as a back-up to the plans for a new stadium, Tottenham <b>registered</b> <b>interest</b> in making use of the Olympic Stadium being built for the 2012 London Olympics in conjunction with AEG, owners and operators of The O2 in London's Greenwich, formerly known as the Millennium Dome. The club also proposed rebuilding on the site [...] after the 2012 Olympics. However Spurs bid for the stadium was rejected on 11 February 2011. Spurs pursued legal action over the ruling to give the Stratford stadium to West Ham United, but later withdrew.|$|E

50|$|The Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, {{marked the}} first major piece of land reform {{legislation}} to be passed under the SNP government. Its provisions covered different areas pertaining to community empowerment and public participation in policy and planning, including several related directly to land. The {{most important of these}} was the extension of the Community Right to Buy to communities of any size, including, for the first time, those in urban areas. It also introduced a new community right to buy land which is abandoned, neglected or causing harm to the environmental wellbeing of the community. Similar to the 2003 Act's crofting community right to buy, this new right does not require a willing seller. Rather, Scottish ministers may compel a landowner to sell to communities with a <b>registered</b> <b>interest,</b> if they deem the sale likely to contribute to sustainable local development.|$|E
5000|$|In many {{countries}} the Torrens title system {{of real estate}} ownership is managed and guaranteed {{by the government and}} replaces cumbersome tracing of ownership. The Torrens title system operates on the principle of [...] "title by registration" [...] (i.e. the indefeasibility of a <b>registered</b> <b>interest)</b> rather than [...] "registration of title." [...] The system does away with the need for a chain of title (i.e. tracing title through a series of documents) and does away with the conveyancing costs of such searches. The State guarantees title and is usually supported by a compensation scheme for those who lose their title due to the State's operation. It has been in practice in all Australian states and in New Zealand since between 1858 and 1875, has more recently been extended to strata title, and has been adopted by many states, provinces and countries, and in modified form in 9 states of the USA.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{responses}} to the consultation the Scottish Government presented the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to the Scottish Parliament on 22 June 2015. The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 16 March 2016, and received Royal Assent on 22 March 2016 becoming Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016. The most radical and controversial provision of the act was the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permitted Scottish Ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a <b>registered</b> <b>interest.</b> Like the Crofting Community Right to Buy and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a third party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|E

A number of independent schools such as Downe House School, City of London School, Charterhouse School, Cranleigh School, Westminster School, Winchester College, Oundle School, Christ's Hospital, Dulwich College, Shrewsbury School, Rugby School and Eton College have replaced A-Levels with Cambridge Pre-Us in some subjects. They are joined by grammar and comprehensive schools, and sixth-form colleges including Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School, Wimbledon College, Coloma Convent Girls' School, King Edward VI School, Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, Harris Westminster Sixth Form, Watford Grammar School for Girls, Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys and Lancaster Royal Grammar School.

5000|$|A further {{provision}} {{is the creation}} of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a <b>registered</b> <b>interest.</b> Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and extended by the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows crofting communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|E

5000|$|In D-Bus, {{a process}} offers its {{services}} exposing objects. These objects have methods {{that can be}} invoked, and signals that the object can emit. Methods and signals are collectively referred as {{the members of the}} object. Any client connected to the bus can interact with an object by using its methods, making requests or commanding the object to perform actions. For instance, an object representing a time service can be queried by a client using a method that returns the current date and time. A client can also listen to signals that an object emits when its state changes due to certain events, usually related to the underlying service. An example would be when a service that manages hardware devices [...] - such as USB or network drives - [...] signals a [...] "new hardware device added" [...] event. Clients should instruct the bus that they are interested in receiving certain signals from a particular object, since a D-Bus bus only passes signals to those processes with a <b>registered</b> <b>interest</b> in them.|$|E
50|$|By {{the turn}} of the millennium, the {{capacity}} of White Hart Lane had fallen significantly behind compared to other major Premier League clubs who had plans to expand further (for example, proposed development of Old Trafford had a projected capacity of 79,000 while Arsenal planned to build a new stadium that would seat 60,000). Talks began over the redevelopment and future of White Hart Lane, and many stadium designs and ideas were rumoured in the media, with the possibility of Tottenham Hotspur moving home also mooted. However, a move to Wembley Stadium was ruled out by the club, as was talk of moving to the 2012 Olympic Stadium in Stratford after completion of the Games. Nevertheless, ostensibly as back-up planning to the plans for a new stadium, on 1 October 2010, Tottenham <b>registered</b> <b>interest</b> in making use of the Olympic Stadium in conjunction with AEG, owners and operators of The O2 in London's Greenwich, formerly known as the Millennium Dome. However Spurs bid for the stadium was rejected on 11 February 2011. Spurs pursued legal action over the ruling to give the Stratford stadium to West Ham United, Ultimately the club's owners, ENIC Group, decided to focus solely on the ongoing redevelopment plan for White Hart Lane as part of the Northumberland Development Project after the West Ham deal for the Olympic Stadium collapsed due to 'legal paralysis' and the stadium remaining in public.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{reflecting}} the social use of land, the priority system of land registration and the Registers record of all interests in land {{has made significant}} exceptions for informal methods of acquiring rights, and especially equitable interests, in land. Under the Land Registration Act 2002 sections 27 to 30, an interest in land that is registered (for instance, freehold ownership, a long lease, or a mortgage) will take priority to all other interests that come later, or are not entered on the register. The first <b>registered</b> <b>interest</b> in time prevails. Yet under LRA 2002 Schedule 3, a series of exceptions, or [...] "overriding interests" [...] are listed. Under Schedule 3, paragraph 1, any lease that is less than seven years need not be registered, and will still bind other parties. The reason is {{to strike a balance}} between an owner who may well keep hold of land for a long period, and a person who may be renting as a home. Most socially significant, under Schedule 3, paragraph 2 (formerly Land Registration Act 1925 s 70(1)(g)), the interest of a person who is in [...] "actual occupation" [...] need not be entered on the register, but will still bind later registered interests. This rule was said to be necessary to prevent the social right to a home being [...] "lost in the welter of registration". It is most used in favour of people, typically a spouse in a family home whose name is not on the title deeds, who have not registered an interest because the law has recognised they have acquired a right not through a formal, or express contract, or gift - but by their contributions, or their reliance on another persons assurances. If such a person is in [...] "actual occupation", then their informally acquired interest (usually through [...] "constructive trust", which recognises their contributions of money or work toward family life) will bind parties who acquire interests later on.|$|E
