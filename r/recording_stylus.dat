2500|$|A non-magnetic, non-electric, hand-powered tape {{recorder}} was patented {{by two of}} the Volta associates in 1886 (...) [...] The tape was a 3/16inch (4.8mm) wide strip of paper coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3cm) diameter reel and around a pulley with guide flanges, where it came into contact with either the recording or playback stylus. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp <b>recording</b> <b>stylus,</b> actuated by a sound-vibrated mica diaphragm, engraved a groove into the wax coating. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the recorded groove. The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes like those of a stethoscope.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{recording}} technologies of the time, the <b>recording</b> <b>stylus</b> creates the groove not by cutting the vinyl but by embossing (plastically deforming) the surface, leaving no waste plastic chips {{to get into}} the mechanical works.|$|E

50|$|In an {{interview}} on British TV show Something for the Weekend Reeves stated there were benefits to doing a radio show, as even more bizarre and outlandish images could be conjured, {{which could not be}} replicated using props on a television programme - such as balancing the whole of Ireland on a <b>record</b> <b>stylus</b> to stop it from skipping.However he also said that he would be interested in making the radio show into a television series.|$|R
50|$|Several {{technologies}} {{were used}} to record the sounds, beginning with wax cylinders, {{almost half a century}} before the invention of the magnetic cartridge. Nowadays mostly vinyl records are used. When playing the <b>record,</b> the <b>stylus</b> is placed in the grooves of the record. By then spinning the <b>record,</b> the <b>stylus</b> start to vibrate caused by the shape of the grooves. These vibrations are then converted by the cartridge. The harder the material used for the record, the harder the stylus has to be in order to increase the quality of the sound and to decrease the wear of the needle. For shellac <b>records,</b> a disposable <b>stylus</b> softer than the record was generally preferred for preservation of the <b>recording.</b> The <b>styluses</b> for playing vinyl records are made out of Sapphire or diamond. There are two common types of stylus: elliptical and spherical. Each contacts the groove differently than the other; the elliptical stylus allows for more groove contact, which increases fidelity, while the spherical stylus makes less contact with the groove, which yields a more sensitive stylus.|$|R

50|$|At {{about this}} time, Johnson began experimenting with {{recording}} and disc duplicating technologies {{under a cloud}} of secrecy. Berliner’s process for creating master records involved covering a zinc disc with an acid-resistant fatty coating and then scratching the coating away with a <b>recording</b> <b>stylus.</b> Berliner would then submerse the disc in acid to create deeper grooves. From this master, stampers could easily be made for mass production—a definite advantage over the difficult-to-duplicate wax cylinders of the Edison phonograph.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} {{electrical}} recording in 1925 {{made it possible}} to use sensitive microphones to capture the sound and greatly improved the audio quality of records. A much wider range of frequencies could be recorded, the balance of high and low frequencies could be controlled by elementary electronic filters, and the signal could be amplified to the optimum level for driving the <b>recording</b> <b>stylus.</b> The leading record labels switched to the electrical process in 1925 and the rest soon followed, although one straggler in the US held out until 1929.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{scientific}} significance, the recording methods of songs on 78rpm gramophone shellac records marked {{a new age}} in Chinese musical history. Usually the recording would be done in one take only. Therefore, sound engineers had to be extremely careful when making <b>records.</b> Steel <b>stylus</b> <b>records</b> (鋼針唱片), which were an important recording medium, have now been abandoned due to the development in digital recording. This is also accompanied by the disappearance of this precious sound recording technology.|$|R
5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} <b>record</b> <b>stylus</b> to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|R

5000|$|Between the {{invention}} of the phonograph in 1877 and the advent of digital media, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called electrical recording, in which a microphone was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the <b>recording</b> <b>stylus.</b> This innovation eliminated the [...] "horn sound" [...] resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured.|$|E

5000|$|Turntablists, who {{are often}} called DJs (or [...] "deejays"), {{generally}} prefer direct-drive turntables over belt-driven or other types, because the belt can be stretched or damaged by [...] "scratching" [...] and other turntable manipulation such as slowing down a record, whereas a direct drive turntable can be stopped, slowed down, or spun backwards without damaging the electric motor. The word turntablist was originated by Luis [...] "DJ Disk" [...] Quintanilla (Primus, Herbie Hancock, Invisibl Skratch Piklz). After a phone conversation with Disk, it was later [...] "coined" [...] and used in 1995 by DJ Babu to describe {{the difference between a}} DJ who simply plays and mixes records and one who performs by physically manipulating the <b>records,</b> <b>stylus,</b> turntables, turntable speed controls and mixer to produce new sounds. The new term coincided with the resurgence of hip-hop DJing in the 1990s.|$|R

The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in binary arithmetic is the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths of a second, the time period associated with a fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom. The drawing indicates that the record should be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the <b>record</b> and <b>stylus,</b> with a binary number giving the time to play {{one side of the}} record – about an hour.|$|R
5000|$|Until the mid-1920s {{records were}} played on purely {{mechanical}} record players usually {{powered by a}} wind-up spring motor. The sound was [...] "amplified" [...] by an external or internal horn that was coupled to the diaphragm and stylus, {{although there was no}} real amplification: the horn simply improved the efficiency with which the diaphragm's vibrations were transmitted into the open air. The recording process was in essence the same non-electronic setup operating in reverse, but with a <b>recording</b> <b>stylus</b> engraving a groove into a soft waxy master disc and carried slowly inward across it by a feed mechanism.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, Emile Berliner {{patented}} {{a variant}} of the phonograph which he named the Gramophone. Berliner's approach was essentially the same one proposed, but never implemented, by Charles Cros in 1877. The diaphragm was linked to the <b>recording</b> <b>stylus</b> in a way that caused it to vibrate laterally (side to side) as it traced a spiral onto a zinc disc very thinly coated with a compound of beeswax. The zinc disc was then immersed in a bath of chromic acid; this etched a groove into the disc where the stylus had removed the coating, after which the recording could be played. With some later improvements the flat discs of Berliner could be produced in large quantities at much lower cost than the cylinders of Edison's system.|$|E
50|$|The {{recording}} had to {{be played}} back with a fiber needle such as cut and pointed bamboo or a plant thorn, as an ordinary steel needle in a typical heavy pickup would severely damage the soft aluminum surface. Even when playing a bare aluminium disc with a modern lightweight magnetic cartridge, a hard stylus that does not correctly fit the contour of the groove will score its surface and tend to skip and repeat, damaging the disc as well as degrading {{the quality of the}} recovered audio. Because the blunt <b>recording</b> <b>stylus</b> typically bore down on the aluminum at a substantial angle, it produced a disproportionately shallow groove, so that optimum playback with modern equipment requires a custom stylus with an unusually large tip radius.|$|E
500|$|The first subwoofers were {{developed}} in the 1960s to add bass response to home stereo systems. Subwoofers came into greater popular consciousness in the 1970s {{with the introduction of}} Sensurround in movies such as Earthquake, which produced loud low-frequency sounds through large subwoofers. With the advent of the compact cassette and the compact disc in the 1980s, the easy reproduction of deep and loud bass was no longer limited by the ability of a phonograph <b>record</b> <b>stylus</b> to track a groove, and producers could add more low frequency content to recordings. As well, during the 1990s, DVDs were increasingly recorded with [...] "surround sound" [...] processes that included a low-frequency effects (LFE) channel, which could be heard using the subwoofer in home theater systems. During the 1990s, subwoofers also became increasingly popular in home stereo systems, custom car audio installations, and in PA systems. By the 2000s, subwoofers became almost universal in sound reinforcement systems in nightclubs and concert venues.|$|R

5000|$|In 1925, the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{maker of}} Brunswick {{phonograph}} records, licensed parts of GE's system {{for use in}} the electrical recording process it was developing. Instead of beaming the light onto photographic film, the vibrating mirror reflected it directly into a photoelectric cell, generating an electronic audio signal which was amplified and used to drive the side-to-side motions of the <b>recording</b> <b>stylus</b> as it engraved a spiral groove into the rotating wax master disc. Brunswick publicized its unique method as [...] "Brunswick Light-Ray" [...] recording. Used simply as a novel type of general-purpose microphone, this hollowed-out version of the pallophotophone proved to be very problematic. In 1927, Brunswick abandoned it in favor of the ordinary carbon and condenser microphones being used by its competitors.|$|E
5000|$|An {{account of}} his {{invention}} was published on October 10, 1877, by which date Cros had devised a more direct procedure: the <b>recording</b> <b>stylus</b> could scribe its tracing through a thin coating of acid-resistant material on a metal surface and the surface could then be etched in an acid bath, producing the desired groove without the complication of an intermediate photographic procedure. The author of this article called the device a [...] "phonographe", but Cros himself favored the word [...] "paleophone", sometimes rendered in French as [...] "voix du passé" [...] (voice of the past) but more literally meaning [...] "ancient sound", which accorded well with his vision of his invention's potential for creating an archive of sound recordings that {{would be available to}} listeners in the distant future.|$|E
50|$|The wax {{cylinder}} got {{a competitor}} {{with the advent}} of the Gramophone, which was patented by Emile Berliner in 1887. The vibration of the Gramophone's <b>recording</b> <b>stylus</b> was horizontal, parallel to the recording surface, resulting in a zig-zag groove of constant depth. This is known as lateral recording. Berliner's original patent showed a lateral recording etched around the surface of a cylinder, but in practice he opted for the disc format. The Gramophones he soon began to market were intended solely for playing prerecorded entertainment discs and could not be used to record. The spiral groove on the flat surface of a disc was relatively easy to replicate: a negative metal electrotype of the original record could be used to stamp out hundreds or thousands of copies before it wore out. Early on, the copies were made of hard rubber, and sometimes of celluloid, but soon a shellac-based compound was adopted.|$|E

2500|$|In this system, each of two stereo {{channels}} {{is carried}} independently by a separate groove wall, each wall face moving at 45 {{degrees to the}} plane of the record surface (hence the system's name) in correspondence with the signal level of that channel. By convention, the inner wall carries the left-hand channel and the outer wall carries the right-hand channel. [...] While the stylus only moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo <b>records</b> the <b>stylus</b> moves vertically as well as horizontally.

50|$|In the {{recording}} process, a sufficiently amplified audio signal {{was sent to}} a heavily weighted electromagnetic recording head with a blunt diamond stylus that indented, rather than cut or engraved, a sound-modulated groove into the surface of the metal. Normally, a completely blank disc was used and {{the recording}} head was slowly carried toward its center by a dedicated feed mechanism. Some low-end recording units economized by eliminating the feed mechanism, relying instead on the use of discs already cut with a narrow blank groove that guided the stylus, which simply impressed its vibrations into the upper region of the existing groove. This cost-cutting approach produced recordings with a very limited dynamic range and generally inferior sound. In either case, because of the grain structure of the metal and its resistance to the side-to-side motions of the <b>recording</b> <b>stylus,</b> significant surface noise was inherent and the high-frequency signal content was heavily attenuated.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide flanges) mounted above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp <b>recording</b> <b>stylus,</b> actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|E
50|$|A stylus {{is also an}} {{instrument}} used to scribe a recording into smoked foil or glass. In various scientific instruments this method may be employed instead of a pen for recording as it {{has the advantage of}} being able to operate over a wide temperature range, does not clog or dry prematurely, and has very small friction in comparison to other methods. These characteristics were useful in certain types of early seismographs and in recording barographs that were once used to verify sailplane <b>records.</b> The <b>styluses</b> used in scanning tunneling microscopes have only a single atom at the tip; these are effectively the sharpest styluses possible.|$|R
