The authors have verified {{the utility of}} in-process project measurement in a real mid-scale multi-vendor distributed project.

The project measurement target was limited to later processes such as the coding and testing phases where the output products were easy to acquire. The <b>requirements</b> <b>definition</b> phase where process and product were not standardized was difficult to measure.

Four different approaches to exploring the socio-organisational contexts of systems are discussed.

The engineering metrics are necessary to be connected to the sensory preference of users to design the right products to user preferences. In this paper we propose a process to manage design information considering product sound quality, and investigate a consistent description method using SysML (Systems Modeling Language) from <b>requirement</b> <b>definition</b> to engineering metrics setting. Picking up a camera as an example of consumer products we extract customer demands using the evaluation grid method according to the cases where the camera is used.

Also a stepwise refinement from the <b>requirement</b> <b>definition</b> to the architectural design is performed using SysML diagrams, and the appropriate engineering metrics are derived...|$|E

The author’s previous studies indicated that <b>requirements</b> <b>definition</b> work of custom-made type application software {{had been running}} through the whole software development process. This trend has been seen among small-scale software development projects, especially for web application system and client/server application system. It is necessary to comprehend that <b>requirements</b> <b>definition</b> work continues through the all software development process. <b>Requirements</b> <b>definition</b> {{is considered to be}} knowledge exchange or knowledge share between customer and supplier. Customer can be defined as an expert of the application or an expert of an undeveloped (to be developed in the near future) application system. Supplier can be defined as an expert of IT development. The author believes it might be effective to apply the Knowledge Management process to <b>requirements</b> <b>definition.</b> On the actual situation, there are traditional methods for requirements elicitation that is interaction between customer and supplier, for instance, interviewing to customer, reading the <b>requirements</b> <b>definition</b> from customer and discussing with customer.

On the other hand, {{it is well known that}} <b>requirements</b> <b>definition</b> is the principle of the project, however the quality of requirements elicitation much depends on personal factors of each supplier (i. e. project managers, system engineers).

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) The {{need for}} {{reform in the}} Department of Defense''s (DoD) {{acquisition}} and management of services acquisitions was recently highlighted by the Government Accountability Office and by the DoD''s top leaders in acquisition. The for-profit sector also struggles with the effective acquisition of services in which the complexities and unique nature of services render the definition of requirements and the specification and measurement of contractor performance problematic. Despite these difficulties, {{little research has been}} conducted to examine the determinants of sourcing performance in services acquisitions. This study examines the relationships between service quality and its antecedents through the use of structural equation modeling. Data were collected from 240 U. S.

A negative relationship is found between the extent of compliance with regulations and statutes and service quality.

40|$|For safety {{relevant}} and critical systems {{a crucial part}} of the development is a concise and complete safety <b>requirement</b> <b>definition.</b> We show how requirements can be modeled with graphical, semiformal means using the systems modeling language SysML. However, aiming at an unambiguous and formal <b>requirement</b> <b>definition</b> and verification, we do not focus on diagrams that are typically used for requirement definitions, e. g. the SysML requirement, parametric and use case diagrams. We rather use the state machine diagram to define safe and unsafe states as well as sequences of states that are expected within the overall system and within subsystems. We show how generic types of safety requirements are represented using extended versions of state machine diagrams. To this end we model expressions that are similar in semantics to linear temporal logic expressions using the SysML state machine diagrams. In particular, we can distinguish, whether a strict sequence of states is requir ed or some kind of intermediate states are allowed within the sequence, e. g. from an unintended initial unsafe state to a final safe state in case of an active safety function. Finally, we will indicate how this approach can be used in future to verify that overall state machine diagrams of systems or subsystems fulfill these formalized requirements...|$|E

Based on a sample of 216 buyers of services, this study uses structural equation modeling to examine the relationships between service quality and its determinants. The {{results suggest that the}} sufficiency of the <b>requirement</b> <b>definition</b> and communication between the buyer and supplier are associated with B 2 B service quality, but that monitoring the supplier is not. Additionally, the internal customer’s level of commitment to the procurement and the sufficiency of the allotted procurement lead time affect how sufficiently the buyer defines the requirement for the supplier. The internal customer’s commitment also affects the amount of monitoring of and communication with the supplier. The study’s findings have implications for integrating unified service theory with service-dominant logic; since service quality increases service value, these findings add fidelity to S-D Logic by unveiling specifically how to co-create value with the supplier. Two novel constructs are introduced to supply chain management discourse—sufficiency of the <b>requirement</b> <b>definition</b> and sufficiency of procurement lead time. Furthermore, a new measure of B 2 B service quality is offered. From these results, implications for practice and theory are drawn. The study concludes with a discussion of limitations and promising directions for future research...|$|E
