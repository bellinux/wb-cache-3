However, environmentally sound waste incineration can only be achieved if done according to well known physico-chemical conditions. This study focused on the formation and reduction mechanisms of nitrogen oxides (NO x) with a non temperature-controlled laboratory <b>scale</b> <b>rotary</b> kiln. It was found that NOx releases vary with the weight of the waste in the kiln. For temperatures lower than 900 °C, it appears that NO x emissions are strongly influenced by the temperature and the local concentration of oxygen. Experiments show the effect of combustible weight on emissions of nitrogen monoxide (NO). NO 2 was not found for peak temperature less than 1012 °C or waste weight less than 3 kg. In ours experimental conditions, NO is essentially formed by the mechanism of “fuel NO”. It is highly influenced by local oxygen concentration in the reaction place, but moderately influenced by the temperature. Lack of the kiln’s temperature control implies kiln’s operation temperature variations. We found that these variations are related the combustible load.

Computational methods for conventional {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} (U) and fluid to particle heat transfer coefficient (hfp) were found unsuitable in high viscosity fluids. A methodology for evaluating an apparent heat transfer coefficient (hap) between retort medium and particle, and an apparent overall heat transfer coefficient Ua between retort medium and can fluid was proposed. Use of h ap and Ua concepts permitted direct predictions of particle temperature and lethality based on retort temperature. An L- 16 orthogonal experimental design of experiments was carried out to select system factors that significantly affected hap and U a values for particles in high viscosity non-Newtonian and Newtonian fluids. Experiments using central composite rotatable design and full factorial design were carried out to study the effects of selected significant factors on hap and Ua. Using all data obtained, dimensionless correlations were developed for the prediction of hap and Ua values. The developed correlations showed a good agreement with the experimental data. More precise predictions were achieved with trained artificial neural network (ANN) models. The results of ANN models could be compiled using algebraic equations and were included so that hap and Ua values could be predicted without actually using the ANN software. A flow visualization study was conducted to better understand the heat transfer behavior in high viscosity fluids. Results showed that in particulate high viscosity fluids, the particle liquid relative movement was very weak, implying that the heat transfer between them could converge to conduction-conduction rather than convection-conduction, which results in erroneous and unusually large hfp values...|$|R

The following Technology in Industry Fellowship (TIF) funded Masters Project is structured around investigating the combustion characteristics of Kiln Two at McDonald’s Lime Ltd using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Numerical results obtained using the commercial CFD code FLUENT were first validated against experimental data from the International Flame Research Foundation’s (IFRF) Furnace No. 1. The validation study focussed on comparing the finite rate and mixture fraction/PDF approaches to combustion chemistry, as well as different methods for defining coal particle size distributions. Numerical modelling of Kiln Two at McDonald’s Lime Ltd began with full three-dimensional simulations, however due to their complexity and large computational times, two-dimensional axisymmetric models were primarily used for investigations. Comparisons were made between the two approaches. Investigations into the original pulverised coal fired system focussed on how the kiln aerodynamics and heat transfer properties were affected by changes to the coal and air inlet properties. The performance of a recently installed waste oil firing system was also investigated, with results showing that firing the kiln with a 25 % thermal substitution of oil is the most efficient mode of operation. As the investigations focussed on the combustion characteristics the effects of the reacting limestone bed were ignored in all simulations. CFD modelling of the combustion characteristics within a large <b>scale</b> <b>rotary</b> kiln proved to be an extremely complex task.

Magnetorheological energy absorbers (MREAs) work well as adaptive isolators due {{to their ability to}} quickly and controllably adjust to changes in system mass or impact speed while providing fail-safe operation. However, typical linear stroking MREAs using pressure-driven flows have been shown to exhibit reduced controllability as impact speed (shear rate) increases. The objective of this work is to develop MREAs that improve controllability at high shear rates by using pure shear and mixed shear-squeeze modes of operation, and to present the fundamental theory and models of MR fluids under these conditions. A proof of concept instrument verified that the MR effect persists in shear mode devices at shear rates corresponding to low speed impacts. This instrument, a concentric cylinder Searle cell magnetorheometer, was then used to characterize three commercially available MRFs across a wide range of shear rates, applied magnetic fields, and temperatures. Characterization results are presented both as flow curves according to established practice, and as an alternate nondimensionalized analysis based on Mason number. The Mason number plots show that, with appropriate correction coefficients for operating temperature, the varied flow curve data can be collapsed to a single master curve.

Industrial rotary kilns are usually equipped with internal fixtures such as lifters, baffles, constrictions or exit dams. The complex hydrodynamic behavior of the granular materials within rotary kilns has led to extensive research over the years. Most of these publications report on the influence of operating parameters (rotational speed, kiln slope, mass flow rate or exit dam height) on the residence time distribution (RTD) and axial dispersion of solid particles. However, few of these studies analyze the effect of the presence of lifters, their number or shape. We therefore decided to conduct a systematic experimental investigation of RTD, kiln holdup and axial dispersion coefficient for the continuous flow of granular materials in rotary kilns equipped with lifters. To do so, we used two different pilot <b>scale</b> <b>rotary</b> kilns. One is about twice the size of the other. We investigated both the influence of operating parameters (rotational speed, kiln slope, mass flow rate) and of the presence of internal devices (grid, different shapes and number of lifters, different height of exit dam) on a large range of size and shape of particles (two different sands, rice and beech chips). The large set of experimental data obtained, allowed us to build a model based on dimensional analysis, which is useful for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Cogeneration in the Australian sugar {{industry}} {{has the potential}} to provide significant environmental and economic benefits. Central to increasing cogenerated energy output is the use of bagasse drying to improve boiler efficiency. In a previous numerical study, pre-drying of bagasse from 50 % moisture to 30 % moisture using waste flue gas was shown to deliver up to 16 % reduction in bagasse usage and up to 24 % increase in specific steam production. Across the world both flighted rotary dryers and flash dryers have been used to dry bagasse fibre for enhanced boiler operation. In this paper, the design and preliminary costing of a flighted rotary dryer processing 50 t/h of Burdekin bagasse fibre from 50 % moisture to 38 % moisture using waste flue gas is described. Operational scenarios, such as the effect of varying flue gas temperature on dryer design, are evaluated. Key design data such as the drying rate and bagasse angle of repose were determined by experiments using a Spencer oven and pilot <b>scale</b> <b>rotary</b> dryer, respectively. The development and use of a multi-scale compartment model for sizing the dryer is described. In this model, the impact of flight and drum geometry on dryer loading and dryer design were directly accounted for. The results of this investigation showed that both energy and material costs of a dryer are highly dependent on the loading state and material properties such as angle of repose and bulk density. A new design methodology which used simulated trails with variable dryer loading states showed a distinct minimum in costs occurring {{at the point where the}} particular dryer was operating closest to its design loading. The optimum flighted rotary bagasse dryer design was found by minimising total cost (electrical energy and raw material requirements), and was shown to occur at design loading. Although the results presented in this work relate to a fixed set of operating conditions, it is likely that the methodology used and conclusions drawn can be applied to the general design and operation of flighted rotary dryers...|$|R
40|$|Studies on both {{full size}} and pilot <b>scale</b> <b>rotary</b> kiln {{incinerators}} {{have suggested that}} mixing between evaporating waste and ambient air {{may be an important}} factor in the destruction of hazardous wastes in such facilities. Research presented here has addressed the issue of gas phase mixing between one intermittent gas stream, representing a transient puff of evaporating waste, and a continuous stream, representing the primary flame flue gas in a rotary kiln incinerator. Experiments were performed in a plexiglas cold flow model which is a full scale replica of the rotary kiln simulator used by EPA's Combustion Research Branch. The intermittent gas stream was seeded with TiO₂ particles. Quantitative data were obtained through a combination of laser flow visualization and digital image analysis. Experiments were completed for different main air flow rates, representing Reynolds numbers from 1, 700 to 17, 000. The experimental results were compared to a computer simulation model, based on the linear eddy modeling technique. Model results agreed very well with experimental data, if a recirculation zone was explicitly accounted for. The model was used to predict mixing at low Schmidt number, with input conditions obtained from the existing evaporation model of Wendt and Linak (1988). Conclusions from this research include the following: (1) digital image analysis, based on flow visualization, can be used to quantify gas phase mixing processes; (2) deviations from Reynolds number similarity in these experiments can be explained from differences in relative (main air and puff) flowrates, and in Strouhal number; (3) recirculation zones {{have a significant effect on}} macro-mixing (average concentration profiles). However, the effect on micro-mixing is limited; (4) interpretation of high Schmidt number, low resolution measurements as if they where fully resolved low Schmidt number measurements is generally adequate. Specifically for the EPA kiln, it was concluded that: (5) three separate mixing mechanisms are present: jet mixing in the cavity, recirculation zones, and shear turbulence; (6) unmixedness is a likely explanation for failure modes in the EPA rotary kiln incinerator; (7) insufficient macro-mixing (controlled by transient evaporation and large scale motion) is more important than local unmixedness (governed by fine scale turbulence and molecular diffusion) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRotary kilns are gas‐solid {{reactors}} used {{to achieve}} {{a wide range of}} materials processing. They are used in operations such as mixing, heating, cooling, or reacting of coarse, free‐flowing or cohesive solids in the chemical, cement, pharmaceutical, nuclear, food, or waste process industries for example. They mainly consist of a cylindrical shell usually inclined, into which the solid charge is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other. They can be fitted with lifters, and/or dam(s) at the kiln end(s). They are classified into two main heating modes: either direct heated or indirect heated, depending on the heating source location with respect to the solids. They are convenient reactors with intensive heat and mass transfer, capable of handling large amount of materials. Heat transfer in rotary kilns is very complex and may involve the exchange of energy via all the fundamental physical transfer mechanisms, i. e., conduction, convection, and radiation. In particular, despite several studies on this field, the heat transfer between the wall and the particles is not yet fully understood, especially for flighted rotary kilns. Therefore, this study aimed at experimentally investigating the wall‐to‐solids heat transfer coefficient (whtc). An indirect heated, continuously fed pilot <b>scale</b> <b>rotary</b> kiln, that could be equipped with lifters (one‐section or two‐section) and fitted with a dam at the outlet end was used. For the longitudinal evaluation of inner (bulk bed, freeboard) and external (wall) temperatures, the equipment includes thermocouples positioned in‐and outside along the kiln tube at five sections. The solid material used was quartz sand with a narrow distributed size fraction around 0. 5 mm. The whtc was determined from the heating of the bulk bed using the measure of heat supply for low and medium temperatures (100 °C, 300 °C and 500 °C). The effects of operational parameters such as the filling degree, the rotational speed, the lifter profile and the temperature set at the wall on the heat transfer coefficient were analyzed in this study. Certain strategies and some assumptions were made on few parameters; a sensitivity analysis examines their effects on the whtc. The wall‐to‐solids heat transfer coefficient was lower in presence of lifters, and lowest for the two‐section lifters compared with the case without lifters. The whtc was also found to increase with the filling degree and the temperature set at the wall. The whtc was also influenced by the rotational speed when keeping a constant filling degree...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRotary kilns are gas-solid {{reactors}} {{commonly used}} in industry to achieve {{a wide array of}} material processing operations. Rotary kilns are used for applications such as reduction of oxide ore, pyrolysis of hazardous waste, calcining of petroleum coke, conversion of uranium fluoride into uranium dioxide for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, and so on. When operated at atmospheric pressure, they consist of a cylindrical shell that can be inclined, into which the solid charge is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other. They can be equipped with lifting flights or lifters, and/or exit dam at the kiln outlet end. They usually require very little labor to operate. Though operational cost of these units is usually high, their design is often conservative {{due to the lack of}} fundamental physical understanding of both solids flow and heat transfer. The objective of this presentation is to provide a new model to predict the residence time of solid particles within the rotary kiln based on a dimensional analysis. This model can be used for process control as well as for design purposes. Progress of material through a rotary kiln is affected by a number of factors, namely: length and diameter of the kiln, design and number of lifters distributed around the circumference, rotational speed, and slope of the kiln, exit dam height at the kiln outlet end, flow rate and physical properties of the material. Experiments were carried out on a pilot <b>scale</b> <b>rotary</b> kiln at room temperature, whether or not equipped with lifters or fitted with dam at the outlet end. These experiments aimed at determining the effects of most of the factors listed above on the mean residence time of solid particles; the mean residence time was determined from residence time distribution measurements data. The tracer impulse-response technique was used to establish residence time distribution curves. Two granular solids having different properties were used: sand and broken rice. Furthermore, two shapes of lifters were compared to determine the influence of lifter geometry: straight lifters (SL) and rectangular lifters (RL). The other operational parameters were also varied so that a matrix of 69 experiments (without including repeatability tests) was achieved. These experiments were used for the consolidation and validation of the presented model. The model not only gave good agreement with the experimental data from the present study, but also demonstrated good predictive performances when applied to published experimental data of other kilns, having different design, materials, and order of magnitude of the operating parameters. The excellent predictive capacity of the model compared to other semi-empirical models shows its capacity to handle a wide range of conditions and operating variables. The model is applicable for inclined kilns that process materials in cascading (tumbling) motion, whether or not equipped with lifters or fitted with dams at the outlet end...|$|R
