Past research has provided demographic and attitudinal profiles of recyclers and non-recyclers at mainly {{the individual and}} household levels with some at the community level. Researchers have found both commonalities and variations in these profiles. Studies have also looked at how the structure <b>of</b> a <b>recycling</b> program influences recycling behavior. The question asked here is how community-level demographic and attitudinal characteristics interact with the structure <b>of</b> public <b>recycling</b> programs to influence aggregate <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> participation and diversion in 40 cities in the western United States. The {{results of this study}} provide modest support for my hypotheses that when recycling programs are less convenient, demographics and attitudinal characteristics will explain more variation in diversion of waste at the community scale. Similarly, as recycling programs become more convenient, the roles of demographic and attitudinal factors (recycling friendliness) are expected to decrease. This study found increased recycling program convenience and less visible fee assessment structures were associated with higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> among cities regardless of their degree <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> friendliness. When recycling outcomes were cross tabulated with indicators convenience and fee assessment, low rates were generally found among cities with low program convenience and high rates were generally found among cities with high program convenience.

50|$|The modern {{understanding}} of the Earth's upper mantle {{is that there are}} two distinct components - the lithospheric part and the asthenosphere. The lithosphere, which includes the continental plates, acts as a brittle solid whereas the asthenosphere is hotter and weaker due to mantle convection. The boundary between these two layers is rheologically based and is not necessarily a strict function of depth. Specifically, oceanic lithosphere (lithosphere underneath the oceanic plates) and subcontinental lithosphere, is defined as a mechanical boundary layer that heats via conduction and the asthenosphere is a convecting adiabatic layer. In contrast to oceanic lithosphere, which experiences quicker <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling,</b> subcontinental lithosphere is chemically distinct, cold, and older.

Wild-type rab 5 or rab 5 ile 133, a mutant protein defective in GTP binding, was overexpressed in baby hamster kidney cells. In cells expressing the rab 5 ile 133 protein, the rate of endocytosis was decreased by 50 % compared with normal, while the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> was not significantly affected. The morphology of early endosomes was also drastically changed by the mutant protein, which induced accumulation of small tubules and vesicles at {{the periphery of the}} cell.

40|$|Transport of {{proteins}} from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi is {{mediated by the}} sequential action of two coat complexes: COPII concentrates cargo for secretion at ER export sites, then COPI is subsequently recruited to nascent carriers and retrieves recycling proteins back to the ER.

Functional assays, including measurements of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> of COPII on the ER membrane and quantitative analyses of secretion, indicate that this interaction underlies functional coupling of ER export to microtubules.
