References to the First Quarto and First Folio are marked Hamlet Q1 and Hamlet F1, respectively, and are taken from the Arden Shakespeare Hamlet: the texts of 1603 and 1623. Their <b>referencing</b> system for Q1 has no act breaks, so 7.115 means scene 7, line 115.|$|E

50|$|In some implementations, weak <b>references</b> {{are divided}} into subcategories. For example, the Java Virtual Machine {{provides}} three forms of weak <b>references,</b> namely soft <b>references,</b> phantom <b>references,</b> and regular weak <b>references.</b> A softly <b>referenced</b> object is only eligible for reclamation, if the garbage collector decides that the program is low on memory. Unlike a soft <b>reference</b> or a regular weak <b>reference,</b> a phantom <b>reference</b> does not provide access to the object that it <b>references.</b> Instead, a phantom <b>reference</b> is a mechanism that allows the garbage collector to notify the program when the <b>referenced</b> object has become phantom reachable. An object is phantom reachable, if it still resides in memory and it is <b>referenced</b> by a phantom <b>reference,</b> but its finalizer has already executed. Similarly, Microsoft.NET provides two subcategories of weak <b>references,</b> namely long weak <b>references</b> (tracks resurrection) and short weak <b>references.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The most {{frequent}} application for comparators is {{the comparison between}} a voltage and a stable <b>reference.</b> Most comparator manufacturers also offer comparators in which a <b>reference</b> voltage is integrated on to the chip.

5|$|All {{references}} to Romeo and Juliet, unless otherwise specified, {{are taken from}} the Arden Shakespeare second edition (Gibbons, 1980) based on the Q2 text of 1599, with elements from Q1 of 1597.

5|$|The Upanishad's {{structure}} is notable as it embeds key parts of verses from early Principal Upanishads, thus <b>referencing</b> them and yet building its own message.

5|$|Themes {{of class}} {{consciousness}} and conflict are {{also present in}} the book. Critics interpreted the stance the novel took against French class-based discrimination and hypocrisy as quite radical, although some French critics found that this made the novel an unsubtle satire of fading social stereotypes. There are also literary allusions in the novel, <b>referencing</b> comic books, movies, music, and paintings.|$|E
50|$|Destroying {{an object}} will cause any <b>references</b> {{to the object}} to become invalid, and in manual memory {{management}} any existing <b>references</b> become dangling <b>references.</b> In garbage collection (both tracing garbage collection and <b>reference</b> counting), objects are only destroyed {{when there are no}} <b>references</b> to them, but finalization may create new <b>references</b> to the object, and to prevent dangling <b>references,</b> object resurrection occurs so the <b>references</b> remain valid.|$|R

5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant <b>referencing</b> of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E
