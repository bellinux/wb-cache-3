5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Mei√üner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E

Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows, though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and {{was signed into law}} on January 23, 1995.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} well {{organized}} for defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about capturing it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy {{to go around the}} trench. These troops found their path blocked by the wagons which the Lacedaimonians had sunken into the soil. The wagons were planted so deeply that they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the wagons, giving them the opportunity to burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to turn around to confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E

25|$|By October {{customers}} {{appeared to}} be regaining confidence in the bank, when it emerged {{that there had been}} a surge in the number of new accounts which had been opened.

25|$|There {{was also}} intense {{pressure}} from the Soviet government {{to open up a}} second front in Western Europe. By early 1942, the Wehrmacht's Operation Barbarossa had clearly failed to destroy the Soviet Union. However, the Germans in a much less ambitious summer offensive launched in June were deep into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin himself repeatedly demanded that the Allies create a second front in France to force the Germans to move at least 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the pressure on the Red Army.|$|E
25|$|Fighting {{broke out}} again in 1967, as the Turkish Cypriots pushed for more freedom of movement. Once again, the {{situation}} was not settled until Turkey threatened to invade {{on the basis that}} it would be protecting the Turkish population from ethnic cleansing by Greek Cypriot forces. To avoid that, a compromise was reached for Greece to be forced to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its troops from the island; for Georgios Grivas, EOKA leader, to be forced to leave Cyprus and for the Cypriot government to lift some restrictions of movement and access to supplies of the Turkish populations.|$|E

Funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879, the Library Company closed. The remainder of its collection was stored in Peabody Hall.|$|E

25|$|On June 17, 2008, the {{university}} once again hired contractors to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the protesters' platforms, lines, and other infrastructure. The operation was started {{the day before}} a final ruling on the athletic center was expected {{in order to prevent}} more protesters from ascending the trees once the ruling was announced. One protester was removed from the trees and arrested after she allegedly bit one of the contractors. She was charged with assault, battery, resisting arrest, providing false information, trespassing and refusing to leave. One contractor was punched twice in the face during the operation. The protesters threw human urine and feces at the contractors and police throughout the day. Despite the actions of {{the university}}, about a dozen protesters remained in the grove.|$|E
25|$|The stains or mineral powder (such as Hematite) are earth {{colors in}} various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the {{original}} colors of the clay (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After the stain {{is applied to the}} ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the stain and reveal the texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. The stain is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of the stain and the rich texture to become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to bring out a particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.|$|E
25|$|The four-game homestand {{concluded}} with a Sunday afternoon national TV game against arch-rivals New York Red Bulls. Despite a pre-game shower during warm-ups and with inclement weather approaching, the teams kicked off on time, but the game was stopped just shy of the 8:00 mark, because a powerful storm was about to settle over RFK. After the torrential rains eased somewhat, grounds-crew tried to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the bigger puddles of water and play resumed after a delay of {{about an hour and}} a quarter. Despite epically sloppy conditions, United was able to create some excellent chances to score, but their finishing was not up to the task. NYRB punished the home team's mistakes when Bradley Wright-Phillips finished off a play that opened up when Franklin whiffed on an attempted clearance due to poor footing. The visitors extended their lead in the second half on a shot by Felipe. As the team had done 2 weeks earlier, a desperate United team was able to rally to gain a home draw. First, Marcelo Sarvas scored on a penalty kick, earned by Lloyd Sam, who was playing against his old team for the first time. The tying goal was scored on a header by Patrick Mullins after Birnbaum headed a long corner kick back into the box. With a mid-week trip to Montreal looming, United were clinging to the final post-season slot, holding a tiebreaker edge over Orlando City SC.|$|E
