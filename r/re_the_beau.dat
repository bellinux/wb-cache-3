40|$|<b>The</b> <b>BEAU</b> is an electric-assist bicycle {{system that}} is {{completely}} self-contained within the rear wheel. The purpose of approaching a electric-assist bicycle in this manner is two-fold: simplifying the device and opening the method of implementation to more creative uses. The project requires {{a large amount of}} knowledge from many fields. Based on the limits of research, the project will show the aspects of <b>the</b> <b>BEAU's</b> design and how they meet the overall design goals of <b>the</b> project. <b>The</b> <b>BEAU</b> is made up of several parts, none of which include a bicycle. The design of <b>the</b> <b>BEAU</b> takes <b>the</b> bicycle and rider into account only for aesthetic and control reasons. Inside <b>the</b> <b>BEAU</b> reside a custom motor, closed loop controller with power electronic drive elements for the motor, battery pack with custom battery management circuitry, and torque and rotary position encoders. The simplification of both the device required to electrify a bicycle and the user input required to control such a device is intended to make <b>the</b> <b>BEAU</b> a very attractive electric bicycle conversion alternative that can be used not only for consumer uses, but also in situations of mass utilization, such as a bike sharing program. This research was completed entirely within the Smart Cities group by the author. The original concept of <b>the</b> <b>BEAU</b> was arrived at during a meeting with the late William J. Mitchell as the "GreenWheel" and the project was begun as a team effort with Michael T. Lin, also of Smart Cities. <b>The</b> <b>BEAU</b> manifestation is entirely of the authors design with the purpose of investigating some of the more theoretical aspects of the GreenWheel concept. by Arthur Petron.

50|$|In 1931 {{she began}} {{to work as a}} {{secretary}} at <b>the</b> <b>Beaux</b> Arts Gallery, which was founded by the sculptor Frederick Lessore, on Bruton Place in London. Increasingly involved in the running of the gallery and the management of artists, she published the first of many articles on the painter Walter Sickert in 1932. In the years following World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Beaux</b> Arts Gallery became noted for championing figurative painting. When Frederick Lessore died in 1951, she took over full directorship of the gallery. Under Lessore's leadership, <b>the</b> <b>Beaux</b> Arts Gallery became specifically known for exhibiting artists from the Kitchen Sink School. In particular, four artists from the Kitchen Sink School became known as <b>the</b> <b>Beaux</b> Arts Quartet: John Bratby, Derrick Greaves, Jack Smith and Edward Middleditch. It is especially noteworthy that each of these artists was chosen before they achieved widespread recognition at the 1956 Venice Biennial. Lessore was also key in championing young, unknown artists. For instance Francis Bacon had a solo exhibition at <b>the</b> <b>Beaux</b> Art Gallery in 1953. In addition both Frank Auerbach and Leon Kossoff each held their first solo exhibitions at the gallery in 1956 and 1957, respectively.|$|R
