5|$|TLS {{implementations}} {{other than}} OpenSSL, such as GnuTLS, Mozilla's Network Security Services, and the Windows platform implementation of TLS, were not affected because the defect {{existed in the}} OpenSSL's implementation of TLS <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protocol itself.|$|E
5|$|At some point, {{possibly}} {{around this}} time, Montagu was killed; {{he was certainly}} dead before his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,' and {{in the thick of}} the fighting, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rout that later followed.|$|E

5|$|Deuterium {{was also}} {{detected}} {{in many other}} hydrogen compounds in the comet. The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in interstellar clouds, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solar nebula. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet Hale–Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25–45kelvins.|$|E
5|$|In October 1986, the IOC {{had voted}} {{to hold the}} Olympic Winter Games halfway through the {{four-year}} Olympiad, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year as the summer Games, and this change started with the XVIIth Olympic Winter Games in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway. A total of 67 nations took part, including the Czech Republic and Slovakia as independent teams, {{and each of the}} ex-Soviet nations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains {{that differ}} from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, plants have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E

5|$|The Uniate Church, {{created for}} the Ruthenian {{population}} of the Commonwealth, in its administrative dealings gradually switched to the Polish language use. From about 1650, {{the majority of the}} Church's archival documents generated were in the Polish, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> otherwise used Ruthenian (its Chancery Slavonic variety), language.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of poxviruses is {{complicated}} by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nucleus. In order to replicate, poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other DNA viruses, {{the most important of}} which is a viral-associated DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|United Dance Organisation (UDO) {{was founded}} in 2002 in the United Kingdom. It is {{endorsed}} by choreographers Ashley Banjo and Sisco Gomez and dancers Twist and Pulse and George Sampson. UDO operates the British Street Dance Championships, the European Street Dance Championships, and the World Street Dance Championships. The European championships are held in Germany <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK.|$|E

5|$|Within the sea turtles, E. imbricata {{has several}} unique {{anatomical}} and ecological traits. It {{is the only}} primarily spongivorous reptile. Because of this, its evolutionary position is somewhat unclear. Molecular analyses support placement of Eretmochelys within the taxonomic tribe Carettini, which includes the carnivorous loggerhead and ridley sea turtles, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tribe Chelonini, which includes the herbivorous green turtle. The hawksbill probably evolved from carnivorous ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E
5|$|Arguments {{about the}} {{taxability}} of compensation for personal services, whether called wages, salary, {{or some other}} term, may be either constitutional arguments as in United States v. Connor (see below) or statutory arguments as in Cheek v. United States, depending {{on the details of}} the argument. For purposes of presentation, these arguments are summarized here <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> article Tax protester statutory arguments. The rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail.|$|E

5|$|At this time, one of De Morgan's 1902 tablets was removed. Commemorating four {{workers who}} had died in an {{accident}} at the East Ham Sewage Works in 1895, Watts had mistakenly listed the incident as having taken place at the West Ham Sewage Works in 1885. The DeMorgan tablet was removed and replaced with a Royal Doulton tablet giving the correct location and date. As the Doulton tablets were in such a different style to DeMorgan's, the replacement tablet was installed in the second row next to the three new tablets to police officers, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> space left by the original.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E
5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details. Most of the {{information}} was properly recorded {{at the time and}} was made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, historical views on the topic differ in their interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of their depiction of the events themselves. The modern version of events does not differ significantly from the contemporary one.|$|E

5|$|However, not {{everything}} was always harmonious between {{the king and}} the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of Osbert de Bayeux, {{who was accused of}} poisoning William the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an ecclesiastical court <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen's reign, but Stephen's death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the shifting of the trial to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald's position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom was to try clergy for crimes in the secular courts.|$|E
5|$|Like {{its parent}} Jeep Wrangler, the Storm {{is first and}} {{foremost}} an airmobile, capable offroad and utility vehicle meant to tackle extreme terrain in a general reconnaissance role, and can be outfitted with a machine gun or other weapons systems. When armed with a 105mm (4.1in) M40 recoilless rifle, the vehicle is uniquely capable of firing directly over its blast guard equipped hood <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> perpendicular position required by most other vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Recent studies, {{based on}} the {{discovery}} of a penny of Eanred for which a date no earlier than c. 850 is proposed, suggest a very different dating for ninth-century Northumbrian kings. From this, it is argued that Eardwulf's second reign ended circa 830, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years soon after 810, and that the reigns of subsequent kings should be re-dated accordingly: Eanred from 830 to 854, Æthelred II from 854 to 862, Rædwulf in 858, and Osberht from 862 to 867.|$|E
