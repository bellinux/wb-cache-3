40|$|ABSTRACT. We have {{inferred}} {{the temperature}} sensitivity of Dorne Margolin choke <b>ring</b> <b>antennas</b> by direct estimation from differential clock estimates for two GPS sites separated by 2400 km. At each site, the cable and receiver systems {{are very well}} isolated from environmental variations. By direct comparison of the observed clock variations between these sites with local temperature measurements, empirical temperature coefficients for each system have been estimated. These thermal coefficients most likely apply to the only uncontrolled components of the systems, the Dorne Margolin choke <b>ring</b> <b>antennas.</b> Based on these results, the short-term (diurnal) stability of the antennas appears {{to be better than}} 2 ps/ºC. The possibility that longer-term effects exist due to sensitivity in the daily average of the pseudorange observations has not been tested and cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Investigation {{into the}} {{feasibility}} of a circular array of dipole antennas to deposit RF-energy centrally in the neck as a function of: (1) patient positioning, (2) <b>antenna</b> <b>ring</b> radius, (3) number of <b>antenna</b> <b>rings,</b> (4) number of <b>antennas</b> per <b>ring</b> and (5) distance between <b>antenna</b> <b>rings.</b> Materials and Methods: Power absorption (PA) distributions in realistic, head and neck, anatomy models are calculated at 433 MHz. Relative PA distributions corresponding to different set-ups were analysed using {{the ratio of the}} average PA (aPA) in the target and neck region. Results: Enlarging the <b>antenna</b> <b>ring</b> radius from 12. 5 cm to 25 cm resulted in a ~ 21 % decrease in aPA. By changing the orientation of the patients with respect to the array an increase by ~ 11 % was obtained. Increase of the amount of <b>antenna</b> <b>rings</b> led to a better focussing of the power (1 - 2 / 3 : ~ 17 %). Increase of the distance between the <b>antenna</b> <b>rings</b> resulted in a smaller (more target region conformal) focus but also a decreased power penetration. Conclusions: A single optimum array setup suitable for all patients is difficult to define. Based on the results and practical limitations a setup consisting of two <b>rings</b> of six <b>antennas</b> with a radius of 20 cm and 6 cm array spacing is considered a good choice providing the ability to heat the majority of patients...|$|R

Results demonstrate that circular polarization of both senses {{can be achieved}} with a <b>ring</b> <b>antenna</b> with proper design of two inner stubs located at angles of 45 {{with respect to the}} feedline. Theory and experiment demonstrate an axial ratio 3 -dB bandwidth of 1 % and the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) 2 bandwidth of 6. 1 %. The axial ratio bandwidth is typical for a microstrip antenna with perturbations, while the VSWR bandwidth is larger than for the circular or rectangular patch with perturbations. A mutual coupling study between two elements shows that the axial ratio is less than 2 dB for interelement spacing greater than 0. 55 e, while the VSWR 2 for all spacings considered.
