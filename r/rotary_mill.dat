Load behaviour was investigated at different volumes of slurry. The insight gained was then used to evaluate the implications of slurry pooling on milling. First, the effects of viscosity on mill charge behaviour were measured using photographic techniques applied to a Perspex mill. A model of the angular location of the free surface of the slurry pool, as affected by slurry filling was proposed. Next, a real ore was used and the load behaviour was measured using non-invasive sensors fitted to a pilot mill. At this point, the angular position of the pool and the net power draw were correlated to the volume of slurry for mill speeds ranging from 65 to 85...|$|E
30|$|Coconut shell was {{collected}} from local market of Roorkee, India. Coconut shell was first washed with {{double distilled water}} to eliminate the impurities like dirt and dried at 60  °C temperature in an oven for 12  h. After drying, coconut shell was crushed in a high-speed <b>rotary</b> <b>mill</b> into 2 – 3  mm size of pieces and stored for additional processing in a muffle furnace (Amudaa et al. 2007; Sodeinde 2012). To prepare the coconut shell activated carbon using chemical activation method, the dried coconut shell was soaked with 2 N H 2 S 04 in a muffle furnace at temperature 300  °C for 12  h in 1 : 3 ratio of solid to liquid to enhance the surface area. The coconut shell activated carbon was washed with Millipore water to eliminate residual chemicals and then the sample was dried at 110  °C temperature for 24  h. The surface modification of CSAC was achieved by impregnation with ferric chloride (Fecl 3). The impregnation was carried out at 70  °C in an oven until the complete evaporation of water was detected, and then the CSAC was dried at 110  °C for 24  h (Mondal et al. 2008). The dried sample was washed with Millipore water until the washing liquid was free from iron, and then dried to constant weight and used as impregnated activated carbon for further studies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As a key {{component}} of heavy five-axis linkage CNC machine tools, the existing mechanical biaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>milling</b> heads are usually driven by worm gear, timing belt, or multi-stage gears. Worm gear is inefficiency to transmit motion, hard to maintain the accuracy and difficult to eliminate all clearance; Timing belt can be seriously worn and cannot maintain good accuracy; and multi-stage gears transmission has defects such as long chain, low transmission stiffness. This paper aims at designing a biaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>milling</b> head with large output torque of 3000 Nm, high precision and high rigidity. So a new design for biaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>milling</b> head with mechanical spindle, gear transmission and swinging fork structure is proposed. An integral supporting axis is applied to increase the rigidity of A-axis; through the closed numerical loop control based on precise encoder and the decoupling technology of feed motion of A/C axis, the contradiction between large reduction ratio and high precision transmission is solved, and then the requirement of high positioning accuracy (10 ") is met. Theoretical calculation and simulated analysis shown, the new design not only can guarantee transmission accuracy and dynamic characteristics of biaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>milling</b> head, but also can improve its structural stiffness and meet the high demands of large torque, high precision and high rigidity...|$|R

40|$|Arising {{from the}} {{collection}} of numerical routines (validation toolbox) developed for validating discrete element method (DEM) predictions of charge motion in grinding mills, a range of rigorous charge analysis techniques have been developed. These provide descriptors of the motion and grinding regimes in a mill that hitherto have not been presented in the literature. To make the analysis meaningful, the descriptions of the charge motion were expressed as mathematical relationships that are applicable over the full range of charge motion that can be experienced in a <b>rotary</b> <b>mill.</b> The original division of the charge using the concept of the equilibrium surface, as proposed by Powell and Nurick (1996) [A study of charge motion in rotary mills. Part 1 - Extension of the theory. Miner. Eng. 9 (2), 259 - 268], has been refined to provide a surface that can be analytically derived from positional data. From this the position of the centre of circulation (CoC) of the charge can be objectively determined. The rate of circulation of the charge is calculated from knowledge of the position of the CoC. Improved techniques are presented for determining the shoulder and toe positions of the bulk charge. Plots of velocity, acceleration, interaction force, frequency of passing through a particular region, etc. can be expressed as a function of position in the mill. Through a consistent analytic characterisation of the charge, the influence of varying the operating conditions on the motion of the charge and the formation and intensity of different grinding regimes can be derived. This paper presents the methods to perform such an analytic characterisation and discusses how they may be used to improve milling efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different stabilizers and stabilizer concentrations on the media milling efficiency of itraconazole. Methods. Starting suspension of 1 g of itraconazole in 5 ml of water with different stabilizers were prepared in 10 ml vials. Povidone K 25, poloxamer 188 and vitamine E TPGS 1000 were used as stabilizers in concentrations of 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 50 % and 100 % (w/w) relative to the weight of itraconazole. Subsequent to the addition of 15 g zirconium beads, milling was started on a <b>rotary</b> <b>mill.</b> After 1, 2, 5 and 7 days, samples were withdrawn from the vials and particle size was analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS). In a further study, {{the effect of the}} polyethylene glycol chain length of vitamine E TPGS was evaluated. Suspensions of 10 % (w/w) vitamine E TPGS 400, 3500, 4000 and 6000 were prepared as described above and analyzed using DLS after 7 days of milling. All experiments were conducted in threefold. Results. For the suspensions stabilized with povidone K 25, no significant particle size reduction could be observed, possibly due to agglomeration of the particles. Poloxamer 188 stabilized suspensions showed particle size reduction and resulted in nanosuspensions with a particle size of 400 - 1000 nm after 7 days of milling. Vitamine E TPGS 1000 stabilized suspensions resulted in particle sizes of 250 - 350 nm after 7 days of milling, except for the 5 % (w/w) suspension that showed agglomeration upon milling. For the other vitamine E TPGS suspensions, slightly higher particle sizes were obtained (up to 400 nm), except for vitamine E TPGS 400, for which a particle size > 800 nm was obtained. Conclusions. Formulations containing at least 10 % (w/w) vitamin E TPGS 1000 resulted in the smallest particle sizes. The suspension containing 10 % vitamine E TGPS was selected for further formulation purposes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|First, to {{evaluate}} the effect of different stabilizing systems and concentrations on the media milling efficiency of itraconazole. Second, {{to evaluate}} the effect of PEG-chain-length in TPGS on the media milling efficiency of itraconazole. Third, {{to evaluate the}} effect of choice and concentration of excipients for freeze-drying on the physicochemical characteristics and dissolution behavior of freeze-dried nanosuspensions. 1 g itraconazole was suspended in a vial containing 5 ml of water and a stabilizer (povidone-K 25, poloxamer- 188 and TPGS- 1000; 5 %- 10 %- 20 %- 50 %- 100 %(w/w) relative to itraconazole). Milling was initiated on a <b>rotary</b> <b>mill</b> after addition of 15 g zirconium beads (0. 5 mm). After 1, 2, 5 and 7 days, DLS analysis was performed. In a further study, {{the effect of the}} PEG-chain-length in TPGS was evaluated. Suspensions of 10 %(w/w) TPGS- 400, 3500, 4000 and 6000 were analyzed using DLS after 7 days of milling. Freeze-drying of larger batches of 10 %(w/w) TPGS- 1000 -stabilized nanosuspensions (prepared in an eccentric ball mill) was done with a water soluble (sucrose) or insoluble (Avicel-PH- 101) excipient in different concentrations (0 %- 50 %- 100 %- 200 %(w/w) relative to itraconazole). The obtained powders were characterized using XRPD, DSC and SEM; and dissolution was performed (paddle method, 500 ml, 0. 2 % SDS, 0. 084 M HCl, 0. 2 % NaCl, 37 °C, 100 rpm). Using 10 %(w/w) or more TPGS- 1000 resulted in the smallest particle size after 7 days of milling (270 - 290 nm), compared to povidone-K 25 (1390 - 2150 nm) and poloxamer- 188 (430 - 670 nm). The use of a shorter TPGS-PEG-chain resulted in larger particles (834 ± 189 nm) while longer chain lengths resulted in a moderate increase of particle size (300 - 410 nm). XRPD and DSC indicated that itraconazole and sucrose/Avicel were (partly) crystalline. SEM confirmed nanoparticles. Higher amounts of Avicel-PH- 101 resulted in faster dissolution (t 60 % release(minutes) : 35 (0 %) - 8 (50 %) - 6 (100 %) - 2 (200 %)). An opposite effect was observed for sucrose (t 60 % release(minutes) : 35 (0 %) - 18 (50 %) - 36 (100 %) - 187 (200 %)). Formulations containing at least 10 %(w/w) TPGS- 1000 resulted in the smallest particle sizes. Co-freeze drying with increasing amounts of Avicel-PH- 101 resulted in faster dissolution.

Compared to its traditional counterpart, a small machine tool designed for meso-scale parts has the advantages of: ease of use, smaller footprint, smaller structural loop, shorter distances between the workpiece and the machine’s metrology devices, opportunities for improved machine metrology, and easier environmental control. At the same time, the small work volume presents a challenge when measuring the machine’s geometric errors, as traditional machine tool metrology instruments (i. e. lasers, ballbars, levels, etc.) are difficult if not impossible to use in very small work volumes.

40|$|Three {{commercial}} silk varieties, namely mulberry, muga and eri, {{were used}} to prepare ultra-fine silk particles. Degummed silk fibres were chopped into short snippets and then pulverised using rotary and planetary ball milling. The effects of degree of degumming, size of milling media, water and lubricant on particle refinement were studied. Before milling, single fibre strength tests were conducted on silk fibres degummed under different conditions. The results indicate that while reducing fibre strength via harsh degumming could cut milling time drastically, too severe a reduction in fibre strength is actually detrimental to achievable minimum particle size due to increased particle aggregation. Water {{played an important role}} in affecting the performance of ball milling. With the milling processes used in this study, a volume based median particle size (d(0. 5)) of around 200 nm was achieved, which is much smaller than previously reported results. To achieve a similar particle size, mulberry silk required more milling time, even though the overall milling behaviour was quite similar for the three silk varieties examined.

40|$|The horse-whim {{was first}} used to turn <b>rotary</b> <b>mills</b> in Greece in 300 B. C. Roman {{engineers}} developed capstan machinery to propel boats with paddle wheels about 370 A. D. About 1680, Rupert, a cousin of King Charles II, built the first horseboat using a horse-whim mechanism to tow ships in the Royal Navy. People in America called the vessels “teamboats,” because of their close relationship to steamboats. By 1819, 8 - 12 horse-boats operated between Manhattan and points across the Hudson and East Rivers. Although teamboats were cheaper than steamboats, they had disadvantages: the circular walkways took {{up a lot of}} deck space and the horses had to walk in circles. In 1819, the treadwheel-propelled horseboat was invented which placed the turntable below the deck; horses stood on top of the turntable through slots in the deck and drove the wheel backward by walking in place. This eased the burden on the horses, freed up deck space, and allowed the ferry to be built on one hull. In the 1830 s, horse-powered treadmills were developed and used with attachments on the farm; they also revolutionized the design of horse ferries. In 1889, Zuntz and Lehmann reported on the chemistry of respiration in the horse during exercise using a revolving platform.

This paper discusses various methods of fabrication of plain and carbon-reinforced composite powders, as well as a range of powder characterisation test methods suitable for defining powders for laser sintering. Two milling processes (based on disc blades and rotatory cutting knives) were used as methods of fabrication of powders, starting from injection moulding granule grades, for comparison with current powders obtained directly from polymerisation processes. It was found that the milling process affects the particles properties. The <b>rotary</b> <b>milling</b> produced powders with superior properties in comparison with the disc milling method. Tests including particle size distribution, angle of repose, aspect ratio, sphericity and roundness of particles were employed to compare and assess the suitability of powders for laser sintering. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller test was identified as a useful method to define surface roughness and porosity of the particles. The carbon fibre (Cf) Poly Ether Ketone (PEK) granules milled well and after an additional sieving process created a good quality powder. This is the first attempt to investigate properties of PEK powder with encapsulated Cf and follow their sintering profile through hot-stage microscopy. It is expected that this type of composite powder will create isotropic structures in comparison with the highly anisotropic properties given by the known dry mix composite powders, currently used in laser sintering. © The Author(s) 2017 Open Access This article is distributed {{under the terms of the}} Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International License ([URL] which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made...|$|R
