5000|$|After {{success of}} his British venture, Owen himself {{established}} a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798-1874), {{considered to be the}} first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism)." [...] Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published, an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type, and made his own printing plates.Warren was a follower of Owen and joined Owen's community at New Harmony. Warren termed the phrase [...] "Cost the limit of price," [...] with [...] "cost" [...] here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item. Therefore, [...] "he proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took {{the same amount of time}} to produce.". He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental [...] "labor for labor store" [...] called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included [...] "Utopia" [...] and [...] "Modern Times." [...] Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews' The Science of Society, published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories. Catalan historian Xavier Diez report that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Emile Armand and the intentional communities started by them.Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe.

ATDC promoted cancer cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. ATDC expression correlated with elevated β-catenin levels in pancreatic cancer, and β-catenin function was required for ATDC's oncogenic effects.

40|$|INTRODUCTION : Currently, {{widely used}} {{antimalarial}} drugs {{have a limited}} clinical lifespan due to parasite resistance development.

AREAS COVERED : In this review the authors discuss current strategies to circumvent resistance in malaria and alternatives that could be employed.

40|$|Australia is {{fortunate}} to have medical clinicians with the scientific rigour, ethical drive, and enthusiasm exemplified by Stephen Bolsin. This said, we are not comfortable that these attributes are enough to ensure the cultural <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>progress</b> is overcome as rapidly as we would want it to be. This commentary will outline {{the main reasons for}} our discomfort. On first reading, Stephen Bolsin’s editorial presents an encouraging and optimistic view {{of the way in which}} medical clinicians see their future roles and responsibilities regarding maintaining standards in Australian health care (Bolsin 2001). Referring to the Bristol case (Bolsin 1999; Hindle 1998), Bolsin says that past lapses provide "unequivocal guidance to doctors in both clinical and managerial positions". Thus the judgements made and the guidelines proposed in the aftermath of the Bristol scandal (reflected in part in local concerns with quality, risk, safety and benchmarking) require that clinicians respond in "a professional manner", which includes providing "appropriate care for the sick". But what is appropriate and where do we find the criteria? In answering this question, Bolsin makes reference to the situation in Australia, where criteria have been framed under the banner ‘clinical governance’. However, Bolsin says the responsibility for clinical governance rests at Area Board level in NSW. This locus of responsibility appears to be reason to refrain from elaborating any further on those principles or on what the...|$|E
40|$|The {{viability}} of the European project is coming under serious question due {{to a combination of}} persistent economic stagnation coupled with the migration crisis, which together fuel the relentless rise of anti-establishment and anti-E. U. sentiments across the continent. Is the magnitude of these crises and their obdurate <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>progress</b> leading the European project towards failure? One of the potential future paths of the E. U., a formal ‘two-speed’ Europe, is in the works regarding the sectors of E. U. defense and border control. If such a framework were to be applied as a solution to their economic problems, E. U. countries could target policies based on their economic performance rather than a one-size-fits-all E. U. policy. Although a current, intrinsic, ‘two-speed’ framework exists in the E. U., it encounters several difficulties (namely political will and through a form of social pressure) that undermine its success, ultimately rendering it unconvincing. I develop an alternative approach based solely on economic performance by adapting the Proust Index, a macroeconomic index originally devised by The Economist which aggregates seven indicators. This analysis firstly reveals clearly divergent patterns of economic trends within the E. U. In the context of a ‘two-speed’ Europe, it then provides a set of hypothetical 'definitions' along which E. U. member-states could be divided, something largely missing or at best vague in the few instances it appears in official statements and in economic literature.

However, our current means of dealing with such challenges has fallen short, and ingenious solutions are required to overcome the inherent <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>progress</b> toward ameliorating such difficulties. Here, we highlight the promises and challenges of international collaboration in achieving success toward these trials. We note prior successes in fields such as education, medicine, science, and environmental issues made to date, yet at the same time we do note deficiencies and shortcomings in these efforts. Hence, the notion of international collaboration should be strengthened and encouraged by governments, non-profit organizations, and others moving forward using creative means to bring talented teams together to tackle these challenges across the globe...|$|E
40|$|Bean/Cowpea Collaborative Research Support Program (B/C CRSP) {{scientists}} have successfully developed integrated consensus {{maps of the}} 11 linkage groups (LGs) in both bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp). The bean map is approximately 1200 cM with some 500 markers and an additional 500 markers shared with other bean maps. The cowpea map spans 2670 cM with over 400 markers. In addition to molecular markers, both maps include map locations of defense genes and phenotypic traits for disease and insect resistance, seed size, color and storage proteins, pod color and those traits associated with the domestication syndrome in bean. Since the bean and cowpea maps were developed independently, LGs with the same number probably refer to non-syntenic groups. Map locations of major resistance genes in bean are revealing gene clusters on LGs B 1, B 4, B 7, and B 11 for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> bean rust, anthracnose, common bacterial blight and white mold. Gene tagging and marker-assisted selection for disease <b>resistance</b> has <b>progressed</b> <b>to</b> {{a point where the}} indirect selection for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> a number of major diseases is now routine in bean breeding programs both in the US and overseas...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{link between}} obesity and β cell failure that causes diabetes {{is difficult to}} establish. Here we show that a conditional knockout of insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs 2) in mouse pancreas β cells {{and parts of the}} brain — including the hypothalamus —increased appetite, lean and fat body mass, linear growth, and insulin <b>resistance</b> that <b>progressed</b> <b>to</b> diabetes. Diabetes resolved when the mice were between 6 and 10 months of age: functional β cells expressing Irs 2 repopulated the pancreas, restoring sufficient β cell function to compensate for insulin resistance in the obese mice. Thus, Irs 2 signaling promotes regeneration of adult β cells and central control of nutrient homeostasis, which can prevent obesity and diabetes in mice...|$|R

40|$|Current {{treatment}} methods for melanoma have some limitations such as less target-specific action, severe {{side effects and}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> drugs. Significant <b>progress</b> {{has been made in}} exploring novel drug delivery systems based on suitable biochemical mechanisms using nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 400 nm for drug delivery and imaging, utilizing their enhanced penetration and retention properties. Poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), a copolymer of poly-lactic acid and poly-glycolic acid, provides an ideally suited performance-based design for better penetration into skin cells, thereby having a greater potential for the treatment of melanoma. Moreover, encapsulation protects the drug from deactivation by biological reactions and interactions with biomolecules, ensuring successful delivery and bioavailability for effective treatment. Controlled and sustained delivery of drugs across the skin barrier that otherwise prohibits entry of larger molecules can be successfully made with adequately stable biocompatible nanocarriers such as PLGA for taking drugs through the small cutaneous pores permitting targeted deposition and prolonged drug action. PLGA is now being extensively used in photodynamic therapy and targeted therapy through modulation of signal proteins and drug-DNA interactions. Recent advances made on these nanomedicines and their advantages in the treatment of skin melanoma are highlighted and discussed in this review...|$|R
