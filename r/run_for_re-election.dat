5|$|Goldschmidt {{declined}} to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 1990, despite the widely held perception {{that he could}} have been easily re-elected; at the time, he cited marital difficulties. Bernie Giusto, who was Goldschmidt's driver at the start of his term and later became Multnomah County Sheriff, was widely rumored to be romantically involved with Goldschmidt's wife Margie (and would later date her openly after they divorced).|$|E
5|$|Gravel did not <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 1966, instead {{choosing}} {{to run for}} Alaska's seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing in a primary to four-term incumbent Democrat Ralph Rivers by 1,300 votes and splitting the Democratic party in the process. Rivers lost the general election that year to Republican state Senator Howard Wallace Pollock.|$|E

5|$|Berrios {{allied with}} Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, during Chicago Mayor Harold Washington's first term, the Council Wars era. In 1987 Raymond Figueroa, with Washington's backing, {{defeated}} Berrios's candidate for alderman, Miguel Santiago, which helped close the Council Wars. A year later Figueroa defeated Berrios for committeeman. In 1991, Figueroa {{decided not to}} <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> as alderman, and left the committeeman's job the following year.

5|$|Following his {{decision}} not to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> as mayor in 1893, three years later, McCauley sought to be Edmonton's representative in the North-West Territories Legislature. During his term as representative, he worked to upgrade Edmonton's school system, along with upgrading the town's trade industry. He served in this capacity until 1902, when he was defeated. During his time, McCauley kept his focus on his development of the school system, introducing a single tax bill intended to give schools boards power to adopt the tax.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election,</b> retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 {{the state}} Apportionment Board, {{controlled}} by a 32 Republican majority despite the party's 6138 minority in the state House of Representatives, redrew state legislative districts following {{the results of the}} 1990 Census, in the hope of retaking control of the state House. The new boundaries created nine districts each with two resident incumbent Democrats, pairing Cordray with the twenty-two-year incumbent Mike Stinziano. Unable to be elected in another district due to a one-year residency requirement, Cordray opted not to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 2005, Fletcher {{announced}} his intent to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b> Shortly after Fletcher was indicted by {{the grand jury}} in 2006, Lieutenant Governor Pence {{announced that he would}} not be Fletcher's running mate during his re-election bid. Fletcher asked for Pence's immediate resignation as lieutenant governor. Pence declined, but did tender his resignation as head of the Justice Cabinet.

5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} {{his term}} in office Clarke decided not to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 1883. He was losing too much support due to his ties with the Hudson's Bay Company. The {{electorate}} suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company. Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.|$|E

Following an injunction by the State Ethics Commission over his ownership of Cape Air, {{he announced}} the suspension of his campaign and his intent to appeal the ruling. Although the Commission eventually ruled in his favor, the nomination process was already well along, and he would eventually <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> to the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Preckwinkle succeeded Evans as 4th Ward Democratic committeeman in 1992, {{defeating}} former Evans {{administrative assistant}} Johnnie E. Hill by 6,227 to 2,327 {{votes in the}} March 17, 1992 primary election; Evans had filed nominating petitions to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> as committeeman and run for judge, but withdrew his name from the ballot for committeeman so his name would only appear once on the ballot, for the judgeship (to which he was elected).|$|E
5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} down the ballot. Meehan did not <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election,</b> {{and the race}} for county sheriff pitted two incumbent city councilmen against {{each other for the}} job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, whose job differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for the next twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{stayed on}} as {{president}} of the UCR, leaving after the party's defeat in the 1991 legislative elections. Suffering damage to its image because of the hyperinflation of 1989, the UCR lost in several districts. Alfonsín became president of the party again in 1993. He supported the creation of a special budget for the province of Buenos Aires, led by governor Eduardo Duhalde. The radical legislator Leopoldo Moreau supported the new budget even more vehemently than the Peronists. Both parties had an informal alliance in the province. Alfonsín also supported the amendment to the constitution of Buenos Aires that allowed Duhalde to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b>|$|E

5|$|Brunner's term as Ohio Secretary of State ends in 2011 and {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 2010 along with other Ohio statewide offices. In January, rumors that were eventually confirmed began circulating that second term Republican United States Senator George Voinovich would not <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 2010. Brunner's name was mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for the seat. On January 23, 2009, Brunner and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher met to discuss the possibility that either of them would run, but did not confirm any decision or leanings to the media.|$|E
5|$|Driehaus {{had been}} {{the choice of the}} Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) to run in Ohio's 1st congressional {{district}} for the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, but he decided to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in his Ohio House of Representatives seat. He had been elected as the Minority Whip of the Ohio House of Representatives, replacing Dale Miller for the beginning of the 2005 session, in a November 2004 vote after being reelected to his third term. Driehaus survived his own challenge from Scott Gehring with a 2:1 victory margin in the 2006 election for his state house seat.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, McCain {{returned}} to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there. In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect Obama, and the two discussed issues they had commonality on. Around the same time, McCain indicated {{that he intended to}} <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> to his Senate seat in 2010. As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival, and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.|$|E
