5|$|As {{the second}} WrestleMania {{to be held}} entirely outdoors, Vince McMahon also {{announced}} that the show would have taken place regardless of the weather conditions. In the March 2008 issue of WWE Magazine, WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel <b>rig</b> with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent rain from falling on the ring. In that same issue, an initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a larger <b>rig</b> surrounding the tarpaulin <b>rig,</b> with lighting and two giant screens attached. The final design had the lighting and video screens on the tarpaulin <b>rig,</b> {{as well as the}} sound system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned that video reinforcement should prevent anyone's view from being obstructed by the steel structure. Up to seven generators were used to power up the show.|$|E

50|$|Small mobile {{drilling}} <b>rigs</b> {{are also}} used to drill or bore piles. <b>Rigs</b> can range from 100 ton continuous flight auger (CFA) <b>rigs</b> to small air powered <b>rigs</b> used to drill holes in quarries, etc. These <b>rigs</b> use the same technology and equipment as the oil drilling <b>rigs,</b> just on a smaller scale.|$|R
5|$|As Chris {{approached}} the Gulf Coast, at least 6,500people were evacuated from the Louisiana coast. Offshore evacuations were also completed, with many oil <b>rig</b> workers were taken off of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil <b>rig</b> as his base. Bond attacks the <b>rig,</b> stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
5|$|During its {{operational}} lifetime, the <b>rig</b> {{was actively}} in operation for 93% of its working life (2,896 of 3,131 days). The remainder partly relates to time spent between sites.|$|E
25|$|Running <b>rigging</b> is the <b>rigging</b> of a {{sailing vessel}} {{that is used}} for raising, lowering, shaping and {{controlling}} the sails on a sailing vessel—as opposed to the standing <b>rigging,</b> which supports the mast and bowsprit. Running <b>rigging</b> varies between vessels that are <b>rigged</b> fore and aft {{and those that are}} square-rigged.|$|R
50|$|Control <b>rigs</b> {{are created}} using bones with {{automatic}} IK, constraints and specialized solvers like spine or tail. Optionally, the ICE {{system can be}} used to create light-weight <b>rigs</b> in a node-based environment. The <b>rigging</b> process can be sped up through the use of adaptable biped and quadruped <b>rigs,</b> FaceRobot for facial <b>rigs</b> and automatic lip syncing.|$|R
50|$|Parrel beads (also spelled parral or parrell) are {{an element}} of sailing <b>rigging,</b> usually {{deployed}} at the jaws of a gaff on a gaff <b>rigged</b> or gunter <b>rigged</b> craft, or on the tack of a spinnaker <b>rigged</b> over a furled jib.|$|R
5|$|During the 1870s the {{distinction}} grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' {{on the one}} hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing <b>rig</b> increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing <b>rig</b> on ironclad battleships.|$|E
5|$|He {{makes it}} to her in time and administers the {{antidote}} before the infection can take hold. Bennett then contacts him and Hansen makes him promise that if he gives Bennett the research, Bennett will save Anna. He soon discovers that Kamsky infected himself with a strain of exocel DNA, and now wishes {{to do the same}} to Anna. Hansen finds Kamsky's laptop and transmits the antidote data to Bennett, but nothing else. As a furious Bennett berates Hansen, he and Anna agree to blow up the <b>rig</b> using C4. As Hansen plants the charges, he learns Kamsky had gone completely insane; after infecting himself with exocel serum, he released the imprisoned exos on the <b>rig</b> and planted a group of exocels on the Eastern Spirit. He then went into hiding to await his metamorphosis. When Hansen has planted all of the charges, he heads to the heliport to meet Anna. Before they can take off however, they are attacked by a mutated Kamsky; the same creature who rescued Anna from the sea. Kamsky is desperate for Anna to remain with him on the <b>rig,</b> but Hansen is able to fight him off and kill him. He and Anna then escape in a helicopter as the <b>rig</b> explodes below them.|$|E

5|$|New {{properties}} {{have also}} been introduced, including temporary properties which are constructed by the <b>Rig</b> unit (formerly known as the APC). Temporary properties cannot build new units like other properties can, but can only be used as stationary resupply bases providing some defensive cover for units, and can be captured. Each <b>Rig</b> unit can construct one of two temporary properties, the Temporary Port and Temporary Airport. Additionally, the new Radar property has been added; when captured it clears a five-tile radius of Fog of War.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{receives}} Doggett and Mulder's message, {{and tells}} them that Kersh has broken the quarantine. Mulder destroys the platform's radio {{so that the}} black oil-infected crew cannot communicate with the aliens. Suddenly, the platform workers stop their attack and begin to sabotage the <b>rig.</b> Doggett and Mulder leave the radio room, and jump off the <b>rig</b> when they realize that the crew are going to destroy it. They are rescued by the helicopters Kersh has sent to break the quarantine. Later, at the FBI, Mulder tells Doggett {{that he has been}} dismissed from the bureau.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Mulder and Doggett agree to jump from the oil platform, which was shot {{in a way that}} recalls a scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump in front of a green screen. Separate footage of the <b>rig</b> exploding—created by {{combining}} actual shots of the <b>rig</b> with CGI—was then filmed, and the two shots were composited on top of one another.|$|E
5000|$|Custom built saddles may be {{designed}} {{with any of}} the above <b>rigging</b> styles. Modern western saddles for riders who need speed and agility, such as barrel racing saddles, often have a 3/4 <b>rigging,</b> the closest placement to a center-fire <b>rigging</b> seen on modern saddles. The most popular modern <b>rigging</b> placement is the 7/8 <b>rigging,</b> which allows a rider to have a secure seat but more easily stay centered over a horse's center of balance and is often seen on saddles used for western equitation. A [...] "full double" [...] <b>rigging</b> is seen most often on saddles used for team roping, where the weight of the steer puts tremendous forward stress on the saddle, requiring <b>rigging</b> set well forward and both a front and back cinch to support the saddle. A few saddles are built with a three-way <b>rigging</b> plate that allows a saddle to be <b>rigged</b> in the full, 7/8 or 3/4 positions.|$|R

Both <b>rigging</b> heads reports to the ACLT and CLT of the department. The Gaffer or the Chief Lighting Technician is the Head of the Set Lighting department and reports to the Director of Photography (Cinematographer) to make decisions on the creative lighting on the set (or on location), and is responsible for executing those decisions. A budget deciphered from the production schedule, script and vision mandates the types of lights and how to proceed with <b>rigs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Advanced systems {{played a}} key role in the rig's operation, from {{pressure}} and drill monitoring technology, to automated shutoff systems and modelling systems for cementing. The OptiCem cement modelling system, used by Halliburton in April 2010, played a crucial part in cement slurry mix and support decisions. These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on the <b>rig</b> that month.|$|E
5|$|Back in Azerbaijan, Bond {{discloses}} to M that Elektra {{may not be}} {{as innocent}} as she seems. An alarm sounds while he is handing M the locator card as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection <b>rig</b> heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the <b>rig,</b> a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.|$|E
5|$|Bond goes to San Francisco {{where he}} learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin {{could be the}} product of medical {{experimentation}} with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's physician, Dr. Carl Mortner. Bond then investigates a nearby oil <b>rig</b> owned by Zorin and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording Zorin's conversation. Ivanova's partner Klolktoff is captured and killed while trying to place limpet mines on the <b>rig,</b> but Ivanova and Bond escape. They go to her place where Bond is able to steal the recording. Bond tracks down the woman that Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and discovers that Zorin is trying to purchase her family's oil business.|$|E

5|$|Catawba {{was renamed}} Atahualpa, after the Emperor Atahualpa, the last {{ruler of the}} Inca Empire. To prepare the ship for her lengthy voyage to Peru around Cape Horn, Swift & Co. added a {{breakwater}} on the bow, stepped two masts with a fore-and-aft <b>rig</b> to supplement her engine, and provided closures to make vents and deck openings water tight.|$|E
5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a <b>rig</b> was constructed to help a <b>rig</b> tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate <b>rig</b> that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the <b>rig</b> flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
50|$|Most {{entertainment}} <b>rigging</b> {{training is}} done either by apprenticeship or formal training through unions i.e. the Stagehands Union or I.A.T.S.E. The recognized entertainment <b>rigging</b> certification is the E.T.C.P. Arena and theater <b>rigging</b> certification programs.|$|R

50|$|Direct push {{technology}} includes {{several types of}} drilling <b>rigs</b> and drilling equipment which advances a drill string by pushing or hammering without rotating the drill string. While this {{does not meet the}} proper definition of drilling, it does achieve the same result — a borehole. Direct push <b>rigs</b> include both cone penetration testing (CPT) <b>rigs</b> and direct push sampling <b>rigs</b> such as a PowerProbe or Geoprobe. Direct push <b>rigs</b> typically are limited to drilling in unconsolidated soil materials and very soft rock.|$|R
