50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} cost-effective safety device is the <b>rupture</b> <b>disk.</b> Incorporated into the pressure vessel in fabrication, {{this is simply}} a port in the vessel closed off by a finely machined plate that will burst at a predetermined pressure. This plate may be made of either aluminum or carbon. The disk is fitted within a flanged assembly that discharges the autoclave's pressure out into an exhaust pipe to carry the whoosh well away from personnel. The disk is fairly inexpensive and can be replaced easily. The <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> {{should be used to}} back up the safety valve and sized to drop internal pressure as quickly as possible. Autoclave fires can release considerable energy into the air inside, resulting in a sudden pressure spike. The <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> is designed to release at a pressure slightly above that of the ASME safety valve and well below that of the hydrostatic test; it is never called into play unless there is a sudden pressure increase beyond the capacity of the safety valve. The very modest cost of even a pair of fairly large rupture disks makes this an extremely attractive option. The <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> should be not less than twice the diameter of the inlet to or the outlet from the vessel, whichever is larger.|$|E

50|$|A {{safety valve}} is a valve {{that acts as}} a {{fail-safe}} in a thermal-hydraulics plant. An example of safety valve is a pressure relief valve (PRV), which automatically releases a substance from a boiler, pressure vessel, or other system, when the pressure or temperature exceeds preset limits. Pilot-operated relief valves are a specialized type of pressure safety valve. A leak tight, lower cost, single emergency use option would be a <b>rupture</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{spring-loaded}} {{safety relief}} valve is usually installed on all oil and gas separators. These valves normally are set at the design pressure of the vessel. Safety relief valves serve primarily as a warning, and in most instances {{are too small to}} handle the full rated fluid capacity of the separator. Full-capacity {{safety relief valve}}s can be used and are particularly recommended when no safety head (<b>rupture</b> <b>disk)</b> is used on the separator.|$|E

50|$|A {{safety head}} or <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> is a device {{containing}} a thin metal membrane {{that is designed}} to rupture when the pressure in the separator exceeds a predetermined value. This is usually from 1 1/4 to 1% times the design pressure of the separator vessel. The safety head disk is usually selected so that it will not rupture until the safety relief valve has opened and is incapable of preventing excessive pressure buildup in the separator.|$|E
50|$|The shell {{contained}} two canisters {{separated by}} a <b>rupture</b> <b>disk.</b> The compartments were filled with two liquid precursor chemicals for sarin (GB2): methylphosphonyl difluoride (denominated DF) and a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and isopropyl amine (denominated OPA) is in a second canister. The isopropyl amine binds the hydrogen fluoride generated during the chemical reaction. When the shell was fired {{the force of the}} acceleration would cause the disk between them to breach and the spinning of the projectile facilitated mixing. The two precursor chemicals would react in flight to produce sarin and when the shell reached its target the sarin would be released.|$|E
5000|$|In a light-gas gun, {{the piston}} {{is powered by}} a {{chemical}} reaction (usually gunpowder), and the working fluid is a lighter gas, such as helium or hydrogen (though helium is much safer to work with, hydrogen offers the best performance explained below and causes less launch-tube erosion). One addition that a light-gas gun adds to the airgun is a <b>rupture</b> <b>disk,</b> which is a disk (usually metal) of carefully calibrated thickness designed to act as a valve. When the pressure builds up to the desired level behind the disk, the disk tears open, allowing the high-pressure, light gas to pass into the barrel. This ensures that the maximum amount of energy is available when the projectile begins moving.One particular light-gas gun used by NASA uses a modified 40-mm cannon for power. The cannon uses gunpowder to propel a plastic (usually HDPE) piston down the cannon barrel, which is filled with high-pressure hydrogen gas. At the end of the cannon barrel is a conical section, leading down to the 5-mm barrel that fires the projectile. In this conical section is a stainless steel disk, approximately 2 mm thick, with an [...] "x" [...] pattern scored into the surface in the middle. When the hydrogen develops sufficient pressure to burst the scored section of the disk, the hydrogen flows through the hole and accelerates the projectile to a velocity of 6 km/s km/h in a distance of about a meter.|$|E

40|$|Industrial <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> {{vent line}} areas for {{two-phase}} flow are currently overestimated. As a consequence, the dischargeable {{mass flow rate}} is partially much higher than necessary often leading to malfunctions in downstream retention systems and increased environmental loads. For two-phase gas/liquid flow there is no standardized sizing procedure available. Hence, the homogeneous non-equilibrium model HNE-DS is transferred from sizing safety valves to a procedure for sizing <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> vent lines. Thermodynamic non-equilibrium effects like boiling delay are considered. The extend method is called HNE-CSE method. Characteristic numbers of <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> vent lines like the resistance coefficient K-g are typically measured under laboratory, subcritical conditions with incompressible fluids, i. e. liquids or gases at very low velocities. In contrast, the flow typically encountered in an industrial <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> vent line is a compressible gas or two-phase gas/liquid flow under critical flow conditions. The sizing of a <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> vent line based on characteristics for incompressible fluids is therefore a challenge. An appropriate test section for compressible fluids {{as an extension of}} ASME PTC 25 is recommended.

40|$|A resin slurry venting {{analysis}} was conducted to address safety issues associated with overpressurization of ion exchange columns used in the Purex process at the Savannah River Site (SRS). If flow to these columns were inadvertently interrupted, an exothermic runaway reaction could occur between the ion exchange resin and the nitric acid used in the feed stream. The nitric acid-resin reaction generates significant quantities of noncondensable gases, which would pressurize the column. To prevent the column from rupturing during such events, rupture disks are installed on the column vent lines. The venting analysis models accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) tests and data from tests that were performed in a vented test vessel with a <b>rupture</b> <b>disk.</b> The tests showed that the pressure inside the test vessel continued to increase after the <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> opened, though at a slower rate than prior to the rupture. Calculated maximum discharge rates for the resin venting tests exceeded the measured rates of gas generation, so the vent size was sufficient to relieve the pressure in the test vessel if the vent flow rate was constant. The increase in the vessel pressure is modeled as a transient phenomenon associated with expansion of the resin slurry/gas mixture upon rupture of the disk. It is postulated that the maximum pressure {{at the end of}} this expansion is limited by energy minimization to approximately 1. 5 times the <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> burst pressure. The magnitude of this pressure increase is consistent with the measured pressure transients. The results of this analysis demonstrate the need to allow for a margin between the design pressure and the <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> burst pressure in similar applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For the {{transfer}} of a b-Glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene to sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) callus and leaf explants by microprojectile bombardment, various <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> pressures and sample plate distances were tested.

The sample plate distances affected the distribution pattern of the particles and the cells expressing the GUS reporter gene were noted to be aggregated in short distances whereas longer distance shots yielded better distribution of transformed cells. For both leaf explants and callus structures the <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> pressure of 1350 psi was observed to yield the highest gene expression results and the sample plate distance of 12 cm for the leaf explants and 9 cm for the callus were found to increase the penetration success of the gold particles.

40|$|Due to the Three Mile Island {{accident}} in 1979 the Swedish government took {{the decision in}} 1986 to impose a pressure relief system for Swedish BWR’s which prevents containment overpressure in case of LOCA. This pressure relief system consists of a rupture disks in two different systems, non-filtered system 361 and filtered system 362. During a steam line break {{it is not clear}} if an unjustified activation of <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> 361 or 362 could possibly occur. If significant amount of nitrogen will leak out from the containment then, there is a risk of low pressure in the containment (e. g. due to activation of containment spray) with leaking rupture disks, which might cause air inflow to the containment and burning of hydrogen, so conditions of activation of <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> must be studied. The main objective of this master thesis is the investigation of conditions of activation of <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> in BWR containment filtering system. In order to find out these conditions specific software called GOTHIC has been used. The methodology of this master thesis has been modeling different containments with GOTHIC software; this thesis work will go from a simple GOTHIC model, that consist in nine lumped control volumes connected by flow paths, until a more complex GOTHIC model that consist in a combination of lumped and 3 D control volumes, connected among them by flow paths and 3 D connectors. A large LOCA in {{the upper part of the}} reactor vessel will be considerate, due to this severe accident; conditions for the activation of the <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> will be complying. It has to be mentioned that pressure in the lumped modeling will be lower than pressure in the 3 D volumes. Activation time for the lumped modeling will be 8, 5 seconds after the steam break for system 362 and activation time for 3 D modeling will be 2, 8 seconds for system 362 as well. In neither case 361 system will be activated. Considering this is a nuclear safety study and accuracy must be a key point, for further investigations it might be more than advisable using 3 D control volumes instead of lumped control volumes. It has to be mentioned also that due to there is no experimental data, uncertainty regarding to the results exist, and if a further safety analysis want to be done, sensitive study of the parameters implemented on GOTHIC software should be performed in the future...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} {{is to determine the}} probability of Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) over-pressurizing during staging at the Canister Storage Building (CSB). Pressurization of an MCO during staging is dependent upon changes to the MCO gas temperature and the build-up of reaction products during the staging period. These effects are predominantly limited by the amount of water that remains in the MCO following cold vacuum drying that is available for reaction during staging conditions. Because of the potential for increased pressure within an MCO, provisions for a filtered pressure relief valve and <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> have been incorporated into the MCO design. This calculation provides an estimate of the frequency that an MCO will contain enough water to pressurize beyond the limits of these design features. The results of this calculation will be used in support of further safety analyses and operational planning efforts. Under the bounding steady state CSB condition assumed for this analysis, an MCO must contain less than 1. 6 kg (3. 7 lbm) of water available for reaction to preclude actuation of the pressure relief valve at 100 psid. To preclude actuation of the MCO <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> at 150 psid, an MCO must contain less than 2. 5 kg (5. 5 lbm) of water available for reaction. These limits are {{based on the assumption that}} hydrogen generated by uranium-water reactions is the sole source of gas produced within the MCO and that hydrates in fuel particulate are the primary source of water available for reactions during staging conditions. The results of this analysis conclude that the probability of the hydrate water content of an MCO exceeding 1. 6 kg is 0. 08 and the probability that it will exceed 2. 5 kg is 0. 01. This implies that approximately 32 of 400 staged MCOs may experience pressurization to the point where the pressure relief valve actuates. In the event that an MCO pressure relief valve fails to open, the probability is 1 in 100 that the MCO would experience pressurization to the point where the <b>rupture</b> <b>disk</b> would actuate. Sensitivity analysis shows that the water content of fuel particulate is the most influential factor to these calculations. The results of continued study and analysis of the fuel particulate water content should be considered for future refinement of this analysis...|$|E
