5|$|The Germans {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was <b>rag</b> <b>paper</b> with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in ultraviolet light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised {{it was because of the}} chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water in order to make the colours match.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} (from the East) of <b>rag</b> <b>paper</b> {{manufacturing}} in Europe {{in the late}} Middle Ages {{and the use of}} the printing press beginning in the mid-15th century, bookbinding began to standardize somewhat, but page sizes still varied considerably.|$|E
25|$|The paper {{industry}} in England was then {{in its infancy}} and the quantity of quality <b>rag</b> <b>paper</b> for the book was imported from France.

William Jaggard was old, infirm and blind by 1623, and died {{a month before the}} book went on sale; most of the work in the project must have been done by his son Isaac.|$|E

25|$|Nine inscribed copper plates {{thought to}} belong to the mature Harappan phase (2600 - 1900 BCE), are thought to be used for printing. The Indus {{characters}} in the plates are mirrored, and the loss in groove definition indicates repeated cleaning and polishing of the surface. The plates are also significantly larger than any seal, and much thicker, the thickness thought to help support pressure applied to their surface. The large nature of the plates makes them an unlikely candidate for seals as the tablets thus produced would be prone to breakage. The metal composition of the plates were characteristic for that period and location, and showed significant corrosion, indicating its ancient nature. Continuing patination {{across the surface of the}} plate, including on the lines, indicates that the marks were not made recently on an ancient piece of metal. On testing the plates for printing using two kinds of ink (water and oil based) onto <b>rag</b> <b>paper,</b> silk and parchment, the results on all three materials were found to be of remarkable quality. All these suggest that these plates point to the first known examples of printing in the world. One of the plates contains 34 characters, the largest number of characters found so far on any single object from Indus findings.|$|E
500|$|The designs used on British paper {{currency}} {{at the beginning}} of the Second World War were introduced in 1855 and had been altered only slightly over the intervening years.

50|$|Outside of {{scientific}} tests, {{there are no}} extant records of paper mills buying mummies. If there were records or account books, they have either been lost or recycled by the mill itself for more paper. There are no photographs of mummies or mummy wrappings at any paper mills. Shipping records and custom records have likewise vanished. However, these may not have proved anything conclusively either; since <b>rags</b> for <b>paper</b> were duty-free at this time, the cargo wouldn’t have needed to have been declared.

50|$|Low-level waste, {{which can}} be handled without special {{radiation}} protection, consists of materials such as mop heads, <b>rags,</b> <b>paper</b> towels, floor sweepings, and protective clothing used in nuclear stations during routine operation and maintenance.

50|$|From {{the late}} 19th century {{until the middle}} of the 20th century, {{drafting}} linen, also known as drafting cloth, was commonly used as an alternative to wood-pulp and <b>rag</b> <b>papers</b> in creating technical drawings. Its major benefits were considerable strength, especially in erasing and redrawing, durability in handling, and translucency for making multiple reprographic prints. Manufactured as an undyed muslin woven fabric, typically using cotton or linen fiber, the textile was highly starched and then calendered to create a smooth surface for precise ink and graphite lines. Although drafting linen was most typically used in creating original drawings, it was occasionally used as the underlying support for blueprints and other similar reprographic processes. Drafting linen largely fell out of favor after the development of drafting film — varying in chemical composition from cellulose acetate to polyester—in the 1950s.|$|R

60|$|The {{repellent}} melancholy of an uninhabited {{place had}} fallen on it already. The plain furniture was not worth taking care of: it was battered and old, and left to dust and neglect. There were two common deal writing desks, formerly used by the two girls. One of them was covered with splashes of ink: varied here and there by barbarous caricatures of faces, in which dots and strokes represented eyes, noses, and mouths. He knew whose desk this was, and opened the cover of it. In the recess beneath were soiled tables of figures, torn maps, and dogs-eared writing books.
