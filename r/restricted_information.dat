But when the accident manuals were submitted to the Diet committee most of the contents was blacked out and heavily redacted. On 12 September 3 pages were presented, including a cover sheet, containing an index of actions to be taken in serious accidents. Most of the index was blacked out and TEPCO did collect the papers immediately after the meeting, explaining that this was <b>restricted</b> <b>information</b> with copyrights, that was not allowed to be made public. The {{special committee}} did ask the industry ministry to order the utility to resubmit the manuals in their original form, as required by law. NISA said it would consider what actions to take.|$|E

We start with a theoretical investigation and then report the results of two experiments designed to examine investor strategy and trustee behavior. Our results suggest that, compared to when information flow is unrestricted, <b>restricting</b> <b>information</b> flow between trustees leads to the following: (a) total investment is larger, (b) the number of trustees receiving positive investment is about the same, and (c) the investor sends out a larger variety of invested amounts to different trustees.

40|$|Privacy and {{integrity}} are important security concerns. These concerns are addressed by controlling information flow, i. e., <b>restricting</b> how <b>information</b> can flow through a system. Most proposed systems that <b>restrict</b> <b>information</b> flow make the implicit {{assumption that the}} hardware used by the system is fully “correct ” and that the hardware’s instruction set accurately describes its behavior in all circumstances.
