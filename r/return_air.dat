2500|$|Ducrocq took Alcock on as a {{mechanic}} at the Brooklands aerodrome, Surrey, {{where he learned}} to fly at Ducrocq's flying school, gaining his pilot's licence there in November 1912. [...] By summer 1914 he was proficient enough {{to compete in a}} Hendon-Birmingham-Manchester and <b>return</b> <b>air</b> race, flying a Farman biplane. [...] He landed at Trafford Park Aerodrome and flew back to Hendon the same day. Alcock became an experienced military pilot and instructor during World War I with the Royal Naval Air Service, although he was shot down during a bombing raid and taken prisoner in Turkey.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, Lisberg was a trainee at {{accountants}} Binder Hamlyn (now {{known as}} BDO International) {{when he discovered}} Herman's Hermits at a church hall in Davyhulme. [...] By early 1964, he was their co-manager, and approached E.M.I.'s Derek Everett, who suggested producer Mickie Most, who in turn agreed {{to work with the}} band after seeing them perform in Bolton on a prepaid <b>return</b> <b>air</b> ticket from Lisberg. [...] Soon signed to EMI, their first single was the Gerry Goffin and Carole King composition, I'm Into Something Good (with B-side Your Hand in Mine, co-written by Lisberg), which went to Number 1 in the UK charts in September/October 1964.|$|E

40|$|The {{apparatus}} {{includes a}} supply duct coupled {{to a source}} of supply air for carrying the supply <b>air</b> therethrough. A <b>return</b> duct is coupled to the supply duct for carrying <b>return</b> conditioned <b>air</b> therethrough. A temperature reducing device is coupled to the supply duct for decreasing {{the temperature of the}} supply and <b>return</b> conditioned <b>air.</b> A by-pass duct is coupled to the supply duct for selectively directing portions of the supply and <b>return</b> conditioned <b>air</b> around the temperature reducing device. Another by-pass duct is coupled to the return duct for selectively directing portions of the <b>return</b> conditioned <b>air</b> around the supply duct and the temperature reduction device. Controller devices selectively control the flow and amount of mixing of the supply and <b>return</b> conditioned <b>air...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1962, The Voice of Firestone <b>returned,</b> <b>airing</b> at 10pm on Sunday nights. The same {{relatively}} small number of viewers tuned in, and the show was permanently canceled in May 1963.|$|R
50|$|A {{concealed}} {{fan coil}} unit will typically be installed within an accessible ceiling void or services zone. The <b>return</b> <b>air</b> grille and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into the ceiling, will be ducted {{to and from the}} {{fan coil unit}} and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating the grilles to suit the ceiling layout and/or the partition layout within a space. It is quite common for the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> not to be ducted and to use the ceiling void as a <b>return</b> <b>air</b> plenum.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} for an air-mixing plenum is {{the mixing of}} <b>return</b> <b>air</b> (or extract air) with fresh air to provide a supply air mixture for onward distribution to the building or area which the ventilation system is serving. The air transferred from the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> stream to the supply air stream is termed recirculated air. All air not mixed is rejected to the atmosphere as exhaust air. Air streams are mixed to save energy and improve energy efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Some systems {{include an}} [...] "economizer mode", which is {{sometimes}} called a [...] "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion [...] "DX" [...] unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare {{the temperature of the}} outside air vs. <b>return</b> <b>air,</b> or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> for the system to enter the economizer mode.|$|E
40|$|An easy, but arbitrary, {{method of}} {{separating}} <b>returning</b> polar <b>air</b> from tropical air along the Texas coast in winter is discussed.

40|$|This note {{provides}} {{examples of}} how geostationary satellite data {{can be applied to}} augment other data sources in tracking warm, moist air masses as they move northward from the Gulf of Mexico. These so-called <b>returning</b> <b>air</b> masses are often a key ingredient in bringing about severe weather outbreaks in the central and southeastern United States. The newer NOAA–GOES imagery provides high spatial and temporal resolution. Together, surface observations, upper-air soundings, and high-resolution satellite im-agery provide a comprehensive picture of the <b>returning</b> moist <b>air</b> mass. 1...|$|R

50|$|An exposed {{fan coil}} unit may be wall-mounted, {{freestanding}} or ceiling mounted, and will typically include an appropriate enclosure to protect and conceal the {{fan coil unit}} itself, with <b>return</b> <b>air</b> grille and supply air diffuser set into that enclosure to distribute the air.|$|E
50|$|In August 2011, it was {{announced}} Hawley would be returning to Coronation Street in October for a short stint. Upon his return, John kidnaps Rosie Webster and tries to clear Fiz's name by confessing to the murders of Colin, Charlotte and Joy. His <b>return</b> <b>aired</b> from 21 October 2011.|$|R

50|$|In early 2007, Hana Yori Dango <b>Returns</b> <b>aired</b> and was better-received {{than the}} first season. In the same year, Inoue co-starred in the drama First Kiss with Check It Out, Yo! co-star Yūta Hiraoka. Her {{outstanding}} performance from her past dramas landed her the lead role in the drama special Hanaikusa as a maiko-turned-geisha.|$|R
5000|$|Conditioned {{outdoor air}} is ducted to the {{terminal}} unit in the space. In this setup, the preconditioned outdoor air is ducted into the fan coil units directly, mixing with the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> from the space. This system {{is similar to a}} chilled beam setup.|$|E
5000|$|Ventilation {{efficiency}} {{is determined by}} design and layout, and is dependent upon placement and proximity of diffusers and <b>return</b> <b>air</b> outlets. If they are located closely together, supply air may mix with stale air, decreasing efficiency of the HVAC system, and creating air quality problems.|$|E
50|$|Typically, intake (fresh) air travels up {{the main}} gate, across the face, {{and then down}} the tail gate, known as 'U' type ventilation. Once past the face the air is no longer fresh air, but <b>return</b> <b>air</b> {{carrying}} away coal dust and mine gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, depending on the geology of the coal. <b>Return</b> <b>air</b> is extracted by ventilation fans mounted on the surface. Other ventilation methods can be used where intake air also passes the main gate and into a bleeder or back return road reducing gas emissions from the goaf onto the face, or intake air travels up the tail gate and across the face {{in the same direction}} as the face chain in a homotropal system.|$|E

5000|$|Multiple blowers may {{be present}} in large {{commercial}} air handling units, typically placed {{at the end of}} the AHU and the beginning of the supply ductwork (therefore also called [...] "supply fans"). They are often augmented by fans in the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> duct ("return fans") pushing the air into the AHU.|$|E
50|$|Warm {{air systems}} {{distribute}} heated air through duct work systems {{of supply and}} <b>return</b> <b>air</b> through metal or fiberglass ducts. Many systems use the same ducts to distribute air cooled by an evaporator coil for air conditioning. The air supply is normally filtered through air cleaners to remove dust and pollen particles.|$|E
50|$|The Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of a {{particular}} cooling device is the ratio of output cooling energy (in BTU) to input electrical energy (in Wh) at a given operating point. EER is generally calculated using a 95 °F outside temp and an inside (actually <b>return</b> <b>air)</b> temp of 80 °F and 50% relative humidity.|$|E

50|$|In older {{buildings}} {{the space}} above the dropped ceiling was {{often used as}} a plenum space for ventilation systems, requiring only enclosed ducts that deliver fresh air into the room below, with <b>return</b> <b>air</b> entering the ceiling space through open grilles across the ceiling. This practice is now used less frequently in new construction.|$|E
50|$|In large office towers, the {{lighting}} system is {{integrated with the}} heating and ventilation system. Waste heat from fluorescent lamps is captured in the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> of the heating system; in large buildings {{a substantial part of}} the annual heating energy is supplied by {{the lighting}} system. However, this waste heat becomes a liability when using air conditioning.|$|E
50|$|Ducts are {{conduits}} or passages used in heating, ventilation, and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) to deliver and remove air. The needed airflows include, for example, supply air, <b>return</b> <b>air,</b> and exhaust air.Ducts commonly also deliver ventilation air {{as part of the}} supply air. As such, air ducts are one method of ensuring acceptable indoor air quality as well as thermal comfort.|$|E
