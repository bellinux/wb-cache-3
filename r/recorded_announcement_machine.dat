50|$|The {{signal is}} used to {{indicate}} that the call is unreachable, either because all circuits (trunks) are busy, the called number is out of service, the call is unroutable, or sometimes that an invalid code has been dialed. A PBX also often indicates an invalid extension, while dialing an invalid telephone number on the PSTN usually results in playing the triple special information tone and a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement.</b> Many telephone companies in North America and in the United Kingdom often play the reorder tone after the reading of a <b>recorded</b> <b>announcement</b> explaining the reason of call failure, typically when the other party fails to receive the call after ringing for several minutes. The reorder tone is sometimes confused with the busy signal because they use the same frequencies and differ only in that the busy signal's beeping sounds have a slower cadence than those of the reorder tone.|$|R
