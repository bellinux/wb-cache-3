5|$|In Journey, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} a <b>robed</b> figure in a desert. After an {{introductory}} sequence, the player is shown the <b>robed</b> figure sitting in the sand, with a large mountain in the distance. The path towards this mountain, the ultimate destination of the game, is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly. The player can walk in the levels, as well as control the camera, which typically follows behind the figure, either with the analog stick or by tilting the motion-sensitive controller. The player can jump with one button, or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another; the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button is pressed, and the note stays in tune with the background music. These controls are presented pictorially {{in the beginning of the}} game; at no point outside of the credits and title screen are any words shown or spoken.|$|E
5|$|Such reenactment pantomimes became {{hugely popular}} and spread {{throughout}} Christendom. Within {{a hundred years}} every church in Italy was {{expected to have a}} nativity scene at Christmastime. Eventually, statues replaced human and animal participants, and static scenes grew to elaborate affairs with richly <b>robed</b> figurines placed in intricate landscape settings. Charles III, King of the Two Sicilies, collected such elaborate scenes, and his enthusiasm encouraged others to do the same.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>robe</b> is a {{loose-fitting}} outer garment. [...] Unlike garments {{described as}} capes or cloaks, <b>robes</b> usually have sleeves. The English word <b>robe</b> derives from Middle English <b>robe</b> ("garment"), borrowed from Old French <b>robe</b> ("booty, spoils"), itself {{taken from the}} Frankish word *rouba ("spoils, things stolen, clothes"), and {{is related to the}} word rob.|$|R
50|$|Bishops usually wear a {{black or}} a red <b>robe</b> {{with a red}} belt. They do not, however, wear a red <b>robe</b> in the {{presence}} of the patriarch, who wears a red <b>robe.</b> Bishops visiting a diocese outside their jurisdiction also wear black <b>robes</b> in deference to the bishop of the diocese, who alone wears red <b>robes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Judges {{dress in}} barrister's <b>robes</b> {{similar to the}} lawyers'. Judges of some courts adorn their <b>robes</b> with {{coloured}} sashes. [...] For example, Federal Court Judges' <b>robes</b> are adorned with a gold sash, and Tax Court of Canada Judges' <b>robes</b> with a purple sash.|$|R
5|$|A {{panelled}} stone {{structure in}} the church, carved with processions of bearded and <b>robed</b> figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in the Book of Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a sarcophagus built to hold {{the remains of a}} high status person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their similarity to the illustrations in the Book of Cerne to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the Benedictine monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England, devotion {{continued}} {{to be paid to}} Wilfrid, with 48churches dedicated to him and relics distributed between 11sites. During the 19th century, the feast of Wilfrid was celebrated on the Sunday following Lammas in the town of Ripon with a parade and horse racing, a tradition which continued until at least 1908. Wilfrid is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion. He is usually depicted either as a bishop preaching and baptising or else as a <b>robed</b> bishop holding an episcopal staff.|$|E
5|$|Journey is Thatgamecompany's latest game. The player {{controls}} a <b>robed</b> {{figure who}} {{wakes up in}} a desert, with a large mountain in the distance as their destination. While traveling, the player can encounter other players over the Internet, one at a time. Players cannot communicate verbally, but may help each other or not as they wish. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 on March 13, 2012. Austin Wintory {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Score Soundtrack for Journey, the first such nomination for a full video game score, but lost to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.|$|E

5|$|Journey is an indie {{video game}} {{developed}} by thatgamecompany {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It was released on March 13, 2012, via the PlayStation Network. In Journey, the player controls a <b>robed</b> figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names until after the game's credits. The only form of communication {{between the two is}} a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The <b>robed</b> figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story.|$|E
5|$|Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Franz Schubert. At midnight {{the devil}} Chernabog awakes and summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain. The spirits dance and {{fly through the}} air until driven back {{by the sound of}} an Angelus bell as night fades into dawn. A chorus is heard singing Ave Maria as a line of <b>robed</b> monks is {{depicted}} walking with lighted torches through a forest and into the ruins of a cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Worship at St James' is {{in a style}} {{commonly}} found in the High Church and moderate Anglo-Catholic traditions of Anglicanism. It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music, with a <b>robed</b> choir singing psalms, anthems and responses {{in contrast to the}} great majority of churches in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with Low Church and Evangelical Christian practices. The teaching at St James' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and the ordination of women.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{the effect}} of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. Candlemas was not celebrated, processions of <b>robed</b> clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on Palm Sunday to the Lindenhof, and triptychs {{remained}} covered and closed after Lent. Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.|$|E
5|$|The Liudhard medalet is a gold Anglo-Saxon coin {{or small}} medal found {{some time before}} 1844 near St Martin's Church in Canterbury, England. It {{was part of the}} Canterbury-St Martin's hoard of six items. The coin, along with other items found with it, now resides in the World Museum Liverpool. Although some {{scholarly}} debate exists on whether or not all the items in the hoard were from the same grave, most historians who have studied the object conclude that they were buried together as a necklace in a 6th-century woman's grave. The coin is set in a mount so that it could be worn as jewellery, and has an inscription on the obverse or front surrounding a <b>robed</b> figure. The inscription refers to Liudhard, a bishop who accompanied Bertha to England when she married Æthelberht the king of Kent. The reverse side of the coin has a double-barred cross, or patriarchal cross, with more lettering.|$|E
5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene. This scene shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other <b>robed</b> travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.|$|E

5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, <b>robed</b> {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
