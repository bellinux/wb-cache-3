40|$|This paper {{considers}} a multicomponent, multiproduct periodic-review assemble-to-order (ATO) system that uses an independent base-stock policy for inventory replenishment. Product demands in each period are integer-valued correlated random variables, with each product being assembled from multiple units of {{a subset of}} components. The system quotes a prespecified <b>response</b> <b>time</b> <b>window</b> for each product and receives a reward if the demand for that product is filled within its <b>response</b> <b>time</b> <b>window.</b> We formulate a two-stage stochastic integer program with recourse to determine the optimal base-stock policy and the optimal component allocation policy for the ATO system. We show that the component allocation problem is a general multidimensional knapsack problem (MDKP) and is NP-hard. We propose a simple, order-based component allocation rule and show {{that it can be}} solved in either polynomial or pseudopolynomial time. We also use the sample average approximation method to determine the optimal base-stock levels and compare it with two variations of the equal fractile heuristic. Intensive testing indicates that our solution method for each stage of the stochastic program is robust, effective, and that it significantly outperforms existing methods. Finally, we discuss several managerial implications of our findings. assemble to order, stochastic programming, inventory management, order-based component allocation, multidimensional knapsack problems, sample average approximation, heuristics...|$|E

In today&# 146;s industry world, existence of uncertainty in VIV prediction program attracts much attention. In this thesis, two major questions are emphasized on. One is the relationship and correspondence between the trajectories figures and the strain curves. The other is the contribution of 3 &# 215; component to the whole fatigue damage and the possible determinant reasons behind it. The experiments data comes from the MARINTEK 22 cases with varying current speed in shear flow are main target. During the analysis procedure, some obvious comparison results appear. The trend of 3 &# 215; strain is highly similar to the motion phase angle, which lead to the idea for future work related to energy flow analysis. More importantly, with the increasing current speed, the 3 &# 215; fatigue damage {{becomes more and more}} important in the total fatigue damage. The 3 &# 215; component can cause extremely high fatigue in the stationary <b>response</b> <b>time</b> <b>window</b> than in the total time window. The occurrence of this high fatigue is often found in the place where witnesses high fatigue value in the original total time window.

The aim of {{our study}} was to determine whether darbEpo is neuroprotective in a cortical impact injury (CII) model and to determine the characteristics of dose <b>response</b> and <b>time</b> <b>window.</b> To better understand the vascular mechanism of darbEpo neuroprotection, the reactivity of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to l-arginine administration was also studied. Rats were given saline or darbEpo from 2. 5 to 50 μg/kg at 5 min after CII or a dose of 25 μg/kg darbEpo at times ranging from 5 min to 24 h after CII. Histological assessment was determined 2 weeks after a severe CII. Other rats were given either darbEpo (25 μg/kg) or saline daily for 3 days before injury. Five minutes after severe CII, they were given either l-arginine or d-arginine. Hemodynamic variables were monitored for 2 h after injury. In the dose-response study, darbEpo in doses of 25 and 50 μg/kg significantly reduced contusion volume from 39. 1 ± 6. 7 to 8. 1 ± 3. 1 and 11. 2 ± 6. 0 mm 3, respectively.

These data demonstrate that darbEpo has neuroprotective effects in traumatic brain injury in a dose- and time-dependent manner and that vascular effects of darbEpo may have a role in neuroprotection...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} dispatching and relocating EMS vehicles during a pandemic outbreak. In such a situation, the demand for EMS vehicles increases {{and in order to}} better utilize their capacity, the idea of serving more than one patient by an ambulance is introduced. Vehicles transporting high priority patients cannot serve any other patient, but those transporting low priority patients are allowed to be rerouted to serve a second patient. We have considered three separate problems in this research. In the first problem, an integrated model is developed for dispatching and relocating EMS vehicles, where dispatchers determine hospitals for patients. The second problem considers just relocating EMS vehicles. In the third problem only dispatching decisions are made where hospitals are pre-specified by patients not by dispatchers. In the first problem, the objective is to minimize the total travel distance and the penalty of not meeting specific constraints. In order to better utilize the capacity of ambulances, we allow each ambulance to serve a maximum of two patients. Considerations are given to features such as meeting the required <b>response</b> <b>time</b> <b>window</b> for patients, batching non-critical and critical patients when necessary, ensuring balanced coverage for all census tracts. Three models are proposed- two of them are linear integer programing and the other is a non-linear programing model. Numerical examples show that the linear models can be solved using general-purpose solvers efficiently for large sized problems, and thus it is suitable for use in a real time decision support system. In the second problem, the goal is to maximize the coverage for serving future calls in a required time window. A linear programming model is developed for this problem. The objective is to maximize the number of census tracts with single and double coverage, (each with their own weights) and to minimize the travel time for relocating. In order to tune the parameters in this objective function, an event based simulation model is developed to study the movement of vehicles and incidents (911 calls) through a city. The results show that the proposed model can effectively increase the system-wide coverage by EMS vehicles even if we assume that vehicles cannot respond to any incidents while traveling between stations. In addition, the results suggest that the proposed model outperforms one of the well-known real time repositioning models (Gendreau et al. (2001)). In the third problem, the objective is to minimize the total travel distance experienced by all EMS vehicles, while satisfying two types of time window constraints. One requires the EMS vehicle to arrive at the patients 2 ̆ 7 scene within a pre-specified time, the other requires the EMS vehicle to transport patients to their hospitals within a given time window. Similar to the first problem, each vehicle can transport maximum two patients. A mixed integer program (MIP) model is developed for the EMS dispatching problem. The problem is proved to be NP-hard, and a simulated annealing (SA) method is developed for its efficient solution. Additionally, to obtain lower bound, a column generation method is developed. Our numerical results show that the proposed SA provides high quality solutions whose objective is close to the obtained lower bound with much less CPU time. Thus, the SA method is suitable for implementation in a real-time decision support system...|$|E

After initial evaluations in young, healthy male animals, further studies should be performed in females, aged animals, and animals with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Another consideration is the use of clinically relevant biomarkers in animal studies.

40|$|Generating new seismic {{responses}} from existing recordings is generally {{referred to as}} seismic interferometry (SI). Conventially, the new responses are retrieved by simple crosscorrelation of recordings made by separate receivers: a first receiver acts as `virtual source' whose response is retrieved at the other receivers. The newly retrieved responses {{can be used to}} extract receiver-receiver phase velocities, which often serve as input parameter for tomographic inverse problems, or which can be linked to temporally varying parameters such as hydrocarbon production and precipitation. For all applications, however, the accuracy of the retrieved responses is of great importance. In practice, this accuracy is often degraded by irregularities in the illumination pattern: correct response retrieval relies on a uniform illumination of the receivers. Reformulating the theory underlying seismic interferometry by crosscorrelation as a multidimensional deconvolution (MDD) process, allows for correction of these non-uniform illumination patterns by means of a so-called point-spread function (PSF). We apply SI by MDD to surface-wave data recorded by the Malargüe seismic array in western Argentina. The aperture of the array is approximately 60 km and it is located on a plateau just east of the Andean mountain range. The array has a T-shape: the receivers along one of the two lines act as virtual sources whose responses are retrieved by the receivers along the other (perpendicular) line of receivers. Because SI by MDD relies on one-way wavefields, we select <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> dominated by surface-wave noise traveling in a favorable direction, that is, traversing the line of virtual sources before arriving at the receivers at which we aim to reconstruct the virtual-source <b>responses.</b> These <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> are selected through a frequency-dependent slowness analysis along the two receiver lines. From the selected <b>time</b> <b>windows,</b> virtual-source <b>responses</b> are retrieved by computation of ensemble-averaged crosscorrelations. Similarly, ensemble-averaged crosscorrelations between virtual sources are computed: the point-spread function. We use the PSF to deconvolve the effect of illumination irregularities and the source function from the virtual-source responses. The combined effect of time-window selection and MDD results in more accurate surface-wave responses. Applied Geophysics and Petrophysic...|$|R

This occurs in the coding r{é}gime in which few spikes are emitted in the relevant <b>time</b> <b>window.</b> This approach allows us to study the additional information contributed by spike timing beyond that present in the spike counts, to examine the contributions to the whole information of different statistical properties of spike trains, such as firing rates and correlation functions, and forms the basis for a new quantitative procedure for the analysis of simultaneous multiple neuron recordings. It also provides theoretical constraints upon neural coding. We find that there is a transition between two coding r{é}gimes {{depending on the size of}} the relevant observation timescale with respect to the characteristic timescale of stimulus-induced <b>response</b> fluctuations. For <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> shorter than the timescale of the stimulus-induced fluctuations, the additional purely temporal information is of third order, and hence spike counts necessarily dominate the population information. For time-windows much longer than the characteristic timescale, the additional timing information can be of first order, and thus affect the instantaneous information rate. It is also found that, over short timescales, the temporal structure of correlations contributes less to temporal coding than the temporal variations of the firing rates...|$|R
40|$|Ratiometric {{measurements}} with FRET-based biosensors {{in living}} cells using a single fluorescence excitation wavelength are often {{affected by a}} significant ion sensitivity and the aggregation behavior of the FRET pair. This is an important problem for quantitative approaches. Here {{we report on the}} influence of physiological ion concentration changes on quantitative ratiometric measurements by comparing different FRET pairs for a cAMP-detecting biosensor. We exchanged the enhanced CFP/enhanced YFP FRET pair of an established Epac 1 -based biosensor by the fluorophores mCerulean/mCitrine. In the case of enhanced CFP/enhanced YFP, we showed that changes in proton, and (to a lesser extent) chloride ion concentrations result in incorrect ratiometric FRET signals, which may exceed the dynamic range of the biosensor. Calcium ions have no direct, but an indirect pH-driven effect by mobilizing protons. These ion dependences were greatly eliminated when mCerulean/mCitrine fluorophores were used. For such advanced FRET pairs the biosensor is less sensitive to changes in ion concentration and allows consistent cAMP concentration measurements under different physiological conditions, as occur in metabolically active cells. In addition, we verified that the described FRET pair exchange increased the dynamic range of the FRET efficiency <b>response.</b> The <b>time</b> <b>window</b> for stable experimental conditions was also prolonged by a faster biosensor expression rate in transfected cells and a greatly reduced tendency to aggregate, which reduces cytotoxicity.

The times produced by pigeons often were in the same ranges as those that have been found with adult human subjects. The average times were described equally well as linear or power functions of signal duration. However, instead of the overestimation of durations usually found when animals have timed the duration of antecedent stimuli, the linear functions suggested that the pigeons underestimated the durations of their own behavior. The birds showing the strongest control when the conditions involved eight or 10 different duration requirements revealed the constant coefficients of variation that support Weber's law and scalar timing theory. Scalar timing in temporal differentiation appears to depend on non-ambiguous information about the duration required for reinforcement and on a high degree of sensitivity to the duration requirement...|$|R

Conventionally, the SI responses are retrieved by simple crosscorrelation of recordings made by separate receivers: one of the receivers acts as a ‘virtual source’ whose response is retrieved at the other receivers. When SI is applied to recordings of ambient seismic noise, mostly surface waves are retrieved. The newly retrieved surface wave responses {{can be used to}} extract receiver-receiver phase velocities. These phase velocities often serve as input parameters for tomographic inverse problems. Another application of SI exploits the tempo- ral stability of the multiply scattered arrivals of the newly retrieved surface wave responses. Temporal variations in the stability and/or arrival time of these multiply scattered arrivals can often be linked to temporally varying parameters such as hydrocarbon production and precip- itation. For all applications, however, the accuracy of the retrieved responses is paramount. Correct response retrieval relies on a uniform illumination of the receivers: irregularities in the illumination pattern degrade the accuracy of the newly retrieved responses. In practice, the illumination pattern is often far from uniform. In that case, simple crosscorrelation of separate receiver recordings only yields an estimate of the actual, correct virtual-source response. Re- formulating the theory underlying SI by crosscorrelation as a multidimensional deconvolution (MDD) process, allows this estimate to be improved. SI by MDD corrects for the non-uniform illumination pattern by means of a so-called point-spread function (PSF), which captures the irregularities in the illumination pattern. Deconvolution by this PSF removes the imprint of the irregularities on the responses obtained through simple crosscorrelation. We apply SI by MDD to surface wave data recorded by theMalargue seismic array in western Argentina. The aperture of the array is approximately 60 km and it is located on a plateau just east of the Andean mountain range. The array has a T-shape: the receivers along one of the two lines act as virtual sources whose responses are recorded by the receivers along the other (perpendicular) line. We select <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> dominated by surface wave noise travelling in a favourable direction, that is, traversing the line of virtual sources before arriving at the receivers at which we aim to retrieve the virtual-source <b>responses.</b> These <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> are selected through a frequency-dependent slowness analysis along the two receiver lines. From the selected <b>time</b> <b>windows,</b> estimates of virtual-source responses are retrieved by means of crosscorrelations. Similarly, crosscorrelations between the positions of the virtual sources are computed to build the PSF. We use the PSF to deconvolve the effect of illumination irregularities and the source function from the virtual-source responses retrieved by crosscorrelation. The combined effect of time-window selection and MDD results in more accurate and temporally stable surface wave responses. Applied Geophysics and Petrophysic...|$|R
