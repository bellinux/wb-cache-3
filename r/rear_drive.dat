25|$|In the 85D, the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> unit is {{replaced}} by a smaller one to save cost and weight, while the second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels. This results in an AWD car with comparable power and acceleration to the RWD version. Additionally, Tesla said the 85D has a 2% (5-mile) range increase and 11% increase in top speed over the 85. In the P85D, the high-power <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> unit is retained, while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50%. This results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed. Deliveries of the P85D started in December 2014, with the 85D models starting in February 2015, and the 70D models starting in April 2015.|$|E
25|$|Medium-duty {{trucks and}} Heavy-duty trucks have {{recently}} adopted 4×4 drive-trains. 4×4 medium-duty trucks became common after Ford Motor Company began selling Ford Super Duty trucks. The Super Duty trucks shared many parts between the light duty and medium duty, reducing production costs. The Dana 60 front axle {{is used on}} both medium- and light-duty Super Duty trucks. Furthermore, the Big Three share/shared parts between the companies reducing costs. The Dana S 110 is currently being used for the <b>rear</b> <b>drive,</b> under Ford and Ram's medium-duty trucks. The Dana 110 was also used on the General Motors 4×4s as well. Ram Trucks began selling medium-duty trucks, 4×4 and 4×2, in 2008. General Motors sold a 4×4 for model years 2005-2009.|$|E
25|$|A {{skid loader}} or {{skid steer loader}} is a small rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E

25|$|For 2007, Ford's Special Vehicle Team {{launched}} Shelby GT500, {{a successor}} to the 2003/2004 Mustang SVT Cobra. The GT500 shared basic design characteristics {{with that of the}} Mustang V6 and GT. It retained the same basic live axle rear suspension setup of the Mustang V6 and GT, with some minor durability enhancements such as thicker sheetmetal supports and extra welds, as well as redesigned strut towers to accommodate a wider engine. The supercharged 5.4L 32-valve DOHC V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at 500hp (373kW) @ 6000rpm and 480lb·ft (650N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual transmission used a 3.31:1 <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> ratio. Wheels are 18×9.5inch with P255/45ZR18 tires in the front and P285/40ZR18 tires in the rear. Brembo 14-inch disc brakes with aluminum four-piston calipers are on the front with 11.8-inch disc brakes with single-piston calipers in the rear.|$|E

2500|$|The scooter had rigid rear {{suspension}} and small [...] wheels that allowed a compact design {{and plenty of}} room for the rider's legs. The Vespa's enclosed, horizontally mounted 98cc two-stroke engine acted directly on the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> wheel through a three-speed transmission. The twistgrip-controlled gear change involved a system of rods. The early engine had no forced-air cooling, but fan blades were soon attached to the magneto-flywheel (which houses the points and generates electricity for accessories and for the engine's spark) to push air over the cylinder's cooling fins. [...] The modern Vespa engine is still cooled this way.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} futuristic ideas were {{explored}} by AMC. But the automaker lacked adequate resources to build components from scratch {{and needed to}} use outside suppliers or adapt its existing parts and use its production facilities. Unique for a comparatively small car, the Pacer was as wide as a full-size American car of the era. American Motors did not describe it as [...] "cab forward," [...] but the Pacer's layout included wheels pushed to the corners (short overhangs), a relatively wide body, and A-pillars moved forward; the windshield was placed over part of the engine compartment. Contrary to myth, The Pacer was not widened six inches (152.4mm) {{to make room for}} the rear-wheel drive configuration. The editor of Road & Track asserted that front-wheel drive, as well as a transverse mid-engined configuration, were among [...] "various mechanical layouts... tossed around by the idea people at AMC," [...] adding that [...] "it's unlikely they ever had much hope of being able to produce anything other than their traditional front engine and <b>rear</b> <b>drive,</b> using components already in production." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{wheel drive}} (AWD) {{historically}} was synonymous with [...] "four-wheel drive" [...] on four-wheeled vehicles, and six-wheel drive on 6×6s, and so on, {{being used in}} that fashion at least {{as early as the}} 1920s., GMC had orders for more than 4,400 all-wheel-drive military trucks." [...] Today in North America the term is applied to both heavy vehicles as well as light passenger vehicles. When referring to heavy vehicles the term is increasingly applied to mean [...] "permanent multiple-wheel drive" [...] on 2×2, 4×4, 6×6 or 8×8 drive train systems that include a differential between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> shafts. This is often coupled with some sort of anti-slip technology, increasingly hydraulic-based, that allows differentials to spin at different speeds but still be capable of transferring torque from a wheel with poor traction to one with better. Typical AWD systems work well on all surfaces, but are not intended for more extreme off-road use. When used to describe AWD systems in light passenger vehicles, it refers to a system that applies torque to all four wheels (permanently or on demand) and/or is targeted at improving on-road traction and performance (particularly in inclement conditions), rather than for off-road applications.|$|E

40|$|Purpose：To {{examine the}} {{reliability}} and validity of the readiness of parenthood scale for adolescent males and females. The readiness of parenthood scale consists of 2 sub-scales. One sub-scale is the affection towards babies and another sub-scale is the child <b>rearing</b> <b>drive.</b> Internal consistency was analyzed by using Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. Construct validity was tested through factor analysis. The subjects were 200 adolescent males and females. 	Results：Cronbach’s coefficients alpha of affection towards babies were 0. 948 to 0. 967 for both males and females. Cronbach’s coefficients alpha of child <b>rearing</b> <b>drive</b> were 0. 833 to 0. 847 for both males and females. Concurrent validity was supported by correlation coefficients (0. 638 to 0. 667 p< 0. 01) between the affection towards babies and the scale of affection toward babies. Concurrent validity was supported by the correlation coefficient (0. 646 to 0. 668 p< 0. 01) between the child <b>rearing</b> <b>drive</b> and the scale of child rearing motivation. The experiences with children were significantly related to the affection towards babies and the positively child rearing motivation scale. Sub- factors of the affection towards babies and the positively child rearing motivation scale possessed higher validity. 	Clinical Considerations：These results suggested that the readiness of parenthood scale may be used in for adolescent males and females...|$|R
