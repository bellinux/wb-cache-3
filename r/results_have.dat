5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, mendelevium is located {{to the right}} of the actinide fermium, to the left of the actinide nobelium, and below the lanthanide thulium. Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible. Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been done regarding its properties.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} if any {{synthetic}} elements with atomic number above 99 are gases. If it transpires that copernicium and flerovium are gaseous metals at or near room temperature, as some calculations as well as preliminary experimental <b>results</b> <b>have</b> suggested, the category of elemental gases {{may need to be}} sub-divided into metallic and nonmetallic gases.|$|E

5|$|Several {{risk factors}} have been {{proposed}} and {{are the subject of}} ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset many studies have focused on parental factors around conception and during gestation. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during pregnancy and birth factors; however, <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{excavation}} {{was undertaken}} by George Marçais in the 1920s. Slimane Mostafa Zbiss conducted {{a more thorough}} excavation in the 1950s of the palace in the southeast quadrant of the city. Further excavations by a Franco-Tunisian team were made around the southeast palace in the late 1970s, ending in 1982. Few <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been published from these earlier excavations, and no records were made of the stratigraphic locations of the stucco fragments that were found.|$|E
5|$|Changing clocks and DST rules has {{a direct}} {{economic}} cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500million to $1billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although {{it has been argued}} that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E

5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as <b>results</b> <b>have</b> differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its highly}} touted lineup, Michigan entered the tournament as the sixth {{youngest}} {{team in the}} country and the youngest team in the field of 68 teams according to Sports Illustrated, based on weighted minutes played. The game marked Michigan's first NCAA Championship Monday appearance since 1989. Some sources claim 1993 as the school's last appearance, but those <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been vacated by the NCAA due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The <b>results</b> <b>have</b> revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the {{confluence}} of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been a zone of hybridization between these two species, although no conclusive <b>results</b> <b>have</b> indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, V. v. subcincta. The subspecies V. v. variegata can be found further south, and V. v. editorum is the southernmost subspecies. The ranges of these two southern subspecies overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although this has not been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research {{conducted}} {{a search for}} natural hassium. This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been released, strongly implying that no natural hassium was found. The possible extent of primordial hassium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.|$|E
5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their <b>results</b> <b>have</b> in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E

5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Once all <b>results</b> <b>have</b> {{returned}} to normal, zinc (usually {{in the form}} of a zinc acetate prescription called Galzin) may be used instead of chelators to maintain stable copper levels in the body. Zinc stimulates metallothionein, a protein in gut cells that binds copper and prevents their absorption and transport to the liver. Zinc therapy is continued unless symptoms recur or if the urinary excretion of copper increases.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo {{track and}} field program has had several successes {{throughout}} its history. The Buffaloes won the state championship in 1945 and 1946, but in more recent years <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been variable. In 2003, Eric Babb won the long jump state title {{for the first time}} in the school's history. The track & field program finished runner-up in the 2006 state championship, falling to Lawrence High School by 1/2 of a point. Garden City has also produced several notable athletes, including 1995 Kansas Track and Field Gatorade Athlete of the Year, high-jumper Jason Archibald.|$|E

50|$|The first {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{studies of}} the order Saxifragales were inconclusive because their <b>results</b> <b>had</b> only weak statistical support. In 2008, by comparing DNA sequences of the entire invert repeat region of the chloroplast genome, Shuguang Jian et alii were able to determine the position of Tetracarpaea within Saxifragales. These <b>results</b> <b>had</b> strong bootstrap support.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{account of}} ant sting fatalities in Australia was first recorded in 1931; two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from the jack jumper ant or Myrmecia pyriformis. 30 years later, another fatality {{was reported in}} 1963 in Tasmania. Historical and IgE <b>results</b> <b>have</b> suggested these two species or perhaps another species were responsible for all recorded deaths.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through television {{has long been}} a goal of the CFL although the <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been intermittent. As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate <b>results</b> <b>have</b> been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E
