40|$|This paper {{serves as}} a {{compilation}} and analysis of different banking systems {{with an emphasis on}} fractional reserve free banking. Contemporary academic literature has debated fractional reserve banking with revisited scrutiny since the 2007 – 2009 financial crisis. The Austrian School, drawing conclusions from the Austrian business cycle theory, blames central banking for boom-bust economics. One proposed solution, fractional reserve free banking, eliminates the central bank’s control for a purer form of fractional reserve practice; however, this system may be inherently fraudulent and unethical. After completing an economic analysis of the western world’s banking system, this paper then explores an alternative solution.

40|$|Conventional finance {{has long}} been plagued by crises that cause {{economic}} dislocations and impede sustained economic growth, with banks and non-bank financial institutions requiring periodic bailouts. Numerous developing countries {{have been unable to}} mobilise domestic and foreign financial resources for development while many advanced countries continue to be plagued by recurring financial crises. A number of eminent economists have denounced the shortfalls of conventional banking and have advocated 100 % reserve banking as the stable foundation for a financial system, a recommendation that happens to coincide with the Islamic financial system. The Islamic financial system is characterised by a two-tier banking system with 100 % <b>reserve</b> <b>deposit</b> system and risk-sharing equity or investment banking akin to a mutual fund, and the prohibition of interest and interest-based transactions. Islamic finance promotes risk sharing and an efficient risk-sharing vehicle would be a stock market that operates along Islamic principles that prohibit interest and interest-based leverage...|$|E
30|$|The most {{important}} component of any short-term stimulus is the relaxing of the money supply. So far, interest rates have been lowered twice. But this is far from enough. Moreover, the <b>reserve</b> <b>deposit</b> ratio is currently too high at 20  %. It should be 17  %, a rate that would have raised {{the amount of money}} available for lending at commercial banks to RMB 2500 – 3000 billion. M 2 can also grow at the expected target rate of 16  %. As for monetary policy, the central bank should amend or abandon the use of interest rate adjustments or “punitive” (or “differential”) reserve ratio requirement hikes which local branches have been required to make in the last 2  years. This would free employees up from the monotonous task of monitoring these numbers from around the country. Instead, local Banking Regulatory Commissions should be allowed to determine the proper scale of lending for commercial banks by applying the set of relevant formulas for calculating liquidity, reserve ratio requirement, and risks devised by the central Banking Regulatory Commission. The central bank should focus on combating money laundering and managing in-flows and out-flows of foreign currencies and payments and receipts for cross-border transactions.|$|E

What Are Federal Funds? ” Federal funds are short-term loans of immediately available funds, i. e., funds that can be transferred or withdrawn during one business day. Such immediately available funds include deposits at Federal Reserve Banks and col-lected liabilities of commercial banks and other de-pository institutions. Federal funds are exempt from reserve requirements and the vast majority are un-secured. Most Federal funds are “overnight money”-funds lent out on one day and repaid the following morning. Loans of longer maturity, known as term Federal funds are not uncommon, however. The law requires, for purposes of monetary con-trol, that all depository institutions maintain reserves as prescribed by the Federal Reserve System. Fed-eral Reserve Regulation D delineates specific classes of liabilities which are subject to Federal Reserve requirements. Commercial banks, thrift institutions; U. S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, and Edge Act corporations must hold set percentages of these liabilities in a combination of vault cash and noninterest-earning reserve balances at a Federal Reserve Bank. The opportunity cost of holding re-serve balances, which yield no return, provides the incentive to depository institutions to minimize thei...|$|E

PT Freeport is not going to stop at the Grasberg mine alone, therefore in 2004 Big Gossan underground mine was developed in 2008 and the underground mine Grasberg Block Cave. Several other mines are also being developed such as underground mine Deep Mine Level Zone (DMLZ) and Kucing Liar. Development of new mines and increasing production capacity requires a huge investment in terms of finance, technology, and labor. The rapid increase in employment was not followed by the addition of a decent accommodation facilities. PT Freeport Indonesia is currently facing substantial deficits accommodation. Deficit accommodation currently covered by the provision of temporary accommodation that are not habitable for the long term. PT Freeport Indonesia should immediately address the deficit that reached 2, 282 units in 2011 and an estimated deficit of 2, 193 units by the end 2012. There are three options that can be undertaken by PT Freeport Indonesia to overcome the accommodation deficit: 1) Delaying the expansion of the underground mine so there is no additional labor. 2) Move some employees to the Jakarta office by office space leased at Jakarta or to buy and build their own offices. 3) Increase the capacity of accommodation in the work area of PTFI, additional accommodation could be gained by building new units or by applying the concept of a limited mining town. Analysis method used is NPV, where the selection will be based on the smalles cost of the investment or the smallest cash outflow. This method is taken because accommodation is not the core business of the company but it is a cost center.

50|$|These gold {{deposits}} {{would become}} known as Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Deposits</b> and quickly lost their 100% gold backing. During the Fed's inception, the Fed needed only to back gold deposits by 35%.

Such a crisis did happen in 1933 and Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Deposits</b> (as well as Federal Reserve Notes) lost their gold backing. Foreign governments were still allowed {{to be on the}} gold standard and their Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Deposits</b> were still redeemable in gold. But these too were only fractionally backed.

5000|$|The Federal Reserve (Fed), when {{founded in}} 1913, sought to {{integrate}} the individual banks in the United States. To this end, they prohibited private bank notes and limited banks to only creating deposits. The banks could create deposits (as governed by their reserve ratio) backed by either gold or direct gold deposits at the Fed. [...] Because the Fed offered convertibility between gold and these gold deposits, and they provided the legal means for banks to expand <b>deposits</b> under the <b>reserve</b> ratio, many banks chose to deposit their gold with the Federal Reserve. The advantage of Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Deposits</b> over Federal <b>Reserve</b> Notes was that it greatly facilitated interbank lending and check-clearing.

40|$|THE TRADITIONAL TOOL of {{monetary}} policy {{is an open}} market operation, in which the Federal Reserve purchases short-term Treasury securities from the public. The Fed pays for these purchases by crediting the deposits that the selling bank holds in an account with the Fed. These deposits {{can be thought of}} as electronic credits for cash, which banks could withdraw in the form of green currency whenever banks wished. The primary goal of open market operations was understood to be to control the available supply of <b>reserve</b> <b>deposits</b> and the money supply in order to achieve policy targets for the short-term interest rate and inflation. If the Fed wanted to increase the supply of <b>reserve</b> <b>deposits</b> on a strictly temporary basis, it would traditionally do so with a repurchase agreement (repo), acquiring an asset from the counterparty and crediting the counterparty’s Fed balance with newly created deposits, with an explicit agreement to return the asset and receive the deposits plus interest back at a 68 THE FED’S ENTRY AND EXIT STRATEGIES specified future date.
