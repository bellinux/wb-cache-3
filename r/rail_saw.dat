2500|$|The British Rail Class 87 {{is a type}} of {{electric}} locomotive built in 1973â€“75 by British Rail Engineering Limited. Thirty-six of these locomotives were built to work passenger services over the West Coast Main Line (WCML). They were the flagships of British Rail's electric locomotive fleet until the late 1980s, when the Class 90s started to come on stream. [...] The privatisation of British <b>Rail</b> <b>saw</b> {{all but one of the}} fleet transferred to Virgin Trains. [...] They continued their duties until the advent of the new Class 390 Pendolinos, when they were transferred to other operators or withdrawn. There is only one Class 87 still in use in Britain, 87002, owned by the AC Locomotive Group and used by Serco to work the empty coaching stock of the Caledonian Sleeper services and for the occasional charter train. A large proportion of the fleet have now been exported to Bulgaria.|$|E
60|$|The deck was now {{slanting}} steeply, and Grahame, {{looking over}} the <b>rail,</b> <b>saw</b> a wet strip a foot broad between the dry planks and the water.|$|E
60|$|It was, however, {{rather more}} than three weeks later when, as a yellow-funnelled {{mailboat}} slid into Las Palmas harbour, Austin, leaning down from her <b>rail,</b> <b>saw</b> Jacinta and Mrs. Hatherly in one of the crowding boats below. The little lady discreetly remained where she was, and when Jacinta came up the ladder Austin met her at the head of it. She flashed a swift glance into his face, and then for a moment turned hers aside.|$|E
50|$|Problems {{with broken}} <b>rails</b> <b>saw</b> {{three sets of}} 45 inch driving wheels {{acquired}} from the South Australian Railways and fitted to 336 at North Ipswich Railway Workshops in November 1900. Judged a success, most others were fitted over the next 30 years. They {{spent most of their}} life operating out of Cairns.|$|R
50|$|High-speed rail {{projects}} opened across Asia and Europe, and <b>rail</b> services <b>saw</b> record passenger numbers.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the crowded}} ships {{passed into the}} harbour, men lining the landward <b>rails</b> <b>saw</b> a woman, dressed in white, singing powerfully through a {{megaphone}} such songs as [...] "There'll Always be an England!" [...] and [...] "Land of Hope and Glory." [...] A well-known local figure, she would drive down from her home on the Berea {{as soon as she}} could see that the ships were moving in.|$|R
60|$|There was, however, no {{suspicious}} {{movement on}} the saloon-deck, and Jake, walking to the <b>rail,</b> <b>saw</b> the peons putting {{the last of the}} barge's cargo into the sling. It came up with a rattle of chain, and the barge sheered off. Somebody gave an order, and there was a bustle on deck. In another few minutes Kenwardine's last chance of escape would be gone, because a British ship is British territory, and her captain can enforce his country's laws.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, Metalcut {{developed}} the first carbide <b>rail</b> <b>saw</b> which was later produced by other companies including Wagner.In 1997, AME developed an economical <b>rail</b> <b>saw</b> under {{the brand name}} AMSAW 300-R, which is still widely used throughout the U.S.In 1999, AME built a special model of a carbide saw for mitercutting railroad rails for frogs and switches.In 2011, AME develops a special model which is integrated as a double saw in a railroad car and used for repair work of railroad tracks in the USA. It replaced abrasive saws which had been used before. These abrasive saws were guilty of causing forest fires due the hot chips and sparks. Consequently, these hazardous machines were replaced with AMSAW cold saws.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, further {{budget cuts}} to Via <b>Rail</b> <b>saw</b> the Super Continental cut once again, however the Canadian which had {{run on the}} Canadian Pacific Railway in {{southern}} Saskatchewan from Winnipeg via Regina to Calgary, Alberta and on to Vancouver, British Columbia, was shifted to the more northerly CN line running through Biggar.|$|E
60|$|Wall-eye, the Canario, sprang {{down with}} his knife, and when Austin climbed back to the bridge deck the men {{clustering}} along the <b>rails</b> <b>saw</b> a canoe with a shadowy object lying in the stern of her slide through the blaze of radiance cast by the blast-lamp and vanish into the blackness outside it. Then Tom put out the light, and a hoarse murmur of relief rose out of the darkness.|$|R
60|$|Above the <b>rail</b> I <b>saw</b> {{the head}} and body of Mary Phillips, who was {{screaming}} through the trumpet. I stood and gazed in petrified amazement.|$|R
25|$|For many years, Lincoln had {{not been}} served with a direct rail service to London. However, the {{awarding}} of two new <b>rail</b> franchises <b>saw</b> this remedied.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s, SNCF {{investigations}} into high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>saw</b> some CC 7100 class locomotives specially modified for operation at speeds {{far higher than}} their regular service speed. These experiments provided valuable test data for the SNCF to develop increasingly more rapid regular services, including the 200 km/h Mistral of 1967, and ultimately the TGV.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} in 1994 of the 82 {{class and}} 90 class locomotives that were maintained by Clyde Engineering at Kooragang Island {{and the resulting}} withdrawal {{of most of the}} 44, 45 and 442 class locomotives together with the move to through working by National <b>Rail</b> <b>saw</b> the depot's use further decline with the depot closing on 24 December 1994.|$|E
50|$|The {{privatisation}} of British <b>Rail</b> <b>saw</b> {{ownership of}} EPS transferred to London and Continental Railways (LCR) in 1996. This {{was part of}} the contract agreed with the Government of the United Kingdom for LCR build and operate High Speed 1 (HS1) between London and the Channel Tunnel. The company was renamed Eurostar (UK) Limited (EUKL) and was to use the income from EUKL to help finance the HS1 project.|$|E
50|$|Declining <b>rail</b> traffic <b>saw</b> {{the gradual}} {{withdrawal}} of services on the railway, {{with the last}} station master being withdrawn on 1 July 1971. The railway was closed in 1981, and removed during 1986.|$|R
6000|$|So in the clean-shaven, {{extremely}} thin face {{hanging over}} the mail-boat's <b>rail</b> Schomberg <b>saw</b> only {{the face of a}} possible [...] "account." [...] The steam-launches of other hotels were also alongside, but he obtained the preference.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} earned special importance {{through the}} Verkehrsprojekt Deutsche Einheit (German Unity Transport Project) number 6 (<b>rail),</b> which <b>saw</b> the reconnection of the Eichenberg-Halle line formerly severed by the Inner German Border between East and West Germany.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s-1980s, CN Rail {{and later}} Via Rail {{operated}} {{a form of}} commuter rail passenger service on the railway line along Bedford Basin into downtown Halifax using frequently scheduled Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) which were destined for Yarmouth, Moncton and Sydney. Rockingham's station was closed after the January 15, 1990 budget cuts to Via <b>Rail</b> <b>saw</b> these services discontinued. The Bedford Highway was redeveloped during the early 1990s into a major collector road from Birch Cove into the city.|$|E
50|$|Snell {{was on the}} Management Committee of the International Union of Public Transport (UIPT), {{the first}} Australian representative, and was {{founding}} member of the UIPT Light Rail Commission. In this capacity, he aided in the creation of Light Rail Transit standards, and was {{one of a group of}} three Members of the Commission who presented at the UITP 46th International Congress in Brussels in May 1985. Snell's work in advocating for light <b>rail</b> <b>saw</b> him elected as the Honorary Vice President of the Light Rail Transit Association of the UK.|$|E
5000|$|The {{privatisation}} of British <b>Rail</b> <b>saw</b> the Freightliner services {{transferred to}} a new Freightliner (UK) company, but other freight operators have now added their own services to Felixstowe which has added {{to the number of}} trains running over the branch. The first of these was operators was GB Railfreight which started a service to [...] in February 2002. On 1 October 2011 it introduced its sixth service from Felixstowe (this one running to Trafford Park in Manchester) which brought the total number of freight trains running over the branch to 29 each way each day.|$|E
60|$|Walking to the poop <b>rail,</b> Bob <b>saw</b> {{that the}} men were {{bringing}} up shot, and putting them in the racks by the guns. The breech covers had been taken off. The first officer was overlooking the work.|$|R
50|$|These 2 <b>rail</b> buses <b>saw</b> {{a return}} to having only a driving {{position}} at one end only along with only having a door on one side. The door on these buses however was a siding door instead of the swing door on the previous rail buses.|$|R
50|$|The hoppers {{typically}} operated from Fyansford, near Geelong, {{to sites}} around Melbourne as required. For example, wagons were unloaded at Victoria Park {{for construction of}} the Eastern Freeway, and construction of the Melbourne Underground <b>Rail</b> Loop <b>saw</b> the wagons unloaded {{in the vicinity of}} Jolimont Junction.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the rail}} is joined, its length must be {{adjusted}} very accurately. This {{ensures that the}} thermal stresses in the rail after it is joined into one continuous piece do not exceed certain limits, resulting in lateral kinks (in hot weather) or fractures (in cold weather). The joining operation is performed by an aluminothermic welding machine which {{is equipped with a}} <b>rail</b> <b>saw,</b> a weld shear and a grinder. When the thermite welding process is complete, the weld is ground to the profile of the rail, resulting in a seamless join between rail sections. Stress in the rail due to temperature variations is absorbed without longitudinal strain, except near bridges where an expansion joint is sometimes used.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, CN and CP {{transferred}} {{responsibility for}} their passenger services to a new federal Crown corporation Via Rail; at this time the mixed train service on the DAR to Windsor was cancelled. Passenger rail service in Truro as offered by Via Rail was relatively stable during the 1980s as the town enjoyed a moderate frequency of trains. This {{came to an abrupt}} halt on 15 January 1990 after massive budget cuts to Via <b>Rail</b> <b>saw</b> rail service from Truro to Sydney, as well as to Edmundston, New Brunswick annulled, leaving Truro with only the 6 day/week Ocean service from Halifax to Montreal. Further cuts in June 2012 resulted in [...] "The Ocean" [...] being reduced to three trips per week.|$|E

50|$|Stone, Barlaston, Norton Bridge and Wedgwood last <b>saw</b> <b>rail</b> {{services}} in 2003. Etruria, no longer used by local workers, closed in 2005.|$|R
60|$|Her exclamation of {{surprise}} was {{drowned in the}} fearful cry 'Man overboard!' and all rushed down to the <b>rail</b> and <b>saw</b> Harold, as he emerged from the water, pull the red cap {{over his head and}} then swim desperately towards the child, whose golden hair was spread on the rising wave.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line has}} seen massive growth, with the Irish Times {{reporting}} that from 2013 to 2014, [...] "the western <b>rail</b> corridor <b>saw</b> a 72.5 per cent increase from 29,000 to 50,000 journeys through the Ennis- Athenry {{section of the}} line.", which was partly attributed {{to the introduction of}} online booking and promotional fares.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, {{a man was}} {{traveling}} through on the <b>rail</b> and <b>saw</b> a very pretty young woman at the Ronceverte Depot. The incident inspired a song, [...] "The Pretty Girl of Ronceverte", written by Thomas Thackston and set to music by Charles Pratt. The music is {{on display at the}} Ronceverte Public Library.|$|R
50|$|On 1 July 2011 {{the line}} closed {{following}} a historic land-swap {{agreement between the}} Singapore and Malaysia governments which <b>saw</b> <b>rail</b> service between Woodlands and Tanjong Pagar cease.|$|R
50|$|These {{are more}} {{expensive}} than conventional horizontal slide saws. They are most effectively used for cutting railroad <b>rails,</b> because the <b>saw</b> blade enters optimally into the rail profile.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2006, a {{line was}} {{slipped into the}} state budget forbidding the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) from {{spending}} any funds on commuter rail without direct approval from the General Assembly. <b>Rail</b> advocates <b>saw</b> that as a last-minute sabotage of the program, as the General Assembly only meets for 40 days once a year. [...] In addition, the Clayton County Commission in January 2007 withdrew its commitment to fund the operating costs of the line.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{being viewed}} {{by many of the}} Discworld's more Machiavellian power brokers as easy to fool, Vimes is more cunning than he appears. His years of {{practical}} experience give him a foundation of hard-headed realism on which he bases much of his more idealistic beliefs. A running gag in the series is his thwarting of several attempts on his life by the Assassins' Guild, due to his knowledge of their rigid code of conduct. Thanks to the funds now available to him, through marriage, his mansion is set with numerous traps, so that the Assassins, who must always offer a sporting chance, cannot get close to him without suffering a severe mishap. Traps include roof tiles set on greased <b>rails,</b> <b>sawn</b> roof joists over the dragon pens and bear traps in the shrubbery. Vimes also personally makes sure that all of the brickwork is kept in good repair, with no convenient handholds. In addition, Vimes' office at Pseudopolis Yard has [...] "everything that his ingenuity could devise", including sharp ornamental railings, [...] "which are pretty, and make the house look nice, but are, above all, spiky." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nosing {{through the}} dense pall of the fog, the boats searched {{the area for}} almost two hours, while those on board the liner prayed for their success. A hatch drifted past, bearing the figure of an {{unconscious}} man. Shouts from the liner directed one of the lifeboats to the rescue. The same boat picked up a swimmer not far away, and the floating body {{of a man who}} appeared to be dead went past.The lifeboats disappeared from sight in the murk and the watchers from the liner waited breathlessly. A red buoy bearing the name 'Nantucket' floated by, informing most of the passengers for the first time what they had struck.After three-quarters-of-an-hour the starboard lifeboat came into view. As those who eagerly lined the <b>rails</b> <b>saw</b> that it contained only one figure aside from those at the oars, and that was motionless, they groaned.But a minute later the port boat appeared with five or six men in the blue 'monkey suits' of the Lighthouse Service. Two of those also appeared to be lifeless. One man in civilian clothes, Captain Braithwaite, sat stiff and upright ... a cut on his head bled profusely ..." ...|$|R
