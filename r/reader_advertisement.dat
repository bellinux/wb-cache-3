This thesis employs a qualitative research approach through focus group studies that include three different age groups, reaching from students aged 20 - 30 up to retirees aged 65 and up. Findings suggest that native advertising has a negative effect on the readers; the respondents explained that they found this form of advertising deceptive and also ethically problematic for the papers. Results also showed that the <b>readers</b> preferred <b>advertisement</b> where they felt in control of the outcome of the persuasion attempt.

40|$|Collin Tateishi’s “Selling Your Lip for a Taste of Freedom” {{offers a}} rhetorical {{analysis}} of a Skoal® Smokeless Tobacco advertisement. Tateishi purposefully uses second-person, direct-address {{to appeal to the}} reader and model the methods of advertisers. When he writes, “By purchasing this product, you are freeing yourself of the monotonous burdens that have plagued your current lifestyle,” how do you respond? Is the tone conversational, moralistic, engaging? While Tateishi relies on both pathos and ethos to appeal to his reader, can you recognize appeals to reason and logic as well? Consider Tateishi’s command of language. He uses active verbs such as “welcomes,” “horse-shoed,” and “symbolizes. ” Do these verbs give the essay energy and, in turn, paint a more vivid picture in your mind? Though Tateishi’s response is brief, he delves deeply into the content and meaning(s) of the advertisement. What is the difference between summary and analysis? Locate moments where the writer shifts between these two modes to give a fully developed response. For example, the statement, “Color is a major contributor to the ad’s devious message,” is an analytic claim. Overall, how does Tateishi organize the essay? Lastly, notice the conclusion, especially the last line. It is somewhat unsettling and lingers in our minds; Tateishi places the responsibility of being discerning <b>readers</b> of <b>advertisements</b> back on his readers...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} and to record any recurring patterns in the form and communicative impact of Shona advertisements. Motivation {{to carry out the}} study came from a realisation of a growing interest in using the Shona language for advertising and the fact that very few studies have been done on Shona advertisements. For methodology, examples of Shona advertisements were qualitatively analysed using some communications and discourse analysis approaches of the speech act theory and text linguistics. A structured interview with advertising agencies randomly selected and a questionnaire on the impact of advertisements were also used. The findings of the research included that Shona was used in advertisements in order {{to reach out to the}} majority of the Zimbabwean population. In addition, Shona was also found to have been developed enough to handle formal issues like advertisements. This finding further shows that Shona advertisements reflect an instance of diglossia leakage from Shona L(ow) to Shona H(igh). Another finding is that Shona advertisements reflect some characteristics of the Shona speech community in form. These include code-switching, slang and word- division problems. An innovation in code-switching noted in some Shona advertisements is the use of three languages, namely, English, Shona and Ndebele in one advertisement. It was also established that everything about the elements of Shona advertisements communicate. For instance, the message may be visual, tactile and olfactory. It also emerged that the Shona commercial advertisements had a presenting and a hidden agenda at the same time. To achieve this the advertisements used persuasive techniques such as advertising claims, cultural hooks and personalities as spokespersons. It was also noted that most <b>readers</b> of <b>advertisements</b> do not interpret them up to the hidden persuaders but end with the direct meaning. On the other hand the Shona advertisements that gave information such as health issues have no hidden agenda. One recommendation made is that advertisements be read and studied to raise the level of awareness about the persuasive techniques used in order to distinguish between misleading advertising and those that give useful information. Some recommendations were made for future research such as carrying out similar studies of informal Shona advertisements, advertisements by n'angas/inyangas (traditional healers), prophets and political campaigns.

Besides, from the questionnaires, the writer also found that most of the respondents could not get the advertisers? idea. In order to get to the right interpretations as the advertisers intended, the frames that the readers needed were `intimacy?, `luxury?, `romance?, `complimentary wine?, `Seabourn Signature Delight?, and `Seabourn shore experience?.

40|$|The writer {{carried out}} a {{research}} for her thesis about the Ambiguous Sentences in the Advertisements because she found that sometimes the <b>readers</b> of the <b>advertisements</b> couldn?t get the right meaning from some advertisements, which contain structural ambiguity. Since the writer analyzed the ambiguity {{from the point of}} view of syntax, so in her thesis, she analyzed the structural ambiguity using Transformational Generative Grammar (TGG) because TGG can trace back all the pattern and surface structure. The purpose of this research is to find how the ambiguous constructions in advertisements are clarified in terms of TGG. The writer hopes that her research can be used by the readers to know the cause of ambiguous sentences and the way they are clarified in terms of TGG. This thesis is limited to any advertisements that contain structural ambiguity. The research questions are what ambiguous sentences occur in the advertisements, what possible meanings and surface structures of ambiguous sentences are and also in what way TGG can explain the ambiguity. In this study the writer used Jacobs and Rosenbaums (1968) procedure in analyzing the structural ambiguities. The writer collected the data and listed them in the appendix. For analyzed the data, she identified the possible meanings and surface structures following Phrase Structure Rules and then she showed the transformational process in clarifying the ambiguity. From the analysis, she found that the position of a prepositional phrase in the structure of the sentence caused the ambiguous constructions. So on the conclusion, the writer concluded that that the ambiguities found in the advertisements are affected by different functions of a constituent, that is, whether it is a sentence constituent (adverb of place) or a noun phrase constituent (noun modifier) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show how {{organizations}} portray the developing world and development support in advertisements and how it relates to the criticism existing against development support. What messages are sent to the <b>reader?</b> Do the <b>advertisements</b> contradict the existing criticism against development support or do they reinforce stereotypes and prejudices? Four organizations are analyzed: the Red Cross; Save the Children; PLAN Sweden; and We Effect. The main focus is on their campaigns and outreaching work connected to these campaigns. The analysis is based on a qualitative discourse analysis of the material complemented by a semiotic approach. The developing world is presented as old-fashioned and out obsolete. The problems existing there are simplified and insufficient solutions are offered. Children are commonly occurring and often presented as the main receivers of the support even though the support is available for all ages. Women are over-represented, while men are rarely occurring. However, men are indirect portrayed as the perpetrators and thus the notion of men is present, presenting them as dangerous and irresponsible. The women on the other hand are associated with traditional work e. g. cleaning and sewing as well as caring about the family. Despite that the organizations work all over the world the pictures mainly show black women and children. Overall the developing world is depicted as dependent on others to reach positive development. Difference is accentuated, which could increase prejudices and stereotypes. It is mainly rural environment that is portrayed, which could be seen as depicting the development world as old-fashion and timeless. Positive images of Sweden are used while negative images of other places creating a huge gap between the readers and the people and places presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Overweight {{and obesity}} are {{recognised}} {{nationally and internationally}} as key public health challenges. Food and drink advertising {{is one of the}} array of factors that influence both diet and physical activity choices and, hence, body weight and obesity. Little previous work has focused on food and drink advertising in magazines. We studied food and drink advertising {{in a wide range of}} popular UK monthly women's magazines published over a full year. We explored differences in the prevalence of food and drink advertising and the type of food and drinks advertised according to season, magazine type and socio-economic profile of <b>readers.</b> Methods All <b>advertisements</b> in all issues of 18 popular UK monthly women's magazines published over 12 months were identified. For each food or drink advertisement, branded food and drinks were noted and categorised into one of seven food groups. All analyses were at the level of the individual advertisement. Results A total of 35 053 advertisements were identified; 1380 (3. 9 %) of these were for food or drink. The most common food group represented was 'food and drinks high in fat and/or sugar' (28. 0 % of food advertisements), the least common group was 'fruits & vegetables' (2. 0 % of food advertisements). Advertisements for alcohol accounted for 10. 1 % of all food advertisements. Food and drink advertisements were most common in summer, general interest magazines, and those with the most affluent readerships. There were some differences in the type of food and drink advertised across season, magazine type and socio-economic profile of readers. Conclusions Food and drink advertisements represented only a small proportion of advertisements in UK women's monthly magazines. Food and drink advertisements in these magazines feature a high proportion of 'less healthy' foods. There were a number of differences across season, magazine type and according to the socio-economic profile of readers in the prevalence of food and drink advertisements. Fewer differences were seen in the type of food and drinks advertised. </p...|$|R
40|$|Who {{listened to}} {{cars in the}} 1920 s? Who listened {{to the sound of}} its {{technical}} malfunctions in the 1950 s? Who were the experts to diagnose failures by their ‘golden ears’ (Perlman 2004) ? What role did listening play in early automobility? To answer these questions, my paper will analyze how different actor groups in Germany listened to automobiles between the end of World War I and roughly 1960. Further, I’ll focus on car technology’s middle ground – the space between production and consumption (Borg 2007 : 1 – 12). In other words, I’ll closely examine the difficult relations between car users and auto mechanics. While in the 1920 s car manufacturers started advertising the silent run of their engines, gears and suspensions, listening to the sound of their automobiles still played an essential role for car users to notice any technical malfunctions. The verbalization of the sound experience was a legitimate and crucial means for error detection. Motorists wrote, for example, to the magazine of the German automobile club, ‘Allgemeine Automobil-Zeitung’, and tried to express their audio evidence {{with a wide range of}} metaphors or by relating it to other common sound experiences: their cars were ‘sobbing, whining or rumbling’. Still in the 1930 s these descriptions were regularly printed in a column called the ‘letter box’ and experts gave technical advices on their basis. Two decades later things had changed: While listening was still a central means for detecting faults, it was reserved to the ‘trained ears’ of car mechanics only. Instead the professionals made a mock of drivers who listened to their cars: the trade journal ‘Krafthand’ told the story of a car owner who claimed that his car was making a strange splashing noise. But during the inspection the mechanics couldn’t find any faults. Later it was discovered that the sound was merely the echo of avenue trees, which irritated the driver while going past. The moral of articles like this one was, that the ears of ordinary motorists lacked the necessary training to listen to their automobiles. The paper will argue that the observed change of the notion of listening to cars can be explained by using Pierre Bourdieu’s ‘praxeology’: e. g., by conceptualising the here roughly sketched conversion as a symbolic struggle between motorists and auto mechanics about who is the real car sound expert. Then, the stories in the trade journal can be read as descriptions of the auto mechanics habitus, or more precisely: their bodily hexis (Bourdieu 1987 : 739). The ability to diagnose malfunctions by listening to the sound of broken-down automobiles became part of the incorporated bodily knowledge of car mechanics. The struggle can thus be interpreted as a negotiation of status: the claim for the exclusive right to listen is then part of the sociotechnical distinction between lay motorists and expert car mechanics. The recurring descriptions of the motorists’ ‘bad ears’ are part of a discursive construction of normal motorists as lay users. Narrations like these are told to exclude motorists from the expert discourse. However motorists always heard their cars while driving, and they still had to listen whether their cars were running well. That is, on a practical level, mechanics couldn’t prevent users from listening, only on a symbolic level they denied access to the realm of car sound as means for technical diagnosis. Due to this contradictory status of listening as an indispensable means to detect malfunctions and listening as an expert tool for detailed diagnosis, users contested the expert authority of auto mechanics. For analyzing the role of listening in automobility I’ll investigate trade journals for auto mechanics, special interest journals for motorists, car manuals and technical handbooks. I’ll take into account editorials, articles and requests for <b>reader’s</b> experiences, <b>advertisements</b> and cartoons. As methodological means I’ll use thick description, and embed the struggle between motorists and mechanics into the historical context of early German automobility, e. g., the change in car functions and properties. For analyzing the empirical findings I’ll refer to the vocabulary of the theory of social practices...|$|R
