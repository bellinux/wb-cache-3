The jump power supply principle is introduced and illustrated along with diagrams in this paper. The prototype is built with Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) as current direction switch components. Optically coupled IGBT drivers are used for the jump control switch. The jump time among the power supplies is synchronized from 40 to 60 milliseconds to meet the RHIC beam transition-crossing requirement. The short jump time is needed to avoid particle loss and to preserve the initial bunch area during the transition, thus successfully transferring the ion beams from the <b>acceleration</b> <b>RF</b> <b>system</b> to storage system.

40|$|International audienceWe propose an {{alternative}} method to accelerate ions in classical gridded ion thrusters and ion sources such that co-extracted electrons {{from the source}} may provide beam space charge neutralization. In this way {{there is no need}} for an additional electron neutralizer. The method consists of applying RF voltage to a two-grid <b>acceleration</b> <b>system</b> via a blocking capacitor. Due to the unequal effective area of the two grids in contact with the plasma, a dc self-bias is formed, rectifying the applied RF voltage. As a result, ions are continuously accelerated within the grid system while electrons are emitted in brief instants within the RF period when the RF space charge sheath collapses. This paper presents the first experimental results and a proof-of-principle. Experiments are carried out using the Neptune thruster prototype which is a gridded Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) source operated at 4 [*]MHz, attached to a larger beam propagation chamber. The RF power supply is used both for the ICP discharge (plasma generation) and powering the acceleration grids via a capacitor for ion acceleration and electron extraction without any dc power supplies. The ion and electron energies, particle flux and densities are measured using retarding field energy analyzers (RFEA), Langmuir probes and a large beam target. The system operates in Argon and N 2. The dc self-bias is found to be generated within the gridded extraction system in all the range of operating conditions. Broad quasi-neutral ion-electron beams are measured in the downstream chamber with energies up to 400 [*]eV. The beams from the <b>RF</b> <b>acceleration</b> method are compared with classical dc acceleration with an additional external electron neutralizer. It is found that the two acceleration techniques provide similar performance, but the ion energy distribution function from <b>RF</b> <b>acceleration</b> is broader, while the floating potential of the beam is lower than for the dc accelerated beam...|$|R

40|$|The {{goals of}} FCC-ee include {{reaching}} luminosities {{of up to}} a few 1036 cm- 2 s- 1 per interaction point at the Z pole or some 1034 cm- 2 s- 1 at the ZH production peak, and pushing the beam energy up to ≥ 175 GeV, in a ring of 100 km circumference, with a total synchrotron-radiation power not exceeding 100 MW. A parameter baseline as well as high-luminosity crab-waist options were described in [1] and [2], respectively. The extremely high luminosity and resulting short beam lifetime (due to radiative Bhabha scattering) are sustained by top-up injection. The FCC-ee design status and typical beam parameters for different modes of operation are reported in [3]. One distinct feature of the FCC-ee design is its conception as a double ring, with separate beam pipes for the two counter-rotating (electron and positron) beams, resembling, in this aspect, the high-luminosity B factories PEP-II, KEKB and SuperKEKB {{as well as the}} LHC. The two separate rings do not only permit operation with a large number of bunches, up to a few 10, 000 ’s at the Z pole, but also allow for a well-centered orbit all around the ring as well as for a nearly perfect mitigation of the energy sawtooth, e. g. by tapering the strength of all magnets according to the local beam energy, and for an independent optics control for the two beams. A side benefit at low energies is a reduction of the machine impedance by a factor of twos. A long list of optics and beam dynamics challenges for FCC-ee includes the following: (1) final focus optics design with a target vertical IP beta function of 1 or 2 mm, 50 or 25 times smaller than for LEP 2, incorporating sextupoles for crab-waist; (2) synchrotron radiation in the final focus systems and the arcs, with effects on the detector (background, component lifetime) and on the beam (vertical emittance blow up and dynamic aperture); (3) beam-beam effects, including single-turn and multi-turn beamstrahlung; (4) design of the interaction region with a strong detector solenoid with possible compensation solenoids, a large crossing angle and a pair of final-focusing quadrupoles; (5) compatibility of the layout with the design of the hadron collider sharing the same tunnel; (6) <b>RF</b> <b>acceleration</b> <b>system</b> for high voltage (ZH, tt) and high current (Z, WW) with possible staging scenario; (7) impedance, HOM losses and instabilities, especially for high-current “low-energy” operation at the Z pole; (8) the top-up injection scheme; (9) achieving the dynamic aperture required for adequate beam lifetime and for the top-up injection, comprising the optimization of the arc optics; (10) vertical emittance control, including alignment and field errors, lattice nonlinearities, as well as beam-beam effects; (11) energy calibration and transverse polarization; (12) adapting to a non-planar tunnel; and (13) the development of a mono-chromatization for direct H production in the s channel.

40|$|In {{the past}} twenty years plasma-based {{propulsion}} systems have found increasing aerospace interest; although they were initially conceived as rockets for interplanetary missions, more recent advances in plasma-based concepts have led to the identification of radio-frequency (<b>RF)</b> generation and <b>acceleration</b> <b>systems</b> as capable of providing not only continuous thrust, but also controllable exhaust velocities, as required in maneuvering applications. The most interesting such studies for plasma propulsion are those focused on the possibility of coupling radio frequency power to plasma, exploiting the possibility of having very efficient devices to generate and heat the plasma, magnetically confining it in a trap in the heating region, so that ion can escape the magnetic trap only when they are energetic enough to be converted into direct out-going flow which provides the thrust. The structure of this system is therefore based on of three stages where plasma is respectively generated, heated and expanded in a magnetic nozzle. The heating stage acts as an amplifier; here plasma is heated by the radio frequency waves by the process of ion cyclotron resonance. It has been developed and tested a numerical tool for the electromagnetic modeling of the ICRF antenna, of the RF booster unit of plasma thrusters, and of the RF-plasma interactions. The latter is studied in the critical ICRF acceleration region by setting up a convenient Electromagnetic (EM) analytical and numerical model based on the Moment-Method solution of a suitable set of integral equations. Solution of the relevant integral equation directly provides the electric surface current density induced on antenna conductors, but the ultimate quantity to be computed is the circuit characterization (e. g. admittance matrix) at the input ports. © 2005 American Institute of Physic...|$|R
