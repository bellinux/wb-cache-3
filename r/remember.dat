25|$|Prospective {{memory is}} a form of memory that {{involves}} <b>remembering</b> to perform a planned action or recall a planned intention at some future point in time. Prospective memory tasks are common in daily life and range from the relatively simple to extreme life-or-death situations. Examples of simple tasks include <b>remembering</b> to put the toothpaste cap back on, <b>remembering</b> to reply to an email, or <b>remembering</b> to return a rented movie. Examples of highly important situations include a patient <b>remembering</b> to take medication or a pilot <b>remembering</b> to perform specific safety procedures during a flight.|$|R

5|$|For {{producing}} the new songs for the album, Madonna worked with David Foster and Nellee Hooper, the former {{known for his}} work with such artists as Barbra Streisand and Olivia Newton-John. Madonna stated that the concept for the album was to make fans and critics alike <b>remember</b> her music contributions rather than her media controversies. Something to <b>Remember</b> was well received by music critics who were impressed with Madonna's vocals and the album's cohesiveness. It was also a commercial success, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Finland, and Italy, and peaking within top ten elsewhere. In the United States, it reached number six on the Billboard 200 and was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of three million units. Worldwide, Something to <b>Remember</b> has sold over ten million copies.|$|E
40|$|Ten {{patients}} with {{mild to moderate}} Parkinson’s disease were compared with ten age-matched normal controls {{in a series of}} saccadic paradigms in order to test various hypotheses relating to the origin of the Parkinsonian saccadic defect. The paradigms comprised a reflex saccade paradigm, a standard <b>remembered</b> saccade paradigm, a <b>remembered</b> saccade paradigm with delayed centre-offset, and a <b>remembered</b> saccade paradigm with a second target flash immediately prior to saccade execution. Finally, subjects executed both reflex and <b>remembered</b> saccades in a standard <b>remembered</b> paradigm (the “twosaccade” paradigm). As has been reported previously, Parkinsonian subjects demonstrated hypometria on all <b>remembered</b> saccade paradigms, particularly the “two-saccade” paradigm. There was, however, {{no significant difference between the}} first three <b>remembered</b> saccade paradigms. These studies serve to refute a simple attentional capture hypothesis, and a hypothesis that suggests that the abnormality of <b>remembered</b> saccades is due to concurrent reflex saccade suppression. On the basis of the results, further hypotheses are advanced in an attempt to explain all published work on Parkinsonian saccades...|$|R

60|$|There is, of course, a {{difference}} between knowing the temporal relation of a <b>remembered</b> event to the present, and knowing the time-order of two <b>remembered</b> events.

It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present, {{but it is clear that}} such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating <b>remembered</b> events.|$|R
