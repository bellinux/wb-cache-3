40|$|Fractals are {{objects that}} are {{generally}} self similar at all scales. Coastlines, mountains, river systems, planetary orbits and some mathematical objects are all examples of fractals. Bruno et al. used the structured walk model of Richardson to establish that lava flows are fractals and that lava flow morphology could be determined {{by looking at the}} fractal dimension of flow margins. They determined that Hawaiian a. a flows have fractal dimensions that range from 1. 05 to 1. 09 and that the pahoehoe lava flows have a fractal dimension from 1. 13 to 1. 23. We have analyzed a number of natural and simulated lava flow margins and find that the fractal dimension varies according to the number and <b>length</b> of <b>rod</b> <b>lengths</b> used in the structured walk method. The potential variation we find in our analyses is sufficiently large so that unambiguous determination of lava flow morphology is problematic for some flows. We suggest that the structured walk method can provide meaningful fractal dimensions if <b>rod</b> <b>lengths</b> employed in the analysis provide a best-fit residual of greater than 0. 98, as opposed to the 0. 95 cutoff used in previous studies. We also find that the use of more than 4 <b>rod</b> <b>lengths</b> per analysis also reduces ambiguity in the results...|$|R

40|$|Many {{important}} quantitative parameters {{have been}} developed {{that relate to the}} rheology and eruption and emplacement mechanics of lavas. This research centers on developing additional, unique parameters, namely the fractal properties of lava flows, to add to this matrix of properties. There are several methods of calculating the fractal dimension of a lava flow margin. We use the 'structured walk' or 'divider' method. In this method, we measure the length of a given lava flow margin by walking <b>rods</b> of different <b>lengths</b> along the margin. Since smaller <b>rod</b> <b>lengths</b> transverse more smaller-scaled features in the flow margin, the apparent length of the flow outline will increase as the length of the measuring rod decreases. By plotting the apparent length of the flow outline {{as a function of the}} length of the measuring rod on a log-log plot, fractal behavior can be determined. A linear trend on a log-log plot indicates that the data are fractal. The fractal dimension can then be calculated from the slope of the linear least squares fit line to the data. We use this 'structured walk' method to calculate the fractal dimension of many lava flows using a wide range of <b>rod</b> <b>lengths,</b> from 1 / 8 to 16 meters, in field studies of the Hawaiian islands. We also use this method to calculate fractal dimensions from aerial photographs of lava flows, using lengths ranging from 20 meters to over 2 kilometers. Finally, we applied this method to orbital images of extraterrestrial lava flows on Venus, Mars, and the Moon, using <b>rod</b> <b>lengths</b> up to 60 kilometers...|$|R

50|$|The {{velocity}} maxima and minima do {{not occur}} at crank angles (A) of plus or minus 90°.

50|$|The {{strength}} of this imbalance is determined by 1. Reciprocating mass, 2. Ratio of connecting <b>rod</b> <b>length</b> to stroke, and 3. Acceleration of piston movement. So small displacement engines with light pistons show little effect, and racing engines use long connecting rods. However, the effect grows exponentially with crankshaft rotational speed.
