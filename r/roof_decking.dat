50|$|Traditionally most flat roofs in {{the western}} world make use of tar or asphalt more usually felt paper applied over <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> to keep a {{building}} watertight. The felt paper is in turn covered with a flood coat of bitumen (asphalt or tar) and then gravel to keep the sun's heat, UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation. <b>Roof</b> <b>decking</b> is usually of plywood, chipboard or OSB boards (OSB = Oriented Strand Board, also known as Sterling board) of around 18mm thickness, steel or concrete. The mopping of bitumen is applied in two or more coats (usually 3 or 4) as a hot liquid, heated in a kettle. A flooded coat of bitumen is applied over the felts and gravel is embedded in the hot bitumen.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{method of}} {{applying}} radiant {{barrier to the}} roof in new construction {{is to use a}} radiant barrier that is pre-laminated to OSB panels or roof sheathing.

50|$|OSB is a {{material}} with favorable mechanical properties {{that make it}} particularly suitable for load-bearing applications in construction. The most common uses are as sheathing in walls, flooring, and <b>roof</b> <b>decking.</b> For exterior wall applications, panels are available with a radiant-barrier layer pre-laminated to one side; this eases installation and increases energy performance of the building envelope. OSB also sees some use in furniture production.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} for a radiant barrier is as a facing for attics. For a traditional shingle roof, radiant barriers may be applied over the rafters or trusses and under the <b>roof</b> <b>decking.</b> This application method has the radiant barrier sheets draped over the trusses of rafters, creating a small air space above with the radiant barrier facing into the entire interior attic space below.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} {{maintaining}} flat roofs {{is that if}} water does penetrate the barrier covering (be it traditional or a modern membrane), it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building {{where it can be}} seen. Thus, {{it is not easy to}} find the source of the leak in order to repair it. Once underlying <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> is soaked, it often sags, creating more room for water to accumulate and further worsening the problem.|$|E

50|$|The natural {{materials}} {{of the region}} were indicative of the style: wood (in particular Douglas fir and red cedar), stone, plywood, wood-stud and post and beam construction with exposed <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> underside of roofs at ceilings and eaves. Connection of the interior to outdoor environment was continued in commercial developments such as the landscaped terraces atop government offices in Robson Square, the glass-roofed Law Courts, the planter-infused Evergreen Building, vine-covered Chan Centre for the Performing Arts, and the UBC Museum of Anthropology. Sidewalks along many shopping streets are covered with glass canopies, providing shelter from the rain but not blocking daylight. Later designs of high-rise residential towers followed this lead with large glass walls.|$|E
5000|$|The second tornadic {{supercell}} produced seven tornadoes. The {{first two}} tornadoes touched down near El Reno and caused no damage, earning ratings of F0. The third tornado touched down near Yukon but, {{as with the}} other two, caused no damage and was rated F0. A fourth tornado touched down over Lake Hefner in Oklahoma City, eventually causing damage to boats in a dry dock at the Oklahoma City Boat Club. Damage to club facilities and nearby boats was estimated at $250,000. The tornado went on to destroy a storage shed and cause minor roof damage to homes east of Lake Hefner Parkway before it dissipated, having caused only F1 damage. The fifth tornado (rated F1) materialized near NW 84th Street and Walker, going on to displace much of a house's <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> and uproot street signs. The tornado also damaged vehicles and caused roof damage to houses on 84th, 85th, 86th, 87th, and 88th Streets. The tornado destroyed the western half of a church in this area after it knocked down its walls on three sides and threw part of its roof at a house which resultantly suffered major damage. The sixth tornado, which was anticyclonic, affected the Northwest Oklahoma City/Nichols Hills area. It caused [...] "considerable" [...] damage to a strip mall, unroofed numerous houses, shattered windows, and damaged signs and powerlines. One building saw an exterior wall collapse. An RV was thrown into a house, a car flipped, trees were knocked down, and pieces of shingles and <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> were blown away. The tornado's ultimate rating of F2 was based on damage limited to a small area, and most damage was actually consistent with that of an F1 tornado.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Jesse Andrew Home is a two story Greek Revival {{structure}} {{located on}} the south side of West Lafayette, near the Purdue University campus. The home is basically an ell-shaped structure with a gable roof; a small, hip-roofed wing, possibly a later addition, projects from the rear facade. Constructed as a single-family residence in 1859, this structure was altered to provide two apartment units sometime in the 1930s. The main (east) facade of the home is a gable end wall three bays in width. On the ground floor level, the two southernmost bays contain two-over-two, double-hung windows with entablature hood molds. The third bay has been modified from the original configuration and now contains two separate entry doors, to provide private access to each of the apartments. A large wooden porch dating from the 1880s protects the ground floor level of this facade; this porch features square columns with molded capitals supporting a flat roof with a wide frieze decorated with dentils and a cyma recta cornice. The porch roof also serves as a deck for the second floor, and features a balustrade with simple square balusters and corner posts. On the second floor, the two exterior bays contain double-hung windows similar to those on the ground floor. The middle bay, located slightly south of center, originally contained a window, but was converted into a doorway in the 1880s to provide access to the porch roof deck. A raking cornice and frieze with returns decorates the gable area, and a triangular attic vent is located just below the gable peak. Window and cornice detailing throughout the rest of the house is similar to that employed on the main facade. The interior of the house was slightly modified when the house was divided into apartments in the 1930s. The walnut balustrade of the main stairway was removed and the stair enclosed with a partition wall in order to provide privacy for the upstairs apartment; the balustrade has been discovered in storage in the attic. The endwall fireplaces were also sealed at this time and remain inoperable. Asbestos shingle siding was applied to the exterior of the home sometime in the 1950s. The present owners, who purchased the home from the Andrew family in 1982, have recently completed a major renovation of the structure. Several termite-damaged structural members were replaced, and other floor joists were braced with concrete block piers. The <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> was repaired and a new roof installed. Repairs were also made at this time to the porch, windows, side door, exterior moldings, and various other elements of the home." ...|$|E

40|$|This Digest {{attempts}} to outline the principles involved in approaching {{the problem of}} dripping in curling rinks, and to discuss some of the methods {{that might lead to}} a solution. The analysis suggests that some means of introducing heat into the building is probably the most generally applicable and effective condensation control, particularly in the colder areas in Canada. In conjunction with heating, a roof deck having some thermal insulation value should be used for reasons of heat economy and to provide maximum ceiling surface temperatures. Ceiling finishes having water- absorbing characteristics offer considerable advantages over finishes incapable of taking up moisture. Wood <b>roof</b> <b>decking</b> is an ideal ceiling finish as it not only provides thermal insulation but is also capable of absorbing water.

40|$|The Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), {{with the}} support of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has {{investigated}} the thermal performance of solar absorbers which are an integral yet indistinguishable part of a building's roof. The first roof-integrated solar absorber (RISA) system was retrofitted into FSEC'S Flexible Roof Facility in Cocoa, Florida in September 1998. This "proof-of-concept" system uses the asphalt shingle roof surface and the plywood decking under the shingles as an unglazed solar absorber. The absorbed solar heat is then transferred to water that is circulated from a storage tank through polymer tubing attached to the underside of the <b>roof</b> <b>decking.</b> Data collected on this direct 3. 9 m) solar system for a period of 12 months indicates that it was able to provide an average of 3. 4 kWh per day of hot water energy to the storage tank under a 242 liters (64 gal) per day load. The RISA system's average annual solar conversion efficiency was also determined to be 8 percent, with daily efficiencies reaching a maximum of 13 percent. In addition, a thermal performance equation has been determined to characterize the Phase 1 RISA system's year-long efficiency under various ambient temperature, insolation, and wind speed conditions...|$|E
