5|$|In 1955, several {{customers}} {{asked if}} Phillips could make demo discs, so {{he bought a}} 1/4inch tape recorder (replaced in 1963 with a Vortexion portable), an MSS (Marguerite Sound Studios - after the owner's wife) disc cutting machine, an amplifier, a 4-track mixer, three microphones (a Reslo, an HMV <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone,</b> and an AKG), and three pairs of headphones for £400, while {{on a trip to}} London to visit his son Frank, who was there for a sound recording course at EMI Electronics.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> is an {{electrically}} simple {{design with}} no active circuitry; {{it is possible}} to build one from a kit, or with basic tools and materials. The acoustic complexity of ribbon microphones is comparable to other types of air coupled transducers.|$|E
25|$|The BBC-Marconi Type A was {{an iconic}} <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> {{produced}} by the BBC and Marconi between 1934 and 1959. Also of note is the ST Coles 4038 (or PGS – pressure gradient single), designed by the BBC in 1954 and still used for some applications to this day. Its historical uses varied from talks to symphony concerts, and it {{is regarded as a}} delicate, fine traditional microphone.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> {{were once}} {{delicate}} and expensive, but modern materials make certain present-day <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> very durable, {{and so they}} {{may be used for}} loud rock music and stage work. They are prized for their ability to capture high-frequency detail, comparing very favorably with condenser microphones, which can often sound subjectively [...] "aggressive" [...] or [...] "brittle" [...] in {{the high end of the}} frequency spectrum. Due to their bidirectional pick-up pattern, <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> are often used in pairs to produce the Blumlein Pair recording array. [...] In addition to the standard bidirectional pick-up pattern, <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> can also be configured to have cardioid, hypercardioid, omnidirectional, and variable polar patterns, although these configurations are much less common.|$|R
25|$|As many mixers are {{equipped}} with phantom power in order to enable the use of condenser microphones, care should be taken when using condenser and ribbon microphones at the same time. If the <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> is improperly wired, which is not unheard of with older microphones, this capacity can damage some ribbon elements; however, improvements in designs and materials have made those concerns largely inconsequential in modern ribbon microphones.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, when it {{was more}} common for {{electric}} recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era. Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, {{making it possible to}} improve the damping of spurious resonances. Crystal pickups were also introduced as lower cost alternatives. The dynamic or moving coil microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> in 1932. Both of these high quality microphones became widespread in motion picture, radio, recording, and public address applications.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Drs. Walter H. Schottky and Erwin Gerlach co-invented the first <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone.</b> By turning the ribbon circuit in the {{opposite}} direction, they also invented the first ribbon loudspeaker. A few years later, Dr. Harry F. Olson of RCA started developing ribbon microphones using ﬁeld coils and permanent magnets. The RCA Photophone Type PB-31 was commercially manufactured in 1931, greatly impacting the audio recording and broadcasting industries. Condenser microphones at the time could not compare to its frequency response. Radio City Music Hall employed PB-31s in 1932. The following year, the 44A came on the scene. Its tone and pattern control helped reduce reverberation. Many RCA ribbon models are still in use and valued by engineers.|$|E

5000|$|Royer Labs is a {{microphone}} company that some {{consider to be}} one of the foremost manufacturers of <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones.</b> The reasons most often cited for this opinion is that Royer has combined the traditional warmth of vintage <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> with modern output levels. While older <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> had a great sound, the ribbons were weak and would break easily. Royer microphones, however, are still strong enough to be placed in front of electric guitar amps, a placement that certain older ribbons could not have weathered.|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, Shure {{introduced}} the first mic in their KSM Series of premium recording microphones, the KSM32. KSM series microphones feature Class A discrete transformer-less preamplifiers. Ten {{years later in}} 2009, Shure acquired Crowley and Tripp <b>Ribbon</b> <b>Microphones</b> from Soundwave Research Laboratories of Ashland, Massachusetts, along with the company's proprietary [...] "Roswellite" [...] ribbon material, and added both <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones,</b> now rebranded the KSM353 and KSM313, to the KSM series.|$|R
500|$|To {{adjust to}} {{potential}} audio feedback and leakage and obtain a usable take, Chavarria tried having Badu sit in an overstuffed chair six feet behind the mixing console and use alternate microphones {{such as a}} Neumann M 269 or AEA R44 <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> with Sony MDR-V900 headphones into a Furman headphone mixer. However, Badu felt she could not perceive all of her voice's frequencies with the headphones and often discarded them to move towards the studio monitors. He also considered situating her in an equilateral triangle with the two speakers, one {{of which would be}} placed out of phase in order to have the leakage cancel itself. However, according to him, the mic has to be stationary, while Badu [...] "likes to hold the mic like an MC. She is at home as a live performer." [...] He said of working around audio spills and adapting to Badu's methods, [...] "We worked to make her vocals fit into the track, phase-wise ... What did work was to keep the monitors fairly low and turn the microphone out of phase, and we would move her around the room until she found a spot where the leakage was reasonable and where she felt comfortable and could hear herself. But just as often she would just sit in that chair behind the board in the A Room." ...|$|E
2500|$|A <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone,</b> {{also known}} as a ribbon {{velocity}} microphone, is a type of microphone that uses a thin aluminum, duraluminum or nanofilm of electrically conductive ribbon placed between the poles of a magnet to produce a voltage by electromagnetic induction. [...] Ribbon microphones are typically bidirectional, meaning that they pick up sounds equally well from either side of the microphone.|$|E
2500|$|Ribbon {{microphones}} use a thin, usually {{corrugated metal}} ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically {{connected to the}} microphone's output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones {{in the sense that}} both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a bi-directional (also called figure-eight, as in the diagram below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides. [...] Also, because the ribbon is much less mass it responds to the air velocity rather than the sound pressure. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. Crossed figure 8, or Blumlein pair, stereo recording is gaining in popularity, and the figure-eight response of a <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> is ideal for that application.|$|E

40|$|Traditional <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> {{cannot be}} {{miniaturized}} {{owing to the}} sensitivity of the microphone in proportion to its ribbon length. A novel symmetrical voice coil instead of the traditional ribbon is proposed, designed, and optimized. The new structure of <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> was fabricated by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, which allows increasing the effective coil length while reducing the diaphragm dimension. The obtained results present a voice coil length of 77. 5 mm under a limited ribbon length of 17 mm. Compared with the conventional <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> (with <b>ribbon</b> length 50 mm and voice coil length 50 mm), the diaphragm dimension was reduced but its effective length was increased by about 55 %, from 50 mm to 77. 5 mm. Moreover, the magnetic flux density in the air gap of the magnetic circuit by simulations and experiments is measured to be at 5. 1 and 5 kG, respectively.

5000|$|In a moving-coil microphone, the {{diaphragm}} {{is attached to}} a light movable coil that generates a voltage as it moves {{back and forth between the}} poles of a permanent magnet. In <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones,</b> a light metal ribbon is suspended between the poles of a magnet. As the ribbon vibrates, a voltage is induced at right angles to both the ribbon velocity and magnetic field direction and is picked off by contacts at the ends of the <b>ribbon.</b> <b>Ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> are also called [...] "velocity microphones" [...] because the induced voltage is proportional to the velocity of the ribbon and thus of the air particles in the sound wave, unlike in some other microphones where the voltage is proportional to the displacement of {{the diaphragm}} and the air.|$|R
2500|$|Also in 1923, the <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> was introduced, another {{electromagnetic}} type, {{believed to}} have been developed by Harry F. Olson, who essentially reverse-engineered a ribbon speaker. Over the years these microphones were developed by several companies, most notably RCA that made large advancements in pattern control, to give the microphone directionality. [...] With television and film technology booming there was demand for high fidelity microphones and greater directionality. Electro-Voice responded with their Academy Award-winning shotgun microphone in 1963.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> when introduced was that the light ribbon had a much higher natural resonant frequency than diaphragms in existing microphones, above hearing range, so it had flatter response at high frequencies. [...] The voltage output of older ribbon microphones is typically quite low compared to a dynamic moving coil microphone, and a step-up transformer is used to increase the voltage output and increase the output impedance. Modern ribbon microphones do not suffer from this problem due to improved magnets and more efficient transformers and have output levels that can exceed typical stage dynamic microphones.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong {{started to}} work at Connie's Inn in Harlem, chief rival to the Cotton Club, a venue for elaborately staged floor shows, and a front for gangster Dutch Schultz. Armstrong also had {{considerable}} success with vocal recordings, including versions of famous songs composed by his old friend Hoagy Carmichael. His 1930s recordings took {{full advantage of the}} new RCA <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone,</b> introduced in 1931, which imparted a characteristic warmth to vocals and immediately became an intrinsic part of the 'crooning' sound of artists like Bing Crosby. Armstrong's famous interpretation of Carmichael's [...] "Stardust" [...] {{became one of the most}} successful versions of this song ever recorded, showcasing Armstrong's unique vocal sound and style and his innovative approach to singing songs that had already become standards.|$|E
50|$|Mathus {{started his}} first studio in his mother's {{hometown}} of Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 2003. Using antique <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> and tube pre-amp, Mathus set up Delta Recording Service in the abandoned Alcazar Hotel in downtown Clarksdale and recorded hundreds of artists there, including Elvis Costello. In 2007, Mathus relocated {{the studio to}} Como, Mississippi.|$|R
5000|$|From 1964 Oktava began {{implementing}} a [...] "zero-defect" [...] production system, and their TM-4 miniature telephone and ML-16 <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> received state quality marks. During this period Oktava was providing equipment for Kremlin meeting rooms and Ostankino Technical Center, the state's biggest TV studio. Oktava loudspeakers were installed in large arenas and squares around the country.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>ribbon</b> and {{condenser}} <b>microphones</b> can be {{used for}} Blumlein pair recording. A few types of stereo <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> (B & O, Royer, AEA) have even been purpose-built for just this type of recording. Several types of stereo condenser microphone (Neumann, AKG, Schoeps) have also offered a Blumlein arrangement as one of their possible configurations. Individual mics with variable patterns (such as those from Pearl/Milab) {{can be used}}. The Soundfield microphone used to make Ambisonic recordings can be adjusted to mimic two microphones of any pattern at any angle to each other, including a Blumlein pair.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{directional}} {{patterns are}} produced by enclosing {{one side of the}} ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from [...] "figure-eight" [...] to [...] "unidirectional". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns, and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphone</b> designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, i.e., those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.|$|E

500|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{different}} types of microphone and there are correspondingly large differences in impedance between them. [...] They range from the very low impedance of <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> (can be less than one ohm) to the very large impedance of piezoelectric microphones which are measured in megohms. [...] The Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) has defined a number of standard microphone nominal impedances to aid categorisation of microphones.|$|R
5000|$|The {{material}} {{used in many}} <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> is aluminium leaf, or [...] "imitation silver leaf", as it {{is sometimes}} called. This is pure aluminium and is around 0.6 to 2.0 micrometres thick. It is virtually the same material that the BBC used on Coles ribbons, with the exception that they also hand beat the leaf even thinner. They did this by sandwiching the ribbon between toilet paper and beating with a ball-peen hammer. This [...] "cold forges" [...] the leaf. The aluminium leaf was then annealed for an hour in an oven to restore flexibility. Corrugations must also be imparted into the ribbon: Coles used 25 per inch (1 mm cycle). RCA 44BX has 19 corrugations per inch (0.7 mm cycle) and is around 50 mm long; RCA 77 has 13 corrugations per inch (0.5 mm cycle). RCA ribbon material is around 1 to 1.5 micrometres (0.00005 inch) thick. The new Nady ribbon plus AEA both state that they use 2 micrometre aluminium <b>ribbon</b> in their <b>microphones.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "Figure 8" [...] or {{bi-directional}} microphones receive sound equally {{from both}} {{the front and back}} of the element. Most <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> are of this pattern. [...] In principle they do not respond to sound pressure at all, only to the change in pressure between front and back; since sound arriving from the side reaches front and back equally there is no difference in pressure and therefore no sensitivity to sound from that direction. In more mathematical terms, while omnidirectional microphones are scalar transducers responding to pressure from any direction, bi-directional microphones are vector transducers responding to the gradient along an axis normal to the plane of the diaphragm. This also has the effect of inverting the output polarity for sounds arriving from the back side.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of {{microphones}} used in home studios: Condenser, dynamic and <b>ribbon.</b> Dynamic <b>microphones</b> {{are known for}} their use with recording distorted guitar, snares, and other loud instruments. The condenser microphone provides a warm sound and is commonly used for recording vocals and the acoustic guitar.|$|R
50|$|A ribbon tweeter uses a {{very thin}} {{diaphragm}} (often of aluminum, or perhaps metalized plastic film) that supports a planar coil frequently made by deposition of aluminium vapor, suspended in a powerful magnetic field (typically provided by neodymium magnets) to reproduce high frequencies. The development of ribbon tweeters has more or less followed the development of <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones.</b> The <b>ribbon</b> is of very lightweight material and so capable of very high acceleration and extended high frequency response. Ribbons have traditionally been incapable of high output (large magnet gaps leading to poor magnetic coupling is the main reason). But higher power versions of ribbon tweeters are becoming common in large-scale sound reinforcement line array systems, which can serve audiences of thousands. They are attractive in these applications since nearly all ribbon tweeters inherently exhibit useful directional properties, with very wide horizontal dispersion (coverage) and very tight vertical dispersion. These drivers can easily be stacked vertically, building a high frequency line array that produces high sound pressure levels much {{farther away from the}} speaker locations than do conventional tweeters.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{professional}} producers opt for {{a condenser}} microphone for studio recording, mostly due to their wide-range response and high quality. A primary alternative to the expensive condenser microphone is the dynamic microphone, used more often in live performances due to its durability. The major disadvantages of condenser microphones are their expense and fragility. Also, most condenser microphones require phantom power, unlike dynamic microphones. Conversely, the disadvantages of dynamic microphones are they do not generally possess the wide spectrum of condenser microphones and their frequency response is not as uniform. Many hip-hop producers typically used the Neumann U-87 for recording vocals which imparts a glassy [...] "sheen" [...] especially on female vocals. But today, many producers in this musical genre use the Sony C-800 tube microphone, vintage <b>microphones,</b> and high-end <b>ribbon</b> <b>microphones</b> tuned for flattering, [...] "big" [...] vocal expression.It {{should also be noted}} that many classic hip-hop songs were recorded with the most basic of equipment. In many cases this contributes to its raw sound quality, and charm.|$|R
