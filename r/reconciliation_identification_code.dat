40|$|In {{the case}} of {{ordinary}} <b>identification</b> <b>coding,</b> a code is devised to identify a single object among $N$ objects. But, in this paper, we consider an <b>identification</b> <b>coding</b> problem to identify $K$ objects at once among $N$ objects in the both cases that $K$ objects are ranked or not ranked. By combining Kurosawa-Yoshida scheme with Moulin-Koetter scheme, an efficient <b>identification</b> <b>coding</b> scheme is proposed, which can attain high coding rate and error exponents compared with the case that an ordinary <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> is used $K$ times. Furthermore, the achievable triplet of rate and error exponents of type I and type II decoding error probabilities are derived for the proposed coding scheme.

40|$|Packages {{have high}} {{rotation}} {{as they become}} municipal solid waste just after the consumption of the product. Therefore, packages should be labeled with identification of the material they are made of {{in order to help}} the recycling chain. Many products made from plastics show a resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> - usually from 1 to 7 inside a three-arrow triangle above a monogram - aimed at identifying the type of plastic the product is made of, and help its separation and later recycling. In other words, one aims to facilitate recovery of plastics discarded with the municipal solid waste. In this study we collected data on the resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> in flexible plastic packages to assess whether the guidelines for material identification are being followed. The data collection was performed in a total of 509 flexible plastic packages used for packing food and non-food products available in the Brazilian market. Even though the NBR 13230 Brazilian standard is already in its second revision, the resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> in plastic packages is still used in a very heterogeneous fashion. Approximately 50 % of the packages had the resin <b>identification</b> <b>code.</b> Up to 30 % of some packages showed incorrect material <b>identification</b> <b>code.</b> Therefore, misinformation still occurs in the Brazilian market concerning the type of material for plastic packaging - including lack of the resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> and incorrect form of <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> in the plastic packaging. Both of these problems have negative effects on the plastic recycling chain. We propose that other materials used in flexible plastic packages, e. g. aluminum foil, should also be identified, {{in order to make the}} separation and recycling easier...|$|R
