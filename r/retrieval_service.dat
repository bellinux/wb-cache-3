25|$|The {{introduction}} of electronic {{information in the}} last quarter of the twentieth century brought a new era of library operations and services, with the ability to access information resources beyond those available in the physical facility. As early as 1973, the Library began to take advantage of electronic information services by acquiring the New York Times Information Bank, the first computerized online information <b>retrieval</b> <b>service.</b> By the 1990s, the library was able to access thousands of U.S. and foreign newspapers and magazines, highly specialized biographic and subject information, and U.S. government and think tank documents through commercial and government databases. The development of the Department's Intranet on the Open Net system has made the resources of the library accessible to Department employees worldwide. The library's electronic catalog, new acquisitions lists, and connection to reference services are available on the Department's I-Net.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to identify and}} demonstrate the deficiencies, suggests the reasons for them, and propose amelioration, {{in the nature of}} record <b>retrieval</b> <b>services</b> given by the state institues in Turkey. It is the contention of this study (its hypotheses) that the major deficiencies in records <b>retrieval</b> <b>services</b> are basicly by product of existing system of archival applications in these institutions that are not based on the modern tecniques and methods, The method chosen for this study is descriptive method. The data to test our hypotheses has been obtained from three official institutions by participatory observation. In conclusion, it has been observed that; - There is a casual relationship between the records retrieval and retrieval apparatus, - The methods and tecniques used, in applications are either incompatible or insuffucient, - From the viewpoint of methods and tecniques applied, the problem is condensed in preparing the means of record retrieval, in filing and in arragement, - Studies toward computerasztion is still in preparatory stage, - The institutions concerned fail to possess the organized structure and the archival system for effective record <b>retrieval</b> <b>services.</b> In order to unravel the strands in the observed inadequecies in the record <b>retrieval</b> <b>services</b> of the state institutions. This study suggests that, - An organized structure should be implemented for archives, - The modern methods andtechniques related to archives should be used in applications, - Computerised method should be preferred to manual method in order to provide economy and efficiency, in the archival applications and services...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{many health}} systems, {{specialist}} services for critically ill children are typically regionalised or centralised. Studies {{have shown that}} high-risk paediatric patients have improved survival when managed in specialist centres and that volume of cases is a predictor of care quality. In acute cases where distance and time impede access to specialist care, clinical advice may be provided remotely by telephone. Emergency <b>retrieval</b> <b>services,</b> attended by medical and nursing staff {{may be used to}} transport patients to specialist centres. Even with the best quality <b>retrieval</b> <b>services,</b> stabilisation of the patient and transport logistics may delay evacuation to definitive care. Several studies have examined the use of telemedicine for providing specialist consultations for critically ill children. However, no studies have yet formally examined the clinical effectiveness and economic implications of using telemedicine in the context of paediatric patient retrieval...|$|R
