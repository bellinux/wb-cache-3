40|$|In March 2017 the neotype {{specimen}} of the Early Jurassic South African prosauropod dinosaur Massospondylus carinatus was appraised and condition {{reported at the}} Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the Witwatersrand (WITS), Johannesburg, in readiness for remedial conservation and <b>re-storage.</b> The work was necessitated by deterioration of the specimen, which was caused by handling {{over a number of}} years and an inadequate and failing support mount. Formally numbered BP/ 1 / 4934, but more affectionately known to staff as ‘Big Momma’, the specimen was contained within several individual blocks on flimsy support bases and presented various conservation challenges. These included treatment of fractures and cracking across several surfaces of the fossil and the production of clam shell supports to allow for articulated display within the constraints of an existing display cabinet. Part of the brief was to facilitate safer handling and access for researchers. This project was led by the author who also trained the curatorial and preparation staff at WITS in the methods and techniques employed. The visit was funded by the Palaeontological Scientific Trust (PAST), the DST/NRF Centre of Excellence in Palaeosciences and The University of the Witwatersrand (WITS) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Seed {{pieces of}} {{different}} potato cultivars and advanced breeding lines (ABLs) from north central US breeding programmes were inoculated with different genotypes of Phytophthora infestans (US- 1, US- 1. 7, US- 8, US- 11 and US- 14). The {{effect of these}} genotypes of P. infestans on seed piece rot severity after <b>re-storage</b> was assessed using an image analysis technique. P. infestans genotypes demonstrat-ed variable ability to cause seed piece rot and to reduce plant emergence measured as final plant stand (%) and the relative area under the plant emergence curve (RAUEPC). The US- 8 genotype of P. infestans was the most aggressive genotype, as indicated by tuber rot severity across all cultivars/ABLs tested, followed by US- 14 in both years. The US- 1, US- 1. 7 and US- 11 genotypes were the least aggressive, causing only moderate seed piece rotting across cultivars/ABLs tested. Similar trends were observed in two field experiments, where the US- 8 and US- 14 genotypes delayed or reduced emergence. Values of final plant stand (%) and RAUEPC demonstrated that the cultivars/ABLs Atlantic, MSJ 453 - 4 Y and Torridon were the least susceptible across all P. infestans genotypes. In both experiments cv. Pike was the most susceptible. Other cultivars/ABLs demonstrated variabl...|$|E
40|$|The {{charge pattern}} {{produced}} by {{atomic force microscopy}} on an insulating surface can be detected on the nanoscale using Kelvin probe force microscopy. Recent applications of charge patterns include data storage, nano-xerography, and charge writing. At present, ongoing development of this technology is being restricted by a poor understanding of the charge modification and erasure mechanisms. In this study, modification and erasure of charge patterns are achieved by applying oppositely polarized pulses to an insulating surface. The effects of the oppositely polarized pulse height and width on the charge erasure behavior are examined, and the charge injection and erasure processes are compared. Hence, it is demonstrated that the charges on the patterned surface can be neutralized by adjusting {{the height and width}} of the oppositely polarized pulse appropriately. In addition, charge injection and erasure mechanisms are proposed. It is suggested that application of an oppositely polarized pulse to the insulating surface causes injection of opposite charges into the surface and removal of the initial charges, both of which occur simultaneously. The findings of this work provide a means of achieving data <b>re-storage</b> or data modification, for which charge spot erasure is essential. In addition, the findings may have general implications for the development of nano-xerography, charge writing, nano-lithography, etc...|$|E
40|$|Effects of alpha-human atrial natriuretic {{polypeptide}} (alpha-HANP) on {{electrical and}} mechanical properties of smooth muscle {{cells of the}} guinea-pig and rabbit renal arteries and of the guinea-pig mesenteric artery were investigated. alpha-HANP (up to 10 nM) modified neither the membrane potential nor resistance of smooth muscle cells of the guinea-pig and rabbit renal arteries. In the guinea-pig mesenteric and renal arteries, alpha-HANP (up to 10 nM) {{had no effect on}} the amplitude and facilitation (mesenteric artery) or depression (renal artery) of excitatory junction potentials nor on action potentials. In the guinea-pig renal artery, alpha-HANP (up to 10 nM) had no effect on the depolarization induced by noradrenaline (NA) (up to 10 microM) but markedly inhibited NA-induced contraction. alpha-HANP (10 nM) slightly inhibited the K-induced contraction. In the rabbit renal artery, alpha-HANP (10 nM) inhibited the NA-induced contraction {{and to a lesser extent}} the K-induced contraction. In the rabbit renal artery, the effects of alpha-HANP on the release of Ca from the cellular storage by two applications of NA, and its <b>re-storage,</b> were investigated in Ca-free solution containing 2 mM-EGTA. When 5 nM-alpha-HANP was applied before and during the first application of 0. 5 microM-NA, the contraction was markedly inhibited but the contraction to a second application of 10 microM-NA was potentiated. If the first dose of NA was 10 microM the effect was very small. Under the same experimental procedures, nitroglycerine (10 microM) showed almost the same effects as alpha-HANP on the NA-induced contractions. When both the first (3 mM) and second (10 mM) contractions were evoked by caffeine in Ca-free solution, alpha-HANP (5 nM) and nitroglycerine (10 microM) inhibited both contractions to the same extent. In the rabbit renal artery, applications of alpha-HANP or nitroglycerine increased the amount of guanosine 3 ', 5 '-phosphate (cyclic GMP) in a dose-dependent manner. However, a much higher concentration of nitroglycerine was required (2 X 10 (3) times). In the rabbit renal artery, hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PI-P 2) activated by 0. 5 microM-NA was inhibited by alpha-HANP, in a dose-dependent manner, but activation by 10 microM-NA was not inhibited by alpha-HANP (up to 100 nM).

40|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} Human {{use of land}} areas leads to impacts on nature in several ways. Within the {{framework}} of the UNEP-SETAC Life-Cycle Initiative, it was stated that LCA of land use should assess at least the impact on biodiversity, the impact on biotic production and the impact on the regulating functions of the natural environment. This study focuses on the climatic impact of land use, as determined by the CO 2 transfers between vegetation/soil and the atmosphere in the course of terrestrial release and <b>re-storage</b> of carbon. Materials and methods Compared with the potential natural vegetation as a baseline, areas getting transformed by man (land transformations) as well as areas forced to maintain their existing non-natural state (land occupa-tions) may store reduced amounts of carbon in soil and vegetation, whereby the mobilized carbon is essentially transferred to the atmosphere in form of CO 2, contributing to global warming. The size of this climatic impact is determined by the amount of carbon transferred per hectare, {{as well as by the}} duration of the carbon's stay in air. Generally, we consider this duration as limited by spontaneous reversal of vegetation and soil towards a more natural form as soon as human land use ends. Taking the mean stay in air of 1 ton carbon from fossil fuel com-bustion as a basis of comparison, 1 ton carbon released by e. g. a forest-to-cropland transformation can be ade-quately weighted by considering the timing of carbon backflow from air to the spontaneously re-growing forest. Results Carbon transfers to the air per hectare, as well as durations of carbon stay in air, are made available for the most important types of land transformation and land occupation, for locations in each of the terrestrial bi-omes of tropical forest, temperate forest, boreal forest, tropical grassland and temperate grassland. The carbon quantities are expressed as 'fossil-combustion-equivalent' tons of carbon so that they can be summed up with carbon amounts from fossil fuel combustion into the usual indicator for global warming potential. Discussion The results confirm that on a per hectare basis, transforming forests into cropland has a more serious climatic effect than continuing to occupy land as cropland for one additional year. But on a global basis, main-taining current cropland areas for one additional year is a serious driver of global warming, exceeding by far the contribution of the current annual rate of forest-to-cropland transformations. Further, forest-to-cropland trans-formations cause roughly similar carbon transfers to air per hectare in tropical, temperate or boreal zones, but due to slow forest restoration, transformation of boreal forests has a stronger influence on global warming. Conclusions and recommendations With the results of this study, impact assessment of land use with respect to global warming is feasible for LCA practice worldwide. Together with the two separate studies covering the impacts of land use on biodiversity and on biotic production, a tool will be available for a reasonably complete assessment of land use at global level.
