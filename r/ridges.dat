5|$|Oceanic crust, {{which forms}} {{the bedrock of}} abyssal plains, is {{continuously}} being created at mid-ocean <b>ridges</b> (a type of divergent boundary) by {{a process known as}} decompression melting. Plume-related decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the Hawaiian islands, as well as the ocean crust at mid-ocean <b>ridges.</b> This phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and oceanic plateaus (two types of large igneous provinces). Decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma as it moves upwards under mid-ocean <b>ridges.</b> This upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new oceanic crust. Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate, usually associated with seafloor spreading. The age of oceanic crust is therefore a function of distance from the mid-ocean ridge. The youngest oceanic crust is at the mid-ocean <b>ridges,</b> and it becomes progressively older, cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid-ocean <b>ridges</b> as part of the process called mantle convection.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{members of the}} genus Mammuthus are the African species M. subplanifrons from the Pliocene, and M. africanavus from the Pleistocene. The former {{is thought to be}} the {{ancestor}} of later forms. Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years ago. The earliest European mammoth has been named M. rumanus; it spread across Europe and China. Only its molars are known, which show that it had 8–10 enamel <b>ridges.</b> A population evolved 12–14 <b>ridges,</b> splitting off from and replacing the earlier type, becoming M. meridionalis about 2–1.7 million years ago. In turn, this species was replaced by the steppe mammoth (M. trogontherii) with 18–20 <b>ridges,</b> which evolved in eastern Asia around 1 million years ago. The Columbian mammoth evolved from a population of M. trogontherii that had crossed the Bering Strait and entered North America about 1.5 million years ago; it retained a similar number of molar <b>ridges.</b> Mammoths derived from M. trogontherii evolved molars with 26 <b>ridges</b> 400,000 years ago in Siberia and became the woolly mammoth. Woolly mammoths entered North America about 100,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7.5–9 by 6.5–7.5µm, with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. Their surfaces are ornamented with warts and short <b>ridges</b> {{that do not}} form a reticulum (a network of raised net-like <b>ridges</b> on the surface), with <b>ridges</b> up to 1.0µm high. The spores are hyaline (translucent), and amyloid—they absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 42 by 9µm. The cap cuticle is a modified ixotrichoderm, meaning that the hyphae are embedded in a slimy or gelatinous layer.|$|E

5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic <b>ridges,</b> is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading <b>ridges</b> are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading <b>ridges</b> are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the finger and palm <b>ridge</b> counts on both hands in a representative group of healthy Bulgarian men. Object of the study are the dermatoglyphic prints from both hands of 1161 healthy men from 116 settlements in the country. The analysis includes: <b>ridge</b> counts on each finger, summary finger <b>ridge</b> count for both hands separately, total finger <b>ridge</b> count; <b>ridge</b> count on each interdigital area, summary palm <b>ridge</b> count for both hands separately, total palm <b>ridge</b> count. The descendent formula of finger <b>ridge</b> count is identical for both hands – I>IV>V>III>II. Considerably higher is the mean summary finger <b>ridge</b> count in right. The distribution of individuals according to summary <b>ridge</b> count in right and left, as well as the total finger <b>ridge</b> count is asymmetrical, moved in left. The palm <b>ridge</b> count is biggest between digital triradii a-b, followed by c-d and b-c. The summary palm <b>ridge</b> count a-d is higher on right hand. The distribution of the individuals after summary palm <b>ridge</b> count a-d in right and left, as well as the total palm <b>ridge</b> count is almost symmetrical, slightly moved in left...|$|R
5|$|On {{the inner}} {{surface of the}} nasal section of skull are <b>ridges</b> called nasoturbinals, which may have {{supported}} cartilage that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, the layer of tissue that detects odors. These <b>ridges</b> are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness because they may have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, the nasal cavity of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E

5|$|The {{expanded}} surface coverage {{provided by}} Cassini has {{allowed for the}} identification of additional regions of smooth plains, particularly on Enceladus's leading hemisphere (the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of motion as it orbits Saturn). Rather than being covered in low-relief <b>ridges,</b> this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and <b>ridges,</b> similar to the deformation seen in the south polar region. This area is {{on the opposite side}} of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar Planitiae, suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn's tides on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|The front root {{is larger}} than the back one. In side view, the upper and back margins are straight, but the front margin is convex. There are eight cusps {{arranged}} in a row on the upper margin, the first of which is located about one third of the tooth's length from the front margin. Only the last is slightly worn, indicating that the tooth is from a young animal. Long <b>ridges</b> extend from the cusps diagonally toward the front on both the lingual and labial (outer) sides of the tooth. The first seven <b>ridges</b> on both sides are connected to the respective cusps, but the eighth <b>ridges</b> do not quite reach their cusp. On both sides of the tooth, there is also a small ridge behind the eighth ridge that extends to the back margin; these <b>ridges</b> are called the posterolabial and posterolingual ridge. An even smaller ridge is located below the ridge on the lingual side.|$|E

5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of <b>ridges</b> on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals.

5|$|The second main terrain type—ridged terrain—comprises {{bands of}} <b>ridges</b> and troughs {{hundreds}} of kilometers in extent. It bounds the cratered terrain and cuts it into polygons.

The bands of ridged terrain often form continuations of canyons, suggesting {{that they may be}} a modified form of the graben or the result of a different reaction of the crust to the same extensional stresses, such as brittle failure.|$|E

The <b>ridges</b> would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over the <b>ridges</b> and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|E
