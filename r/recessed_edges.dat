Five residential wings are lined to the south giving a clear view to the landscape in the north. The course follows the terrain profile and thus has a slope of five meters.

Meyer created not only a development, but also a public space {{that can be used}} in rainy weather as a movement zone. Each housing unit had a colour (e.g. red) assigned to each floor and was then differentiated further once on the floor (e.g., carmine, vermilion, pink).|$|E
40|$|Vacuum glazing {{is a form}} of low-conductance {{double glazing}} using in {{internal}} vacuum between the two glass sheets to eliminate heat transport by gas conduction and convection. An array of small support pillars separates the sheets; fused solder glass forms the edge seal. Heat transfer through the glazing occurs by radiation across the vacuum gap, conduction through the support pillars, and conduction through the bonded edge seal. Edge conduction is problematic because it affects stresses in the edge region, leading to possible failure of the glazing; in addition, excessive heat transfer because of thermal bridging in the edge region can lower overall window thermal performance and decrease resistance to condensation. Infrared thermography was used to analyze the thermal performance of prototype vacuum glazings, and, for comparison, atmospheric pressure superwindows. Research focused on mitigating the edge effects of vacuum glazings through the use of insulating trim, <b>recessed</b> <b>edges,</b> and framing materials. Experimentally validated finite-element and finite-difference modeling tools were used for thermal analysis of prototype vacuum glazing units and complete windows. Experimental measurements of edge conduction using infrared imaging were found to be in good agreement with finite-element modeling results for a given set of conditions. Finite-element modeling validates an analytic model developed for edge conduction...|$|E
50|$|The variant {{was based}} on a prop owned by screenwriter Terry Nation which had been used in the second Doctor Who film. The neck bin mesh, struts and neck rings were removed, the latter items being {{replaced}} by new rings having a flat, <b>recessed</b> <b>edge</b> detailed with small rivets rather than the usual bevel. Lilac dome lights shaped like upturned jam jars were fitted, together with an eyeball resembling a flashlight which lit up when it spoke. It was painted in gloss black with yellow-gold hemispheres, slats, neck rings and dome. It is uncertain who carried out the conversion work, although the painting of the prop was undertaken by the BBC Visual Effects Department under the direction of Clifford Culley.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} performance of deep/shallow recessed hybrid bearing. It is intended that, {{on the basis of the}} numerical results drawn from this study, appropriate shallow recess depth and width can be determined for use in the bearing design process. By adopting bulk flow theory, the turbulent Reynolds equation and energy equation are modified and solved numerically including concentrated inertia effects at the <b>recess</b> <b>edge</b> with different depth and width of shallow recess. The results indicate that the load capacity, drag torque increases as the depth of shallow recess is shallower and the width ratio (half angle of deep recess versus half angle of shallow recess) is smaller. In contrast, the flow rate decreases as the depth of shallow recess is shallower and the width ratio is smaller. Nevertheless, the appropriate design of the depth and width of shallow recess might well induce the performance of high-speed deep/shallow recessed hybrid bearing...|$|R

This surface is {{surrounded}} by a chip patterned band, even on the handle. The area inside this band is filled with a pattern of interwoven spirals. A single large spiral in the centre is connected by double strands to seven medium-sized spirals surrounding it. These seven spirals are surrounded by an outer row of fourteen yet smaller spirals. Each of the seven medium spirals are connected to two of their neighbours and to three of the spirals in the outer row. The spirals on the outer edge are each connected to their two neighbours and are formed of three or four spirals, depending on whether they are linked to {{one or two of the}} medium-sized spirals.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{comprehensive}} time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) evaluation of recessed-gate devices with five different AlGaN barrier thicknesses with characteristics {{ranging from a}} D-mode MIS-HEMT to an E-mode MIS-FET. First, the fitted parameter beta (the slope of the Weibull distribution) was smaller for a deeper recessed gate and larger for a thicker gate dielectric. Secondly, the extrapolated V-G (criterium of 0. 01 % failures after 20 years) for the devices with Wg (gate width) = 10 mu m was lower when less AlGaN barrier remains under the gate. However, the extrapolated VG was increased when the AlGaN barrier was completely removed. Thirdly, a deeper recessed gate {{could result in a}} dominant percolation path due to a thinner gate dielectric on the sidewall of the gate <b>recess</b> <b>edge.</b> Fourthly, the Weibull distribution could scale with the gate width, indicating an intrinsic failure. Finally, the lifetime was extrapolated to 0. 01 % of failures for W-g= 36 mm at 150 degrees C after 20 years by fitting the data with a power law or an exponential law to gate voltages of 4. 9 V and 7. 2 V, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A bulk-flow {{analysis}} and computer program for prediction of the static load performance and dynamic force coefficients of angled injection, orifice-compensated hydrostatic/hydrodynamic thrust bearings have been completed. The {{product of the}} research is an efficient computational tool {{for the design of}} high-speed thrust bearings for cryogenic fluid turbopumps. The study addresses the needs of a growing technology that requires of reliable fluid film bearings to provide the maximum operating life with optimum controllable rotordynamic characteristics at the lowest cost. The motion of a cryogenic fluid on the thin film lands of a thrust bearing is governed by a set of bulk-flow mass and momentum conservation and energy transport equations. Mass flow conservation and a simple model for momentum transport within the hydrostatic bearing recesses are also accounted for. The bulk-flow model includes flow turbulence with fluid inertia advection, Coriolis and centrifugal acceleration effects on the bearing recesses and film lands. The cryogenic fluid properties are obtained from realistic thermophysical equations of state. Turbulent bulk-flow shear parameters are based on Hirs' model with Moody's friction factor equations allowing a simple simulation for machined bearing surface roughness. A perturbation analysis leads to zeroth-order nonlinear equations governing the fluid flow for the thrust bearing operating at a static equilibrium position, and first-order linear equations describing the perturbed fluid flow for small amplitude shaft motions in the axial direction. Numerical solution to the zeroth-order flow field equations renders the bearing flow rate, thrust load, drag torque and power dissipation. Solution to the first-order equations determines the axial stiffness, damping and inertia force coefficients. The computational method uses well established algorithms and generic subprograms available from prior developments. The Fortran 9 O computer program hydrothrust runs on a Windows 95 /NT personal computer. The program, help files and examples are licensed by Texas A&M University Technology License Office. The study of the static and dynamic performance of two hydrostatic/hydrodynamic bearings demonstrates the importance of centrifugal and advection fluid inertia effects for operation at high rotational speeds. The first example considers a conceptual hydrostatic thrust bearing for an advanced liquid hydrogen turbopump operating at 170, 000 rpm. The large axial stiffness and damping coefficients of the bearing should provide accurate control and axial positioning of the turbopump and also allow for unshrouded impellers, therefore increasing the overall pump efficiency. The second bearing uses a refrigerant R 134 a, and its application in oil-free air conditioning compressors is of great technological importance and commercial value. The computed predictions reveal that the LH 2 bearing load capacity and flow rate increase with the recess pressure (i. e. increasing orifice diameters). The bearing axial stiffness has a maximum for a recess pressure rati of approx. 0. 55. while the axial damping coefficient decreases as the recess pressure ratio increases. The computer results from three flow models are compared. These models are a) inertialess, b) fluid inertia at <b>recess</b> <b>edges</b> only, and c) full fluid inertia at both <b>recess</b> <b>edges</b> and film lands. The full inertia model shows the lowest flow rates, axial load capacity and stiffness coefficient {{but on the other hand}} renders the largest damping coefficients and inertia coefficients. The most important findings are related to the reduction of the outflow through the inner radius and the appearance of subambient pressures. The performance of the refrigerant hybrid thrust bearing is evaluated at two operating speeds and pressure drops. The computed results are presented in dimensionless form to evidence consistent trends in the bearing performance characteristics. As the applied axial load increases, the bearing film thickness and flow rate decrease while the recess pressure increases. The axial stiffness coefficient shows a maximum for a certain intermediate load while the damping coefficient steadily increases. The computed results evidence the paramount of centrifugal fluid inertia at low recess pressures (i. e. low loads), and where there is actually an inflow through the bearing inner diameter, accompanied by subambient pressures just downstream of the bearing <b>recess</b> <b>edge.</b> These results are solely due to centrifugal fluid inertia and advection transport effects. Recommendations include the extension of the computer program to handle flexure pivot tilting pad hybrid bearings and the ability to calculate moment coefficients for shaft angular misalignments...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{investigation was}} carried out in the Merril Wind Tunnel at the California Institute of Technology to determine the effect on low speed lift of retracting the leading edge of a thin, circular-arc airfoil. Several configurations were tried, some with a spanwise slot milled into the upper surface so that the leading <b>edge</b> <b>recess</b> formed by retraction could be utilized as an air intake to improve the flow. A comparison was made between the configurations with the leading edge retracted to various positions and the basic airfoil. The investigation showed that leading edge retraction caused a linear loss of maximum lift proportional to the percent reduction in chord up to a critical position where lift and the stalling angle of attack increased abruptly. Thereafter, maximum lift was reduced at a rate higher than the chord reduction. The effect of the slot was negligible. The critical position phenomenon warrants further study...|$|R

50|$|Printing a {{photogravure}} {{is similar}} to printing any other intaglio plate, especially a finely etched aquatint. A stiff, oily intaglio printing ink {{is applied to the}} whole surface of the plate with a rubber brayer, or a small, stiff squeegee, or a rolled tamper. The plate is then gently wiped with tarlatans to remove the excess ink and drive it into the recesses (wells). It is finally wiped with the fatty part of the palm of the hand in quick glancing strokes. This removes all remaining ink from the polished highlights and high points and leaves ink only in the etched <b>recesses.</b> After the <b>edges</b> are cleaned, the plate is placed on the printing bed of an intaglio press. It is covered with a sheet of dampened rag paper and then two to three layers of thin wool blankets. It is then run through the press at high pressure. The high pressure pushes the fibers of the dampened paper into the wells of the plate which then transfers the ink onto the paper thereby creating the impression. The paper is carefully peeled off the plate and placed between blotters and weighted so it will dry flat. The plate can now be re-inked for another impression or it can be cleaned for storage.|$|R

The method comprises forming recesses with an electromagnetic radiation emitted by a laser light source at a surface of a substrate (1) from a polymeric material, and coating the recesses from a polymeric material formed on the surface of the substrate and/or a layer from an electrical conductive material.; The recesses form a regular array of structural elements at the respective surface of the substrate, before further layers are formed for forming organic light emitting diodes or organic photovoltaic elements on the surface of the substrate or a multilayer structure is connected for the organic light emitting diodes or organic photovoltaic elements with the substrate. The radiation emitted by the laser light source: is directed with local varying intensity, focus, power, polarization, pulse rate/pulse length and/or with different wavelengths on the surface of the substrate so that a local varying material removal and/or recast takes place for forming the recesses; is radiated by a microlens array; and is divided into partial laser beams, where the emitted radiation is focused on a plane that coincides with the plane of the surface of the substrate and is arranged in radiation direction before or after the plane of the surface of the substrate. An irradiation of the emitted radiation takes place from the laser light source in such a way that the laser partial beams in an overlay area are brought under predefined/angle to interference. The substrate is positioned with the respective surface at a predefined position in the overlay area. The laser partial beams are generated by a beam splitter from an individual laser beam emitted from the laser light source, and are guided using a beam deflector into the overlay area.

The recesses are formed so that a distance between neighboring recesses and/or a periodicity of the recess structure in the plane of the surface of the substrate is 100 nm and 300 mu m. A depth expansion of the recesses to the plane is 10 nm and 50 mu m. A lateral expansion of the recesses in the plane of the substrate is 25 nm and 250 mu m. An aspect ratio of the depth expansion and the lateral expansion is 0. 3 - 3.
