40|$|Abstract Background Following the {{introduction}} of a computerised diabetes register in part of the northeast of England, care initially improved but then plateaued. We therefore enhanced the existing diabetes register to address these problems. The aim of the trial was to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of an area wide 'extended,' computerised diabetes register incorporating a full structured recall and management system, including individualised patient management prompts to primary care clinicians based on locally-adapted, evidence-based guidelines. Methods The study design was a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial, with the general practice as the unit of <b>randomisation.</b> <b>Set</b> in 58 general practices in three Primary Care Trusts in the northeast of England, the study outcomes were the clinical process and outcome variables held on the diabetes register, patient-reported outcomes, and service and patient costs. The effect of the intervention was estimated using generalised linear models with an appropriate error structure. To allow for the clustering of patients within practices, population averaged models were estimated using generalized estimating equations. Results Patients in intervention practices {{were more likely to have}} at least one diabetes appointment recorded (OR 2. 00, 95 % CI 1. 02, 3. 91), to have a recording of a foot check (OR 1. 87, 95 % CI 1. 09, 3. 21), have a recording of receiving dietary advice (OR 2. 77, 95 % CI 1. 22, 6. 29), and have a recording of blood pressure (BP) (OR 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 06, 4. 36). There was no difference in mean HbA 1 c or BP levels, but the mean cholesterol level in patients from intervention practices was significantly lower (- 0. 15 mmol/l, 95 % CI - 0. 25, - 0. 06). There were no differences in patient-reported outcomes or in patient-reported use of drugs, or uptake of health services. The average cost per patient was not significantly different between the intervention and control groups. Costs incurred in administering the system at the register and in general practice were in addition to these. Conclusion This study has shown benefits from an area-wide, computerised diabetes register incorporating a full structured recall and individualised patient management system. However, these benefits were achieved at a cost. In future, these costs may fall as electronic data exchange becomes a reliable reality.

Secondly, to evaluate the effect of patients' preferences on outcome. Design Non-inferiority randomised controlled trial eliciting preferences independently of <b>randomisation.</b> <b>Setting</b> Physiotherapy departments in a community setting in Yorkshire and north Lincolnshire. Participants 268 patients (mean age 48 years) with subacute and chronic neck pain, who were referred by their general practitioner and randomly assigned to a brief physiotherapy intervention (one to three sessions) using cognitive behaviour principles to encourage self management and return to normal function or usual physiotherapy, at the discretion of the physiotherapist concerned. Main outcome measures The Northwick Park neck pain questionnaire (NPQ), a specific measure of functional disability resulting from neck pain. Also, the short form 36 (SF- 36) questionnaire, a generic, health related, quality of life measure; and the Tampa scale for kinesophobia, a measure of fear and avoidance of movement.

40|$|Objective To {{examine whether}} {{students}} use or avoid newly shaded areas created by shade sails installed at schools. Design Cluster {{randomised controlled trial}} with secondary schools as the unit of <b>randomisation.</b> <b>Setting</b> 51 secondary schools with limited available shade, in Australia, assessed over two spring and summer terms. Participants Students outside at lunch times. Intervention Purpose built shade sails were installed in winter 2005 at full sun study sites to increase available shade for students in the school grounds. Main outcome measure Mean number of students using the primary study sites during weekly observations at lunch time. Results Over the study period the mean change in students using the primary study site from pre-test to post-test was 2. 63 (95 % confidence interval 0. 87 to 4. 39) students in intervention schools and – 0. 03 (– 1. 16 to 1. 09) students in control schools. The difference in mean change between groups was 2. 67 (0. 65 to 4. 68) students (P= 0. 011). Conclusions Students used rather than avoided newly shaded areas provided by purpose built shade sails at secondary schools in this trial, suggesting a practical means of reducing adolescents’ exposure to ultraviolet radiation.

Design Randomised controlled trial with general practices as the unit of randomisation and analysis. Clinicians and researchers were blinded to group allocation until after <b>randomisation.</b> <b>Setting</b> 68 general practices with about 480 [*] 000 patients in Wales, United Kingdom. Participants 34 practices were randomised to receive the educational programme and 34 practices to be controls. 139 clinicians from the intervention practices and 124 from control practices had agreed to participate before randomisation. Practice level data covering all the clinicians in the 68 practices were analysed. Interventions Intervention practices followed the Stemming the Tide of Antibiotic Resistance (STAR) educational programme, which included a practice based seminar reflecting on the practices’ own dispensing and resistance data, online educational elements, and practising consulting skills in routine care. Control practices provided usual care. Main outcome measures Total numbers of oral antibiotic items dispensed for all causes per 1000 practice patients in {{the year after the}} intervention, adjusted for the previous year’s dispensing. Secondary outcomes included reconsultations, admissions to hospital for selected causes, and costs.

Design Stratified cluster randomised controlled trial with clubs as the unit of <b>randomisation.</b> <b>Setting</b> 230 Swedish football clubs (121 in the intervention group, 109 in the control group) were followed for one season (2009, seven months). Participants 4564 players aged 12 - 17 years (2479 in the intervention group, 2085 in the control group) completed the study. Intervention 15 minute neuromuscular warm-up programme (targeting core stability, balance, and proper knee alignment) to be carried out twice a week throughout the season. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was rate of anterior cruciate ligament injury; secondary outcomes were rates of severe knee injury (> 4 weeks' absence) and any acute knee injury. Results Seven players (0. 28 %) in the intervention group, and 14 (0. 67 %) in the control group had an anterior cruciate ligament injury. By Cox regression analysis according to intention to treat, a 64 % reduction in the rate of anterior cruciate ligament injury was seen in the intervention group (rate ratio 0. 36, 95 % confidence interval 0. 15 to 0. 85). The absolute rate difference was - 0. 07 (95 % confidence interval - 0. 13 to 0. 001) per 1000 playing hours in favour of the intervention group. No significant rate reductions were seen for secondary outcomes. Conclusions A neuromuscular warm-up programme significantly reduced the rate of anterior cruciate ligament injury in adolescent female football players.

40|$|QuestionWhat is {{the effect}} of a {{structured}} warm-up program for reducing knee and ankle injuries in young people participating in sport?DesignCluster randomised controlled trial, with clubs as the unit of <b>randomisation.</b> <b>Setting</b> 120 handball club teams in Norway. Patients 1837 players (1586 female, 251 male), aged 15 – 17 years. InterventionsA structured warm-up program to improve running, cutting, and landing technique as well as neuromuscular control, balance, and strength used at the beginning of every training session for 15 consecutive sessions and then once a week {{during the rest of the}} eight-month season. Each club received one visit from an instructor and they received an exercise book, five wobble boards, and five balance mats. The main focus of the program was to improve awareness and control of knee and ankle by use of equipment. The program included four sets of exercises: warm-up exercises, technique, balance, and strength and power. The players were instructed to spend 4 – 5 minutes on each exercise group for a total duration of 15 – 20 minutes. The instructor did one follow-up visit midway through the season. OutcomesPrimary outcome was rate of acute injuries to the knee or ankle. Secondary outcomes were any injury to the lower limb and overall injuries. Injuries were recorded by 10 physiotherapists blinded to group allocation. Result 13 % of the clubs in the intervention group did not use the program, whereas 22 % of the clubs in the control group used specific warm-up exercises to prevent injuries during the study period. During the eight month season 14 % of the 1837 players had an injury. The intervention group had significantly fewer acute knee and ankle injuries, 4. 8 % of subjects experienced injuries in the intervention group versus 8. 6 % in the control group (relative risk 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 35 to 0. 81, number needed to treat (NNT) = 26. Injuries overall and upper limb injuries were also lower in the intervention group (NNT for all injuries = 11, NNT for upper limb injuries = 38).

40|$|Background Exercise {{programmes}} {{aimed at}} reducing injury {{have been shown to}} be efficacious for some non-collision sports, but evidence in collision sports such as rugby union is lacking. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of an evidence-informed injury prevention exercise programme in reducing match injuries in adult community rugby union players. Design Prospective cluster randomised (single-blind) controlled trial. Clubs were the unit of <b>randomisation.</b> <b>Setting</b> English adult community clubs (2015 – 2016 season) with a formally qualified medical professional to diagnose and report match-injuries. Participants 860 clubs were invited to participate of which 81 volunteered and were randomly assigned. Data was received from 41 clubs (control, 19; intervention, 22). Interventions A 42 -week exercise programme comprising 6 -week graduated exercise blocks was introduced during pre-season. The control programme reflected ‘normal practice’ exercises, whereas the intervention focused on proprioception, balance, cutting, landing, and resistance exercises. Main Outcome Measurements Match-injury incidence and burden for: all ≥ 8 days time-loss injuries and targeted (lower-limb, shoulder, head and neck, excluding fractures and lacerations) ≥ 8 days time-loss injuries. Results Poisson regression identified unclear differences between groups for overall injury incidence (rate ratio (RR), 90 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 9, 0. 6 – 1. 3) and injury burden (RR, 90 % CI= 0. 8, 0. 5 – 1. 4). A likely beneficial difference in targeted injury incidence (RR, 90 % CI= 0. 6, 0. 4 – 1. 0) was identified, with ∼ 40 % lower lower-limb incidence (RR, 90 % CI= 0. 6, 0. 4 – 1. 0) and ∼ 60 % lower concussion incidence (RR, 90 %CI= 0. 36, 0. 18 – 0. 70) in the intervention group.

40|$|Abstract Background Smoking in {{pregnancy}} remains {{a public health}} challenge. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is effective for smoking cessation in non-pregnant people, but because women metabolise nicotine and cotinine much faster {{in pregnancy}}, {{it is unclear whether}} this will be effective for smoking cessation in pregnancy. The NHS Health Technology Assessment Programme (HTA) -funded smoking, nicotine and pregnancy (SNAP) trial will investigate whether or not nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is effective, cost-effective and safe when used for smoking cessation by pregnant women. Methods/Design Over two years, in 5 trial centres, 1050 pregnant women who are between 12 and 24 weeks pregnant will be randomised as they attend hospital for ante-natal ultrasound scans. Women will receive either nicotine or placebo transdermal patches with behavioural support. The primary outcome measure is biochemically-validated, self-reported, prolonged and total abstinence from smoking between a quit date (defined before <b>randomisation</b> and <b>set</b> within two weeks of this) and delivery.

40|$|Prognostication {{of newly}} {{diagnosed}} colorectal cancer (CRC) predominantly relies on stage {{as defined by}} the UICC-TNM and American Joint Committee on Cancer classifications. Tumour extent, lymph node status, tumour grade and the assessment of lymphatic and venous invasion are still the most important morphological prognostic factors. Evidence suggests that tumour budding and tumour border configuration are important, additional histological parameters but are not regarded as essential in prognosis. Although several molecular features, such as LOH 18 q and TP 53 mutation analysis, have shown promising results in terms of their prognostic value, the American Society of Clinical Oncology Tumor Markers Expert Panel does not currently recommend their use in routine practice. cDNA-microarray, PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridisation are now frequently used to identity potential prognostic indicators in CRC, but the applicability of these methods in routine use is likely to have limited impact. Reliable prognostic markers identified by immunohistochemical protein profiling have yet to be established. <b>Randomisation</b> of data <b>sets,</b> assessment of interobserver variability for protein markers and scoring systems, as well as the use of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in combination with multimarker-phenotype analysis of several different markers may be an effective tactical approach to increase the value of immunohistochemical findings.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} if circulating concentrations of vitamin D are causally associated with risk of cancer. Design Mendelian <b>randomisation</b> study. <b>Setting</b> Large genetic epidemiology networks (the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON), the Genetic and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), and the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortiums, and the MR-Base platform). Participants 70 [*] 563 cases of cancer (22 [*] 898 prostate cancer, 15 [*] 748 breast cancer, 12 [*] 537 lung cancer, 11 [*] 488 colorectal cancer, 4369 ovarian cancer, 1896 pancreatic cancer, and 1627 neuroblastoma) and 84 [*] 418 controls. Exposures Four {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (rs 2282679, rs 10741657, rs 12785878 and rs 6013897) associated with vitamin D were used to define a multi-polymorphism score for circulating 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) concentrations. Main outcomes measures The primary outcomes were the risk of incident colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma, which was evaluated with an inverse variance weighted average of the associations with specific polymorphisms and a likelihood based approach. Secondary outcomes based on cancer subtypes by sex, anatomic location, stage, and histology were also examined. Results There was little evidence that the multi-polymorphism score of 25 (OH) D was associated with risk {{of any of the}} seven cancers or their subtypes. Specifically, the odds ratios per 25 nmol/L increase in genetically determined 25 (OH) D concentrations were 0. 92 (95 % confidence interval 0. 76 to 1. 10) for colorectal cancer, 1. 05 (0. 89 to 1. 24) for breast cancer, 0. 89 (0. 77 to 1. 02) for prostate cancer, and 1. 03 (0. 87 to 1. 23) for lung cancer. The results were consistent with the two different analytical approaches, and the study was powered to detect relative effect sizes of moderate magnitude (for example, 1. 20 - 1. 50 per 25 nmol/L decrease in 25 (OH) D for most primary cancer outcomes. The Mendelian randomisation assumptions {{did not seem to be}} violated. Conclusions There is little evidence for a linear causal association between circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of various types of cancer, though the existence of causal clinically relevant effects of low magnitude cannot be ruled out. These results, in combination with previous literature, provide evidence that population-wide screening for vitamin D deficiency and subsequent widespread vitamin D supplementation should not currently be recommended as a strategy for primary cancer prevention...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hand eczema has {{a one-year}} {{prevalence}} of approximately 10 % {{in the general}} Danish population. Often the disease becomes chronic with numerous implications for the individual’s daily life, occupation and quality of life. However, no guidelines of self-management recommendations beyond the acute stage are given. Self-management of the disease is pivotal and involves self-monitoring of the condition, medication adherence, and preventive behaviour. Interventions best to support the individual in this ongoing process need to be developed. Methods/design This paper describes {{the design of a}} randomised clinical trial to test a newly developed intervention of individual counselling versus conventional information. 300 patients consecutively referred to dermatologic treatment at two different settings are individually randomised to either the intervention programme, named ‘The Healthy Skin Clinic’ or to the control group. Block-wise <b>randomisation</b> according to <b>setting</b> and gender is carried out. The intervention offers a tool for self-monitoring; basic and specific individual counselling; the possibility of asynchronous communication with the intervention team; and an electronic patient dialogue forum. Primary outcome variable is objective assessment of the hand eczema severity performed at baseline prior to randomisation, and repeated at six months follow-up. Secondary outcome variables are dermatology related life quality and perceived global burden of disease. Discussion The trial aims at evaluating a newly developed guidance programme which is expected to support self-management of patients referred to dermatology treatment due to chronic hand eczema. The design of the protocol is pragmatic with blinding of neither participants nor the investigator. Thus, in the interpretation of the results, the investigator takes into account effects that may be attributed to actors of the interventions rather than the intervention per se as well of potential observer bias. Inclusion criterions are wide in order to increase transferability of the results. Trial registration The trial is registered in ClinicalTrials. Gov with registration number NCT 01482663. </p...|$|R
40|$|Epidural {{analgesia}} is {{the international}} standard for pain treatment in abdominal surgery. Although some studies have advocated continuous wound infiltration with local anaesthetics, robust evidence is lacking, especially on patient-reported outcome measures. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of continuous wound infiltration in hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery. In this randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority trial (POP-UP), we enrolled adult patients undergoing hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery by subcostal or midline laparotomy in two Dutch hospitals. Patients were centrally randomised (1 : 1) to receive either pain treatment with continuous wound infiltration using bupivacaine plus patient-controlled analgesia with morphine or to receive (patient-controlled) epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and sufentanil. All patients were treated within an enhanced recovery <b>setting.</b> <b>Randomisation</b> was stratified by centre and type of incision. The primary outcome was the mean Overall Benefit of Analgesic Score (OBAS) from day 1 - 5, a validated composite endpoint of pain scores, opioid side-effects, and patient satisfaction (range 0 [best] to 28 [worst]). Analysis was per-protocol. The non-inferiority limit of the mean difference was +  3 · 0. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NTR 4948. Between Jan 20, 2015, and Sept 16, 2015, we randomly assigned 105 eligible patients: 53 to receive continuous wound infiltration and 52 to receive epidural analgesia. One patient in the continuous wound infiltration group discontinued treatment, as did five in the epidural analgesia group; of these five patients, preoperative placement failed in three (these patients were treated with continuous wound infiltration instead), one patient refused an epidural, and data for the primary endpoint was lost for one. Thus, 55 patients {{were included in the}} continuous wound infiltration group and 47 in the epidural analgesia group for the per-protocol analyses. Mean OBAS was 3 · 8 (SD 2 · 4) in the continuous wound infiltration group versus 4 · 4 (2 · 2) in the epidural group (mean difference - 0 · 62, 95 % CI - 1 · 54 to 0 · 30). Because the upper bound of the one-sided 95 % CI did not exceed + 3 · 0, non-inferiority was shown. Four (7 %) patients in the continuous wound infiltration group and five (11 %) of those in the epidural group had an adverse event. One patient in the continuous wound infiltration group had a serious adverse event (temporary hypotension and arrhythmia after bolus injection); no serious adverse events were noted in the epidural group. These data suggest that continuous wound infiltration is non-inferior to epidural analgesia in hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery within an enhanced recovery setting. Further large-scale trials are required to make a definitive assessment of non-inferiority. Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherland...|$|R
