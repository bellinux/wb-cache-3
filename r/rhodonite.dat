40|$|Alleghanyite, manganhumite and sonolite {{have been}} found in the Bald Knob {{manganese}} deposit of North Carolina. These minerals are the manganese analogues of chondrodite, humite and clinohumite respectively. They are close to end-member Mn minerals in terms of cations but have about 25 - 30 vo of hydroxyl replaced by fluorine. The observed partitioning of minor elements among coexisting alleghanyite-manganhumite and mangan-humite-sonolite suggests that minor element substitution does not stabilize one manganese humite relative to another. The Bald Knob humites coexist with <b>rhodonites</b> and manganese carbonates. Qualitative phase equilibria suggest hat these assemblages require water-rich conditions to form in silica-undersaturated rocks during regional metamorphism and that variations in XHzOI(XH 2 O+XCO) may account for their formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} compositions of the coexisting manganoan amphiboles (mainly the Na-Ca- and alkali-amphibole series) manganoan clinopyroxenes (the aegirine-diopside-johannsenite series) and pyroxenoids {{were analyzed}} {{by means of an}} EPMA method. As the number of diopside molecule in manganoan clinopyroxenes coexisting with pyroxenoids increases, the num- ber of johannsenite molecule in them also tends to increase. Although the oxidation conditions during the ore formation do not have much effect on the Mn content of clinopyroxenes, they strongly affect the ferrous iron content in pyroxenoids. The calcium content in the M 2 site of clinopyroxene is larger than that in the M 4 site of amphibole. The M 1 site of clinopyroxene can accommodate much more Mn ions than the M 1, M 2 and M 3 sites of the coexisting amphibole. On the other hand, Mg ions can occupy much more easily in the M 1, M 2 and M 3 sites of amphibole than the M 1 site of clinopyroxene. This study shows that among the coexisting amphiboles, manganoan clinopyroxenes and pyroxenoids, almost all the <b>rhodonites</b> and pyroxmangites can accommodate the smallest amounts of Mg, Ca and Fe 2 + in their structures...|$|R

50|$|Both bustamite and johansennite {{are found}} at Franklin.

50|$|<b>Rhodonite</b> {{crystals}} {{often have}} a thick tabular habit, but are rare. It has a perfect, prismatic cleavage, almost at right angles. The hardness is 5.5-6.5, and the specific gravity 3.4-3.7; luster is vitreous, being less frequently pearly on cleavage surfaces. The manganese is often partly replaced by iron, magnesium, calcium, and sometimes zinc which may sometimes be present in considerable amounts; a greyish-brown variety containing as much as 20% of calcium oxide is called bustamite; fowlerite is a zinciferous variety containing 7% of zinc oxide.The inosilicate (chain silicate) structure of <b>rhodonite</b> has a repeat unit of five silica tetrahedra.

50|$|They {{are then}} met with another Gem (a fusion), {{who is very}} fearful {{that they had been}} {{followed}} and is skeptical of Steven and Lars. The Twins identify this nervous Gem as <b>Rhodonite</b> (Enuka Okuma). Then, another Gem (an orange Sapphire) makes an appearance, excitedly exclaiming that she has had a vision that the Twins would bring two new strangers into their location. <b>Rhodonite</b> fondly tells the Sapphire, now identified as Padparadscha (Erica Luttrell), that they are aware, as the events of her prediction have already occurred. The Rutile Twins explain why they brought Steven and Lars into their hiding place, as a third Gem (a very large fusion) comes out from behind a pillar. This large fusion is later identified as Fluorite (Kathleen Fisher).|$|E

It occurs associated with alleghanyite, <b>rhodonite,</b> sonolite, spessartine, tephroite, kutnohorite, manganhumite, jacobsite, kellyite and alabandite in the Bald Knob area. Associated minerals include katoptrite, magnetite, manganostibite, magnussonite, tephroite, manganhumite and manganosite in the Brattfors mine area of Nordmark, Värmland, Sweden.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rhodonite</b> is a {{manganese}} inosilicate, (Mn, Fe, Mg, Ca)SiO3 {{and member}} of the pyroxenoid group of minerals, crystallizing in the triclinic system. It commonly occurs as cleavable to compact masses with a rose-red color (the name comes from the Greek ῥόδος rhodos, rosy), often tending to brown because of surface oxidation.|$|E

In the iron and manganese mines at Pajsberg near Filipstad and Långban in Värmland, Sweden, small brilliant and translucent crystals (pajsbergite) and cleavage masses occur.

50|$|Bustamite is a calcium {{manganese}} inosilicate (chain silicate) and {{a member}} of the wollastonite group. Magnesium, zinc and iron are common impurities substituting for manganese. Bustamite is the high-temperature polymorph of CaMnSi2O6 and johannsenite is the low temperature polymorph. The inversion takes place at 830 C, but may be very slow.Bustamite could be confused with light-colored <b>rhodonite</b> or pyroxmangite, but both these minerals are biaxial (+) whereas bustamite is biaxial (-).|$|E
50|$|In a pure CaSiO3, each {{component}} forms {{nearly half of}} the mineral by weight: 48.3% of CaO and 51.7% of SiO2. In some cases, small amounts of iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn), and lesser amounts of magnesium (Mg) substitute for calcium (Ca) in the mineral formula (e.g., <b>rhodonite).</b> Wollastonite can form a series of solid solutions in the system CaSiO3-FeSiO3, or hydrothermal synthesis of phases in the system MnSiO3-CaSiO3.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1956 and named for an occurrence in Birness, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Birnessite is found as an oxidation product {{of several other}} minerals, including <b>rhodonite,</b> rhodochrosite, and as a weathering product of franklinite-willemite ore. It has also been found as a coating along joint planes and fractures within a trachyte sill. However, it has been most commonly seen as a constituent of oceanic nodules of manganese.|$|E

5000|$|Rhodolite is a varietal {{name for}} rose-pink to red mineral pyrope, a {{species in the}} garnet group. It is found in Cowee Valley, Macon County, North Carolina.

50|$|Rhodochrosite is a {{manganese}} carbonate mineral with chemical composition MnCO3. In its (rare) pure form, it is typically a rose-red color, but impure specimens can be shades of pink to pale brown. It streaks white, and its Mohs hardness varies between 3.5 and 4. Its specific gravity is between 3.5 and 3.7. It crystallizes in the trigonal system, and cleaves with rhombohedral carbonate cleavage in three directions. Crystal twinning often is present. It is transparent to translucent with refractive indices of nω=1.814 to 1.816, nε=1.596 to 1.598. It is often {{confused with the}} manganese silicate, <b>rhodonite,</b> but is distinctly softer.|$|E

Padparadscha, instead of predicting future events like a normal Sapphire, can only make obliviously late predictions of events that have just happened; <b>Rhodonite</b> is a forbidden permanent fusion of a Pearl and a Ruby; Fluorite is a perma-fusion consisting of six Gems; the Rutile Twins are a deformity of two conjoined Gems.|$|E
