50|$|Four {{fundamental}} attenuator {{circuit diagrams}} {{are given in}} the figures on the left. Since an attenuator circuit consists solely of passive <b>resistor</b> <b>elements,</b> it is linear and reciprocal. If the circuit is also made symmetrical (this is usually the case since it is usually required that the input and output impedance Z1 and Z2 are equal) then the input and output ports are not distinguished, but by convention {{the left and right}} sides of the circuits are referred to as input and output, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{termination}} resistors on the motherboard reduce some {{reflections on the}} signal lines, {{they are unable to}} prevent reflections resulting from the stub lines that connect to the components on the module card (e.g. DRAM Module). A signal propagating from the controller to the components encounters an impedance discontinuity at the stub leading to the components on the module. The signal that propagates along the stub to the component (e.g. DRAM component) will be reflected back onto the signal line, thereby introducing unwanted noise into the signal. In addition, on-die termination can reduce the number of <b>resistor</b> <b>elements</b> and complex wiring on the motherboard. Accordingly, the system design can be simpler and cost effective.|$|E
5000|$|In many {{situations}} it is desired to measure resistivity of a bulk material by applying an electrode array at the surface. Amongst the fields that use this technique are geophysics (because it avoids having {{to dig into}} the substrate) and the semiconductor industry (for the similar reason that it is non-intrusive) for testing bulk silicon wafers. [...] The basic arrangement {{is shown in figure}} 3, although normally more electrodes would be used. To form a relationship between the voltage and current measured on the one hand, and the resistivity of the material on the other, it is necessary to apply the distributed element model by considering the material to be an array of infinitesimal <b>resistor</b> <b>elements.</b> Unlike the transmission line example, the need to apply the distributed element model arises from the geometry of the setup, and not from any wave propagation considerations.|$|E

50|$|When ice {{crystals}} are aligned with their basal planes {{parallel to the}} temperature gradient (z-crystals), they can be represented as two resistors in parallel. The thermal resistance of the ceramic is significantly smaller {{than that of the}} ice however, so the apparent resistance can be expressed as the lower Rceramic. If the {{ice crystals}} are aligned perpendicular to the temperature gradient (r-crystals), they can be approximated as two <b>resistor</b> <b>elements</b> in series. For this case, the Rice is limiting and will dictate the localized thermal conditions. The lower thermal resistance for the z-crystal case leads to lower temperatures and greater heat flux at the growing crystals tips, driving further growth in this direction while, at the same time, the large Rice value hinders the growth of the r-crystals. Each ice crystal growing within the slurry will be some combination of these two scenarios. Thermodynamics dictate that all crystals will tend to align with the preferential temperature gradient causing r-crystals to eventually give way to z-crystals, which {{can be seen from the}} following radiographs taken within the TZ.|$|E
50|$|There are {{colonies of}} {{similarly}} aligned ice crystals growing throughout the suspension. There are fine lamellae of aligned z-crystals growing with their basal planes {{aligned with the}} thermal gradient. The r-crystals appear in this cross-section as platelets but in actuality, they are most similar to columnar dendritic crystals cut along a bias. Within the transition zone, the r-crystals either stop growing or turn into z-crystals that eventually become the predominant orientation, and lead to steady-state growth. There are some reasons why this occurs. For one, during freezing, the growing crystals tend to align with the temperature gradient, as this is the lowest energy configuration and thermodynamically preferential. Aligned growth, however, can mean two different things. Assuming the temperature gradient is vertical, the growing crystal will either be parallel (z-crystal) or perpendicular (r-crystal) to this gradient. A crystal that lays horizontally can still grow {{in line with the}} temperature gradient, but it will mean growing on its face rather than its edge. Since the thermal conductivity of ice is so small (1.6 - 2.4 W mK−1) compared with most every other ceramic (ex. Al2O3 = 40 W mK−1), the growing ice will have a significant insulative effect on the localized thermal conditions within the slurry. This can be illustrated using simple <b>resistor</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E

In order to extend the life time and runtime of batteries, an equalization process, with a good precision is required. Indeed, as mentioned in prior works, to achieve voltage equalization, the process must have a precision around 10 mV/cell. We have focused the impact of an unbalanced cells voltage on their lifetime. Typically, there are two equalization systems: While the active cell equalization processes remove charge from higher energy cell(s) and deliver it to lower energy cell(s), the passive methods, based on <b>resistor</b> <b>element,</b> remove the excess charge until the charge matches those of the lower cells in the same pack.

40|$|Recently, {{open circuit}} {{failures}} of individual elements in thin film resistor networks {{have been attributed}} to electrostatic discharge (ESD) effects. This paper will discuss the investigation that came to this conclusion and subsequent experimentation intended to characterize design factors that affect the sensitivity of <b>resistor</b> <b>elements</b> to ESD. The ESD testing was performed using the standard human body model simulation. Some of the design elements to be evaluated were: trace width, trace length (and thus width to length ratio), specific resistivity of the trace (ohms per square) and resistance value.
