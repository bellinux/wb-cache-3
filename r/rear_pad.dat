50|$|The {{thylacine}} {{was able}} to open its jaws to an unusual extent: up to 80 degrees. This capability {{can be seen in}} part in David Fleay's short black-and-white film sequence of a captive thylacine from 1933. The jaws were muscular but weak and had 46 teeth.Thylacine footprints could be distinguished from other native or introduced animals; unlike foxes, cats, dogs, wombats or Tasmanian devils, thylacines had a very large <b>rear</b> <b>pad</b> and four obvious front pads, arranged in almost a straight line. The hindfeet were similar to the forefeet but had four digits rather than five. Their claws were non-retractable.More detail can been seen in a cast taken (below and to the left) from a freshly dead thylacine. The cast shows the plantar pad in more detail and shows that the plantar pad is tri-lobal in that it exhibits three distinctive lobes. It is a single plantar pad divided by three deep grooves. The distinctive plantar pad shape along with the asymmetrical nature of the foot makes it quite different from animals such as dogs or foxes. This cast dates back to the early 1930s and is part of the Museum of Victoria's thylacine collection.|$|E

Moreover, when M. duvali was mixed with BCG, it was not any more effective than BCG alone.

40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} highly {{efficient}} photovoltaic modules at low costs leads to new solar cell designs. For enhanced module efficiency the cell efficiency {{has to be}} optimized regarding later operation under module conditions. This implies that the interconnected solar cell structure has to be assessed. Commonly the solar cell itself is optimized separately. In this work an easy to implement cell design was investigated where the number of busbars was varied to decrease the total series resistance of the interconnected solar cell. For this study a simulation program based on the two-diode model was applied to determine the optimal efficiency of the device. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that a device with multiple busbars has a high potential in cost savings due {{to a reduction in}} metal consumption for the front side metallization. For an optimized cell structure the amount of Ag paste needed for a sufficient front side metallization could be reduced to 7 mg Ag paste for a 6 inch solar cell. In the same time the efficiency can be increased.

30|$|When subcutaneously and abdomenally administered, {{a part of}} CNTs exist {{persistently}} in {{the local}} tissues while {{some of them may}} be absorbed through lymphatic canal. Because the fenestra in the endothelial cells of blood capillaries are 30 nm to approximately 50 nm while that in the endothelial cells of lymphatic capillaries are larger than 100 nm in diameter, the lymph absorption of bundled CNTs seemed to be easier than blood absorption. The lymphatically absorbed CNTs migrate along the lymph canal and are accumulated in the lymph node, which is in fact a lymphatic target effects. This is clinically important because lymphatic metastasis occurs extensively in cancers, resulting in frequent tumor recurrence, even after extended lymph node dissection. If anticancer drugs are loaded into CNTs, they will be delivered into lymph system, where the drugs will be released to kill metastatic cancer cells. Ji et al. successfully delivered gemcitabine to lymph nodes with high efficiency by using lymphatic targeted drug delivery system based on magnetic MWCNTs under the magnetic field guidance [48, 49]. The result suggests that the anticancer drug delivery system based on CNTs is advantageous over the current ways to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to lymph nodes. In another approach [50], water-soluble MWCNTs were subcutaneously injected into the left <b>rear</b> foot <b>pad</b> of rat; the biopsy found that the accumulation of MWCNTs in left popliteal lymph nodes was more obvious than in other regions, and micropathology revealed large MWCNT collections in the popliteal lymph nodes.

N. brasiliensis was injected into the <b>rear</b> foot <b>pads</b> of BALB/c mice to establish an infection. Within 30 days, infected animals developed a chronic actinomycetoma infection. Batch cultures of N. brasiliensis were used to purify P 61, P 38, and P 24 antigens; P 61 is a catalase, and P 38 is a protease with strong caseinolytic activity. Active and passive immunizations of BALB/c mice with these three purified soluble antigens were studied. Protection was demonstrated for actively immunized mice. However, immunity lasted only 30 days. Other groups of immunized mice were bled at different times, and their sera were passively transferred to naive recipients that were then infected with N. brasiliensis. Sera collected 5, 6, and 7 days after donor immunization conferred complete, long-lasting protection. The protective effect of passive immunity decreased when sera were collected 2 weeks after donor immunization. However, neither the early sera (1 -, 2 -, and 3 -day sera) nor the later sera (30 - or 45 -day sera) prevented the infection. Hyperimmune sera with the highest levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to N. brasiliensis antigens did not protect at all. The antigens tested induced two IgM peaks. The first peak was present 3 days after immunization but was not antigen specific and did not transfer protection. The second peak was evident 7 days after immunization, was an IgM response, was antigen specific, and conferred protection.
