5000|$|It {{was decided}} the third {{parachute}} would {{be attached to}} the risers of his main parachute (risers are the webbing which connects a parachute's suspension lines to a jumper's harness and are exposed on a jumper's shoulders while the actual canopy fabric and lines are packed securely in the container on the jumpers back). In sport parachuting, a jumper typically has just two handles on his chest (in addition to a third handle which deploys the main parachute and is located elsewhere). Usually on one's right side is the main parachute <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> (or [...] "cut-away"). On the left is the reserve parachute ripcord, which deploys the emergency parachute. Due to the special nature of Harris' jump, a second <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> was attached to his harness near the usual one. Harris was to jump and immediately deploy the third parachute, and then be filmed releasing that parachute, entering freefall, and deploying his normal main parachute (completing his skydive in the usual manner).|$|E

5000|$|An {{accident}} {{during the}} filming of the Mountain Dew [...] "007" [...] commercial directed by David Kellogg and recorded by Janusz Kamiński resulted {{in the death of}} noted skysurfer Rob Harris in 1995. The incident was due to an error made during an attempt to film an [...] "intentional cut-away" [...] (where a skydiver intentionally releases, and falls away from his primary parachute). Harris was wearing a modern sport parachute harness containing two parachutes (a [...] "main" [...] and a [...] "reserve") which was modified so that a third parachute could be externally attached to the risers of his main parachute and be released in-flight via an extra [...] "cut-away" [...] <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> (attached to his harness near the standard main parachute <b>release</b> <b>handle).</b> It was the intention of the stunt to film Harris releasing his open [...] "main" [...] parachute, dropping into freefall, and deploying his [...] "reserve" [...] parachute (which would have actually been his real main parachute, the one he intended to land), while still having a reserve parachute in case it was required. Skydivers are required by law to always jump with one more parachute than they intend to deploy on any given jump. Since Harris planned to deploy two parachutes on this jump, he required a third.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 February 2011, an Air New Zealand Bombardier Q300 Dash 8 {{aircraft}} - Flight NZ8309, {{operated by}} the subsidiary Air Nelson again suffered a nose wheel failure upon landing at Blenheim Airport. It {{had been scheduled to}} fly from Hamilton to Wellington (in the North Island), but was diverted to Blenheim after crew reported a problem with the undercarriage. After circling the airport four times, the aircraft landed with the nose gear undeployed coming to a stop approximately two thirds {{along the length of the}} runway. No injuries were sustained. A Transport Accident Investigation Commission report (#11-002), found a faulty inhibit switch caused the loss of nosewheel steering on departure and was the cause of the landing gear later not extending normally. The pilots were unable to utilise the alternate extension system as they did not apply enough force to the <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> for the uplock (or possibly did not hold the <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> in position long enough for the uplock to disengage). This was found to be at least in part due to the flight simulators not requiring the full 40 kg (90 lbs) or more force as required in the actual aircraft.

5000|$|The {{difference}} between the “Land” and “Maritime” versions is how the outer cummerbund is attached at the front and where the quick-release handle is located. Both comes with an internal cummerbund which overlaps across the stomach and is secured with Velcro. The [...] "Maritime" [...] version has a solid center panel and two side flaps with Velcro panels underneath of them. Each side of the cummerbund attaches to the Velcro on its corresponding side. The <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> {{is located at the}} top of the front panel near the wearer's neck which allows ambidexstrous use. This version provides the wearer with a wide, uninterrupted section of webbing on the center of the vest which allows pouches for multiple magazines to be placed on the center of the body for easy access. On the Land version the external cummerbund wraps around and overlaps over the user's stomach and is secured under a single center flap rather than the two side flaps of the [...] "Maritime" [...] version. The <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> on the [...] "Land" [...] vest is located on the left side of the front panel, just above where the cummerbund wraps around. This version breaks up the amount of continuous webbing on the user's front, but allows the vest to be fitted with a different cummerbund which has additional pockets for 6x8" [...] side plates. The addition of these plates can bring the vest of to full Level IV protection for the entire torso, meaning the vest can stop rifle rounds from all sides instead of just front and back.|$|E
50|$|The Plymouth Cranbrook, as a car, was {{conservatively}} styled, {{designed to}} fit K.T. Keller's notion that cars be practical and allow drivers to sit upright while wearing a hat; it was sold {{at a time when}} competitors favored the low and sleek look. Differences between the 1950 Special Deluxe and the 1951 Plymouth Cranbrook are relatively few in number and scope, with interchangeable glass and doors, but different rubber seals; lack of woodgrain on the instrument panel; plastic brake handle instead of chrome; and other similar changes. More substantial was having what had been the hood <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> function as the overdrive control. Fender lettering and other badging necessarily changed as well. From a distance, the cars were essentially similar.|$|E
50|$|The large {{bottom ring}} is {{securely}} {{attached to the}} skydiver's harness, the middle ring is securely attached {{to the end of}} the parachute riser, and the small ring is securely attached to the parachute riser above the middle ring. The middle ring is passed through the large ring and looped upwards; the small ring is then passed through the middle ring and looped upwards. Continuing in the same manner, a cord loop is passed through the small ring, loop upwards, and finally passes through a grommet to the opposing side of the parachute riser. A semi-rigid cable attached to a <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> then passes through this loop, securing the loop. Releasing the cord loop by removing the cable with a tug causes the three-ring system to cascade free and quickly disconnect the riser from the harness.|$|E

50|$|The bailout {{sequence}} {{began at}} approximately 7,000 feet with an outside temperature of approximately 42 degrees, and was normal except the gunner could not jettison his turret despite full strength {{pull on the}} inner emergency <b>release</b> <b>handle.</b> The gunner was called forward and bailed out the navigator hatch, using the spare chute in the forward compartment. The pilot continued to guide the aircraft toward a clear area. The crew continued to bail out in order of navigator, spare navigator, spare pilot, EW, gunner, co-pilot and radar navigator. The pilot bailed out at 4,000 feet. The aircraft was trimmed and calculated to be at approximately a 21:1 glide ratio at this time. The aircraft made one complete 360 degree left turn and crashed into a clear flat barley field area 13.6 miles west of Yuba County Airport, California, at approximately 22:50 after takeoff. The aircraft struck the ground at a 15.3 degree left bank and an estimated attitude of 5 degrees nose down at an indicated airspeed of approximately 200 knots. Impact angle was approximately 45 degrees.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} extension latch {{attached to}} the probe cylinder body engaged and retained the probe center piston in the retracted position. Before vehicle separation in lunar orbit, manual cocking of the twelve ring latches was accomplished. The separating force from the internal pressure in the tunnel area was then transmitted from the ring latches to the probe and drogue.In undocking, {{the release of the}} capture latches was accomplished by electrically energizing tandem-mounted DC rotary solenoids located in the center piston. In a temperature degraded condition, a single motor release operation was done manually in the Lunar Module by depressing the locking spool through an open hole in the probe heads, while release from the CSM was done by rotating a <b>release</b> <b>handle</b> {{at the back of the}} probe to rotate the motor torque shaft manually.When the Command and Lunar Modules separated for the last time just before re-entry, the probe and forward docking ring were pyrotechnically separated, leaving all docking equipment {{attached to the}} lunar module. In the event of an abort during launch from Earth, the same system would have explosively jettisoned the docking ring and probe from the CM as it separated from the boost protective cover.|$|E
