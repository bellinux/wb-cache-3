40|$|Even with an {{advancement}} of technologies, most of industries are still using manual greasing method {{in maintaining the}} electric motorâ€™s performance. Even though it has helped to maintain the motors performance, yet it presents associated problems such that difficulties in maintaining the <b>regreasing</b> time interval and <b>regreasing</b> volume as well as reaching motor in an inaccess area. These motivating factors lead this project to develop automatic grease system in order to extend bearing lifetime without danger the maintenance technician; it also will increase electric motor performance. This project focuses on developing a system that capable to automate greasing an electrical motor according to required specification or preventive and maintenance plan...|$|E
40|$|During the {{preliminary}} operaton of a volatilization apparatus {{it became apparent}} that a large stopcock in the high vacuum side of the oil diffusion pump was quite unsatisfactory. Since it was necessary to mount the stopcock in a relatively inaccessible location, the difficulty of turning the plug and the consequent necessity of <b>regreasing</b> the valve approximately every week were real problems. Also, {{it became apparent that}} an increased pumping speed through the valve would be required. Since a larger stopcock was out of the question, a type of valve reported by Stern was modified in design and was bulit into the apparatus...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} work presented in this volume {{is to develop a}} process for the separation and purification of actinium- 227 produced by neutron bombardment of radium- 226 and to develop methods by which uniform films of actinium metal may be deposited on metallic surfaces. The design work on the cave structure and mechanical equipment used in the actinium separation is proceeding on schedule. As the mechanical design phase is nearing completion the emphasis is being directed toward processing equipment. The process as well as the mechanical equipment has been adapted from the research work of F. T. Hagemann and the Remote Control Group at Argonne National Laboratory. Consequently, one of the first objectives is to become familiary with the chemistry of the process and the operation of the mechanical equipment. Cold runs have been made on the T. T. A. benzene extraction using lanthanum and barium in place of actinium and radium. No difficulty with the operation was observed. The formation of precipitates was one of the difficulties encountered with the process as the precipitates carry radium. It has been found that metals such as nickel cause these precipitates to form and should, therefore, be avoided in the construction of equipment. it was also found that a T. T. A. solution exposed to 0. 5 curie of polonium over a period of days develops a precipitate. Some new mechanical features hav eshown promise. The use of copper-coated glassware which will hold together even though the glass is cracked has made it possible to replace custom-built heaters with standard heating mantles. A new graphite, silicone grease mixture appears to hold up in stopcocks handling benzene and, as a result, may eliminate the necessary of entering the cave for <b>regreasing.</b> Tests on the preparation of dense concrete have given results which meet the shielding requirements for the cave. A strippable paint and tape combination has been studied and specified to provide for decontamination of the interior of the cave. A number of different methods for the preparation of actinium metal are being tested with lanthanum compounds. It has not been found possible to reduce lanthanum from liquid ammonia with metallic sodium. Electrolytic methods are being investigated. Preliminary work has been started in an effort to determine polarographically the reduction potential of lanthanum from various fused salts. An attempt to obtain lanthanum metal from the iodide by the DeBoer proces is also under way. Lanthanum iodide vapor is thermally decomposed at a tungsten filament and the iodine vapor pumped from the system...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Desquamative {{interstitial}} pneumonia (DIP) {{may represent}} the early stage and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) the late stage of the same disease. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the computed tomographic (CT) features of DIP, to evaluate the changes in pattern and extent of disease over time, and to determine whether the appearances of DIP on the CT scan change to those of UIP during follow up. METHODS: Sequential CT evaluation was conducted on eight patients with DIP over a mean (SD) follow up period of 3. 2 (1. 3) years (range 1. 6 - 6. 5). The relative extents of ground glass and honeycombing were determined from serial CT scans. Changes in the extent and appearance of the disease were examined in paired anatomically comparable CT sections. RESULTS: Common features on the CT scans of patients with DIP were a homogeneous increase in lung attenuation (n = 5), linear areas of attenuation (n = 5), relatively well preserved lung architecture (n = 5), and the presence of small cysts (n = 6). Uncommon features were architectural distortion (n = 3), and traction bronchiectasis (n = 1). In six patients with DIP with cystic spaces these did not change with time in three cases, in two they <b>regreased,</b> and in one patient they increased. Open lung biopsy samples from patients with DIP with many cystic lesions showed dilated alveolar ducts and bronchioles and/or pulmonary cysts, as well as numerous macrophage-filled air spaces and mild fibrosis, but no typical honeycomb cysts were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the microcysts in DIP are different from the honeycomb cysts seen in UIP, and some of the cysts seen in patients with DIP resolve with time. DIP does not progress to UIP in the short term. ...|$|R
