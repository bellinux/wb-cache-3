5|$|The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America {{was formed}} in 1976 by Ailsa Crawford, {{one of the first}} Jack Russell terrier breeders in the United States. Size ranges for dogs were kept broad, with the ability of working dogs awarded higher than those in {{conformation}} shows. An open registry was maintained, with <b>restricted</b> <b>line</b> breeding. Registration for the club is made at adulthood for Jack Russells, rather than at birth, to ensure the breed's qualities remain, given the open registry.|$|E

2500|$|Nowak {{received}} her commission in the United States Navy in 1985. In 1987, {{she became a}} Naval Flight Officer via the Tactical Navigation syllabus at Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Nowak was then assigned to Electronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron 34 (VAQ-34) at NAS Point Mugu, California, where she flew both the EA-7L and ERA-3B aircraft, supporting the U.S. Pacific Fleet in small and large-scale exercises with jamming and missile profiles. In 1993, she was selected for transfer to the <b>Restricted</b> <b>Line</b> as an Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer, and to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. After graduating from the Naval Postgraduate School, Nowak stayed at Patuxent River working as an aircraft systems project officer at the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility and at Strike Aircraft Test Squadron, flying in the F/A-18 and EA-6B. Nowak was then assigned to the Naval Air Systems Command, working on acquisition of new systems for naval aircraft, when she was selected for the astronaut program. She logged over 1,500 hours of flight in over 30 different aircraft during her career in the Navy. On August 20, 2010, a panel of three U.S. Navy admirals recommended that she be discharged from the Navy and her rank reduced from Captain to Commander. Her service was classified as [...] "other than honorable".|$|E

40|$|Direct and {{correlated}} {{responses to}} selection for weight gain were investigated after nine generations of within family selection. Four selection criteria were used: gain between 28 and 38 or 48 and 58 days of age, and under two feeding regimes, ad libitum consumption or restricted to 80 % of control lines. Two lines consisting each of twenty pair matings were selected under {{each of these}} criteria. Two unselected control lines were kept. Carcass composition analyses were performed in generation nine {{at the beginning and}} end of each selection period and at 100 days of age. Direct responses to selection in the first period were greater in the ad libitum lines while in the second period direct responses were greater in the <b>restricted</b> <b>lines.</b> Direct responses and realized heritability estimates were significantly different between the sexes; males had greater direct responses and higher heritabilities in all selected lines. Body weights before the selection periods decreased in all lines as a result of selection. Body weights after the selection period were not different from controls in the ad libitum <b>lines</b> while <b>restricted</b> <b>lines</b> remained smaller animals. Correlated responses in feed efficiency and feed consumption in the ad libitum lines were positive in the first period and negative in the second period. <b>Restricted</b> <b>lines</b> had a positive response in feed efficiency and negative response in consumption in both periods of selection. Changes in body composition in the first period reflected the changes in body weights through a lower crude protein percentage at the start of the period and a lower ash percentage at the end of the period. Body composition at the start of the second period was not altered by selection, while at the end of the selection period ad libitum lines had higher dry matter percentages and <b>restricted</b> <b>lines</b> had lower fat percentages. Body composition at 100 days of age was not affected by selection except for dry matter percent, that was lower in the <b>restricted</b> <b>lines.</b> Correlated response in fitness was evaluated through litter size. In the first period lines selected under ad libitum feeding were not affected by selection for increased weight gain while selection for weight gain under restricted feeding caused a significant decrease in litter size...|$|R
40|$|The Polytechnical University in Madrid is {{developing}} a real-time system for analysing driving behaviour. The first step in thi 8 project is {{the construction of a}} system for determining the lateral position of a vehicle on the road, making use of video images, for real-time as well as posterior analysis. Such a position determination might be a simple task for human beings. But for computing scientists working in the area of computer vision it is still far from obvious how to deal with this. This project tries to take the first steps in developing a system for lateral position determination, by developing a method for detecting and tracking the white <b>restricting</b> <b>lines</b> and the verges of the road throughout image sequences. This method will make use of monocular panoramic video images, taken from the viewpoint of the driver of a car. This report tries to solve the problem situations described in [Mig 93], where the presented approach does not function properly in case of low contrast within the image, or absence of the white <b>restricting</b> <b>lines.</b> The problems are tried to be solved by making use of a texture segmentation method. Once the tracking of the white <b>restricting</b> <b>lines</b> and the verges of a road is possible, the corresponding lateral position of the car can easily be computed. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of fault currents differ widely {{depending on the}} type of earthing system used, the installation's supply type and earthing system, and its proximity to the supply. For example, for a domestic UK 230 V, 60 A TN-S or USA 120 V/240 V supply, fault currents may be a few thousand amperes. Large low-voltage networks with multiple sources may have fault levels of 300,000 amperes. A high-resistance-grounded system may <b>restrict</b> <b>line</b> to ground fault current to only 5 amperes. Prior to selecting protective devices, prospective fault current must be measured reliably at the origin of the installation and at the furthest point of each circuit, and this information applied properly to the application of the circuits.|$|R

In certain shipboard environments, many unrestricted line officers fill what might be considered <b>restricted</b> <b>line</b> duties, such as the officers in a ship's or submarine's engineering department. Because they maintain their general surface warfare or submarine warfare specialist duties instead of completely specializing in one career area, they maintain their unrestricted line command career path.|$|E

The first version of this system reconstructs three-dimensional objects from perfect drawings, in which all angles and line junctions are consistent with projections of rectangular polyhedron. Ambiguities which are inherent in such drawings are avoided by choosing a line grammar which yields only a single interpretation. Next, reconstruction from imperfect drawings, in which all the line segments were randomly perturbed, was then achieved by grouping line endpoints into vertices while simultaneously <b>restricting</b> <b>lines</b> to particular orientations, and recovering three-dimensional form from the corrected line drawing. Finally, when actual hand-drawn sketches were used as input [...] ...|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very <b>restricted</b> <b>lines</b> of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|R
