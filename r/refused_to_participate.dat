5|$|Leuthen was {{the last}} battle at which Prince Charles {{commanded}} the Austrian Army, before his sister-in-law, Empress Maria Theresa, appointed him as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and placed Leopold Joseph von Daun {{in command of the}} army. The battle also established beyond doubt Frederick's military reputation in European circles. After Rossbach (5 November), the French had <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> further in Austria's war with Prussia; after Leuthen (5 December), Austria could not.|$|E
5|$|This {{still left}} the {{question}} of relations between the U.S. and the League. Hughes' State Department initially ignored communications from the League, or tried to bypass it through direct communications with member nations. By 1922, though, the U.S., through its consul in Geneva, was dealing with the League, and though the U.S. <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in any meeting with political implications, it sent observers to sessions on technical and humanitarian matters.|$|E
5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, the {{government}} offered al-Jamri {{the opportunity to}} serve as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain (Shia branch). Al-Jamri agreed after Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei issued him with a religious permit to do so. The decision was controversial within Bahrain, as many Shia clerics had <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in {{the government}}-run judiciary ever since its foundation in the 1920s. Al-Jamri held the position until June 1988, when he was suspended due to his criticism of the government.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, Boston Police Department {{officers}} went {{on strike}} at 5:45p.m. Of the force's 1,544 officers and men, 1,117 (72%) failed to report for work. Coolidge assigned 100 members of the state's Metropolitan Park Police Department to replace the striking officers, but 58 of them <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> and were suspended from their jobs. Despite assurances from Commissioner Curtis to Mayor Peters and Governor Coolidge, Boston had little police protection for the night of September 9. Volunteer replacements were still being organized and due to report the next morning. Many of those who provided scab labor were students at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|One {{week before}} the eruption, the Palace of Justice siege took place. The assailants (M-19 a Marxist, Terrorist Insurgency group) planned to hold a trial {{involving}} Colombian President Belisario Betancur. He <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> and sent the national army into the building. The attackers were holding several hundred hostages, including the 24 Supreme Court justices and 20 other judges. In the ensuing battle between the two forces, more than 75 hostages died (including 11 judges). This disaster, coupled with the Armero tragedy, spurred the Colombian government to predict and prepare for {{a broad range of}} threats.|$|E

5|$|Sigeberht abdicated {{in favour}} of his co-ruler Ecgric and retired to lead a monastic life, but soon {{afterwards}} the East Angles were attacked by Mercian forces, led by their king, Penda. Ecgric and his army appealed to Sigeberht to lead them into battle against the Mercians, but he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b> He was dragged from his monastery to the battlefield, where, still refusing to bear arms or fight, he and Ecgric were slain and the defeated East Anglian army was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{within the}} ministry {{came to a}} head on 8 February 1708, when Godolphin and the Marlboroughs insisted that the Queen had to either dismiss Harley or do without their services. When the Queen seemed to hesitate, Marlborough and Godolphin refused to attend a cabinet meeting. Harley attempted to lead business without his former colleagues, and several of those present including the Duke of Somerset <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> until they returned. Her hand forced, the Queen dismissed Harley.|$|E
5|$|Thebes, Corinth and Athens also <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in a Spartan {{expedition}} to Ionia in 398 BC, with the Thebans {{going so far}} as to disrupt a sacrifice that the Spartan king Agesilaus attempted to perform in their territory before his departure. Despite the absence of these states, Agesilaus campaigned effectively against the Persians in Lydia, advancing as far inland as Sardis. The satrap Tissaphernes was executed for his failure to contain Agesilaus, and his replacement, Tithraustes, bribed the Spartans to move north, into the satrapy of Pharnabazus. Agesilaus did so, but simultaneously began preparing a sizable navy.|$|E

5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli set his goal on an {{alliance}} with Philip of Hesse. He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate,</b> but after a long process, Zurich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, there were {{increasing}} {{calls for the}} replacement of the Seated Liberty design, used since the 1830s on most denominations of silver coins. In 1891, Mint Director Edward O. Leech, having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns, ordered a competition, seeking a new look for the silver coins. As only the winner would receive a cash prize, invited artists <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> and no entry from the public proved suitable. Leech instructed Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half dollar, and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891. Striking of the new coins began the following January.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was {{determined}} to stop the hegemony of Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and Senegalese leaders. Houphouët-Boigny <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the Inter-African conference in Dakar on 31 December 1958, which was intended to {{lay the foundation for}} the Federation of Francophone African States. Although that federation was never realised, Senegal and Mali (known at the time as French Sudan) formed their own political union, the Mali Federation. After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959, Houphouët-Boigny tried to sabotage the federation's efforts to wield political control; in cooperation with France, he managed to convince Upper Volta, Dahomey, and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation, before it collapsed in August 1960.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2000 United States Census, city {{officials}} made a push to get residents to respond {{and participate in the}} enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used to justify their deportation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on 10 February, about 50 Vietnamese {{soldiers}} (Tirailleurs indochinois) of the 4th Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles within the Yen Bay garrison turned on their French officers with assistance from about sixty civilian VNQDDĐ members who invaded the camp from the outside. The mutiny failed within 24 hours when {{the majority of}} the Vietnamese soldiers in the garrison <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> and remained loyal to the colonial army. Further sporadic attacks occurred across the Delta region, with little impact. French retribution to the attack was swift and decisive. The main leaders of the VNQDD were arrested, tried and put to death, effectively ending the military threat of what was previously the leading Vietnamese nationalist revolutionary organisation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} the FVdG {{influenced}} strikes in the arms industry as early as February or March 1918, but the organization was not re-established {{on a national level}} until December 1918. On December 14, Fritz Kater started publishing Der Syndikalist (The Syndicalist) in Berlin as a replacement for Die Einigkeit. On December 26 and 27, a conference organized by Kater and attended by 33 delegates from 43 local unions took place in Berlin. The delegates reflected upon the difficult times during the war and proudly noted that the FVdG was the only trade union which did not have to adjust its program to the new political conditions because it had remained loyal to its anti-state and internationalist principles. The delegates reaffirmed their rejection of parliamentarianism and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the National Assembly.|$|E
