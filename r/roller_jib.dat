50|$|In 1968 boat {{designers}} Rod MacApline-Downie and Dick Gibbs {{designed the}} Buccaneer 18. It {{was a popular}} sailboat design, but it led to a demand for a lighter, more affordable boat. Three years later, in 1971, MacApline-Downie and Gibbs finished the design on the Mutineer 15. The Mutineer and Buccaneer are very similar in basic design, and include {{many of the same}} features. At the time it was designed, the Mutineer had several innovative features, including the <b>roller</b> furling <b>jib,</b> spinnaker rigging, and a foredeck launcher tube.|$|R
50|$|The Mutineer 15 {{has gone}} through a series of company changes since its {{introduction}} in 1971. It was designed and first produced by the Marine division of Chrysler. The original design was developed by boat designers, Rod MacAlpine-Downie and Dick Gibbs,who had previously worked on the Buccaneer 18. Several innovative features were included in their design, making the Mutineer 15 suitable for both racing and cruising applications. Some of these features included a <b>roller</b> furling <b>jib,</b> spinnaker rigging, a foredeck launcher tube, hiking straps, and a hiking stick. who included several innovative features in their design.|$|R
50|$|The hull {{design is}} {{low to the}} water and {{marginally}} wide for its length. The transom is open making the cockpit self bailing. Cockpit edges are rounded and comfortable to hike on in conjunction with hiking straps for each crew member. The bowsprit is a retractable carbon fiber pole for the asymmetrical spinnaker, which is launched from an attached bag on the port side. The centerboard boasts an impressive 4 ft draft when down and retracts by swinging aft on a pivot. The rig is supported by one set of upper side stays and one set of lower side stays, along with a forestay integrated into the <b>roller</b> furling <b>jib.</b> There is no backstay, {{and as a result}} the stern remains quite clear most of the time. Controls for the cunningham and boomvang are led back to the skipper under a removable spine that keeps them from becoming tangled in Jib Spinnaker sheets.|$|R
5000|$|The Laser 2 is a {{double-handed}} {{version of}} the popular Laser one-design class of small sailing dinghy. It is a quick, planing dinghy that differs from the Laser in {{that it has a}} jib, symmetric spinnaker and a trapeze for the crew. It was designed by New Zealander Frank Bethwaite and was first launched as a product in Australia then North America in 1979 and in Europe in 1980. The hull is made of GRP (glass reinforced plastic). The rig is a Bermudian rig sloop with spinnaker. It is designed to be a mid to high performance racer. In Britain, its most common current use is at university class in British University Sailing Association (BUSA) events. A version known as the Laser Fun was available, the same hull but featuring a reefable mainsail and a <b>roller</b> furling <b>jib,</b> and with the option of an asymmetric spinnaker (Laser Fun New Wave). As a strict one-design boat the Laser 2 was not available for amateur construction.|$|R
50|$|Most R-22 {{boats are}} now {{equipped}} with Inner Mast Furling (IMF) {{as well as}} <b>roller</b> reefing <b>jibs.</b> The R-22 can be sailed single handed from the large, self-bailing cockpit. The cockpit features a flat floor bottom, comfortable seating, and an optional Boom Room. The boom can be raised or lowered, allowing the boat to be sailed with a Bimini top in place providing shade from the sun. The cabin features a partitioned V-berth, 4' long galley with stove and icebox, {{as well as an}} enclosed head. The cabin ceiling features two standing room hatches and an optional pop top and canvas enclosures. The sailboat also uses the swing keel as a self-centering feature when loading onto the trailer. Unlike most sailboats in its class, this boat features positive foam flotation that render it unsinkable, even if holed. The sturdy mast is supported by 9 stays and 9 chain plates: one forward jib stay, 3 stays on each side, and two back stays. The mast can remain upright with any broken stay, even the single forward jib stay. One R-22 boat was caught in hurricane-force winds in Long Island Sound and knocked down 3 times. The R-22 is unsinkable and self-righting, but hurricane-force winds tested its mettle. It broke one shroud and one stay, but was never de-masted and sailed back to Mamaroneck Harbor when the winds died to about 30 mph.|$|R
