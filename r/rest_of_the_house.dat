It has a plate tracery window with a Trefoil cusping surrounded by wall paintings. The solar separated from the hall by a screens passage.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is {{speculation}} that it may lie on the site of a Roman building, based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie at an angle to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew, which stands on the coast.|$|E
5|$|The term ildebrandshuse (English: fire houses) today {{refer to}} a type of townhouses that was built in large numbers in the years {{immediately}} after the fire. Many of them were modelled on generic renderings made by Johan Cornelius Krieger with inspiration from Christof Marselis. The houses are two or three storeys high, five bays wide and have a prominent wall dormer. The façade towards the street is in brick while the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> has timber framing. They are typically painted in bright colours. Well-preserved examples are today found in locations such as Gråbrødretorv and Gammel Mønt.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave {{him as a}} wedding present. Due to limited financial resources, {{the time required to}} import building materials from the east, and the craftsmanship required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818. After a fire destroyed the log cabin in which the Rowans lived in 1812, they moved into the part of the mansion that was completed, and continued to live there while construction on the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was finished. Federal Hill was once {{believed to be the first}} brick house constructed in the state of Kentucky, but more contemporary sources give the designation to the William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, which was completed in 1794 near Crab Orchard, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built {{on the south side of}} the home.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably colder than the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and they {{feel as if they}} are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes {{in front of them and}} Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} bought by Colonel Joseph Holden Strutt a British soldier and long-standing Member of Parliament. He renovated the house and {{neighbouring}} church. He extended the house {{before his death in}} 1845. His youngest daughter Charlotte Olivia inherited the house and lived there with her husband the Reverend Robert Drummond until her death in 1897. In 1912 it was inherited by Richard Strutt, the youngest son of the second Baron Rayleigh. Richard Strutt added an orangery and built the library to designs by Charles Bateman. In addition he joined the ruined chapel near the gate to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The house was then inherited by his son John Strutt.|$|E
5|$|Woodlea's {{exterior}} {{was designed}} in an Italian Renaissance Revival style. The house {{is said to}} have been modeled after Kimberley Hall in Kimberley, Norfolk. Its classical devices of 18th-century English architecture include urns, pediments, columns, and balusters. The house also is a full-blown expression of the American Renaissance. Woodlea incorporates characteristics of the Beaux-Arts style of architecture– the exterior dictates the use of the interior, with family and guest rooms on the third floor. At the north end of the house, situated farthest from the main entrance, and of a size larger than most houses, is the service wing, which contains the servant quarters. Compared to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> this wing has lower ceilings, smaller windows, and less exterior trim. In the early 1900s, the wing was clad in ivy.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish loggia {{on the southwest}} elevation of the house. Bottomley was able to incorporate the existing parapets, finials and pierced railings and posts from the north library bay windows into the loggia design, with a ceiling reconstructed from a sixteenth-century house {{on the grounds of}} a manor in Knole, Kent, England. Wall tiles were used which indicated use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his loggia was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of picturesqueness and romance that the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the loggia was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for his drawings and construction.|$|E

5|$|Some of the house's {{architecture}} {{also reflects}} the influences from contemporary buildings across North Wales, in particular Gwydir Castle, built by Robert Wynn's father John. Plas Mawr lacks a fashionable long gallery, for example, which was popular in England at the time, and was {{already beginning to}} appear in Welsh houses. Instead, it has a rear turret, or belvedere, which is raised prominently above {{the height of the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> overlooking the town: this was a slightly antiquated feature, but was widely used in other Wynn family properties, including Bodysgallen Hall. The design of Plas Mawr influenced other buildings in North Wales at the time, including the redecoration of Gwydir Castle, Maenan Hall further up the Conwy valley, Plas Mawr in Caernarfon and Hen Blas in Beaumaris. It also later shaped the architecture of 19th- and 20th-century buildings in Conwy itself, surviving examples of which include the town's police station and the Castlebank Hotel.|$|E
25|$|For the BBTV task, a {{newsroom}} was built, {{where two}} housemates transmitted {{news to the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> such as messages from home. The rooms were also used as a studio for a gameshow and later a talent show.|$|E
25|$|Gein {{held on to}} {{the farm}} and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, {{including}} the upstairs, downstairs parlor, and living room, leaving them untouched; while the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> became increasingly squalid, these rooms remained pristine. Gein lived thereafter in a small room next to the kitchen. Around this time, he became interested in reading death-cult magazines and adventure stories, particularly those involving cannibals or Nazi atrocities.|$|E

50|$|The {{land was}} bought by John Jones in 1722, and <b>the</b> first <b>houses</b> to be built were 3-7 {{on the south side}} in 1724, with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> his nephew and {{son-in-law}} John Price. Jones died in 1727, and left his property in Kensington to his wife Rebecca and his son-in-law, who built most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> by 1736. It was originally called Parson's Yard, and was renamed as Holland Street in the early 1800s.|$|R
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring <b>the</b> style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>houses.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|R
25|$|The house's {{interior}} {{was carried out}} by architects James S. Kuhne and Percival H. Goodman from Chicago and New York respectively. The interior, painted in shades of yellow, coral, and blue, was designed in the Modernist style—as was the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The central part of the interior features a living and dining room connected via an aluminum staircase to an overhanging balcony with access to the terrace. The house's two bedrooms and the only bathroom, were located on the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|Two police {{officers}} {{responded to the}} 911 call and arrived at the Ramsey home within three minutes. They conducted a cursory search of the house but {{did not find any}} sign of a break-in or forced entry. John made arrangements to pay the ransom. A forensics team was dispatched to the house. Believing that the case was a kidnapping, only JonBenét's bedroom was cordoned off to prevent contamination of evidence. There was no process taken to prevent contamination of evidence in the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} eighties, An Bord Pleanála finally granted {{permission}} for its wings to be demolished. In 1981, it {{was stripped of}} its wings. These constituted {{seventy percent of the}} house. The essential conditions that called for the restoration of the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> were subsequently ignored. When the wings were demolished, nothing was done to prop up the remainder of the house. Despite this, the building was still structurally safe. The Corporation had argued that the proposed development was unsuitable for the area. Once Roches had completed their Department Store, the conservationists had no legal leg to stand on, since permission to demolish the house was effective once permission to develop the site had been granted. They became unwilling to negotiate with the conservationists. Roches declared that Frescati was beyond restoration. Marie Avis Walker pointed out that the British Embassy in Merrion Square, which had been gutted by fire, had been restored.|$|E

25|$|More {{pictures}} were {{released to the}} press later in the day. These depicted {{the exterior of the}} Diary Room, this year a chaotic web of sliced and angled mirrors giving housemates a distorted reflection of the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> These pictures also showed that the house was composed of one main, column-free, airy room with cream-coloured carpeting on which the dining table rested and an elevated kitchen containing a row of yellow cabinets. For the first time, an American-style refrigerator was utilised, giving the housemates more space for food and located next to the store-room. However, the glass wall that allowed housemates to view the bedroom from the living area was disguised as a mirror to ensure that viewers {{would not be able to}} count how many housemates would be in the House. Finally, only a few days before launch night, pictures of a loft in the garden leaked to the press. On Day 1, it was shown that it was painted green rather than the pink shown in the pictures.|$|E

500|$|In the 2001 case of Kyllo v. United States, Scalia {{wrote the}} Court's opinion in a 5–4 {{decision}} that cut across ideological lines. That decision found thermal imaging {{of a home}} to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter than the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> because of indoor growing lights. Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, {{on the ground that}} at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable. In a 1990 First Amendment case, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a St. Paul, Minnesota, hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross. Scalia noted, [...] "Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire".|$|E
