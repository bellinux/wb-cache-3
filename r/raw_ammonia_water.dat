The obtained powder {{was characterized by}} XRD, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy, TEM and etc. Its photocatalytic activity under UV light was evaluated with methyl orange solution as target contaminant. The results from XRD analysis showed that the titled TiO 2 existed in an anatase phase. The particle size read from XRD was 5 ~ 10 nm, in general accordance with that from TEM. XPS analysis exhibited an N 1 s peak around 399 eV, which indicated an N-Ti-O structure in TiO 2. UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy exhibited a red shift of the absorption edge, which indicated that the sample had a certain absorption of visible light at 400 ~ 500 nm. The results of photocatalysis experiment proved that the titled TiO 2 has a higher photocatalytic activity. </p...|$|R

The model comprises three interconnected components: the gas furnace, the distillation column and the rectifier. The furnace is modeled like a well-stirred single volume. The distillation column and the rectifier are discretized along their axial dimension. Several heat transfer mechanisms are simultaneously solved: radiative and convective heat transfer between combustion products and generator finned surface, flow boiling and pool boiling in the two-phase <b>ammonia</b> <b>water</b> mixture inside the distillation column. The model is applied to operating conditions of interest in real applications. The generated outputs provide insight on the internal gradients, the quantification of gas furnace efficiency, and effectiveness of solution boiling and internal heat recovery.
