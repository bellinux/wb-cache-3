40|$|Abstract: Conscious events {{interact}} with memory systems in learning, rehearsal and retrieval (Ebbinghaus 1885 / 1964; Tulving 1985). Here we present hypotheses {{that arise from}} the IDA computional model (Franklin, Kelemen and McCauley 1998; Franklin 2001 b) of global workspace theory (Baars 1988, 2002). Our primary tool for this exploration is a flexible cognitive cycle employed by the IDA computational model and hypothesized to be a basic element of human cognitive processing. Since cognitive cycles are hypothesized to occur five to ten times a second and include interaction between conscious contents {{and several of the}} memory systems, they provide the means for an exceptionally fine-grained analysis of various cognitive tasks. We apply this tool to the small effect size of subliminal learning compared to supraliminal learning, to process dissociation, to implicit learning, to <b>recognition</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>recall,</b> and to the availability heuristic in recall. The IDA model elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory, transient episodic memory, and procedural memory. In most cases, memory is hypothesized to {{interact with}} conscious events for its normal functioning. The methodology of the paper is unusual in that the hypotheses and explanations presented are derived from an empirically based, but broad and qualitative computational model of human cognition...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{examining}} working memory for sequences of instructions have demonstrated a performance advantage when instructions are physically enacted rather than verbally recalled. However, {{little is known}} about the source of this effect, or how instructions are stored in working memory more generally. In particular, no previous studies have compared impacts of enactment on encoding <b>vs.</b> <b>recall</b> in working <b>memory.</b> We conducted an experiment to examine the impact of enactment on both the encoding and recall phases of a task measuring memory for sequences of simple action-object pairs (e. g. touch the circle, spin the cross, flip the square [...] .) in young adult participants. An advantage for enacted over verbal recall was observed, in line with recent evidence. In addition, enactment of actions during the encoding phase on each trial significantly facilitated subsequent performance; this effect was particularly apparent for verbal repetition rather than enacted recall. These findings are interpreted as reflecting a beneficial role for spatial-motoric coding in working memory, that can be engaged either through action planning or physical performance...|$|R
40|$|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is {{characterized}} by intrusive recall of the traumatic memory. While numerous studies have investigated the neural processing mechanisms engaged during trauma <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> in PTSD, these analyses have only focused on group-level contrasts that reveal little about the predictive validity of the identified brain regions. By contrast, a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) approach towards identifying the neural mechanisms engaged during trauma <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> would entail testing whether a multivariate set of brain regions is reliably predictive of (i. e., discriminates) whether an individual is engaging in trauma or non-trauma <b>memory</b> <b>recall.</b> Here, we use a MVPA approach to test 1) whether trauma <b>memory</b> <b>vs</b> neutral <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> can be predicted reliably using a multivariate set of brain regions among women with PTSD related to assaultive violence exposure (N= 16), 2) the methodological parameters (e. g., spatial smoothing, number of <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> repetitions, etc.) that optimize classification accuracy and reproducibility of the feature weight spatial maps, and 3) the correspondence between brain regions that discriminate trauma <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> and the brain regions predicted by neurocircuitry models of PTSD. Cross-validation classification accuracy was significantly above chance for all methodological permutations tested; mean accuracy across participants was 76 % for the methodological parameters selected as optimal for both efficiency and accuracy. Classification accuracy was significantly better for a voxel-wise approach relative to voxels within restricted regions-of-interest (ROIs); classification accuracy did not differ when using PTSD-related ROIs compared to randomly generated ROIs. ROI-based analyses suggested the reliable involvement of the left hippocampus in discriminating <b>memory</b> <b>recall</b> across participants and that {{the contribution of the}} left amygdala to the decision function was dependent upon PTSD symptom severity. These results have methodological implications for real-time fMRI neurofeedback of the trauma memory in PTSD and conceptual implications for neurocircuitry models of PTSD that attempt to explain core neural processing mechanisms mediating PTSD...|$|R

The Hirst [Hirst, W., Johnson, M. K., Phelps, E. A., & Volpe, B. T. (1988). More on recognition and recall in amnesics. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, & Cognition, 14, 758 - 762] technique for titrating exposure times {{was used to}} match recognition memory performance {{as closely as possible}} before comparing <b>recall</b> <b>memory</b> scores. Data were available from two different control groups given differing exposure times. Each of the patient groups showed poorer <b>recall</b> <b>memory</b> performance than recognition scores, proportionate to the difference seen in healthy participants. When patients' scores were converted to Z-scores, {{there was no significant difference}} between mean Z-recall and Z-recognition scores. When plotted on a scatterplot, the majority of the data-points indicating disproportionately low <b>recall</b> <b>memory</b> scores came from healthy controls or patients with pathology extending into the lateral temporal lobes, rather than from patients with pathology confined to the medial temporal lobes. Patients with atrophy extending into the parahippocampal gyrus (H+) performed worse than patients with atrophy confined to the hippocampi (H-); but, when H- patients were given a shorter exposure time (5 s) and compared with H+ at a longer exposure (10 s), their performance was virtually identical and did not indicate any disproportionate <b>recall</b> <b>memory</b> impairment in the H- group. Parahippocampal volumes on MRI correlated significantly with both <b>recall</b> and recognition <b>memory.</b> The possibility that findings were confounded by inter-stimulus artefacts was examined and rejected. These findings argue against the view that hippocampal amnesia or memory disorders in general are typically characterised by a disproportionate impairment in <b>recall</b> <b>memory.</b> Disproportionate <b>recall</b> <b>memory</b> impairment has been observed in a number of published cases, and the reason for the varying pattern obtained across hippocampal patients requires further examination...|$|R

40|$|Background: Eye {{movement}} desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is {{an effective}} treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. The working memory (WM) theory explains its efficacy: recall of an aversive memory and making eye movements (EM) both produce cognitive load, and competition for the limited WM resources reduces the memory's vividness and emotionality. The present study tested several predictions from WM theory. Objective: We hypothesized that 1) recall of an aversive autobiographical memory loads WM compared to no recall, and 2) recall with EM reduces the vividness, emotionality, and cognitive load of <b>recalling</b> the <b>memory</b> more than only recall or only cognitive effort (i. e., recall of an irrelevant memory with EM). Method: Undergraduates (N= 108) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three conditions: 1) <b>recall</b> relevant <b>memory</b> with EM, 2) <b>recall</b> relevant <b>memory</b> without EM, and 3) <b>recall</b> irrelevant <b>memory</b> with EM.
