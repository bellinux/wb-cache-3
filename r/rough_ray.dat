When Universal Pictures allowed Johnny Mack Brown's contract to lapse, Monogram grabbed him and kept him busy through 1952.|$|R
40|$|A real valued {{function}} of one variable φ {{is called a}} metric transform if for every metric space (X,d) the composition d_φ = φ∘ d is also a metric on X. We give a complete characterization {{of the class of}} approximately nondecreasing, unbounded metric transforms φ such that the transformed Euclidean half line ([0,∞),|·|_φ) is Gromov hyperbolic. A consequence of this result is a type of rigidity with respect to metric transformation of roughly geodesic Gromov hyperbolic spaces: If (X,d) is any metric space containing a <b>rough</b> geodesic <b>ray</b> and φ is an approximately nondecreasing, unbounded metric transform such that the transformed space (X,d_φ) is Gromov hyperbolic and roughly geodesic then φ is an approximate dilation and (X,d) is Gromov hyperbolic and roughly geodesic.

50|$|In {{her book}} Off With Their Heads!: A Serio-Comic Tale Of Hollywood, screenwriter Frances Marion wrote that {{numerous}} people attempted to dissuade Ray from making the film because lengthy costume dramas were not box office draws at the time. Ray {{chose not to}} listen to the advice and, after failing to secure financial backing from a major studio, he put up $500,000 (approximately $ today) of his own money to finance the film. Ray began filming The Courtship of Miles Standish in January 1923 at his namesake studio on Sunset Boulevard. Production costs quickly rose as Ray spent money with abandon. In addition to the $65,000 (approximately $ today) 180-ton replica of the Mayflower that was set on a mechanism to simulate it being on <b>rough</b> seas, <b>Ray</b> also had full sized log cabins built solely for exterior shots. By the end of filming, Ray had invested all of his saving, nearly $2 million (approximately $ today), and borrowed additional funds at a 30% interest rate to finish the film. The film's final budget was estimated at $3 million (approximately $ today).|$|R
40|$|First arrival traveltime {{methods have}} proven to fail to image deeper structure, {{when most of the}} {{reflected}} energy is transported by later arrivals. The family of ray tracing methods {{is one of the few}} available alternatives to generate Green’s functions with multiple arrivals. Dynamic ray methods also compute amplitudes and phase-shifts. Even in <b>rough</b> structures, <b>ray</b> methods can be used to compute useful Green’s functions, if the model is properly smoothed. We discuss ways to obtain a good image with Green’s functions computed with the paraxial ray tracing method in the 2 -D Marmousi model. Our paraxial ray tracing implementation uses the paraxial and regularity conditions to limit the region where the paraxial solution for a specific ray is useful. Smoothing the model, does not only make the model more “ray valid”, but also makes the high frequency wavefield more like the band-limited solution. We apply a merging of phases technique to reduce two nearby arrivals into one. This technique reduces the high frequency noise in the image significantly at a similar cost as using just the most energetic arrival. Smoothing over a length proportional to the local wavelength of the center-frequency, results in a better image than just smoothing over a constant length. Using the two most energetic arrivals, instead of just the most energetic, improves the image of the “target ” zone...|$|R
