50|$|In {{population}} ecology and economics, {{maximum sustainable yield}} or MSY is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) {{that can be taken}} from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Fundamental to the notion of sustainable harvest, the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely. Under the assumption of logistic growth, <b>resource</b> <b>limitation</b> does not constrain individuals’ reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small. At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the carrying capacity, individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate. At this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals. Above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity. At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield.|$|E
40|$|Clonal growth allows {{plants to}} spread {{horizontally}} and to experience {{different levels of}} resources. If ramets remain physiologically integrated, clonal plants can reciprocally translocate resources between ramets in heterogeneous environments. But {{little is known about}} the interaction between benefits of clonal integration and patterns of resource heterogeneity in different patches, i. e., coincident patchiness or reciprocal patchiness. We hypothesized that clonal integration will show different effects on ramets in different patches and more benefit to ramets under reciprocal patchiness than to those under coincident patchiness, as well as that the benefit from clonal integration is affected by the position of proximal and distal ramets under reciprocal or coincident patchiness. A pot experiment was conducted with clonal fragments consisting of two interconnected ramets (proximal and distal ramet) of Fragaria orientalis. In the experiment, proximal and distal ramets were grown in high or low availability of resources, i. e., light and water. <b>Resource</b> <b>limitation</b> was applied either simultaneously to both ramets of a clonal fragment (coincident <b>resource</b> <b>limitation)</b> or separately to different ramets of the same clonal fragment (reciprocal <b>resource</b> <b>limitation).</b> Half of the clonal fragments were connected while the other half were severed.

Results are discussed in terms of a post-interpretive processing impairment in these patients. Two additional experiments investigated possible determinants of sentence comprehension impairments in DAT. One employed a dual-task paradigm to examine the effect of increasing the processing load associated with sentence comprehension. The other examined processing <b>resource</b> <b>limitations</b> in the patients tested in the first and second experiments by employing a battery of tasks designed to measure all aspects of working memory.

40|$|Protein {{production}} in gene transcription networks {{relies on the}} availability of resources necessary for transcription and translation, such as RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosomes, which are found in cells in limited amounts. As various genes in a network compete for a common pool of resources, a hidden layer of interactions among genes arises. Such interactions are not reflected by standard Hill-function-based models and their interaction graphs. Recent experimental results have revealed that <b>resource</b> <b>limitations</b> can affect the behavior of gene networks, and thus impede our efforts to analyze and design gene transcription networks. This thesis mainly addresses two problems: how to model the hidden interactions due to <b>resource</b> <b>limitations,</b> and the potential effects of these hidden interactions. A model is developed to account for the sharing of limited amounts of RNAP and ribosomes in gene networks. The model is based on deterministic reaction rate equations, and can be reduced to have the same dimension as the standard Hill-function-based models. Hidden interactions due to <b>resource</b> <b>limitations</b> are identified using this model, and transformed into simple rules to modify the interaction graph of a network. The model is applied to two common network motifs, the activation and repression cascades, where the hidden interactions dramatically change their behaviors. In particular, it is demonstrated that, as a result of <b>resource</b> <b>limitations,</b> a cascade of activators can behave like an effective repressor or a biphasic system, and that a repression cascade can become bistable. The results presented in this thesis may be helpful to mitigate the undesirable effects arising from <b>resource</b> <b>limitations</b> in the future. by Yili Qian. Thesis: S.

However, variation in plant intrinsic traits {{in response to}} resource availability may modify the bottom-up effects. Furthermore, the consequences also may depend on the feeding strategy of insect herbivores belonging to different feeding guilds. We evaluated the performance of two insect herbivores from distinct feeding guilds, the leaf miner Tuta absoluta and the phloem feeder Bemisia tabaci. We offered the insects two tomato cultivars growing under optimal nitrogen input vs. nitrogen limitation, or under optimal water input vs. water limitation. We found that: (i) the two cultivars differed in their responses to nitrogen and water limitation by regulating primary (leaf-gas exchange related parameters, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf C/N ratio) and secondary metabolism (main defensive compounds: glycoalkaloids); (ii) for both plant cultivars, nitrogen or water limitation significantly affected T. absoluta survival and development, while B. tabaci survival was affected only by nitrogen limitation; and surprisingly (iii) plant cultivar differences did not modify the negative bottom-up effects of <b>resource</b> <b>limitation</b> on the two insect herbivores.
