40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical <b>references.</b> The <b>shareholder</b> {{benefit is}} noncash gifts and {{services}} Japanese companies provide to their shareholders. We find that firms that initiate the shareholder benefit program experience {{a significant increase}} in the number of individual investors but the average number of shares held by individual investors become smaller, indicating a more diffused ownership by individual investors. Our analyses on the price movement and trade volume around the ex-benefit day show that the shareholder benefit is reflected in the stock price around the ex-benefit day, providing evidence of an existence of shareholder benefit clientele in Japan. We also find a positive relation between firm value and the number of individual investors, our proxy for the investor recognition, consistent with Merton's (1987) investor recognition hypothesis. The positive relationship, however, does not hold when firm age is 10 years or older, asset size is larger than the median value, and the percentage ownership structure by individuals exceeds 51 %. Our analyses suggest a possible trade-off between the improvement in investor recognition and the deterioration in effective monitoring due to more diffused ownership by individual investors...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{classification models}} of deceptive discussions during quarterly earnings conference calls. Using data on subsequent financial restatements (and a set of criteria to identify especially serious accounting problems), we label the Question and Answer section of each call as “truthful ” or “deceptive”. Our models are developed with the word categories that have been shown by previous psychological and linguistic research {{to be related to}} deception. Using conservative statistical tests, we find that the outof-sample performance of the models that are based on CEO or CFO narratives is significantly better than random by 4 %- 6 % (with 50 %- 65 % accuracy) and provides a significant improvement to a model based on discretionary accruals and traditional controls. We find that answers of deceptive executives have more references to general knowledge, fewer non-extreme positive emotions, and fewer <b>references</b> to <b>shareholders</b> value and value creation. In addition, deceptive CEOs use significantly fewer selfreferences, more third person plural and impersonal pronouns, more extreme positive emotions, fewer extreme negative emotions, and fewer certainty and hesitation words. We would like to thank Thomas Quinn for his help in securing the FactSet data and Daniel Jurafsky...|$|R

40|$|Individuals {{investing}} in a venture capital trust (VCT) IPO listed on the London Stock Exchange receive a number of conditional tax incentives; the time-related nature of the associated conditions can create a ?lock-in effect?. By deriving and testing {{a model of the}} value of these incentives we examine how they influence investors? pricing and trading decisions. This paper contributes to the ongoing tax capitalisation debate in three ways: first, by calculating the magnitude of the lock-in effect without <b>reference</b> to underlying <b>shareholder</b> records; second, by adopting a time series approach in view of the time-varying magnitude of the potential lock-in effect, and thereby avoiding control issues involved in cross-sectional analysis of the effects of taxation on pricing; and third, by focusing on changes in the bid?ask spread rather than, for example, mid price, so reducing the impact of changes in the market value of the instruments under consideration on the analysis. Our results have direct policy implications in suggesting a conflict between the existence of time-related conditional tax incentives and the requirement for VCTs to be listed on the London Stock Exchange explicitly in order to promote liquidity in a historically illiquid sector of the market.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze whether the {{institutional}} environment has a direct effect on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting practices or if this effect is explained by the influence of the institutional environment on Corporate Governance (CG) mechanisms. To conduct our study, we focused on two countries that reflect different types of institutional environment: relation-based (Brazil) and rule-based (Spain). Based on our results, we can affirm that the institutional environment influences CG mechanisms (Board Size and <b>Reference</b> <b>Shareholder)</b> as well as companies’ CSR disclosure. Additionally, the CG mechanisms affected by the institutional environment also help to explain differences in CSR reporting practices. As relation-based societies evolve into rules-based environments, the information disclosed about CSR becomes more complex due to a strengthening of CG mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{relation}} between capital structure, ownership structure, and corporate value for a sample of 1, 216 firms from 15 European countries. Our results stress two different conflicts of interest and show the differential {{role played by the}} mechanisms of corporate control depending on the legal and institutional environment. In common law countries, {{as a consequence of the}} relationships between managers and shareholders, capital structure and managerial ownership are the most effective mechanisms of control. In civil law countries, however, as a consequence of the conflicts between majority and minority shareholders, the ownership concentration and the sharing of control within the firm become crucial. In this scenario, the second <b>reference</b> <b>shareholder</b> plays a critical role in contesting the control of the dominant largest shareholder in order to reduce the extraction of private benefits and improve the firm?s performanceLaw and finance approach, capital structure, ownership structure, corporate governance. ...|$|E
40|$|Companies have to {{continue}} with their businesses in the current uncertain environment triggered by the economic crisis. Since the decrease {{in the performance of}} companies is a reality, academicians, managers and entrepreneur are worried about what may be happening with Corporate Social Responsibility. Because of the strong impact of the crisis on Spain, we are going to study its effect on the CSR behaviour of Spanish companies. Therefore, we analyse whether the performance of the company, as well as some shareholding characteristics, influence CSR before and during the crisis. The results show that large Spanish companies continue to carry out CSR actions despite the effects of the crisis on their financial health. It seems that shareholders are more influential than managers in these strategic and entrepreneurial decisions. Additionally, the presence of a <b>reference</b> <b>shareholder</b> means that companies are more committed to CSR, although a higher percentage of insider shareholders cause the contrary effect...|$|E
40|$|Divestment {{activities}} {{have become a}} popular trend in recent years. This thesis is a pioneering UK study examining divestitures from three points of view: shareholder wealth; corporate governance, and the life cycle. While the growth factor is important for most firms, most previous divestment research appears not to have given enough emphasis to the growth variable. This research emphasises {{the importance of the}} growth variable and the importance of two variables, growth and concentration ratio, are examined in a classification study, thereby enhancing previous research. Furthermore, most of the previous literature would appear to have made a more general investigation of divestments without <b>reference</b> to <b>shareholder</b> wealth or the corporate governance characteristics of each life cycle stage. The question is then raised: “Will market reaction to divesting firms be different when they are classified into different life-cycle sub-samples?” This study classifies divestments into different life cycle stages and seeks to provide a detailed study of understanding market reaction and corporate governance across the life cycle. For the cluster analysis, three clusters (late expansion, early maturity and mature/decline) are found. Young firms have lower agency problems and older firms have higher agency problems. The research builds a detailed picture of share price performance for different life cycle stages, finding that the market takes a more positive view of divestitures across the life cycle on the divestitures announcement day. In contrast, the market takes a less positive view for divestures across the life cycle during the post-announcement period, including day 0 to day + 60. Finally, the research uses regression analysis to examine the impact of different corporate governance variables on the stock market reaction across different stages of the life cycle. The finding is that the size of the divested unit is positively significant for divesting firms for all three stages in the life cycle. The corporate governance variable still plays quite {{an important role in the}} regression. ...|$|R
40|$|Bankers’ Compensation Schemes {{have long}} been a topic of {{interest}} for regulators and academics alike, with early seminal work on the links between pay and performance by Jensen and Meckling (1976), and early discussions around the impact of compensation on risk taking by Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1982). Despite interest saturating over time, the Financial Crisis of 2007 / 2008 catapulted Bankers’ Compensation Schemes back into the headlines of media and the forefront of politics. Much of the focus was generated due to the speculation that bankers’ compensation schemes were thought to allow and reward excessive risk taking behavior, which Jickling (2010) describes {{as one of the}} contributing factors to the Financial Crisis. Naturally a succession of reforms in the Financial Sector have been proposed aimed at averting future financial catastrophes. Notably, the Dodd Frank Review (2010) which forms part of what Obama describes as ‘the biggest reform of the Financial Sector since The Great Depression’. Part of the proposed reform has targeted bankers’ compensation schemes, from official reports such as the Dodd Frank review but also academic studies such as Bebchuk and Spamann (2009). Whilst the proposed reform responds logically to evidence on the risk-compensation relationship from studies such as Rajgopal and Shevlin (2002), the reforms fail to address the counter evidence and concerns. Such concerns are raised by numerous academics and financial commentators such as Carpenter and Walter (2010), Jensen and Murphy (1990), with particular <b>reference</b> to excessive <b>shareholder</b> risk taking and the composition of equity payments. The primary goal {{of this paper is to}} provide further more conclusive evidence on the extent to which current Bankers’ Compensation Schemes induce excessively risky strategies, whilst addressing some of the flaws in previous studies, detailed in the unique contributions of this paper. The findings will be of crucial importance as compensation reform will undoubtedly trouble the Financial Industry, so reform will need to have solid economic rationale, thus dismissing claims from the industry that it is a political knee jerk reaction to punish Bankers for the Crisis...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the implications that the Enron collapse holds {{out for the}} self-regulatory system of corporate governance. The case shows that the incentive structure that motivates actors in the system generates much less powerful checks against abuse than many observers have believed. Even as academics have proclaimed rising governance standards, some standards have declined, particularly those addressed to the numerology of shareholder value. The Article 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry begins with Enron 2 ̆ 7 s business plan. The Article asserts {{that there may be}} more to Enron 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 virtual firm 2 ̆ 2 strategy than meets the eye beholding a firm in collapse. The Article restates the strategy as an application of the incomplete contracts theory of the firm that prevails in microeconomics today and asserts that Enron failed because its pursuit of immediate shareholder value caused it to misapply the economics, mistaking its own inflated stock market capitalization for fundamental value. The Article proceeds to Enron 2 ̆ 7 s collapse, telling four causation stories. This er ante description draws on information available to the actors who forced Enron into bankruptcy in December 2001. The discussion accounts for the behavior of Enron 2 ̆ 7 s principals by <b>reference</b> to the <b>shareholder</b> value norm and Enron 2 ̆ 7 s corporate culture. Finally. the Article takes up the self-regulatory system of corporate governance, asserting that the case justifies no fundamental reform. The costs of any significant new regulation can outweigh the compliance yield particularly in a system committed to open a wide field for entrepreneurial risk taking. If we seek high returns, we must discount for the risk that rationality and reputation will sometimes prove inadequate as constraints. At the same time. we should hold critical gatekeepers, particularly auditors, to high professional standards. The Article argues that present reform discussions respecting the audit function do not adequately confront the problem of capture demonstrated in this case...|$|R
5000|$|In July 1860 the Port Carlisle company {{obtained}} an Act {{giving it}} running powers over the N&C's Canal Branch and authorising {{the issue of}} another £40,000 of preference stock. In 1861 the Silloth company introduced a Bill to build a branch from Abbey, crossing the Maryport and Carlisle at Leegate to serve collieries south of the M&C around Mealsgate, and to raise another £180,000 by preference shares and borrowing. The Maryport and Carlisle Railway would have welcomed the branch if it had gone no further than a junction with the M&C at Leegate, but regarded its continuation to Mealsgate as an invasion of their territory, and accordingly opposed the Bill, offering to introduce a Bill of their own in the next parliamentary session for a loop off the M&C main line to serve the Mealsgate collieries. At the committee hearing on the Silloth company's Bill, counsel for the company admitted it was insolvent, {{and the secretary of}} the company said that 'it was no secret' that borrowings had exceeded that authorised by parliament, and that thousands of pounds had been spent at Silloth on streets, sewerage, gasworks, hotel, and baths - all things helping the formation of a seaside resort, but none of them things on which expenditure was authorised by the company's Act of Incorporation. Without hearing witnesses opposed to the branch, the committee rejected the bill. Cross-examination of company witnesses had been used to explore the extent to which Silloth directors had persistently used their personal wealth to circumvent the requirements and limits of the company's Act, and the Carlisle Patriot, feeling amply justified, commented that the evidence [...] "disclosed such a state of reckless management and pecuniary insolvency that we may assume the Committee deemed it high time to stop the parties from adding to their misfortunes and difficulties"; [...] "it shows the exact position in which the Company, or rather, the Directors and Manager of the company, now stand with <b>reference</b> to the <b>shareholders,</b> the creditors, and the public. It is evident that Parliament, in future, means to refuse to legalise reckless and wanton expenditure upon objects ultra vires the act of incorporation: all such unauthorised expenditure will therefore have to be borne by the parties by whom it is contracted." ...|$|R
