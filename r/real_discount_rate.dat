50|$|Neither {{fiscal gap}} {{accounting}} nor generational accounting are perfect measures of fiscal sustainability. Neither suffers from economics severe labeling problem. But both raise the thorny {{issue of how}} to discount future taxes and transfers when they are uncertain. The Social Security Trustees Report, in Table IVB6, provides an infinite horizon fiscal gap analysis each year for the Social Security System by itself in which the actuaries use a 3 percent <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> The size of the fiscal gap can {{be sensitive to the}} choice of the discount rate. But so is the size of the present value of future GDP against which it is compared. Hence, the ratio of the fiscal gap to the present value of GDP is much less sensitive to the choice of discount rate. It is this ratio that determines what adjustment is needed to eliminate the fiscal gap. In the U.S. case, the fiscal gap is now 12 percent of the present value of GDP, suggesting that an immediate and permanent fiscal adjustment equal to 12 percent of GDP would be required to eliminate the fiscal gap.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Silvopasture is {{the planned}} and managed {{agroforestry}} {{system in which}} forage, livestock, and trees or shrubs are integrated {{in order to enhance}} individual components. Silvopasture has been identified as the most promising agroforestry system for the Pacific Northwest and Southeast United States. However, there have been few studies describing the economic viability of silvopasture in these regions. There are two objectives explored in this study: first, to determine the potential for silvopasture as an economically viable income source to farmers in eastern North Carolina and northeastern Oregon by calculating the Land Expectation Value (LEV), Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Annual Expectation Value (AEV), of realistic silvopastoral management regimes, compared to traditionally managed timber or livestock farms; second, to explore whether silvopasture can store as much or more carbon than a traditionally stocked timber plantation, and whether profits from sequestered carbon are possible at this time in the United States. The most profitable silvopasture regimes for eastern North Carolina were cool season grasses combined with loblolly pine at a four percent <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> (LEV = 1, 025 per acre) and cool season grasses combined with longleaf pine at a four percent <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> (LEV = 285 per acre). Traditionally stocked loblolly pine at a four percent <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> accrued an LEV of 1, 777 per acre, while longleaf pine had negative returns (LEV = - 143 per acre). The cattle standard model for eastern North Carolina accrued an LEV of 2, 069 per acre at a four percent <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> The most profitable silvopasture regime for northeast Oregon was native forage establishment with ponderosa pine at a four percent <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> (LEV = 274 per acre). Planted ponderosa pine had negative returns for all economic indicators (LEV at four percent <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> = - 411). The cattle standard model accrued an LEV of 954 per acre at a four percent <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Models suggest loblolly pine timber management and cattle management is more profitable than silvopasture management in eastern North Carolina. Additionally, cattle management is more profitable than silvopasture in northeastern Oregon. Longleaf pine and ponderosa pine are not profitable when solely managed for timber, and benefit economically when combined with livestock. There is a growing appreciation for ecosystem services from Silvopasture in the scientific and public community. Tree canopy provides shade and a barrier from adverse weather for livestock herds. Silvopasture can also aid in increased biological diversity, reduced erosion, increased nutrient uptake, and enhanced carbon sequestration. In addition, silvopasture has the potential to store significant amounts of carbon, which benefits society as a whole. Therefore, it is amenable to include the social externalities of profitability in cash flow analyses. Currently there are only voluntary cap and trade markets. The most well-known is arguably the California Air Resources Board (ARB), regulated by the California Environmental Protection Agency. Unfortunately, silvopasture does not qualify at this time for carbon markets in the United States...|$|E

40|$|The rule-of-thumb {{method of}} {{adjusting}} <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> for income taxes is (after-tax rate) = (before-tax rate) × (1 – tax rate). Previous researchers {{have concluded that}} the rule-of-thumb adjustment for income taxes is accurate only when the investment alternative used to define the opportunity cost of capital has certain characteristics: if other investments are limited to land rental, taxable bonds, and bank certificates of deposit, for example. In the present article we demonstrate that inflation is also an important factor in the rule-of-thumb’s accuracy in accounting for income taxes. If the unmodified rule-of-thumb adjustment for income taxes is applied to a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> specified in uninflated terms, the estimated <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> may be significantly higher or lower than the actual rate. If applied to real interest rates and not corrected for the effect of inflation, the rule-of-thumb will overestimate the after-tax <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> that is equivalent to a specific before-tax rate; it will underestimate the before-tax rate equivalent to an after-tax rate specified in <b>real</b> terms. <b>Discount</b> <b>rates</b> estimated by the unmodified rule-of-thumb applied in real terms can be six percentage points or more too high or too low, depending on the rate of inflation, the income tax rate, and whether a before-tax or an after-tax <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is being estimated.

40|$|A simple {{model that}} is {{commonly}} used to interpret movements in corporate common stock. price indexes asserts that real stock prices equal {{the present value of}} rationally expected or optimally forecasted future real dividends discounted by a constant <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> This valuation model (or variations on it in which the <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is not constant but fairly stable) is often used by economists and market analysts alike as a plausible model to describe the behavior of aggregate market indexes and is viewed as providing a reasonable story to tell when people ask what accounts for a sudden movement in stock price indexes. Such movements are then attributed to "new information" about future dividends. I will refer to this model as the "efficient markets mode" although it should be recognized that this name has also been applied to other models. It has often been claimed in popular discussions that stock price indexes seem too "volatile," that is, that the movements in stock price indexes could not realistically be attributed to any objective new information, since movements in the price indexes seem to be "too big " relative to actual subsequent events. Recently, the notion that financial asset prices are too volatile to accord with efficient markets has received some econometric support in papers by Stephen LeRo...|$|E

The authors also show that plausible combinations of lower expected future <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> and higher expected real dividend (earnings) growth could rationalize current broad market stock values, raising the possibility that changes in market fundamentals have made a major contribution to the run-up in stock prices.

40|$|Alternative {{corporate}} tax systems {{differ in their}} ability to adapt to changes in the rate of inflation. Absent complete indexing of depreciation allowances, a tax system may use the expected inflation rate to set accelerated depreciation allowances in a way that minimizes the welfare loss from them is allocation of capital. This welfare loss is a nonlinear function of the assumed inflation rate, however, so the welfare loss at the expected inflation rate may be quite different from the expected welfare loss. We compute these two welfare concepts for each of three alternative {{corporate tax}} schemes in the U. S. and for two different relationships between inflation and interest rates. One important finding is that the Auerbach-Jorgenson first year recovery plan is not equivalent to indexing as is often claimed, if uncertainty about inflation implies uncertainty about the <b>real</b> after-tax <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the dynamic {{relationship between the}} series of monetary aggregates M 1 and M 2 for the period 1972 - 2014. M 1 and M 2 are the dependent variables, while the explanatory variables are <b>real</b> income, <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation <b>rate,</b> <b>real</b> exchange rate, and remittances. The ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration is used to investigate the existence of long-run and short-run effects of remittances on monetary aggregates. The results show that remittances exert only positive effects on real narrow money demand in the end, suggesting that in Pakistan remittances are used {{for the purpose of}} consumption. Both money demand functions are stable in Pakistan, but the longrun effect of M 1 remittances is a faster speed of adjustment to equilibrium (26. 2 %) than M 2 remittances (21. 3 %). It is recommended that M 1 be used as a monetary tool in Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation {{management}} practices {{have become an}} integral component of forest management. Economics of alternative vegetation management treatments were analyzed in this thesis {{on the basis of}} two journal papers. Six research sites established and managed by Vegetation Management Alternatives Program of Ontario were the sources of data. In the first paper, differences in stem quality, and volume and value of fibre produced by planted white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] 16 years after vegetation management treatments in northwestern Ontario were examined. Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVSOntario) was used to pro-ject the total and merchantable volume to age 70 and BUCK- 2 was used to opti-mize the resulting product mix. Projected value was based on 2009 prices for hog fuel and SPF (spruce-pine-fir) eastern green lumber prices. At 16 years post-treat-ment, gross total volumes in herbicide-treated and mechanically cut plots were significantly higher (120 - 165 % and 94 - 98 %, respectively) than that in control plots (14. 73 m 3 ha- 1). Based on height, diameter, and taper criteria, observed tree quality did not differ among treatments. The projected value of the fibre produced was 36 to 53 % higher in herbicide-treated plots and 24 to 37 % higher in mechanically cut plots than in control plots ($ 18, 486. 76 ha- 1). Second paper presents the stand-level benefit-cost analyses of 12 vegeta-tion management treatments applied at six study sites in northern Ontario. Net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and internal rate of return (IRR) for crop and all species in each treatment and site were calculated and compared using 2009 constant dollars and variable <b>real</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> Aerial herbicide treatments produced the highest NPV, BCR, and IRR. Internal rates of return of 4. 32 % for aerial herbicide, 2. 90 % for manual brush cutting, 2. 82 % for ground ap-plied herbicide, and 2. 50 % for brush cutting plus herbicide treatments indicated that all of the vegetation management alternatives evaluated are economically viable...|$|R
