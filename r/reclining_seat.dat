25|$|New Zealand Railways at {{the time}} also ran another {{overnight}} train service, (the Night Express) which stopped at {{more than double the}} stations of the Silver Star, which had much older (1930s/1940s-built) rolling stock, and which had no on-board buffet service, but had cheaper fares (and three classes of accommodation). By refurbishing this train in 1975, which became the Northerner, many rail passengers preferred to pay around 33% less for a large <b>reclining</b> <b>seat</b> or 15% less for a 2-berth sleeper cabin without shower or toilet, than pay for a Silver Star cabin - more upmarket travellers simply preferred to fly.|$|E

5000|$|One cab car, 8101, and one {{intermediate}} car, 8151, were {{manufactured in}} July 1965 {{for a total}} of two cars of this type. Both cars were [...] "first-class" [...] cars and came with <b>reclining</b> <b>seats.</b> Both cars were eventually downgraded to standard class cars 8101 and 8102, with the <b>reclining</b> <b>seats</b> being removed. The <b>reclining</b> <b>seats</b> from both of these cars were to be used for an upcoming train car, but they were never used due to plans for constructing the train falling through. Both cars were scrapped in 1985.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>reclining</b> <b>seat</b> {{and back}} will shift {{weight to the}} occupant's back. This may be more {{comfortable}} for some in reducing weight on the seat area, but may be problematic for others who have bad backs. [...] In general, if the occupant is supposed to sit for a long time, weight {{needs to be taken}} off the seat area and thus [...] "easy" [...] chairs intended for long periods of sitting are generally at least slightly reclined. [...] However, reclining may not be suitable for chairs intended for work or eating at table.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, the four-place {{cabin with}} {{front and rear}} bucket seats and center console was {{replaced}} by a choice of bucket seats or conventional bench seats as standard equipment, making the Riviera a full six-passenger car for the first time. Optionally available was a Strato-bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with either a short consolette or a full-length operating console with a [...] "horseshoe" [...] shaped floor shifter and storage compartment. Both the buckets and Strato-bench seat were available with a <b>reclining</b> <b>seat</b> option for the passenger's side. Sales for 1966 rebounded to 45,308, a new record.|$|E
2500|$|The Veltro's slender {{fuselage}} {{was shaped}} with circular formers and four longerons and skinned with plywood, forming a semi-monocoque structure. [...] The wing was attached {{with a pair}} of tapered pins on each side. [...] Forward of the wing a long, one piece perspex canopy reaching almost to the nose covered the cockpit, in which the pilot had a <b>reclining</b> <b>seat</b> to reduce the overall cross sectional area. [...] This was a novelty at the time. Initially, the glider was fitted with an [...] "Orthocinétique" [...] control system, where pitch, roll and yaw were all controlled from a control column fitted with a handlebar; the pilot's feet were then free to operate flaps or undercarriage. This system was never flown. [...] Behind the wing the fuselage had a circular cross-section, tapering to a then novel T-tail. The horizontal tail, straight tapered with ply covered tailplane and fabric covered elevator, was positioned on top of an unusually low aspect ratio ply skinned fin and fabric covered rudder. [...] Flight testing showed the tailplane, out of the wing wake, worked well but the rudder tended to lock in side slips. [...] This problem [...] was cured {{with the addition of a}} dorsal fin and yaw control was later improved with a double slotted rudder, hinged well ahead of the fin trailing edge.|$|E
