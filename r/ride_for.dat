5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary <b>Ride</b> <b>for</b> Refuge.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012 season, {{all of the}} WindSeekers except Kings Island's {{experienced}} {{incidents in}} which the ride stopped, stranding riders in the air.

Two days later on September 21, Cedar Fair announced the closure of all other WindSeekers to conduct an internal review. The company said that until the review concludes, none of the rides would operate again. The rides remained closed through the remainder of the 2012 season at the five seasonal parks but reopened at all parks in 2013, excluding Knott's Berry Farm's version which has been relocated.|$|E

5|$|Several local {{politicians}} have proposed re-opening {{the line and}} either making it part of the Jæren Commuter Rail {{or part of the}} planned light rail in Greater Stavanger. Additionally, the Norwegian National Rail Administration has supported a future re-opening of the line. Estimates show that the line has a traffic potential for 600,000 passengers per year. In a proposal from the National Rail Administration, the Ålgård Line is seen as a possible branch of the commuter rail, with stations at Vagle, Figgjo, Kongeparken and Ålgård. Without making any investments to the Sørlandet Line, {{it would be possible to}} extend the two hourly services that terminate at Sandnes to Ålgård. Ålgård is also a good location for a park and <b>ride</b> <b>for</b> European Route E39. However, the Ålgård Line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. This would give a travel time from Ganddal to Ålgård of 10 to 12 minutes. The estimated cost of re-opening the line is NOK500 million. The Center Party has proposed converting the line to a bus lane. The borough council of Figgjo has voted to convert the line to a bicycle path, but this has been rejected by the National Rail Administration.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the <b>ride</b> <b>for</b> over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable <b>ride</b> <b>for</b> commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E
