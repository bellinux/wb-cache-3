50|$|B. C. P. Jansen (1 April 1884, Zwolle - 18 October 1962) was a Dutch chemist and biochemist. In the Dutch Indies, {{with his}} {{colleague}} W. F. Donath, he isolated in crystalline form an anti-beriberi factor (known as vitamine B1 or aneurin) from <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> and named it thiamine (sulfur-containing amine).

5000|$|He then {{served in}} the Philippines, where he saw and studied {{tropical}} diseases (especially beriberi and scurvy). U.S. Army medical officers were conducting much research into the possible causes of beriberi, initially using animal subjects. Vedder became convinced {{by the work of}} Christiaan Eijkman and Gerrit Grijns and others that beri-beri was indeed caused by a nutritional deficiency. He enlisted the help of Robert R. Williams of the Bureau of Science in Manila in isolating the [...] "anti-beri-beri factor". In 1911, Vedder and Maj. Weston P. Chamberlain, who had become members of the Tropical Disease Board in 1910, began experimenting with the treatment of infantile beriberi with an extract of <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> (or partially milled rice, an alcohol-based extract of rice hulls). Williams set out to isolate the ingredient responsible, but his work was deferred with a career change to chemistry for Bell Telephone Company. Other physicians had already tried feeding the polishings to nursing mothers. Believing the problem to be a poison in the mother's milk, they required that each baby be exclusively bottle-fed until the mother's treatment had been completed. Vedder and Chamberlain cured 15 infants whose mothers had symptoms of beriberi by supplementing each mother's milk with an extract of <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> and allowing nursing to continue. In every case, regardless of the seriousness of the baby's condition, the cure was rapid and complete. The experiment demonstrated conclusively that beriberi was a deficiency disease rather than the result of a toxin in the mother's milk. In 1913 Vedder published a seminal book on the subject. (As an aside, work slowdown during the Great Depression allowed Williams to return to beri-beri research, and it was not until 1933 when he successfully isolated its vitamin preventative in quantity. In 1936 he first synthesized it and named it thiamine [...] - [...] vitamin B1 having been its original designation.) ...|$|E

An understanding of the role of thiamine in modern nutrition is crucial in the rapidly advancing knowledge applicable to Complementary Alternative Medicine. References are given that provide insight into the use of this vitamin in clinical conditions that are not usually associated with nutritional deficiency. The role of allithiamine and its synthetic derivatives is discussed. Thiamine plays a vital role in metabolism of glucose. Thus, emphasis is placed on the fact that ingestion of excessive simple carbohydrates automatically increases the need for this vitamin. This is referred to as high calorie malnutrition...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritive value}} of rice by {{products}} in Costa Rica, Chemical composition, availability and use. By-products from the milling of rice, as obtained in Costa Rica, were examined for chemical composition and availability in the country. Data {{were taken from}} the CINA feed data base and from the literature. In Costa Rica, rice bran is a mixture of <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> and rice bran, without the broken rice and contain all the layers of the rice obtained in the milling operation of brushing the grain to polish the kernel. It may contain small quantity of hulls and germ of the rice. It must contain no less than 9 % of crude protein and no more than 13 % of crude fiber. The data show an availability of rice bran of 16. 800 tons with an average protein content of 13. 6 % and 8. 5 % of crude fiber. The digestible energy swine was 3924 Kcal/kg of dry matter and 3340 Kcal/kg of dry matter of metabolizable energy for poultry. The brewers rice (polished and broken grain) and the rice hulls showed a chemical analysis typical for this type of products' It is suggested to control the marketing of rice bran mixtured with gro. rlá hulls which is illegal in CostaRica' It should be marketed as "bran with hulis"...|$|E

In Experiment 1, 2 groups of 4 steers were given either a basal diet of {{molasses}} containing 4 % (w/w) urea (Diet A) or the basal diet supplemented with 82 fish meal (Diet B). In Experiment 2, the steers were reallocated {{into three groups}} and given either Diet A (2 animals), Diet B (2 animals) or Diet C (4 animals; the basal diet supplemented with 12 % fish meal). All diets included a mineral and vitamin supplement and each animal was given 1. 5 kg cereal hay per day. Dry matter intake and liveweight change were recorded for each group {{for a period of}} 93 d and 51 d for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 respectively. Glucose entry rates were estimated in both experiments from a single injection of [2 - H] glucose. The parameters of glucose metabolism did not vary significantly when 3 estimated at 6 hr intervals over a 24 hr period. Glucose entry rates varied between 7. 4 to 14. 5 g/kg / /d and g growth rates varied between 300 and 700 g/d. Over the range of growth rates measured, there were significant linear relationships between glucose entry rate and growth rate, and between try ratter intake and glucose entry rate. Key Words: Cattle, molasses/urea, bypass protein, growth, glucose entry rate It is now well established that growth rate of cattle given sugar cane diets can be increased by supplementing the diet with <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> (see Preston 1977).

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine standardized ileal amino acid digestibility (SIAAD) of commonly used feed ingredients in poultry diets in Pakistan. These feed ingredients included corn, rice broken (RB), <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> (RP), wheat bran (WB), sunflower meal (SFM), cottonseed meal (CSM), guar meal (GM), soybean meal (SBM) from India and Argentine and fish meal (FM). The SIAAD of each ingredient was determined in triplicate using 21 -days-old broilers. Day-old male broiler chicks (Hubbard× Hubbard) were reared on corn-SBM based diet from 1 to 13 days and thereafter birds were fed experimental diets from day 14 to 21. Each diet was fed to 36 birds kept in six replicate cages, each cage had six birds. In cereals, the SIAAD of corn’s amino acid (AA) (90. 1 %) was similar (p> 0. 05) to RB (89. 0 %). Isoleucine (97. 8 %) and lysine (96. 9 %) were highly digestible AA in corn and RB, respectively. Among cereal-by products, WB’s SIAAD (76. 9 %) was same (p> 0. 05) as RP (71. 9 %). Arginine from WB (82. 5 %) and RP (83. 2 %) was highly digestible. However, threonine in WB (72. 7 %) and leucine in RP (69. 6 %) were the lowest digestible AAs. In plant protein meals, AAs from Argentine-SBM (85. 1 %) and Indian-SBM (83. 4 %) had higher (p 0. 05). The SBM from plant protein meals had higher (p< 0. 05) SIAAD than other studied feed ingredients. However, the GM had the lowest (p< 0. 05) SIAAD among protein meals...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{sugarcane}} digestion {{was applied to}} indicate the suitability of various locally available supplements for enhancing milk production of Indian crossbred dairy cattle. Milk production was calculated according to simulated energy, lipogenic, glucogenic and aminogenic substrate availability. The model identified the most limiting substrate for milk production from different sugarcane-based diets. For sugarcane tops/urea fed alone, milk production was most limited by amino acid followed by long chain fatty acid availability. Among the protein-rich oil cake supplements at 100, 200 and 300 g supplement/kg total DM, cottonseed oil cake proved superior with a milk yield of 5 · 5, 7 · 3 and 8 · 3 kg/day, respectively. This was followed by mustard oil cake with 5 · 1, 6 · 5 and 7 · 6 kg/day, respectively. In {{the case of a}} protein-rich supplement (fish meal), milk yield was limited to 6 · 6 kg/day due to a shortage of long chain fatty acids. However, at 300 g of supplementation, energy became limiting, with a milk yield of 6 · 7 kg/day. Supplementation with rice bran and <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> at 100, 200 and 300 g restricted milk yield to 4 · 3, 4 · 9 and 5 · 5 and 4 · 5, 5 · 3 and 6 · 1 kg/day, respectively, and amino acids became the factor limiting milk production. The diet comprising basal sugarcane tops supplemented by leguminous fodder, dry fodder (e. g. rice or wheat straw) and concentrates at levels of 100, 200 and 300 g supplements/kg total diet DM proved to be the most balanced with a milk yield of 5 · 1, 6 · 7 and 9 · 0 kg/day, respectivel...|$|E
40|$|Poultry {{can be an}} {{important}} source of food following drought and crop failure. Unfortunately, reduced staple crop production also affects the chickens so that they become scrawnier and less able to produce eggs thereby detracting from their potential contribution to human diet. The article below suggests one rather innovative means by which the nutrition of poultry may be safeguarded in times of drought and food scarcity. Eds Chickens are unable to manufacture 10 necessary amino acids or the B vitamins. 1 They therefore require a diet high in protein. In addition, they require fats and carbohydrates, and cannot exist on high fibre diets. When NGOs or the FAO have taken a role in the improvement of family poultry farming in the developing world, the diet endorsed is varied, comprised of grains and tubers "for energy " (millet, sorghum, maize, sweet potatoes, and even cassava); meals for protein (sunflower cake, fish meal, cotton seed cake, maize germ, soya cake, meat and bone meal) and vegetables "for vitamins " (green grass, green kale, and cabbage) 2 and green seaweed. 3 The grains are given as a supplement to foraging 4 with millet recommended as the best grain for protein supplementation in chickens. Where these are unavailable, leaf meals have been used, 5 and recent research suggests that the seeds of the Croton tree are valuable in supplying necessary oils and proteins. 1 In the search for less expensive, natively available food for chickens, recent studies suggest that tobacco seed cakes, 6 or even molasses from sugar cane residue, 7 can be reasonably and productively utilised, and that meal from azolla, snails or <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> are comparable to maize-soybean meal diets. 8 In Haiti, however, farmers often are unable to purchase any form o...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) of commonly used cereals and cereal by-products in poultry diet. The 3 samples of each of corn, rice broken (RB), <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> (RP) and wheat bran (WB) were assayed for AMEn by substitution method using 21 -days-old broilers. The 12 experimental diets (4 ingredients x 3 samples) were formulated by substituting the corn-soybean meal basal diet with 30 % test ingredients. The acid insoluble ash was added at 1 % of all diets. The 468 day-old male broiler chicks (Hubbard x Hubbard) were reared on basal diet from day 1 to 13 and thereafter experimental diets were offered ad libitum to birds from 14 to 21 days. Each diet was offered to 36 birds, equally distributed to six replicate pens. The basal diet continued to feed the birds of 6 replicates from day 14 to 21. The excreta samples were collected for 3 days, day 19 - 21 and AMEn was calculated. The average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated from 14 - 21 days of age. Data regarding ADFI, ADG, FCR and AMEn were analyzed using GLM procedures of SAS while means were partitioned by t-test. The ADFI, ADG, FCR and AMEn remained unaltered (P> 0. 05) by feeding diets based on samples of same feed ingredient except the RP and WB. The birds fed RP and WB based diets showed varying (P< 0. 05) AMEn between the samples. The birds fed corn substituted basal diet had higher (P< 0. 05) ADG (56. 03 g) followed by RB (50. 04 g), WB (45. 87 g) and RP (43. 61 g) diets. The ADFI of broilers was highest (P< 0. 05) fed corn diets while it was lowermost with RB based diets. The birds showe...|$|E
40|$|Various {{investigators}} {{have stated that}} liver extracts, effective {{in the treatment of}} pernicious anemia, cause a {{rise in the number of}} reticulocytes in the guinea pig (1, 2, 3, 4). The route of administration (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, oral) does not affect the type of response nor the height of the reticulocyte rise, but it appears to change slightly the time of the peak of the reticulocytosis. Jacobson (2) defines a positive response as " a rise of the reticulocyte count to at least 2. 0 per cent on two successive days, within 6 days after the administration of the substance to be tested. " According to his data it falls on the 4 th to 7 th day following the injection. All the substances tested by him were administered intraperitoneally. Landsberg and Thompson (3) who daily injected commercial liver extract subcutaneously in the abdominal wall obtained a reticulocytosis with peaks between the 5 th and 11 th days following the beginning of the treatment, most of them falling on the 8 th day or later. Miller and Rhoads (4), administering liver extract orally, found the maximum reticulocytosis occurred between the 7 th (Received for publication February 25, 1936) and 12 th days. These data indicate that the antianemic substance, when injected intraperitoneally, produced a reticulocyte peak at an earlier time than when given either subcutaneously in the abdominal wall or orally. Liver extracts are not the only substances which cause this reticulocytosis in guinea pigs. Miller and Rhoads (4) found that oral administration of extracts of <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> and vegex, when incubated with gastric juice, will also give a similar response. The same is also true of gastric juice incubated with beef muscle, with or without pepsin, provided the gastric juice is not heated to 90 ° C. before intraperitoneal administration (2). The following report deals with the reticulocyte response of guinea pigs to the intramuscular administration of gastric juice from patients wit...|$|E
40|$|When {{blood plasma}} {{proteins}} are depleted by bleeding, with return of washed red cells (plasmapheresis), {{it is possible}} to bring dogs to a steady state of low plasma protein in the circulation and a uniform plasma protein production on a basal diet. Such dogs become test subjects by which the effect of various factors on plasma protein regeneration can be measured. Dogs previously the subjects of plasmapheresis, during long rest periods appear to increase their stores of plasma protein building materials and their blood plasma protein concentrations above former normal levels. A sterile abscess (turpentine) induces a marked reduction in plasma protein regeneration in these test dogs consuming an ample basal diet. The sharp reduction during the initial 24 hours may in part reflect an extravasation of plasma protein into the injured tissue but there also appears to develop a true disturbance of the mechanism which produces plasma proteins. Digestive disturbances interfere seriously with plasma protein production. Whereas large quantities of live yeast upset digestion and form no plasma protein, autoclaved yeast is well utilized, having a potency ratio of 4. 4. Amino acids have been tested inadequately. A mixture of cystine, glutamic acid, and glycine does seem to have a definite effect upon protein metabolism and plasma protein production. Iron, under the conditions of these experiments, does not influence the output of plasma proteins. Liver extract (parenteral) is also inert. The proteins of red blood cells when added to the diet are poorly utilized for plasma protein formation and show a potency ratio of only 10. 1. Kidney protein added to the kidney basal diet shows a potency ratio of about 5 as compared with 4. 6 for that basal diet. A digest of beef stomach and <b>rice</b> <b>polishings</b> shows a potency ratio of about 7. 9. Dried powdered serum shows a potency ratio of 3. 5, which is much less than fresh serum (2. 6). Powdered thyroid fed in doses sufficient to accelerate body metabolism shows no distinct effect upon plasma protein production not attributable to the protein in the thyroid powder itself. Long periods (25 to 30 weeks) of plasma depletion and basal diet intake remove much protein from body fluids and tissues. Associated with this protein depletion the dog loses its appetite and may vomit some food. There is loss of hair, a tendency to skin ulceration, and a distinct lowering of resistance to infection. The plasma protein output may fall to fasting levels in spite of food intake sufficient to maintain weight. We believe this condition to be a deficiency state related to severe depletion of the essential protein matrix of the body cells...|$|E
