Unlike the calculations of free oscillations, that reside in determination of natural frequencies and waveshapes and unlike the calculations of forced oscillations far away from resonance, that are performing without reference to friction, the oscillations researches in vicinity of resonance need accounting of friction forces. Special attention is paid to forced transverse fluctuations in beams as an important technical problem for engineering and building. Aim: The aim of the work is constructing of analytical solution of the problem of forced transverse vibrations of a straight <b>rod</b> with <b>constant</b> cross-section, which is {{under the influence of the}} harmonic load taking into account external and internal resistances. Materials and Methods: The internal resistance is taken into account using the corrected hypothesis of Kelvin-Voigt which reflects the empirically proven fact about the frequency-independent internal friction in the material.

The modeling relies on a discretization of the continuum robots using 6 DoFs Frames along the structure of the robot that is compatible with the modeling of a sequence of rigid vertebras. When the robot's structure relies on <b>rods</b> with <b>constant</b> sections, internal forces are computed with beam elements, placed between two adjacent frames, that applies forces and torques.

In both cases, for solving the whole robot model and inverting it in real-time, the numerical method takes advantage of the serial nature of continuum robots, using a Block-Tri-Diagonal solver.
