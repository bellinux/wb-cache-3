40|$|The {{support systems}} for Radio Base Stations (RBS) are getting {{increasingly}} advanced. There are demands to support numerous RBS configurations, multiple and {{alternative energy sources}} such as wind a solar, different cooling systems and alarm handling. The support system is desired to be modular, reusable and upgradable. This requires more advanced software solutions utilizing the facilities of a <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> system. <b>Real-time</b> capabilities and performance are important factors when selecting a <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> system for an application. There is no standard method or tool for benchmarking <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems, neither is there an independent organization that verify and publish benchmark results of <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems. This thesis studies benchmarking of <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems which could be suitable for Radio Base Station support systems. A survey of small <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> system was done that focus on kernel services and available middleware. Different benchmarking methods were studied and presented in a benchmarking survey. A portable benchmark tool based on rhealstone was implemented and is {{discussed in terms of}} portability and the information it provides. Two <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems Quadros RTXC and Freescale MQX was benchmarked. The results show there can be a considerable difference in performance of small <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems. The thesis ends with a discussion about benchmarking of <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems in general that emphasises the importance of requirements and that the selection of scheduling algorithm, priority assignments and the design of the application {{plays a major role in}} obtaining the best performance. Extending the benchmark tool to include stress testing, network performance, memory footprint and power consumption is suggested. Finally it is called for an independent organization which could verify benchmark results of <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems and provide benchmarking tools...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{mechanism}} for runtime updating of all kernel modules of a highly modular dynamic <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> system. Our approach can help solve the lack of adaptability, extensibility, and flexibility of existing <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems. The dynamic <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> system will efficiently support {{a wide range of}} applications since any kernel module can be dynamically loaded at runtime to exactly suit the applications without necessitating a reboot of the system. 1...|$|R

We report results of a detailed analysis regarding the impact of soft-errors on <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> systems cores, {{taking into account the}} application timing constraints. Our results show the extent to which softerrors occurring in a <b>real-time</b> <b>operating</b> system’s kernel impact its reliability. 1...|$|R
