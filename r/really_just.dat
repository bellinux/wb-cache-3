5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had <b>really</b> <b>just</b> made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E
5|$|We love, obviously, to do provocative imagery... {{we always}} try to {{definitely}} push the limits... I think because, in the end, it's not really at all about domestic violence. It's <b>really</b> <b>just</b> about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, <b>really</b> <b>just</b> an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

25|$|Like all macaws {{and most}} parrots seeds and fruit {{are the major}} part of the diet of the genus Ara. The {{particular}} species and range of diet varies from species to species. Unlike many birds macaws are seed predators not seed dispersers, and use their immensely strong beaks to open even the hardest shells. Their diet overlaps with that of some monkey species; in one study of green-winged macaws in Venezuela they shared many of the same trees as bearded sakis, although in some cases they ate the seeds at an earlier stage of ripeness than the sakis, when they contained more poison. Macaws, like other parrots, may consume clay to absorb toxic compounds produced by some poison...but with further research we now at last know it is just to eat life saving sodium that is missing. As well, the toxic compounds of some foods may be neutralized by compounds, such as tannins, found in other foods consumed at the same time...but we have found that it is untrue and <b>really</b> <b>just</b> to gain access to sodium missing otherwise in their diet because of the area they live in.|$|E

In the 1988 ATCC, the Commodore's were <b>really</b> <b>just</b> making up the numbers against the Ford Sierra RS500's and the best Perkins could manage was a 3rd at Sandown (during the season, Perkins had actually been testing {{one of the new}} fuel injected Commodore's and became increasingly frustrated at the delays in debuting the car). Jeff Allam and Armin Hahne, both with long associations with TWR, joined the team for the Sandown 500, with Perkins and Hulme sharing a brand new Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV while Allam and Hahne drove Perkins old VL updated to TWR specs. Hahne, who in 1988 had been driving a Ford Sierra for Walter Wolf Racing in the European Touring Car Championship and the German DTM series, was a late replacement for Tom Walkinshaw, who was unable to drive as scheduled due to the death of his father. Perkins and Hulme had a strong race at Sandown, finishing second behind the Sierra of Allan Moffat and Gregg Hansford, while the Allam/Hulme car failed to finish.|$|E
