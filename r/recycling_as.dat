The reactor had already been de-fueled, decontaminated, and sealed before being towed to the James River Reserve Fleet. According to the decommissioning plan the Sturgis will be relocated to Galveston, Texas, where CB will remove the residual radioactive waste materials.

500|$|Burns's {{walk through}} the {{supermarket}} {{was based on a}} false rumor that George H. W. Bush visited a store and was confused by the scanner and, in the original draft for the episode, Burns met Bush while there. When bidding farewell to the hippie Mr. Burns says [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] a reference to Pink Floyd's song of the same name. The hippie responds by saying that Burns needs to stop living in the past. The voice of the hippie is based on Dennis Hopper's character in Apocalypse Now. [...] "Achy Breaky Heart", a song by Billy Ray Cyrus, is played at the old folks' home. The scene where Mr. Burns chases Lisa through town is a spoof of the opening to the TV series That Girl. The scene where Lisa runs through the streets proclaiming <b>recycling</b> <b>as</b> evil spoofs the finales of Soylent Green and the original The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.|$|E

The Institute for Local Self-Reliance argues that the cost of recycling depends on various factors, such as landfill fees and the amount of disposal that the community recycles. It states that communities begin to save money when they treat <b>recycling</b> <b>as</b> a replacement for their traditional waste system rather than an add-on to it and by [...] "redesigning their collection schedules and/or trucks." ...|$|E

Whale {{should have had a}} live link to the Newsnight studio, but due to a technical failure this was not possible. Whale announced he believed global warming was solely a natural phenomenon. He described <b>recycling</b> <b>as</b> a 'joke' and believed prisoners should sort rubbish and recyclable waste. When asked if Green councillors were a good idea, Whale replied [...] "I don't think Green anything's a good idea!" [...] Whale also often criticises politicians for jumping on the Green bandwagon, in particular Conservative Party leader David Cameron for his 'vote blue, go green' slogan, saying Cameron is 'not fit to govern'. Whale has often stated his admiration for Margaret Thatcher but says he will no longer vote Conservative as long as David Cameron is the party's leader.|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} website {{of the documentary}} Garbage Dreams states that, [...] "Far ahead of any modern 'Green' initiatives, the Zabbaleen survive by recycling 80 percent of the garbage they collect." [...] By comparison, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect. After the takeover of the municipal waste collection, the three private companies, two from Spain and one from Italy, that were awarded with contracts to dispose of Cairo's trash were only required to recycled 20 percent of the trash that they collect. The rest of the trash that foreign companies do not recycle are placed into new landfills. The efficiency and environmental-friendliness of the Zabbaleen [...] "waste collection and recycling system received major world recognition and approval at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992." [...] The Mega-Cities Project sought to encourage the Zabbaleen system of waste collection and <b>recycling</b> <b>as</b> a model to be encouraged in other developing world cities such as Manila and Mumbai. The Zabbaleen waste collection system has received international funding from the World Bank, the Ford Foundation and Oxfam for specific projects to upgrade and improve the recycling of solid waste.|$|E

40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} (C&D) waste can {{be either}} directly disposed in landfills or processed in <b>recycling</b> plants <b>as</b> aggregates. Depending upon its physical properties, this recycled waste {{can be used in}} a variety of construction applications and also reduce dependence on natural aggregates. Since the recycling of C&D waste reduces landfill and conserves natural aggregate resources, most environmental policies aim at increasing C&D recycling. An optimization model is presented to understand the dynamics and planning of a C&D waste <b>recycling</b> network <b>as</b> an integrated set of supply-and-demand chains at the regional level. The model optimizes for minimum costs, includes assessment of technical and environmental performance, and shows the effects of potential policy interventions. A case study using the model revealed that disposal taxes are a cost-effective lever to increase total recycling, but not necessarily high-quality recycling. Increased transport costs reduce the <b>recycling</b> rate considerably, <b>as</b> <b>recycling</b> requires longer transport distances than disposal. The expected strong increase in the supply of C&D waste associated with the population decline (and associated shrinkage) projected for 2050 in Germany requires new sinks, e. g. intensified use of recycled aggregates in concrete, to preserve current high recycling rates.
