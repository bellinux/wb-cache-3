In Latvian, the word [...] "iesvētības", which literally means [...] "in-blessings," [...] is used, also standing for religious rites of passage, especially confirmation.

A similar equivalent term exists in the Russian military, where a hazing phenomenon knowing as Dedovshchina exists, meaning roughly [...] "grandfather" [...] or the slang term [...] "gramps" [...] (referring to the senior corps of soldiers in their final year of conscription).

[...] The charms of wedlock all his soul employ: [...] Each nymph by turns his wav'ring mind possessed, [...] 230 [...] And reigned the short-lived tyrant of his breast; [...] Whilst fancy pictured ev'ry lively part, [...] And each bright image wandered o'er his heart. [...] Thus, in some public forum fixed on high, [...] A mirror shows the figures moving by; [...] 235 [...] Still one by one, in swift succession, pass [...] The gliding shadows o'er the polished glass. [...] This lady's charms the nicest could not blame, [...] But vile suspicions had aspersed her fame; [...] That was with sense, but not with virtue, blest: [...] 240 [...] And one had grace, that wanted all the rest. [...] Thus doubting long what nymph he should obey, [...] He fixed at last upon the youthful May. [...] Her faults he knew not, love is always blind, [...] But ev'ry charm revolved within his mind: [...] 245 [...] Her tender age, her form divinely fair, [...] Her easy motion, her attractive air, [...] Her sweet behaviour, her enchanting face, [...] Her moving softness, and majestic grace.[22] [...] Much in his prudence did our knight rejoice, [...] 250 [...] And thought no mortal could dispute his choice:[23] [...] Once more in haste he summoned ev'ry friend, [...] And told them all, their pains were at an end.[24] [...] Heav'n, that (said he) inspired me first to wed, [...] Provides a consort worthy of my bed: [...] 255 [...] Let none oppose th' election, since on this [...] Depends my quiet, and my future bliss.[25] [...] A dame there is, the darling of my eyes, [...] Young, beauteous, artless, innocent, and wise; [...] Chaste, though not rich; and though not nobly born, [...] 260 [...] Of honest parents, and may serve my turn.[26] [...] Her will I wed, if gracious heav'n so please; [...] To pass my age in sanctity and ease; [...] And thank the pow'rs, I may possess alone [...] The lovely prize, and share my bliss with none! [...] 265 [...] If you, my friends, this virgin can procure, [...] My joys are full, my happiness is sure. [...] One only doubt remains: Full oft, I've heard, [...] By casuists grave, and deep divines averred; [...] That 'tis too much for human race to know [...] 270 [...] The bliss of heav'n above, and earth below. [...] Now should the nuptial pleasures prove so great, [...] To match the blessings of the future state, [...] Those endless joys were ill exchanged for these; [...] Then clear this doubt, and set my mind at ease.[27] [...] 275 [...] This Justin heard, nor could his spleen controul, [...] Touched to the quick, and tickled at the soul. [...] Sir knight, he cried, if this be all your dread, [...] Heav'n put it past your doubt, whene'er you wed; [...] And to my fervent prayers so far consent, [...] 280 [...] That ere the <b>rites</b> are o'er, <b>you</b> may repent! [...] Good heav'n, no doubt, the nuptial state approves, [...] Since it chastises still what best it loves. [...] Then be not, sir, abandoned to despair; [...] } [...] Seek, and perhaps you'll find among the fair, } [...] 285 [...] One, that may do your business to a hair; [...] } [...] Not ev'n in wish, your happiness delay, [...] But prove the scourge to lash you on your way: [...] Then to the skies your mounting soul shall go, [...] Swift as an arrow soaring from the bow! [...] 290 [...] Provided still, you moderate your joy, [...] Nor in your pleasures all your might employ; [...] Let reason's rule your strong desires abate, [...] Nor please too lavishly your gentle mate. [...] Old wives there are, of judgment most acute, [...] 295 [...] Who solve these questions beyond all dispute; [...] Consult with those, and be of better cheer; [...] Marry, do penance, and dismiss your fear. [...] So said, they rose, no more the work delayed;[28] [...] The match was offered, the proposals made [...] 300 [...] The parents, you may think, would soon comply; [...] The old have int'rest ever in their eye. [...] Nor was it hard to move the lady's mind; [...] When fortune favours, still the fair are kind.[29] [...] I pass each previous settlement and deed, [...] 305 [...] Too long for me to write, or you to read; [...] Nor will with quaint impertinence display [...] The pomp, the pageantry, the proud array.[30] [...] The time approached, to church the parties went, [...] At once with carnal and devout intent:[31] [...] 310 [...] Forth came the priest, and bade th' obedient wife [...] Like Sarah or Rebecca lead her life: [...] Then prayed the pow'rs the fruitful bed to bless, [...] And made all sure enough with holiness. [...] And now the palace-gates are opened wide, [...] } [...] 315 [...] The guests appear in order, side by side, [...] } [...] And placed in state, the bridegroom and the bride.[32] } [...] The breathing flute's soft notes are heard around, [...] And the shrill trumpets mix their silver sound; [...] The vaulted roofs with echoing music ring, [...] 320 [...] These touch the vocal stops, and those the trembling string. [...] Not thus Amphion tuned the warbling lyre, [...] Nor Joab the sounding clarion could inspire, [...] Nor fierce Theodomas,[33] whose sprightly strain [...] Could swell the soul to rage, and fire the martial train. [...] 325 [...] Bacchus himself, the nuptial feast to grace, [...] (So poets sing) was present on the place: [...] And lovely Venus, goddess of delight, [...] } [...] Shook high her flaming torch in open sight, [...] } [...] And danced around, and smiled on ev'ry knight: } [...] 330 [...] Pleased her best servant would his courage try, [...] No less in wedlock, than in liberty. [...] Full many an age old Hymen had not spied [...] So kind a bridegroom, or so bright a bride. [...] Ye bards! renowned among the tuneful throng [...] 335 [...] For gentle lays, and joyous nuptial song, [...] Think not your softest numbers can display [...] The matchless glories of this blissful day; [...] The joys are such, as far transcend your rage, [...] When tender youth has wedded stooping age. [...] 340 [...] The beauteous dame sate smiling at the board, [...] And darted am'rous glances at her lord. [...] Not Hester's self, whose charms the Hebrews sing, [...] E'er looked so lovely on her Persian king: [...] Bright as the rising sun, in summer's day, [...] 345 [...] And fresh and blooming as the month of May! [...] The joyful knight surveyed her by his side, [...] Nor envied Paris with his Spartan bride; [...] Still as his mind revolved with vast delight [...] Th' entrancing raptures of th' approaching night, [...] 350 [...] Restless he sate, invoking ev'ry pow'r [...] To speed his bliss, and haste the happy hour. [...] Mean time the vig'rous dancers beat the ground, [...] And songs were sung, and flowing bowls went round. [...] With od'rous spices they perfumed the place, [...] 355 [...] And mirth and pleasure shone in ev'ry face. [...] Damian alone, of all the menial train, [...] Sad {{in the midst of}} triumphs, sighed for pain; [...] Damian alone, the knight's obsequious squire, [...] Consumed at heart, and fed a secret fire. [...] 360 [...] His lovely mistress all his soul possest, [...] He looked, he languished, and could take no rest: [...] His task performed, he sadly went his way, [...] Fell on his bed, and loathed the light of day. [...] There let him lie; till his relenting dame [...] 365 [...] Weep in her turn, and waste in equal flame. [...] The weary sun, as learned poets write, [...] Forsook th' horizon, and rolled down the light; [...] While glitt'ring stars his absent beams supply, [...] And night's dark mantle overspread the sky. [...] 370 [...] Then rose the guests; and as the time required, [...] Each paid his thanks, and decently retired. [...] The foe once gone, our knight prepared t' undress, [...] So keen he was, and eager to possess: [...] But first thought fit th' assistance to receive, [...] 375 [...] Which grave physicians scruple not to give; [...] Satyrion near, with hot eringos stood, [...] Cantharides, to fire the lazy blood, [...] Whose use old bards describe in luscious rhymes, [...] And critics learn'd explain to modern times. [...] 380 [...] By this the sheets were spread, the bride undressed, [...] The room was|$|R
