5|$|On 26 October 1952, the Comet {{suffered}} {{its first}} hull loss when a BOAC flight departing Rome's Ciampino airport failed to become airborne {{and ran into}} <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> {{at the end of}} the runway. Two passengers sustained minor injuries, and the aircraft, G-ALYZ, was a total loss. On 3 March 1953, a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A, registered CF-CUN and named Empress of Hawaii, failed to become airborne while attempting a night takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan, on a delivery flight to Australia. The aircraft plunged into a dry drainage canal and collided with an embankment, killing all five crew and six passengers on board. The accident was the first fatal jetliner crash, as well as the Comet's first accident to result in fatalities. In response, Canadian Pacific cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A and never operated the type in commercial service.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and anti-armour weapon. However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy and awkward to manhandle, particularly over <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high curved trajectory, making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for training, a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of the way}} {{airframe}} loads {{are distributed}} while operating on <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> tailwheel aircraft {{are better able to}} sustain this type of use {{over a long period of}} time, without cumulative airframe damage occurring.|$|E
50|$|The low {{tow hitch}} {{position}} and small tow ring means {{they were really}} only suitable for towing behind an M7, as they dragged at quite an angle when hitched to a Weasel. An M7 tractor could tow two loaded M19 trailers on solid going such as an ice or snow-covered road, and when <b>rougher</b> <b>ground</b> was to be traversed it would drop one unit and shuttle them across the <b>rougher</b> <b>ground</b> one at a time.|$|R

25|$|The {{north-western}} {{connection to}} Long Side is a narrower ridge with <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> to the north, bounding {{the head of}} Southerndale. Southerndale Beck, like all of the waters of Carl Side, ultimately finds its way to Bassenthwaite Lake, curving around {{the northern tip of}} Ullock Pike.|$|E
25|$|Dual-sports, {{sometimes}} called dual-purpose or on/off-road motorcycles, are street legal machines {{that are also}} designed to enter off-road situations. Typically based on a dirt bike chassis, they have added lights, mirrors, signals, and instruments that allow them to be licensed for public roads. They are higher than other street bikes, with a high center of gravity and tall seat height, allowing good suspension travel for <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

60|$|Nothing {{could be}} much simpler than what Sandra said as she descended the Acro-Corinth, keeping to the little path, while Jacob strode over <b>rougher</b> <b>ground</b> by her side. She had been left motherless {{at the age of}} four; and the Park was vast.|$|R
50|$|The {{grass is}} well manicured {{and it is}} known today chiefly as a spot for picnics and games of {{football}} and cricket, and serves as the games field for nearby Parkside Community College. Fairs tend to be held on the <b>rougher</b> <b>ground</b> of Midsummer Common.|$|R
25|$|The {{southern}} and eastern flanks of The Old Man are composed of <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> deeply pockmarked by slate quarries. One of these quarries, Bursting Stone, is still operating to produce an olive green slate. Across the southern slopes runs the Walna Scar Road. This was the original trade route between Coniston village and the settlements of the Duddon Valley and is a public restricted byway.|$|E
25|$|Drainage {{from the}} {{southern}} side of the fell is via a number of feeders to Stickle Gill and Great Langdale Beck. Among the tributaries is White Gill, its ravine being an interesting route of ascent. Water from the northern flanks reaches Grasmere via Easedale Beck and its feeders. Crags look down over Easedale Tarn and Blindtarn Moss to the north, while further <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> looms over the Great Langdale road.|$|E
25|$|The British {{embarked}} {{nearly all}} their cannon and artillerists and, as the terrain was unsuitable for cavalry, all their cavalry troopers {{and a few}} healthy horses, but killed some 2,000 of the cavalry's horses. Moore now actually had the advantage in numbers in infantry, 15,000 to 12,000 and, with the <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> much broken up by sunken roads and walls, Soult's cavalry would be of little use. The British were rearmed, well rested and well fed, {{in marked contrast to}} the oncoming French.|$|E

50|$|In 1915, it {{was bought}} by the Poet William Wilfred Campbell, who moved in {{with his wife and}} {{extended}} family. He was the owner who named it Kilmore. Campbell worked days off and weekends to transform the <b>rough</b> <b>grounds</b> of the compound that surrounded the house into gardens and landscaping. Today, the house sits on 2.1 acres of land.|$|R
5000|$|The fell is {{circular}} in {{plan with}} smooth slopes {{to the south}} and west. Wainwright famously claimed that the southern side could be [...] "ascended comfortably in bare feet". There is <b>rougher</b> <b>ground</b> on the other sides and Hallin Fell's northernmost extremity — Geordie's Crag — projects into the lake, separating Ullswater's middle and lower reaches.|$|R
25|$|Blea Rigg {{is a broad}} plateau, {{around a}} mile wide and two miles long, {{climbing}} roughly east to west. It connects via a narrower section between Stickle and Codale Tarns to Sergeant Man and ultimately High Raise in the west. Stickle Tarn is {{the larger of the}} two waterbodies, a 50ft deep corrie tarn with the level increased by a stone faced dam. It is used to supply water to the residents of Great Langdale. Codale Tarn is a shallow pool set amid <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> a little to the north east.|$|E
500|$|These {{areas were}} {{the centre of}} a major mining industry; this is {{reflected}} in areas of contaminated <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> known locally as [...] "gruffy"; the word [...] "gruffy" [...] is thought to derive from the closely packed shafts that were sunk to extract lead ore from veins near the surface. Calamine, manganese, iron, copper and barytes were also mined.|$|E
500|$|In {{some areas}} the {{limestone}} and the dolomitic conglomerate have been mineralised with {{lead and zinc}} ores. From the time of Roman Britain until 1908, the hills were {{an important source of}} lead. These areas were the centre of a major mining industry in the past and this is reflected in areas of contaminated <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> known locally as [...] "gruffy". The word [...] "gruffy" [...] is thought to derive from the grooves that were formed where the lead ore was extracted from veins near the surface. Other commodities obtained included calamine (zinc ore), manganese, iron, copper and baryte. The eastern area reaches into parts of the Somerset Coalfield.|$|E

500|$|In Dhaka, East Pakistan (now in Bangladesh), Harvey made 96 on a matting pitch over <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> in the First Test, {{mastering}} the medium pace of Fazal Mahmood, while his teammates struggled to score. In {{the course of}} the innings, Harvey had to overcome a fever, dysentery and physical illness, which forced him to leave six times to recompose himself. Gideon Haigh called it [...] "one of his most dazzling innings". Described by Benaud as [...] "one of the best innings at Test level", it set up an Australian win. During his stay at the crease, his partners contributed 48 runs while seven wickets fell. Harvey's innings allowed Australia to score 225 in reply to the hosts' 200. Harvey then made 30 in the second innings to help ensure an eight-wicket win.|$|E
500|$|The {{horses that}} remain on Sable Island are feral. They {{generally}} stand between [...] Males {{from the island}} average about [...] and females about [...] The available food on the island limits their size, and the offspring of horses removed from the island and fed more nutritious diets are generally larger. Physically, the horses resemble Spanish horses, with arched necks and sloping croups. Overall, they are stocky and short, with short pasterns {{that allow them to}} move easily on sandy or <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> Sable Island horses have very shaggy coats, manes and tails, especially during the winter. The tail is full and low-set. Their coats are mostly dark colours, but some do have white markings. About half are bays, with the rest distributed among chestnut, palomino and black. Many Sable Island Horses have a natural ambling gait. Prior to their protection, when they could be kept for the use of humans, the horses were known for their sure-footedness and gaits.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{exhibits}} a natural ambling gait, called the single-foot, which replaces the trot {{seen in a}} majority of horse breeds. Both gaits are an intermediate speed between a walk and a canter or gallop; ambling gaits are four-beat gaits, whereas the trot is a two-beat gait. The extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always {{has at least one}} foot on the ground. [...] This minimizes movement of the horse's topline and removes the bounce of a two-beat gait, caused by a moment of suspension followed by the jolt of two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other. The value of an intermediate speed is that the horse conserves energy. [...] More than thirty horse breeds are [...] "gaited," [...] able to perform a four-beat ambling gait, and some can also trot. Thus, a Rocky Mountain Horse, with rider, can use the single-foot to cover <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> at around [...] and short stretches of smooth ground at up to [...] The faster speed is known as the rack. In comparison, the average medium trot speed is [...]|$|E

40|$|This work aims at {{estimating}} the musculoskeletal forces {{acting in the}} human lower extremity during locomotion on rough terrains. We employ computational models of the human neuro-musculoskeletal system that are informed by multi-modal movement data including foot-ground reaction forces, 3 D marker trajectories and lower extremity electromyograms (EMG). Data were recorded from one healthy subject locomoting on <b>rough</b> <b>grounds</b> realized using foam rubber blocks of different heights. Blocks arrangement was randomized across all locomotion trials to prevent adaptation to specific ground morphology. Data were used to generate subject-specific models that matched an individual's anthropometry and force-generating capacity. EMGs enabled capturing subject- and ground-specific muscle activation patterns employed for walking on the <b>rough</b> <b>grounds.</b> This allowed integrating realistic activation patterns in the forward dynamic simulations of the musculoskeletal system. The ability to accurately predict the joint mechanical forces necessary to walk on different terrains have implications for our understanding of human movement but also for developing intuitive human machine interfaces for wearable exoskeletons or prosthetic limbs that can seamlessly adapt to different mechanical demands matching biological limb performance...|$|R

Travelling round Ceram, the crew from Goram run away. He describes in detail the process of making sago.|$|E
500|$|The {{site had}} been built upon at least {{as early as the}} 16th century, when the estate was called Well Street. The origin of the name is the Chart Well, a spring {{to the north of the}} current house, Chart being an Old English word for <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> Henry VIII was reputed to have stayed in the house during his {{courtship}} of Anne Boleyn at nearby Hever Castle. Elements of the Tudor house are still visible, the Historic England listing for Chartwell notes that 16th (or possibly 17th) century brickwork can be seen in some of the external walls. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the house was used as a farmhouse and its ownership was subject to frequent change. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, a former MP; the Campbell Colquhouns were a family of Scottish landowners, lawyers and politicians. The original farmhouse was enlarged and modified during their ownership, including the addition of the stepped gables, a Scottish baronial genuflection to the land of their fathers. By the time of the sale to Churchill, it was, in the words of Oliver Garnett, author of the 2008 guidebook to the house, an example of [...] "Victorian architecture at its least attractive, a ponderous red-brick country mansion of tile-hung gables and poky oriel windows".|$|E

50|$|He {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on Doctor Who, for which he was a Visual Effects Designer, from the 1970s to the 1980s. He is {{credited}} with building the first K-9 prop for the serial The Invisible Enemy (1977). He was not told that it would be required beyond that story, thus the prop he designed was only capable of traversing the studio floor and proved useless when brought on location for subsequent stories.
