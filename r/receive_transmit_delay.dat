40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the two-hop full-duplex (FD) relay channel with self-interference and fading, which {{is comprised of}} a source, an FD relay, and a destination, where a direct source-destination link does not exist and the FD relay is impaired by self-interference. For this channel, we propose three buffer-aided relaying schemes with adaptive reception-transmission at the FD relay for the cases when the source and the relay both perform adaptive-power allocation, fixed-power allocation, and fixed-rate transmission, respectively. The proposed buffer-aided relaying schemes significantly improve the achievable rate and the throughput of the considered relay channel by enabling the FD relay to adaptively select to either <b>receive,</b> <b>transmit,</b> or simultaneously <b>receive</b> and <b>transmit</b> in a given time slot based on the qualities of the <b>receiving,</b> <b>transmitting,</b> and self-interference channels. Our numerical results show that significant performance gains are achieved using the proposed buffer-aided relaying schemes compared to conventional FD relaying, where the FD relay is forced to always simultaneously <b>receive</b> and <b>transmit,</b> and to buffer-aided half-duplex relaying, where the half-duplex relay cannot simultaneously <b>receive</b> and <b>transmit...</b>|$|R
