5|$|In 1963, Henson and {{his wife}} moved to New York City, where the newly formed Muppets, Inc., would reside for some time. Jane quit {{performing}} to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppet performer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson later credited both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted 27 years; their teamwork is particularly evident in their portrayals of the characters of Bert and Ernie, Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear.|$|E
25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society. The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent's occupational status. Parents from the professional class tend to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to become curious independent thinkers, while working class parents <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to have a more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority. Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values while working class parents emphasize external values.|$|E

25|$|Men {{came into}} direct contact {{not only with}} Wapishana from other villages but also with Indians of other groups, and later, with non-Indians from the act of bartering. By tradition, men have control over the labor of their wives and daughters, {{unmarried}} sons, and younger sons-in-law in their households. Married daughters usually build their house close to their maternal house. They <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> alongside their own mother, sharing food and labor.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the ideals}} of family honor is social class. Social class {{can be defined as}} a group of people {{categorized}} into a hierarchy based on the amount of money they have accumulated, how much education they have received, and the amount of power they hold within society, amongst other variables. People who play similar roles within society tend to have similar outlooks. Social standing affects the way in which families form. It determines how and who a person mates with, how they <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> and how people relate to one another.|$|E
25|$|Anthony's {{father was}} an {{abolitionist}} and a temperance advocate. A Quaker, he had a difficult relationship with his traditionalist congregation, which rebuked him for marrying a non-Quaker and then disowned him for allowing a dance school to operate in his home. He continued to attend Quaker meetings anyway and became even more radical in his beliefs. Anthony's mother was not a Quaker but helped <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in a more tolerant version of her husband's religious tradition. Their father encouraged them all, girls as well as boys, to be self-supporting, teaching them business principles and giving them responsibilities at an early age.|$|E

25|$|Since 1970, sociologists Paula LeMasters and Melvin Kohl {{have set}} out {{repeatedly}} to research class based cultures. Class {{culture has been}} shown to have a strong influence on the mundane lives of people, affecting everything from {{the manner in which they}} <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> initiation and maintenance of romantic relationship to the color in which they paint their houses. The strongest cultural differences seem to run along the professional middle class-working class divide. A recent increase in residential class segregation and the overall tendency of individual to associate mostly with those of equal standing as themselves has further strengthened class differences.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the {{majority}} of Japanese national students within Greater New York City attended U.S. schools. To have education in the Japanese language and Japanese literature, they attend the weekend classes offered by the Japanese Weekend School of New York. The parents who select the weekend school and local school combination often wish to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> as international and connected to foreign cultures, while parents choosing the Japanese day schools wish to raise them as typical Japanese children. As of 1988 over 30% of the New York City area parents of school age children selected the full-time NYJS instead of the weekend school and local school combination.|$|E

A member of the Liberal Party, Aquino's husband Ninoy rose to become the youngest governor {{in the country and}} eventually became the youngest senator ever elected to the Senate of the Philippines in 1967. During her husband's political career, Aquino remained a housewife who helped <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and played hostess to her spouse's political allies who would frequent their Quezon City home. She would decline to join her husband on stage during campaign rallies, preferring instead to stand {{at the back of the}} audience and listen to him.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to the {{tradition}} that {{the children of the}} imperial family should be separated from their parents and placed with private tutors, Crown Prince Akihito and his wife Crown Princess Michiko again broke precedent from the start by preferring to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> instead of entrusting them to the care of court chamberlains; the Crown Princess even breastfed. She and her husband have also built up a strong position among the general public, by their frequent trips in the 47 prefectures in the country to meet people but also for the liberties taken by the imperial couple vis-a-vis the protocol. At a more formal level, the Crown Prince and Princess visited 37 foreign countries between 1959 and 1989.|$|E
25|$|During the Spanish Inquisition, Spanish women (as well as Native American and African American {{women in}} the Spanish colonies) were {{expected}} to behave {{in a manner that}} would promote the Spanish culture and uphold the standards of Catholicism. Women were typically limited to the following roles: nun, wife/housewife, and mother. Any other role was looked down upon as it defied the Crown and Spanish culture. In fact, Spanish women were expected to teach the Indigenous and African women how to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and take care of their family. Because familial endeavors were highly emphasized by the monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, women were encouraged to have children, raise a family, and secure Spanish ideals and Catholic customs.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the situations and experiences of single mothers in <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in Chibolya, Zambia. The breakdown of family structure in developed, and recently in developing countries, poses challenges on single mothers {{to take care of}} <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> in particular in Zambia. Three research questions were used to explore and analyse the material; i) what are the experiences of single mothers in <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in Chibolya, ii) which challenges do they meet when <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and iii) which coping strategies do single mothers use in <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in Chibolya? The study used qualitative approach to recruit 16 single mothers and seven professionals using purposive and snowball sampling. A total of 21 participants were recruited and semi-structured interviews were used to explore the single mothers’ experiences and a focus group discussion for the professionals. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data and the findings pointed to all the single mothers having poor educational backgrounds. They had challenges in <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> due to <b>their</b> poor families, friends and neighbours surrounding them. Their main challenge was lack of work and financial capacity. They found it difficult to raise children in a risk community without facilities to take care of children in the absence of children’s fathers. They used different coping strategies to cope with their challenges and problems. Informal networks such as the family, relatives, friends, neighbours provided emotional as well as some limited material support to the single mothers and <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> They received at least some material, financial, health, clothing, and education support for <b>their</b> <b>children</b> from Children International Zambia. None received support from the government. The majority were street vendors, some were employed as cleaners in homes and in restaurants while others were involved in rotating saving groups and others were engaged in risk behaviours. On a concluding note, the problems and challenges they faced in <b>raising</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> were personal while others were coming from the community due to lack of support from society. The findings are relevant to professionals from civil society organisations and public social service departments...|$|R

500|$|Joint legal custody grants parents joint {{decision-making}} {{rights for}} important {{decisions that affect}} their minor children. The parents jointly decide how to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in matters of schooling, spirituality, social events, sports religion, medical concerns, and other important decisions. Both parents have equal decision-making status where the welfare and safety of the children is concerned. This generally means that both parents must be involved for major legal matters concerning their children, but that ordinary [...] "day-to-day" [...] matters and issues are left to {{the discretion of the}} parent who is providing physical care for the children at the time the decision is made. [...] Also, with joint legal custody, both parents share the ability to access to their children's records, including educational records, health records, and other records.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court has {{previously}} held that citizens have certain fundamental rights {{upon which the}} government cannot infringe, unless the deprivation of that right is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest. This doctrine, arising from the [...] "liberty clause" [...] of the Fourteenth Amendment, is known as substantive due process. The right to privacy {{was found to be}} fundamental under this doctrine, and a number of rights to choice came out of it, such as in Roe v. Wade, where the Court found a right to have an abortion and in Meyer v. Nebraska, where the court found a parental right to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> as they wish. In Griswold v. Connecticut the Court extended this doctrine to the right to procure contraception. Substantive due process was further expanded to encompass children with In re Gault establishing that children have a right to procedural due process when the state attempts to take custody of them.|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, {{the opening}} track [...] "Thinking of You" [...] is [...] "a really soul, southern, funky song" [...] {{inspired}} by Al Green. It has light guitar strokes and is sung in a Southern twang by Saadiq, while [...] "Top Notch" [...] features jazz elements and the vocalist's playful {{promise of a}} trip to Denny's for [...] "the most expensive dinner we can find". On [...] "Still a Man", he sings {{from the perspective of}} a man who was left by his wife to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> alone. The backing vocalists sing the meditative hook, [...] "Have you ever loved somebody / Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad?" [...] On [...] "Holy Smokes & Gee Whiz", Saadiq's older brother Randall Wiggins sings lead. The song was described by Washington City Paper journalist Rickey Wright as a modernized version of the Stylistics' 1972 song [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow", featuring [...] "a dead-on impression of Russell Thompkins' unmistakable falsetto and precise diction". [...] "Annie May" [...] was written by Wiggins as a story about a [...] "good girl next door" [...] who becomes an exotic dancer, while [...] "Let Me Know" [...] is a love song with Wall of Sound elements. According to Nick Krewen of The Spectator, [...] "Wild Child" [...] is [...] "a ballad in the grand sense" [...] of the 1977 Earth, Wind & Fire song [...] "Be Ever Wonderful". [...] "Party Don't Cry" [...] is a meditation on mortality with jazzy, philosophical overtones. Wright believed the song [...] "expresses an overt spirituality unheard in the Tonyies' past songs". The closing track is a gospel-influenced instrumental and variation of [...] "Lovin' You" [...] composed by Saadiq. Its sole lyric, according to Wright, is an universalist platitude.|$|E
