A new model for evaluating the sputter erosion of electrodes is described in this paper, which is based on the electromagnetic forces against the molten pool, flowing velocity, kinetic energy and the surface tension of the molten pool. Erosion tests on AgSnO 2, AgNi 10 and AgNi 0. 15 contacts under the loads of <b>resistance,</b> <b>lamp</b> and inductance respectively at 14 VDC have been carried out.

Susceptibility of the lamp power to the switching frequency variation at low luminous level can be reduced.

50|$|The {{first and}} last states are stable, because the <b>lamp</b> <b>resistance</b> is weakly related to the voltage, but the second state is unstable. Any {{anomalous}} increase in current will cause an increase in power, causing an increase in amalgam temperature, which will cause a decrease in resistance, which will cause a further increase in current. This will create a runaway effect, and the lamp will jump to the high-current state (#3). Because actual lamps are not designed to handle this much power, this would result in catastrophic failure. Similarly, an anomalous drop in current will drive the lamp to extinction. It is the second state that is the desired operating state of the lamp, because a slow loss of the amalgam over time from a reservoir will have less effect {{on the characteristics of}} the lamp than a fully evaporated amalgam.

By 1882 the investor-owned utility Edison Illuminating Company was established in New York City. Edison designed his [...] "utility" [...] {{to compete with the}} then established gas lighting utilities, basing it on a relatively low 110 volt direct current supply to power a high <b>resistance</b> incandescent <b>lamp</b> he had invented for the system. Edison direct current systems would be sold to cities throughout the United States, making it a standard with Edison controlling all technical development and holding all the key patents. Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day. Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. Direct current also worked well with electric motors, an advantage DC would hold throughout the 1880s. The primary drawback with the Edison direct current system was that it ran at 110 volts from generation to its final destination giving it a relatively short useful transmission range: to keep the size of the expensive copper conductors down generating plants had to be situated in the middle of population centers and could only supply customers {{less than a mile from}} the plant.|$|R
