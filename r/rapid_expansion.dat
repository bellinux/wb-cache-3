40|$|SummaryMandibular {{cross-sectional}} deficiency is a dentofacial {{defect in}} connection with the narrowing of the mandibular arch width. This abnormality is a significant etiopathogenic factor and it is often associated with nasal breathing difficulties. This atresia may be treated through <b>Rapid</b> Maxillary <b>Expansion</b> or Surgically Assisted <b>Rapid</b> Maxillary <b>Expansion,</b> depending on the patient’s age. Both procedures will change the craniofacial structure, especially the nasal cavity. AimBased on literature review, {{the purpose of this paper}} was to report the relationship among maxillary expansion, nasal cavity and Nasal Airflow Resistance. MethodA non-systematic literary review was conducted in search of experimental studies to treat maxillary atresia. Papers considering <b>Rapid</b> Maxillary <b>Expansion</b> and Surgically Assisted <b>Rapid</b> Maxillary <b>Expansion</b> were included, whereas those using Maxillary Expansion through Segmented Osteotomy were excluded. ResultRapid Maxillary Expansion and Surgically Assisted <b>Rapid</b> Maxillary <b>Expansion</b> cause dentofacial changes, especially in the nasal cavity. Consequently, the nose width enlarges, reducing Nasal Airflow Resistance. ConclusionAnteroposterior cephalometric studies show evidence of an enlarged nasal cavity following maxillary expansion...|$|R

40|$|Aim The {{original}} indication for <b>rapid</b> palatal <b>expansion</b> was {{to treat}} skeletal maxillary constriction.

Conclusion It can be concluded that <b>rapid</b> palatal <b>expansion</b> is predominantly recommended in children with maxillary constriction. In those with normal occlusion, maxillary expansion can be considered as the really last choice of treatment when other treatment options in patients with nose breathing, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), nocturnal enuresis and conductive hearing loss (CHL) have failed. Therefore, collaboration between paediatricians, otolaryngologists, paediatric dentists and orthodontists will lead to the best treatment outcomes in the future...|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root.

5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries.

The <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} changes in nasal resistance to airflow in persons undergoing <b>rapid</b> maxillary <b>expansion</b> and to reevaluate the responses at a 1 -year follow-up. Nasal resistance measurements, assessed in four modes (natural state, anterior nares dilation with Tygon tubing, following administration of decongestant, and nares dilation with tubing and decongestant), were taken on a group of 38 patients receiving <b>rapid</b> maxillary <b>expansion</b> and compared with a control group not receiving expansion. Thirty-three of the patients were reevaluated 9 to 12 months after expansion was completed. Eighteen subjects in the control group were also reevaluated. Oral/nasal airflow rates (percent nasality) were recorded for the control group and for some of the expansion patients. Results indicated that some subjects receiving <b>rapid</b> maxillary <b>expansion</b> had a significantly higher nasal resistance than the control group. There was a significant median reduction in nasal resistance following <b>rapid</b> maxillary <b>expansion,</b> measured in the natural state only, and this appeared to be stable up to 1 year after maximum <b>expansion</b> was obtained. <b>Rapid</b> maxillary <b>expansion</b> appeared to effect an expansion at the anterior nares, which contributes to nasal resistance reduction. Individual variation in nasal resistance values was considerable and hence the median response for the group was not a reliable estimate of individual response. Due to the high individual response variability, <b>rapid</b> maxillary <b>expansion</b> is not a predictable means of decreasing nasal resistance...|$|R

Changes in craniofacial skeleton arising from orthodontic treatment are more complex than envisaged from two-dimensional cephalometric assessments, and so we decided to do a three-dimensional study of the craniofacial skeleton using finite element analysis.|$|R
5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|From 1774 until 1858, Madras {{was a part}} of British India and {{was ruled}} by the British East India Company. The last quarter of the 18th century was a period of <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion.</b> Successful wars against Tipu Sultan (1782–99), Velu Thambi, Polygars and Ceylon added vast areas of land and contributed to the {{exponential}} growth of the Presidency. Newly conquered Ceylon formed part of the Madras Presidency between 1793 and 1798. The system of subsidiary alliances originated by Lord Wellesley as Governor-General of India (1798–1805) also brought many princely states into the area militarily subordinate to the Governor of Fort St George.

5|$|After {{the war of}} independence, Lima {{became the}} capital of the Republic of Peru but {{economic}} stagnation and political turmoil brought its urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a <b>rapid</b> <b>expansion</b> of the city. In the next two decades, the State funded the construction of large size public buildings to replace colonial establishments; these included the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the Penitentiary, and the Dos de Mayo Hospital. There were also improvements in communications; a railroad line between Lima and Callao was completed in 1850 and an iron bridge across the Rímac River, the Balta Bridge, was opened in 1870. The city walls were torn down in 1872 as further urban growth was expected. However, the export-led economic expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest.|$|E
