5|$|In stamp {{collecting}} circles, the word forerunner usually describes {{a postage stamp}} used during the time period before a <b>region</b> <b>or</b> territory issues stamps of its own.

These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail {{and they had no}} legal standing for mail in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{estimated}} 30,000 to 40,000 people who reached Dawson City during the gold rush, only around 15,000 to 20,000 finally became prospectors.

By the time most of the stampeders arrived in 1898, the best creeks had all been claimed, either by the long-term miners in the <b>region,</b> <b>or</b> by the first arrivals of the year before. The Bonanza, Eldorado, Hunker and Dominion Creeks were all taken, with almost 10,000 claims recorded by the authorities by July 1898; a new prospector would have to look further afield to find a claim of his own.|$|E

5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral <b>region,</b> <b>or</b> those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E
5|$|The Jugal <b>Region,</b> <b>or</b> Neala, is {{a region}} of the wing that is usually a small {{membranous}} area proximal {{to the base of}} the vannus strengthened by a few small, irregular veinlike thickenings; but when well developed it is a distinct section of the wing and may contain one or two jugal veins. When the jugal area of the forewing is developed as a free lobe, it projects beneath the humeral angle of the hindwing and thus serves to yoke the two wings together. In the Jugatae group of Lepidoptera it bears a long finger-like lobe. The jugal region was termed the neala ("new wing") because it is evidently a secondary and recently developed part of the wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{songs that}} could be considered American popular music, as opposed to the popular music of a particular <b>region</b> <b>or</b> ethnicity, were sentimental parlor songs by Stephen Foster and his peers, and songs meant for use in minstrel shows, theatrical productions that featured singing, dancing and comic performances. Minstrel shows generally used African instruments and dance, and featured performers with their faces blackened, a technique called blackface. By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had taken this music not only to every part of the United States, but also to the UK, Western Europe, and even to Africa and Asia. Minstrel shows were generally advertised as though the music of the shows was in an African American style, though this was often not true.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Tirunelveli was {{researched}} by Robert Caldwell (1814–91), a Christian missionary {{who visited the}} area. Tirunelveli was {{under the rule of}} Pandya kings as their secondary capital; Madurai was the empire's primary capital. The Pandya dynasty in the region dates to several centuries before the Christian era from inscriptions by Ashoka (304–232 BCE) and mention in the Mahavamsa, the Brihat-Samhita and the writings of Megasthenes (350–290 CE). The province came under the rule of Cholas under Rajendra Chola I in 1064 CE; however, it is unclear whether he conquered the <b>region</b> <b>or</b> obtained it voluntarily. Tirunelveli remained under control of the Cholas until the early 13th century, when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital.|$|E

5|$|The medieval cathedrals of England, which {{date from}} between {{approximately}} 1040 and 1540, are {{a group of}} twenty-six buildings that constitute a major aspect of the country’s artistic heritage and {{are among the most}} significant material symbols of Christianity. Though diversified in style, they are united by a common function. As cathedrals, each of these buildings serves as central church for an administrative <b>region</b> (<b>or</b> diocese) and houses the throne of a bishop (cathedra, from the Greek). Each cathedral also serves as a regional centre and a focus of regional pride and affection.|$|E

Securing raw materials scarce near the city was an important concern for the rulers; basalt was an important building tool and it was probably acquired from the Salamiyah <b>region</b> <b>or</b> Al-Rastan. Calcite was provided from either the Syrian coast or Egypt, amber came from the Baltic region, while regions in modern Afghanistan provided carnelian and lapis-lazul.|$|E
5|$|While Burger King still {{utilizes}} {{a version}} of its revamped franchising system in the United States, outside of North America its international locations licenses are still sold on a regional basis with franchises owning exclusive development rights for a <b>region</b> <b>or</b> country.

5|$|Calakmul {{is one of}} {{the most}} structure-rich sites within the Maya region. The site {{contains}} 117 stelae, the largest total in the region. Most are in paired sets representing rulers and their wives. However, because these carved stelae were produced in soft limestone, most of these stelae have been eroded beyond interpretation. Also many elaborate murals were discovered at Calakmul. These murals do not represent activities of the elite class. Rather, they depict elaborate market scenes of people preparing or consuming products such as atole, tamales, or tobacco as an ointment. Also items being sold were textiles and needles. These murals also have glyphs within them describing the actions occurring. The most prominent figure in these murals is identified as Lady Nine Stone; she appears in many scenes. This brings a world of the Maya marketplace to vibrant life for archaeologists. Another highly beneficial resource to Maya archaeological understanding at Calakmul is the ceramic remains. The composition of the ceramic materials identifies the <b>region</b> <b>or</b> more specifically the polity that produced them. Ceramics with the snake emblem glyph found at several sites also give more evidence to identify ties or control over that site by Calakmul.|$|E
