5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed far more than discretionary action and more than most other countries.|$|E

5|$|Lastly, British {{efforts to}} downplay and {{disguise}} {{the nature and}} impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderate movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian movement.|$|E
5|$|Morales' {{second term}} was heavily {{affected}} by infighting and dissent from {{within his own}} support base, as indigenous and leftist activists came to oppose {{a number of the}} governments' reforms. In May 2010, Morales' government announced a 5% <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage. The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cost of living, and called a general strike. Protesters clashed with police, although the government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests then broke out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment and a lack of investment in infrastructure.|$|E
30|$|In total, these {{theoretical}} models suggest that firms {{have a number}} of strategies for reacting to <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage. Moreover, <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage can result in both increases and decreases in specific cost components.|$|R

5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E

5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth.

Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24.
