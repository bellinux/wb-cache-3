500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and <b>rustic</b> <b>bunting.</b> Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

40|$|The <b>rustic</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza rustica) is a bird {{breeding}} in swampy {{boreal forests}} of Russia and Fennoscandia. In the last decades, populations in Norway, Sweden and Finland have declined drastically. The factors behind this decline {{are not fully}} understood and, among other things, {{there is a lack}} of quantitative habitat data from the breeding territories. In this study, 19 habitat variables are used to model presence of <b>rustic</b> <b>bunting.</b> Swampy forests in boreal Sweden were surveyed using playback and habitat variables were measured at both presence points and randomly generated points. The data were analyzed by generating all possible GLMs with one or two variables and ranking these models according to their AICc value. The individual variables were ranked using Akaike weights. The variables broadleaf trees 3 - 5 m tall and water surface coverage stood out as the most important: they were both included in the top model and received top scores in the Akaike weights. This study is the first to analyze <b>rustic</b> <b>bunting</b> habitat in a quantitative manner and offers a starting point for making spatial predictions of <b>rustic</b> <b>bunting</b> habitat, which is important to further understand the situation at breeding grounds...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{expansion}} of the <b>Rustic</b> <b>Bunting</b> (Emberiza rustica) westwards in northern Eu-rope during the 19 th and 20 th centuries, declines have been reported in Fennoscandia. The Norwegian population was 100 – 500 breeding pairs in 1994. We carried out censuses to detect Rustic Buntings in Norway during 2008 – 12, and compared these results with pre-vious records to evaluate recent population changes. Transect censuses made along 15 km of optimal habitat (swamp forest along rivers) yielded 18 territories during 1972 – 78, but in 2008 we found only 5 territories, and none since 2011. We also detected Rustic Bunt-ings in 21 of 74 previously-occupied sites (one or more records during 1963 – 2007). Dur-ing the study period 2008 – 12, we recorded Rustic Buntings in 41 sites, with a maximum of 47 territories in 2008. However, from 2008 to 2012 we detected a decline of 82 % (yearly decline of 34 % ± 9 %; 95 % CI). Local extinctions occurred in at least 31 sites. The current known population size is 13 territories in 9 sites, and the true population size may be only slightly larger. About half of all territories were associated with beaver dams, but the rate of decline during 2008 – 12 did not depend on dams. Extinctions could be attri-buted to habitat loss or change in 9 / 53 sites (1 logging, 1 cultivation, and 7 loss of a beaver dam). We suggest that the population decline of Norwegian Rustic Buntings is due to fac-tors operating during migration or in wintering areas. 1...|$|E
40|$|Northern European peatlands are {{important}} habitats for biological conservation because they support rich biodiversity and unique species compositions. However, historical management of peatland habitats has had negative consequences for biodiversity and their degradation remains a major conservation concern. Despite increasing {{awareness of the}} conservation value of peatlands, the statuses and ecological requirements of peatland species have remained largely understudied. Here, we first analysed temporal trends of Northern European peatland birds to document the status of their populations using bird data from five different countries. Second, we used Finnish monitoring data to assess habitat preferences of peatland bird species, hence helping to target conservation to the most relevant habitat types. There was a general decline of 40 % in Northern European peatland bird population sizes in 1981 – 2014 (speed of decline 1. 5 %/year) largely driven by Finland, where populations declined almost 50 % (2. 0 % annual decline). In Sweden and Norway, peatland bird populations declined by 20 % during 1997 – 2014 (1. 0 % annual decline). In contrast, southern populations in Estonia and Latvia, {{where the majority of}} open peatlands are protected, showed a 40 % increase during 1981 – 2014 (1. 0 % annual increase). The most important habitat characteristics preferred by common peatland species in Finland were openness and low tree height, while wetness proved to be an important feature for waders. Drainage of peatlands had clear negative effects on the densities of many species, with the only exception of <b>rustic</b> <b>bunting,</b> which specializes on edge habitats. Our findings call for more effective conservation actions in Northern European peatland habitats, especially in Finland where peatland drainage represents a major threat to biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate changes in avifauna communities of the Civilian Control Zone (CCZ: N 38 o 10 '∼ 19 ', E 127 o 04 '∼ 26 '), which is the near Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in Cheorwon, Korea. An analysis was conducted on data that were collected 4 times a year between December and February from December 2001 to February 2011. This study documented changes in bird population affected by artificial feeding and agricultural activity. In this study, a total of 59, 393 individuals (maximum number of individuals) of 101 species were observed. In descending order of dominance, dominant species were the White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons), White-naped Crane (Grus vipio), Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Red-crowned Crane (Grus japonensis), <b>Rustic</b> <b>Bunting</b> (Emberiza rustica), and Cinereous Vulture (Aegypus monachus). Over the course of the study, avifauna communities did not show significant increasing or decreasing changes in community indices. However, {{with the exception of the}} White-fronted Geese, evenness decreased. Red-crowned Crane and Cinereous Vulture populations experienced significant fluctuations, which were strongly related to changes in the intensity of artificial feeding. In particular, the abundance of Cinereous Vultures tended to decrease as artificial feeding decreased; decreases in artificial feeding were a preventive measure to address concerns regarding the occurrence of infectious diseases, such as avian influenza and foot and mouth disease. Except for Cinereous Vultures, raptors have decreased for the past ten years in all community indices, such as the number of species (r= − 0. 74, p< 0. 05), species diversity (r= − 0. 76, p< 0. 05), species richness (r= − 0. 62, p= 0. 056), and species evenness (r= − 0. 67, p< 0. 05). Such a drop in the raptor indices is possibly due to a decrease in area in the CCZ, increasing residential area, agricultural intensification, and decreasing natural areas...|$|E
