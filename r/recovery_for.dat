In the fourth quarter, All-Americans tackle Youngstrom blocked a Thorpe punt and returned it for a touchdown. The Sunday Chronicle named Thorpe, Henry and Lowe as the Bulldogs' stars, while Anderson, Youngstrom, and Miller were the standouts for the All-Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{global economy}} {{suffered}} heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The US emerged much richer {{than any other}} nation; it had a baby boom and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much {{higher than that of}} any of the other powers and it dominated the world economy. The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany in the years 1945–1948. Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European <b>recovery</b> <b>for</b> several years.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding <b>recovery.</b> <b>For</b> those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E

Over $430 million in federal disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families; the bulk of the funds went to <b>recovery</b> <b>for</b> areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course. In Maryland, Governor Marvin Mandel placed 10 of the state's 23 counties under a state of emergency.

The war created a great demand for energy, which was satisfied by expanded strip mining operations throughout the Harrisburg Coal Fields. Shortly after World War II, {{it became clear}} that coal was losing favor to other energy sources such as oil and natural gas. In contrast to other cities in the United States that prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes of Saline County began to quickly diminish. Harry Truman stopped briefly in Harrisburg during his whistlestop tour in September 30, 1948, giving some hope for economic <b>recovery</b> <b>for</b> the region. Without hesitating, the long parade of police, buses, and accompanying cars sped through town. Poplar street, at that time the main drag through town, was crowded with multitudes of persons for its entire length.

5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Brooklyn Dodgers {{in the sixth}} game of the season. While the Dodgers had not won a game all season, they started off strong against Cleveland. The Browns took a 10–0 lead in the first quarter, but the Dodgers {{answered}} with 10 points of their own {{in the second quarter}} to tie the score at halftime. Edgar Jones ran for Cleveland's first touchdown, which Groza followed with a 53-yard field goal, the longest of his career at the time. Brooklyn's Mickey Colmer ran in the team's second-quarter touchdown after a 66-yard drive. The Browns came back with another touchdown in the third quarter, aided by two long Horace Gillom receptions, but the Dodgers again evened the score after a Groza field goal was blocked and returned by Hank Foldberg for a touchdown. Cleveland pulled away in the fourth quarter, however, with a fumble <b>recovery</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown by George Young and a short run by Motley. The Browns had 23 first downs in the game, setting a team record. Groza missed an extra point after one of Cleveland's touchdowns, breaking a long streak.

He helped the Vikings defensive unit rank fifth in the NFL in defensive points allowed at 18.9 points per game, playing {{a key role in the}} Vikings winning the NFC North title over long-time reigning champs Green Bay Packers for the first time since 2009. In Week 10, he started the game at Oakland and posted a season-best 7 tackles against the Raiders. Four weeks later, he recorded seven solo tackles again in the loss at Arizona Cardinals on December 20. He posted his first sack as a Viking when he corralled Packers' quarterback Aaron Rodgers in Week 11. The following week, he got his first pick of the season when he intercepted Falcons' quarterback Matt Ryan. In the final game of the regular season against the Green Bay Packers for the NFC North title, the Vikings had a 13-3 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter. On a 3rd-and-12 play, Aaron Rodgers dropped back to his own 45-yard line to make a pass, but Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen got a hand on Rodgers' arm, causing him to fumble; Munnerlyn scooped up the ball at the 55-yard line and with blocking support from safety Andrew Sendejo and linebacker Anthony Barr, ran it all the way back for a touchdown (his first on a fumble recovery).

40|$|A multiresidue gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} {{method was}} developed to determine 28 priority pesticides of different chemical families (organochlorine, organophosphorus, triazines, anilides) together with some of their transformation products in river sediment. Ultrasonic, Soxhlet and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) methods were compared in spiking experiments using acetone:hexane (1 : 1) followed by alumina solid phase extraction cartridges or in-cell alumina clean-up for PLE. All extraction techniques produced acceptable <b>recoveries</b> <b>for</b> the pesticides under study, although Soxhlet extraction produced the lowest <b>recoveries</b> <b>for</b> 2, 4 -DDE, trifluralin, lindane, and hexachlorobenzene (< 50 %) whereas ultrasonic extraction resulted in low <b>recoveries</b> <b>for</b> hexachlorobenzene and lindane (< 50 %). However, PLE using in-cell alumina clean-up produced an overestimation of more apolar compounds, given the amount of coextracted compounds. Limits of detection at the low μg L- 1 -ng L- 1 levels were obtained with Soxhlet and ultrasonic extraction, while PLE produced higher variability {{due to the lack}} of exhaustive clean-up. Given the simplicity of ultrasonic extraction, this method was further employed to determine target compounds in river sediments collected in Portugal.
