A consortium called Lydec, led by Lyonnaise des Eaux (now SUEZ), was awarded the 30-year concession without a competitive tender in 1997. The Casablanca concession paved the way for subsequent concessions in Rabat, Tangiers and Tetouan. While the Rabat concession was awarded directly to Vivendi in 1998, the concessions in Tangiers and Tetouan were awarded in 2002 after competitive bidding to Amendis, a subsidiary of Vivendi.|$|E
25|$|During the Quiet Revolution, the {{government}} of Quebec invested heavily in the province's industries, A large component of this was nationalizing some predominant industries into state run business for example Hydro Quebec. {{in an attempt to}} modernize the economy and to encourage the development of francophone businesses.

In 1961, the Conseil d’orientation économique was established to promote economic growth of the regions of Quebec, growth which was once heavily funded by the Government of Canada.|$|E
25|$|During the French Protectorate, {{beginning}} in 1912, {{water supply and}} sanitation in many large cities in Morocco were managed under a concession to the private company Société Marocaine de Distribution d'eau, de gaz et d'electricité (SMD). SMD, a consortium led by Lyonnaise des Eaux, provided services in Casablanca, Rabat, Salé, Tangiers and Meknes. Since 1950 SMD also managed a vital bulk water transfer project: The supply of water from the Oum er-Rbia river to Casablanca. Bulk water supply to other cities that were not able to supply themselves from local water sources was a responsibility of a public company called <b>Régie</b> d'exploitation industrielle du protectorat (REIP) created in the early 1930s. The foundations for two important elements of today's water and sanitation sector - private concessions for water distribution in large cities and a national public company for bulk water supply - were thus already laid during the protectorate.|$|E

2500|$|Farmers {{had been}} {{suffering}} financially {{for several months}} as tobacco prices fell below the cost of production in 1903. They were subject to conditions so deplorable that [...] "many producers were compelled to sell tobacco at prices which returned them thirty cents a day" [...] {{in a time when}} the average income for Southern tobacco farmers was upwards of $3.00. While some farmers speculated that this was due to overproduction of the region’s cash-crop, dark-fried tobacco, the vast majority asserted that the real problem rested with the American Tobacco Company. The primary buyers of dark tobacco grown along the Kentucky-Tennessee border were representatives of the ATC and companies financed by the Italian government’s tobacco monopoly, the Italian <b>Regie.</b> Representatives of the Planters’ Protection Association charged that these two companies had an agreement not to bid against one another. Agents of the Association gradually infiltrated local trust syndicates in the area between 1904 and 1905, and confirmed these speculations.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Muang Sing was {{incorporated}} in French Laos after France and Great Britain made an agreement. In 1907, the Governor-General of Indochina in Hanoi issued a decree {{to establish the}} post of a [...] "delegue du Commissaire du Gouvernement" [...] at Muang Sing. It became part of French Indochina in 1916, but the locals continued to show discontent with the French occupation. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, the French capitalized on the location of the town by using it as a weigh station and market to regulate their opium monopoly, Opium <b>Regie,</b> and control production by the Hmong and Mien peoples. By World War II, some 15% of the colonial revenue of the French was obtained through opium trading. When changes in the international situation after the war blocked off many historical trading routes, the French government encouraged Hmong farmers to mass-produce the poppies by some 800% to compete and maintain their monopoly. In 1953, however, Laos became independent from France and trading declined until the 1990s, when the opening of the country to tourism saw many people arriving in the area to smoke opium, leading to the reopening of drug dens.|$|E
2500|$|For Mustafa Kemal, {{as for his}} supporters, tobacco {{remained}} {{wedded to}} his policy {{in the pursuit of}} economic independence. Turkish tobacco was an important industrial crop, while its cultivation and manufacture had been French monopolies under capitulations of the Ottoman Empire.

The control of tobacco was the biggest achievement of the Kemalist political machinery's [...] "nationalization" [...] of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. They accompanied this achievement with the development of the cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second biggest industrial crop in Turkey at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In the jurisdictions {{where the}} FNC rule survives, a court will usually dismiss a case {{when the judge}} determines that the dispute would be better {{adjudicated}} in a different forum. Courts have been split in their applications of the rule. In Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co v Fay (1988) 165 CLR 197 and Voth v Manildra Flour Mills (1990) 171 CLR 538 the High Court of Australia refused to adopt the [...] "most suitable forum" [...] approach and instead devised its own [...] "clearly inappropriate forum" [...] test. Nevertheless, the Australian courts balanced the foreign and local factors, and a dismissal would only be granted if the defendant could {{show that he was}} [...] "oppressed" [...] or [...] "harassed" [...] by the plaintiff's choice of Australia for legal action. This retained the rationale of the traditional doctrine, making it impossible for Australian defendants to obtain a dismissal from their own courts on FNC grounds. In <b>Regie</b> National des Usines Renault SA v Zhang (2002) 210 CLR 491, the High Court affirmed the [...] "clearly inappropriate forum" [...] test as Australian law, while stating that even where the law of a foreign country had to be applied to decide a case, Australia would not be a [...] "clearly inappropriate" [...] forum for hearing the matter.|$|E
2500|$|On Duvalier's {{death in}} April 1971, power passed to his 19-year-old son Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as [...] "Baby Doc"). Under Jean-Claude Duvalier, Haiti's {{economic}} and political condition continued to decline, {{although some of the}} more fearsome elements of his father's regime were abolished. Foreign officials and observers also seemed more tolerant toward Baby Doc, in areas such as human-rights monitoring, and foreign countries were more generous to him with economic assistance. The United States restored its aid program in 1971. In 1974, Baby Doc expropriated the Freeport Tortuga project and this caused the venture to collapse. Content to leave administrative matters in the hands of his mother, Simone Ovid Duvalier, while living as a playboy, Jean-Claude enriched himself through a series of fraudulent schemes. Much of the Duvaliers' wealth, amounting to {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} over the years, came from the <b>Régie</b> du Tabac (Tobacco Administration), a tobacco monopoly established by Estimé, which expanded to include the proceeds from all government enterprises and served as a slush fund for which no balance sheets were ever kept. His marriage, in 1980, to a beautiful mulatto divorcée, Michèle Bennett, in a $3million ceremony, provoked widespread opposition, as it was seen as a betrayal of his father's antipathy towards the mulatto elite. At the request of Michèle, Papa Doc's widow Simone was expelled from Haiti. Baby Doc's kleptocracy left the regime vulnerable to unanticipated crises, exacerbated by endemic poverty, most notably the epidemic of African swine fever virus—which, at the insistence of USAID officials, led to the slaughter of the creole pigs, the principal source of income for most Haitians; and the widely publicized outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s. Widespread discontent in Haiti began in 1983, when Pope John Paul II condemned the regime during a visit, finally provoking a rebellion, and in February 1986, after months of disorder, the army forced Duvalier to resign and go into exile.|$|E
