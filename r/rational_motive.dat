40|$|Background and problem: A palpable {{trend in}} {{organizations}} {{today is to}} centralize several finance departments and create a shared service center (SSC). Few previous {{studies have examined the}} motives behind this, and those that have often seem to implicitly assume that the motives are based on rational decision-making. As management ideas are known to spread as trends, we question the view that only <b>rational</b> <b>motives</b> are behind organizations adopting an SSC. Aim of study: The aim of this thesis is to investigate the motives behind the implementation of an SSC and understand if the decisions to implement shared services are based solely on <b>rational</b> <b>motives</b> or if trends are a factor as well. Methodology: Our case study is based on data collected at four different organizations that have implemented an SSC. At each organization, we conducted one semi-structured interview with a key person. Conclusions: We conclude that all four organizations have <b>rational</b> <b>motives</b> for implementing shared services. The main motive for all organizations was to save resources, either to use to focus on core activities or as a goal in itself (cost savings). The decision-making process behind the implementation was swift and it seems as though an SSC was seen as an obvious solution that did not require much investigation. To some extent, we believe that this had to do with external factors, such as trends. If SSCs were not a commonly used management idea, we believe that our studied organizations would have spent more time investigating whether to implement it. Thus, this suggests that their decision-making processes are not entirely rational...|$|R

60|$|Into {{this field}} of {{criticism}} it is not, I repeat, our present business minutely to enter. The only question for us, attempting {{to study the}} history of opinion, is what Helvétius meant by his paradoxes, and how they came into his mind. No serious writer, least of all a Frenchman in the eighteenth century, ever sets out with anything but such an intention for good, as is capable of respectable expression. And we ask ourselves what good end Helvétius proposed to himself. Of what was he thinking when he perpetrated so singular a misconstruction of his own meaning as that inversion of beneficence into self-love of which we have spoken? We can only explain it in one way. In {{saying that it is}} impossible to love good for good's sake, Helvétius was thinking of the theologians. Their doctrine that man is predisposed to love evil for evil's sake, removes conduct from the sphere of <b>rational</b> <b>motive,</b> as evinced in the ordinary course of human experience. Helvétius met this by contending that both in good and bad conduct men are influenced by their interest and not by mystic and innate predisposition either to good or to evil. He sought to bring morals and human conduct out of the region of arbitrary and superstitious assumption, into the sphere of observation. He thought he was pursuing a scientific, as opposed to a theological spirit, by placing interest at the foundation of conduct, both as matter of fact and of what ought to be the fact, instead of placing there the love of God, or the action of grace, or the authority of the Church.|$|E
60|$|Since then, {{so far as}} I know, {{the only}} person who has been patient enough to dig it up again is Mr. Ezra Pound. He is well known as an American poet; and he is, I believe, a man of great talent and information. His attempt to recover the old Teutonic theory of the Folk-Wandering of Peter the Hermit was expressed, however, in prose; {{in an article in the}} New Age. I have no reason to doubt that he was to be counted among the most loyal of our allies; but he is evidently one of those who, quite without being Pro-German, still manage to be German. The Teutonic theory was very Teutonic; like the German Hospice on the hill it was put {{together}} with great care and knowledge and it is rotten from top to bottom. I do not understand, for that matter, why that alliance which we enjoy with Mr. Pound should not be treated in the same way as the other historical event; or why the war should not be an example of the Wanderlust. Surely the American Army in France must have drifted eastward merely through the same vague nomadic need as the Christian Army in Palestine. Surely Pershing as well as Peter the Hermit was merely a rather restless gentleman who found his health improved by frequent change of scene. The Americans said, and perhaps thought, that they were fighting for democracy; and the Crusaders said, and perhaps thought, that they were fighting for Christianity. But as we know what the Crusaders meant better than they did themselves, I cannot quite understand why we do not enjoy the same valuable omniscience about the Americans. Indeed I do not see why we should not enjoy it (for it would be very enjoyable) about any individual American. Surely it was this vague vagabond spirit that moved Mr. Pound, not only to come to England, but in a fashion to come to Fleet Street. A dim tribal tendency, vast and invisible as the wind, carried him and his article like an autumn leaf to alight on the New Age doorstep. Or a blind aboriginal impulse, wholly without <b>rational</b> <b>motive,</b> led him one day to put on his hat, and go out with his article in an envelope and put it in a pillar-box. It is vain to correct by cold logic the power of such primitive appetites; nature herself was behind the seemingly random thoughtlessness of the deed. And now that it is irrevocably done, he can look back on it and trace the large lines of an awful law of averages; wherein it is ruled by a ruthless necessity that a certain number of such Americans should write a certain number of such articles, as the leaves fall or the flowers return.|$|E
60|$|Pope's {{version of}} the Prologue of the Wife of Bath first {{appeared}} in a volume of Poetical Miscellanies, published by Steele, in 1714. The portrait of this repulsive woman is drawn by Chaucer with a vigorous hand. She is a wealthy cloth manufacturer, with a bold countenance, and more than masculine freedom of speech. She dresses ostentatiously, rides with spurs, and, glorying in her shame, openly boasts of the vices which less impudent women would carefully conceal. Her two predominant characteristics are an inordinate self-will which makes her resolve to rule her husbands with an absolute despotism, and an inordinate sensuality which has completely absorbed every finer sentiment. She not only avows her propensities, but exults in the deceit, the tricks, and the violence which she has employed to gratify them as so many testimonies to her cleverness and power. She has no compunctious visitings for the frauds she has practised, and the misery she has inflicted upon her deceased husbands. She speaks of the dead as of the living with brutal insensibility, and would think it a weakness to be swayed by a human feeling. The impersonation of domineering, heartless selfishness, her pride is to prevail by tyranny instead of by the gentle graces of feminine tenderness, and her pleasure is to indulge in worldly gaiety, and the gross gratifications of sense. Even her jovial good humour is hardly a redeeming feature in her character, for it mainly proceeds from her keen relish for physical enjoyments, and turns to temper the instant she is thwarted. It is difficult to conceive that anybody could be injured by reading her confessions, which have nothing alluring, but with Warton, we must condemn the taste which could select the story as a ground-work for the embellishments of modern verse. The character may exist in every generation. The unblushing candour with which it displays itself belonged to more outspoken times than our own. Chaucer painted from the life, and this portrait of a coarse, voluptuous, defiant woman of the citizen class, finds a place in his gallery, {{because she had a}} prominent place in the society of the middle ages. There was no <b>rational</b> <b>motive</b> for tricking her out in the newest fashion of a period to which she did not belong, and she might with advantage have been allowed to remain in her primitive place and garb. The indelicacy of the pieces he translated from Chaucer was, however, one of their recommendations to Pope, and they may have had a further attraction for him from the fact, that they held wives up to odium. His deformed and insignificant person was an antidote to love, and the court he paid to women met with a cold return. He retaliated with his pen for the mortification to which they exposed him, and he almost always represented them in a frivolous or degrading light. He may not improbably have had a pleasure in reproducing from Chaucer the caustic sentiments which were congenial to his own, and may have found some satisfaction for his wounded spirit in revenging indifference by satire.|$|E

Perry identified a multidimensional scale to measure PSM with four components: attraction to policy making (APM), commitment to public interest, compassion, and self-sacrifice. But there is little research on the generalizability and applicability of the dimensions and scale of PSM in the other countries. This study tests whether the structure of PSM observed in the United States by Perry can be generalized to Korea. Two independent samples (n 1 5 294 and n 2 5 290) are used to validate the scale.

40|$|Offshoring has {{historically}} been the norm for American originated multinational corporations (MNC), to utilize advantages specific for the offshore location, such as low wages. After several years of this trend a new phenomenon has emerged, which possibly can be a new and upcoming trend, called reshoring. Reshoring is the bringing back of an operation from the offshore nation to the country of origin, the ‘home country’. Why is this potential shift taking place? Since no theories are yet formulated purely for reshoring, this thesis will use different classical theories to analyze the reshoring phenomenon, in order to answer the research question “What are the motives behind reshoring?” The classical theories will be used on data found via case studies on reshoring MNCs and manufacturing competitiveness in two countries of focus, China and the United States. This thesis reveals and disregards both <b>rational</b> and irrational <b>motives</b> regarding the decision to reshore.

50|$|According to Alos-Ferrer and Strack the dual-process {{theory has}} {{relevance}} in economic decision-making through the multiple-selves model, {{in which one}} person's self-concept is composed of multiple selves depending on the context. An {{example of this is}} someone who as a student is hard working and intelligent, but as a sibling is caring and supportive. Decision-making involves the use of both automatic and controlled processes, but also depends on the person and situation, and given a person's experiences and current situation the decision process may differ. Given that there are two decision processes with differing goals one {{is more likely to be}} more useful in particular situations. For example, a person is presented with a decision involving a selfish but <b>rational</b> <b>motive</b> and a social motive. Depending on the individual one of the motives will be more appealing than the other, but depending on the situation the preference for one motive or the other may change. Using the dual-process theory it is important to consider whether one motive is more automatic than the other, and in this particular case the automaticity would depend on the individual and their experiences. A selfish person may choose the selfish motive with more automaticity than a non-selfish person, and yet a controlled process may still outweigh this based on external factors such as the situation, monetary gains, or societal pressure. Although there is likely to be a stable preference for which motive one will select based on the individual it is important to remember that external factors will influence the decision. Dual process theory also provides a different source of behavioral heterogeneity in economics. It is mostly assumed within economics that this heterogeneity comes from differences in taste and rationality, while dual process theory indicates necessary considerations of which processes are automated and how these different processes may interact within decision making.|$|E

So far, most {{of the literature on}} Reid has focused on perception, the principles of common sense, and Reid's account of active power or moral liberty. In my dissertation, therefore, I examine Reid's account of motives or principles of action and their relation to the different faculties of the mind and I situate and evaluate {{it in the context of}} 18 th century moral philosophy.; The first two chapters deal with the nature of the different kinds of motives. In the first chapter I try to understand the difference between Reid's animal and <b>rational</b> <b>motives.</b> I argue that rational judgments require intention, will and judgments, not only about present objects but also about ends that we naturally value. In the second chapter I argue that there is a difference between Hume's calm passions and Reid's <b>rational</b> <b>motives</b> since for Reid the mere conception of some end, without any feeling necessarily associated, is a desire or principle of action. In the third chapter, I examine the relation between active power, reason and the moral sense. I show that active power implies having reasoning abilities. However, having active power and hence reasoning abilities does not imply that one has a functioning moral sense.; The next two chapters deal with the relation between principles of action and moral liberty. In chapter four, I examine two arguments Reid uses to argue that motives function as advice and not as necessary causes. In chapter five, I defend and evaluate Reid's possible answer to the problem of explaining the agent's choice between motives.; I argue, in chapter six, that Reid is more truly a moral sense theorist than his predecessors. In chapter seven, I show that moral perception involves the three different kinds of natural signs and hence it involves but cannot be reduced to perception by our external senses.

By choice a person decides what object is best, or what course of action he will follow, and by volition he carries into effect the choice, or refuses to do so. Choice is absolute, is necessary; while volition follows from choice, though not necessarily, and in some cases not at all.

40|$|The {{special program}} of {{perfection}} of sporting technique of skilled gymnasts {{is presented in}} a supporting jump. 20 skilled gymnasts {{took part in a}} pedagogical experiment. A pedagogical experiment was conducted in the conditions of preparation to the main starts of world and Ukrainian championships during 12 months. The table of contents of the special program was made by seven complexes for 5 special physical exercises (only 35 exercises). The method of biomechanics analysis of kinematics structure of motive actions of sportswomen is offered. Attention on 7 phases of supporting jump is accented, in each of which tasks decide on achievement of optimum individual biomechanics indexes. Descriptions of such constituents of perfection of technique of sportswomen are recommended: physical preparedness, <b>rational</b> <b>motive</b> mode, maximum possible parameters of the physical loadings in employment...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} is {{the rejection of}} an individual because of some defects ? observed or believed ? on the aggregate characteristics of his group. Unlike negative discrimination, the rejection does not rely on prejudice or racial or gender bias, but on a probabilistic inference about some decisive characteristic. It is a <b>rational</b> <b>motive,</b> but this rational does not say the entire story: to reject supposes not only to evaluate probabilities, but also to choose some risks and this cannot be done without practical considerations. The rationality of discrimination lies then on a context-dependant reasoning {{which could not be}} underestimated. It appears then that the lack of individual information could also justify a reasonable bet like positive discrimination or affirmative action. JEL classification code: J 7. statistical discrimination, affirmative action, rationality...|$|E
40|$|Crime Related to Substance Abuse The {{topic of}} my thesis is Crime Related to Substance Abuse which {{is focused on}} drug- related crime. The main aim of this work is to explain drug {{problematic}} in penal law consequences to the reader. First Chapter introduces the reader to drug problematic and drug addiction issue including drug crimes, defining health, social, psychological and economic risks and dangers which {{may be caused by}} drugs. The drug crimes are divided into few basic categories because of different <b>rational</b> <b>motives</b> why those crimes are committed. Then, several essential terms connected to drug abuse are explained. Second Chapter deals with classifying drugs into several categories and analyzing their different characteristics. Third Chapter concerns with international cooperation, including its history and current international law treaty's on drugs passed within the United Nations. Three essentials applicable and effective treaties are following: Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) and United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988). They involve international regulation and control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The Czech Republic acceded and signed all of them. Theirs [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Democracy {{became the}} {{preferred}} and consolidated {{form of government}} only in the twentieth century. It {{is not sufficient to}} explain this change solely by reference to <b>rational</b> <b>motives,</b> nor by detecting processes and leadership. A historical approach is required. The new historical fact that led to the change of preference from aristocratic rule to democracy is the capitalist revolution, which changed the manner of appropriating the economic surplus from violence to the market. This is the first necessary condition for democracy. The disappearance of the fear of expropriation, the rise of middle classes and the pressures of the poor or of the workers are the second, third and fourth new historical facts that opened the way for the transition from the liberal to the liberal-democratic regime. After these four conditions were fulfilled, the elites ceased to fear that they would be expropriated if universal suffrage was granted. Eventually, after the transition, the democratic regime became the rational choice for all classes. The theory presented here does not predict transitions, since countries often turn democratic without fully realized historical conditions, but it predicts democratic consolidation, since no country that has completed its capitalist revolution falls back into authoritarianism. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{normative}} {{theory of}} multilateral democratic integration starts {{within the context}} of liberal peoples engaged in the common realization of rights, freedoms, and life chances for their citizens while seeking to preserve self-government and popular sovereignty. The point argued in the paper is that the fair terms of multilateral democratic integration must be determined by an integrated original position of citizen and people representatives choosing basic principles of liberal multilateralism. The proposal to merge the two Rawlsian original positions offers a political solution to the contrast between rival conceptions of grand universalism and national particularism. After a general discussion of the wider problematic and the original position (1), I explain the concept and the reality of multilateral democratic integration (2). In part three, I justify why citizen and people representatives ought to be seen as participants of the original position of multilateral democratic integration. I then assess the <b>rational</b> <b>motives</b> of both types of representatives (4) and determine the veil of ignorance of the integrated original position (5). In section (6), the original position is applied to the test of several normative hypotheses prima facie considered as candidates for basic principles of multilateral democratic integration. These principles are not necessarily new, but they are principles which presumably apply to multilateral democratic integration as a specific political order and system of cooperation...|$|R
