Optically beamformed base station antennas capabilities to address dynamically changes in the network features and resources in order to overcome the service unavailability arising from man-made and natural impairments will be demonstrated. Coverage area management strategies and control/monitoring protocols for fixed and mobile <b>radio</b> <b>accesses</b> will be developed. High-performance optoelectronic devices and photonic integrated circuits composing the optical beamformers will be developed, using dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technologies. I. Introduction. A tremendous growth of broadband multimedia interactive services is expected for next five years. The provision of these services requires high-performance and high-reliable communication networks for both the access part and the transport part. In principle, wired and wireless terrestrial access networks can meet stringent specifications to provide broadband interactive services. Despite of the huge potential offered b...|$|R
