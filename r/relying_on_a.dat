5|$|Forman {{based his}} story on a {{real-world}} incident {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on {{trying to create a}} real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|While <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> script each week, the {{producers}} decided {{at the outset}} to allow the cast leeway in what they said and did on the show. Their decisions could affect the delivery of their lines and the blocking of each scene. If the actors felt that something was untrue to their character or a mode of delivery didn't work, they were free to change it, provided they still hit the vital plot points.|$|E

5|$|A {{video of}} the Stockholm {{performance}} of the Final Fantasy VI Symphonic Poem was released on October 11, 2014, and a full album recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios was released on February 23, 2015 by Merregnon Studios. The album, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of the arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more traditional medley. The concert series was followed by Final Symphony II, a similar concert tour by Merregnon Studios which began in 2015 with music from Final Fantasy V, VII, IX, and XIII.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{four new}} {{performances}} were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. These performances featured slightly modified {{versions of the}} original arrangements, and like the original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> traditional medley.|$|E

5|$|Tamar was proclaimed heir and co-ruler by her reigning father George III in 1178, but {{she faced}} {{significant}} {{opposition from the}} aristocracy upon her ascension to full ruling powers after George's death. Tamar was successful in neutralizing this opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by {{the decline of the}} hostile Seljuq Turks. <b>Relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated the Caucasus until its collapse under the Mongol attacks within two decades after Tamar's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{has suggested}} that self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, Kauffman {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> continuous input of energy.|$|E
5|$|The three Miller boys played Australian rules {{football}} {{in winter and}} cricket in summer. Their {{father had been a}} successful local cricketer and taught the boys to play with an orthodox and classical technique, <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford. At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to Elsternwick, in Melbourne's south east. As a child, Miller was small for his age, which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, something that held him in good stead for the future.|$|E

5|$|With the {{publishing}} {{of the first}} Swedish ecclesiastical history in 1642, {{the interpretation of the}} painting and the historical details surrounding it found a new path to follow. <b>Relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> publication from 1620, the sun dogs are said to have appeared first to King John III (1537–1592) on his deathbed - the painting subsequently being produced by the papist-friendly king in order to save the souls of the Protestant kingdom - and a second time before King Gustavus Adolphus shortly before his death at the Battle of Lützen in 1632.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{stopped on}} 5 October, when a {{cease-fire}} {{agreement was reached}} by the belligerents after the JNA reached the outskirts of Zadar and blocked all land routes to the city. Subsequent negotiations resulted in a partial withdrawal of the JNA, restoring road access to Zadar via the Adriatic Highway and the evacuation of JNA facilities in the city. The JNA achieved a portion of its stated objectives; while it blocked the Maslenica Bridge (the last overland route between the Croatian capital of Zagreb and Zadar), a road via Pag Island (<b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ferry) remained open. The JNA Zadar garrison was evacuated {{as a result of}} negotiations, but the ZNG captured several relatively small JNA posts in the city. The port was never captured by the JNA, although it was blockaded by the Yugoslav Navy.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As a testament to Chapman's philosophy of <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning side had gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E
5|$|For 11days, the JTWC on Guam {{was unable}} to {{continue}} operations, <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> backup agency. The damage to the airport radar prompted the NEXRADa network of high-resolution weather radarsto be installed earlier than scheduled, in February 1993, and limited incoming and outgoing flights to the daytime. On August30, a naval ship docked at Apra Harbor to provide a temporary mobile radar. By September15, both ships that had been washed ashore were refloated. In {{the aftermath of the}} destruction, insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete. In January 1996, former Governor Carl Gutierrez issued an executive order, mandating that homes or storm shutters on the island withstand winds of at least 250m/h (155mph).|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Burnet {{scaled back}} his {{laboratory}} work, taking one day off per week {{to concentrate on}} writing. In 1963, Autoimmune Diseases: Pathogenesis, Chemistry and Therapy, which he authored with Ian Mackay, was published. He also oversaw {{an expansion of the}} Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small staff to enforce his plans.|$|E

5|$|In September 1909, Glavis {{made his}} {{allegations}} public {{in a magazine}} article, disclosing that Ballinger had acted as an attorney for Cunningham between his two periods of government service. This violated conflict of interest rules forbidding a former government official from advocacy on a matter he had been responsible for. On September 13, 1909 Taft dismissed Glavis from government service, <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> report from Attorney General George W. Wickersham dated two days previously. Pinchot was determined to dramatize the issue by forcing his own dismissal, which Taft tried to avoid, fearing that it might cause a break with Roosevelt (still overseas). Taft asked Elihu Root (by then a senator) {{to look into the}} matter, and Root urged the firing of Pinchot.|$|E
5|$|Many castles were {{originally}} built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking {{features such as}} towers and arrowslits and <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> central keep. In the late 12thand early 13thcenturies, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, {{with an emphasis on}} flanking fire. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence– several stages of defence within each other that could all function {{at the same time to}} maximise the castle's firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.|$|E
5|$|The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr {{attempted}} to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy {{in the light}} of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome sin on its own. Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.|$|E
