40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it will be}} argued that the {{significant}} potential behind trade in electronic content services (e-services) 1 may not materialize if the <b>regulatory</b> GATS <b>disciplines</b> on domestic regulations are not reformed. The increasing amount and the diversity of national regulatory approaches to electronically delivered content services may be at the origin of this untapped potential. Obviously, the increased “balkanization ” of e-commerce via domestic regulations threatens to disappoint the early hopes for a global trading environment which was to be free of any trade barriers. New domestic regulations may also accommodate protectionist aims of national interest groups that want to avoid the competitive pressure of this new market access possibility (e-protectionism). The argument is developed in two steps. In the first part, it is shown that the increasing electronic delivery of content services creates a significant need for better developed GATS <b>regulatory</b> <b>disciplines.</b> In the second part, light is shed on the weaknesses of the current GATS <b>regulatory</b> <b>disciplines</b> and the ongoing negotiations.

In a departure from previous literature in this area, this article draws on documents appended or pertaining to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to identify barriers to trade in voice telephone services, and to estimate quantity impacts on this basis. The article finds that market access and national treatment commitments scheduled by WTO members under the GATS, when complemented by commitments to pro-competitive <b>regulatory</b> <b>disciplines,</b> may be formulated into meaningful policy variables.

Using data for 207 banks across 10 Central and Eastern European countries, this paper empirically analyzes the disciplining role of interbank deposits. We find that market discipline has been effective in Central and Eastern Europe since the implementation of explicit deposit insurance. However, several factors affect the strength of this discipline. State-owned banks are not disciplined probably because they benefit from implicit insurance. Institutional and legal factors, and resolution strategies adopted by countries during banking crises also impact bank risk and the effectiveness of market discipline.

By reconstructing discussions in law over the relationship between legal realism, law 2 ̆ 6 society, and law 2 ̆ 6 economics, and in economics over the merits and prospects of institutional and neo-institutional economics from an evolutionary perspective, the introduction argues that a theory of governance must today build on and incorporate the developments {{in both of these}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>disciplines.</b> Contributions from evolutionary theory and sociology, in particular in the important field of economic sociology, provide a fresh perspective on the particular dynamics of disciplinary development.

40|$|Abstract__ Product {{development}} in the health and life sciences is shifting from the development of target-specific pharmaceutical products to multi-target therapies, including medical nutrition. Medical nutrition consists of nutritional compositions, prescribed by medical professionals for the nutritional support in the dietary management of diseases. The European medical nutrition industry is rapidly maturing, driven by new knowledge on medical nutrition effectiveness and increasing public awareness on its importance. Nevertheless, there are still numerous unmet medical needs {{that can only be}} addressed through innovation by the medical nutrition industry. This dissertation describes the innovation dynamics within the European medical nutrition industry, through exploring the origin and development of this industry and all stakeholders involved. The research is multidisciplinary, encompassing scientific, industrial, technological, economic and <b>regulatory</b> <b>disciplines.</b> Although the relatively new and emerging medical nutrition industry offers innovation potential, the results show that a lack of medical nutrition innovation may result in a gloomy future for the medical nutrition industry. The dynamics of the medical nutrition innovation system induces the realization that social well-being and economic growth is not only dependent on the innovation activity of both the food and pharma industries but requires input from key opinion leaders in academia; patients; regulatory and funding bodies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis argues that, {{under the}} right conditions, the {{expansion}} of international trade flows and increased labour mobility through circular migration have contributed both directly and indirectly to the goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development in the Pacific Forum Island Countries (FICs). An extensive range of both specific and general policy conditions to ensure those outcomes are specified. Based on these conditions, the study suggests a strategic approach {{to the implementation of}} trade liberalisation and circular migration, which offers a clear path for Pacific Island governments to embrace. It involves balancing the pace and staging of liberalisation to ensure that trade reform, migration policy and development goals are well aligned. Such ‘strategic liberalisation’ can embed the fundamentals of competitiveness in FICs, while ensuring that transition costs, <b>regulatory</b> <b>disciplines,</b> and other conditions are in place to allow Pacific communities to benefit from future trading arrangements. The thesis concludes that while FICs need to ambitiously lock in necessary political, economic and trade reforms, developed countries and larger developing countries with whom they trade also need to intensify their efforts to allow sufficient market access, an increase in the temporary migration of Pacific Islanders and adequate capacity-building support for FICs to adjust to and consolidate these trade and migration policy reforms.

40|$|We {{show that}} market {{discipline}} {{can be effective}} in resolving the moral hazard problem which arises when depositors {{do not know whether}} bankers are monitoring or not the projects they finance. Demandable debt, by allowing the possibility of bank runs, can induce bankers to monitor. However, market discipline comes at a cost. When depositors are not equally informed about the future value of bank assets, withdrawals caused by a liquidity shock may be confused with future insolvency and cause uninformed depositors to precipitate a run. Likewise, withdrawals due to upcoming insolvency may be confused with a liquidity shock and dissuade depositors from running. Bank runs are, therefore, costly and imperfect disciplinary devices for bankers. Our results offer a new perspective on the debate on market versus <b>regulatory</b> <b>discipline</b> of banks. ...|$|E

Performance Research. 17 (2), 121 - 127 Special Issue: On FootThe author?s {{contribution}} is an autobiographical account that traces {{her relationship with}} her gender identity and dance training. She converses with feminist theoreticians as they provoke her to consider her relationship with dance and her dancing self. Here, theory takes the position of a wandering companion, facilitating a critique of the self, clarifying perception through a feminist lens, and containing reminiscence within a structure that re-configures the personal as political. This autoethnography is a methodological response to the context of gender construction and dance, foregrounding a more fluid relationship with theory than an argument for specific positions. The phenomenological influence is a response to the particularity of self, perception and memory. The foot here is a foot that alights, ventures out and finds its hold in feminist ground. This article uses the different sections of the pointe shoe of the classical ballet dancer as its structuring device. The article is autobiographic and draws on memories of how both dance and gender identity were constructed and practised by the author through the <b>regulatory</b> <b>disciplines</b> and rituals of dance classes, as well as the desire to conform and to escape from the materiality of her body. From early memories of music and language that combined to produce certain qualities of movement and states of awareness, the line of thought proceeds to later struggles with body shape, image, identity and possible demeanours available to the young adult. The article considers the foot, both its encasement in the hardened silk of the pointe shoe, and the bare foot's exposure and contact with the ground of contemporary dance practice. This experiential tale will draw on feminist theory through the lens of a personal conversation between theory and lived experience. The author considers how desiring transcendence from biology and over determined social roles of femininity and appropriate behaviour became a feature of the dancing woman's psychic landscape and remain as negotiable and contested territory.

This includes, amongst other things, using forward-looking market prices {{to identify those}} credit in-stitutions that are most at risk of failure. The paper’s key aim is to analyse whether market investors signalled potential problems at Northern Rock {{in advance of the}} bank announcing that it had negotiated emergency lending facilities at the Bank of England in September 2007. A further aim of the paper is to examine the signalling qualities of four financial market instruments so as to explore both the relative and individual qualities of each. Therefore, the paper’s findings contribute to the market discipline literature on using market data to identify bank risk-taking and enhancing supervisory monitoring. In addition, the paper tests for evidence of an implicit “too-big-to-fail ” policy in UK bank-ing. Our analysis suggests that private market participants did signal impending financial problems at Northern Rock in advance of the bank announcing that it had negotiated emergency lending facilities. These findings lend some empirical support to proposals for the supervisory authorities to use market information more extensively to improve the identification of troubled banks.

40|$|Electricity {{is a basic}} infrastructural service {{necessary}} for the achievement of developmental outcomes. The use of electricity, specifically, serves economic {{as well as social}} needs. It is universally accepted that electrification enhances quality of life at the household level and stimulates the economy at a broader level. Given its substantial benefits, electrification together with other sources of modern energy such as renewable energy, has been identified as essential for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals (UNDP, 2005). In most cases, the main challenge in the achievement of these goals is the bundled nature of the electricity supply chain in majority of developing countries. This necessitated the need for policy reforms with the aim of unbundling the sector in Kenya. The literature review sets out to consider the main features of the electricity sector to better understand the legal and regulatory reforms that have taken place in the electricity sector and the impact of the liberalization on rural electrification and the poor in society. It takes note of the changing role of government in the sector with the liberalization and privatization, which has entailed the unbundling of the vertically integrated state-owned utility that has led to the introduction of competition in some segments of the electricity sector value chain such as generation and distribution. In addition, the review considers the classification related issues arising from the reforms that have taken place in the electricity sector and the regulatory imperatives for a competitive electricity services sector. Finally, a review of the reforms in the electricity sector in Kenya is assessed together with the impact of the reforms. Furthermore, the necessary <b>regulatory</b> <b>disciplines</b> instrumental in cross-border trade in electricity services are identified. The rationale of the study focuses mostly on the phenomenological (qualitative) and positivistic (quantitative) types of research. The focus was on identifying, analyzing and reporting patterns (themes) within data to facilitate a clear understanding of the electricity services sector in Kenya. Furthermore, the chapter on methodology presents the research population, sampling strategy, data collection, frame of analysis and a summary of how the data was analysed. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the questions. The findings and discussion sections of the study are focused on the reforms in the electricity services sector in Kenya, the pro-competitive regulations for an effectively liberalized electricity sector, and the resultant electricity-related services. Due to the complexity of the issues in the sector, interviewees preferred to be provided with the questionnaire instead of face-to-face or telephonic interviews. The questionnaire consisted of two sections, namely the respondent's demographics and reforms in the electricity sector in Kenya. The questionnaire targeted key stakeholders in the sector and was sent to eighteen potential respondents, and of these, only fourteen were responsive. The study concludes that reforms in the electricity sector in Kenya have brought about clarity in terms of the services that are embedded in the sector and identified the key regulatory elements necessary to enhance competition in the sector. The new services that have surfaced in Kenya, include geothermal exploration, grid connectivity through KENTRACO, generating electricity from crude oil, and ensuring that more households are connected to the national grid through the rural electrification project...|$|R

In response, radically new approaches need to be developed. A milestone in this direction is the vision of the national research council (NRC) of the USA "Toxicity testing in the 21 st century: A vision and a Strategy". Currently, an alliance formed by the national toxicology program (NTP) and the chemcial genomics centre (NCGC) of the NIH and the computational toxicology centre (NCCT) of the EPA is testing whether this new strategy can realistically form the basis for future public health decisions. The visionrequires a radical paradigm shift in the approach to safety assessments, and turns the commonly known procedures upside down. Where animal experiments used to be the most important technology, the future is seen in the strength of in vitro and in silico approaches based on human material. Toxicity testing starts today with an initia lblack box screen on animals, sometimes followed by mechanistic studies, while the new vision approaches hazard assessment bottom up. The procedure would begin with in vitro tests to definethe perturbated pathways.

Drawing from an in-depth qualitative study of 10 foster families supported by local authorities or independent agencies in Wales, the paper examines the meaning of care in what is often a nebulous mix of paid and unpaid fostering. The moral texture of the foster family is revealed in regard to three areas of everyday domestic life that are often taken for granted and rarely researched: the symbolism of food, issues of the body, and aspects of touch. The paper concludes with a brief reprise of foster care as relational, constitutive and contextual in contrast with care as a professional and <b>regulatory</b> <b>discipline...</b>|$|E

To support his assessment of the evolution of the preservation field over time, Bentel looks to William Murtagh’s book, Keeping Time: The History and Theory of Preservation in America. Murtagh argues that the development of the preservation “movement ” was inevitable, “a result of the relentless response of preservationists to opportunities as they arose … a constant—if indeterminate—process of invention out of the raw material of circumstance” (Bentell 44).

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{highlights the importance}} of both <b>regulatory</b> and market <b>discipline.</b> Government reactions to the crisis included expanding deposit insurance coverage and rescuing troubled institutions, including some institutions that might not otherwise be considered too important to fail. These actions may have the unintended consequence of a reduction in market discipline that might otherwise penalize banks for risk-taking behavior. Alternatively, market discipline may have increased during the crisis due to heightened awareness of the risks of bank failures. To address these issues, we first test for the presence of depositor discipline effects in the period leading up to the {{financial crisis}} in both the US and the EU. Second, we test whether depositor discipline decreased or increased during the crisis. We find significant depositor discipline prior to the crisis in both the US and EU, but this varies between the US and the EU as well as with banking organization size and with listed versus unlisted status. We also find that depositor discipline mostly decreased during the crisis, except for the case of small US banks...|$|R

This proposal, however, has been subject to criticism related {{to the quality of}} the signal generated in current sub-debt markets. We argue that previous studies evaluating the potential usefulness of sub-debt proposals have evaluated sub-debt spreads in a very different environment from that characterized by a fully implemented sub-debt program, where the market will become deeper, issuance will be more frequent, debt will be viewed as a more viable means to raise capital, bond dealers will be less reluctant to publicly disclose more details on debt transactions, and generally, the market will be more closely followed. As a test to see how the quality of the signal may change, we evaluate the risk-spread relationship [...] accounting for the enhanced liquidity and market transparency surrounding new debt issues. Our empirical results indicate a superior risk-spread relationship surrounding the period of new debt issuance due, we posit, to greater liquidity and transparency. Our results overall suggest that the degree of market discipline would be significantly enhanced by a mandatory sub-debt program, thus suggesting a potential role for sub-debt in the banking regulatory reform. <b>Regulatory</b> reform Market <b>discipline</b> Subordinated debt Bank capital Financial regulation...|$|R
