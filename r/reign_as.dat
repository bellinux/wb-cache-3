5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his <b>reign,</b> <b>as</b> nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his <b>reign,</b> <b>as</b> well as aspects of his own identity and rule.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his <b>reign</b> <b>as</b> boss, Massino enjoyed the benefit of limited FBI attention. In 1987, with the Bonannos weakened, the FBI merged its Bonanno squad with its Colombo family squad, and this squad was initially preoccupied with the Colombos' third internal war.

5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her <b>reign</b> <b>as</b> a popular movie actress {{well into the}} mid-1930s.

Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. It was well received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' <b>reign,</b> <b>as</b> well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|George mainly {{lived in}} Great Britain after 1714 though he visited {{his home in}} Hanover in 1716, 1719, 1720, 1723 and 1725; in total George spent about one fifth of his <b>reign</b> <b>as</b> King in Germany. A clause in the Act of Settlement that forbade the British monarch from leaving the country without Parliament's {{permission}} was unanimously repealed in 1716.
