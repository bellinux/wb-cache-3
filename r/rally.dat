5|$|Toivonen's first World <b>Rally</b> Championship victory {{came with}} a Talbot Sunbeam Lotus at the 1980 Lombard RAC <b>Rally</b> in Great Britain, just after his 24th birthday. He had the record of being the {{youngest}} driver ever to win a world <b>rally</b> until his countryman Jari-Matti Latvala won the 2008 Swedish <b>Rally</b> {{at the age of}} 22. After driving for Opel and Porsche, Toivonen was signed by Lancia. Despite nearly ending up paralysed at the <b>Rally</b> Costa Smeralda early in 1985, he returned to rallying later that year. He won the last event of the season, the RAC <b>Rally,</b> as well as the 1986 season opener, the Monte Carlo <b>Rally,</b> which his father had won exactly 20years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Although Mouton {{competed in}} only one world {{championship}} event during the season, she contested a full six-round British <b>Rally</b> Championship. Her campaign was plagued by reliability problems and she recorded only one finish. In the National Breakdown <b>Rally,</b> Mouton stopped after damaging her Quattro in a jump. After technical problems led to an early retirement at the Circuit of Ireland, she finished second at the Welsh <b>Rally</b> behind Malcolm Wilson in another Quattro. At the Scottish <b>Rally,</b> Mouton had been {{closing in on the}} leading Wilson until a transmission problem forced her to retire. At the Ulster <b>Rally,</b> she set the fastest time for the first stage but then dropped out with a mechanical failure. In the season-ending Manx International <b>Rally,</b> Mouton struggled to start her Quattro and then crashed out five stages later.|$|E

Gameplay is similar to early iterations of the Colin McRae <b>Rally</b> series of racing games with content predominantly taken from the 2000 title Colin McRae <b>Rally</b> 2.0. Players can drive cars and participate in point-to-point <b>rally</b> events, competing against times recorded by computer drivers. Stages take place in several different locations with varied terrain like tarmac and gravel. The game features damage modelling and chassis deformation effects that can be sustained from collisions.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Rallying</b> {{makes up}} the {{majority}} of the [...] "grassroots" [...] of amateur motorsport, especially in the United Kingdom.

The two basic categories are special stage <b>rallies</b> and road <b>rallies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Colin McRae <b>Rally</b> was {{developed}} by Codemasters' Southam-based development studio. It was the company's first internally developed mobile game, and lead off an initiative to produce games for new and existing intellectual property specifically for mobile devices. The development team was composed of staff who had worked on early Colin McRae <b>Rally</b> games and more recent Codemasters racing games. The game was initially designed for iOS mobile devices using Colin McRae <b>Rally</b> 2.0 as a basis. This early iteration of their <b>Rally</b> series {{was chosen as the}} foundation because it presented a focused <b>rally</b> racing experience, whereas later entries expanded to offer more gimmicks and game modes. Thirty stages from <b>Rally</b> 2.0 were faithfully reproduced; the team ensured that the position of every corner, obstacle, and surface transition matched the original rallies. While existing content and assets were reused, they also chose to take advantage of modern technology while creating Colin McRae <b>Rally.</b> The game was built using the Unity game engine and written in the C# programming language, closely referencing the original C source code to make certain that the handling and physics systems replicate <b>Rally</b> 2.0.|$|E
5|$|For the 1982 season, Toivonen {{switched}} to the Rothmans-sponsored Opel team, which was co-managed by David Richards. Toivonen's team mates were Ari Vatanen, who had won the previous year's championship (with Richards as his co-driver), the 1980 and 1982 world champion Walter Röhrl and Jimmy McRae, the previous year's British <b>Rally</b> Champion and father of future <b>rally</b> star Colin McRae. In his Ascona 400 debut in Portugal, Toivonen surprised the event favourites by leading the <b>rally</b> before retiring five stages from the finish. He competed in only four more WRC events, but finished on the podium twice, at the Acropolis <b>Rally</b> and at the RAC <b>Rally.</b> In the European <b>Rally</b> Championship, he participated in four rallies, registering three podiums and one retirement. He also made a guest appearance in one round of the British Formula Three circuit racing championship, where he finished tenth driving a Ralt RT3. In his Formula One test for March Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit, Toivonen was 1.4 seconds faster than the team's regular driver Raul Boesel.|$|E

Club <b>rallies</b> (e.g. road <b>rallies</b> or regularity <b>rallies)</b> are usually run on public roads {{with an emphasis on}} navigation and teamwork. These skills are important fundamentals required for anyone who wishes to progress to higher-level events. (See Categories of <b>rallies.)</b> Short special stage practice events on public roads are in some countries organized by the local clubs, with a permission of the local police, the community normally using the road, and the road authority. The public road is closed during these by the organisers or the police.|$|R

5|$|Toivonen {{continued}} with Opel into the 1983 season, now driving the Manta 400, which {{took advantage of}} the new Group B regulations. Although the Manta was a Group B car, it was underpowered against the likes of the Audi Quattro A2 and Lancia 037, which were controlling the world <b>rally</b> scene at the time. Toivonen achieved a win at the Manx International <b>Rally,</b> a round of the British Open <b>Rally</b> Championship and the European <b>Rally</b> Championship, in the Isle of Man, at his first attempt. He also finished first at the Mille Pistes <b>rally</b> in France, but the organisers decided to ban the Group B cars halfway through the event. Toivonen and his co-driver, Ian Grindrod, received only a consolation trophy. In the World <b>Rally</b> Championship, he retired in three rallies, finished sixth at the Monte Carlo <b>Rally</b> and fourth at the Rallye Sanremo. He also drove a Ferrari 308 GTB at the San Marino <b>Rally,</b> where he was co-driven by Juha Piironen for the first time. The pair retired from the event, but Piironen would become his main co-driver for the next two seasons, and later have a long and successful partnership with four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen. In late October, Toivonen again competed on the circuits. This time he entered two sportscar races, driving a Porsche 956 for Richard Lloyd Racing in the World Sportscar Championship. Partnered with Derek Bell and Jonathan Palmer, he finished fourth at Imola and third in the next race at Mugello.|$|E
