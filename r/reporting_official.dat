25|$|Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer {{discuss the}} HDI from the {{perspective}} of data error in the underlying health, education and income statistics used to construct the HDI. They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in <b>reporting</b> <b>official</b> statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.|$|E

5000|$|Persuasive discursive {{activity}} {{included the}} propagation and repetition {{of a few}} key messages consistently over time, {{with the aim of}} misdirecting public attention from the silence-generating activities. Key Bush Administration messages were that detainees were evil, dangerous terrorists; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. Key British Administration messages were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. Key messages common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair Administrations). These key messages were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including press conferences and media interviews, authorised leaks, real-time <b>reporting,</b> <b>official</b> investigations and public inquiries) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once-secret documents. The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth-telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of key messages and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full accountability is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that justice has been served, all-the-while being constant targets of manipulation.|$|E

40|$|Sources of data: The current report {{reviews the}} data from the series Acci-dental Death and Suicide in India {{published}} by India’s National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) <b>reporting</b> <b>official</b> suicide rates based on police reports over the period of 10 years from 2004 to 2013. A reference to wider literature is made to present a comprehensive picture. Areas of agreement: Suicide in India is more prevalent in young, is likely to involve hanging and ingestion of pesticides and is related to social and eco-nomic causes. Reducing alcohol consumption, unemployment, poverty, social inequities, domestic violence and improving social justice are essen-tial to reduce suicide in India. Areas of controversy: NCRB data might underreport suicide. Discrepancy in farmers ’ suicide rate between reports suggests that this might be overrepre-sented in NCRB data. Growing points: An integrated suicide prevention programme with a multi-dimensional approach is needed. Mental health care bill and the recent launch of first national mental health policy are welcome measures. Decrim-inalization of suicide is likely to positively influence mental health practice and policy in India. Area timely for developing research: Nationally representative studies investigating fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviours, evaluation of models of service delivery for the vulnerable population, investigating suicide follow-ing different treatment services and effects of decriminalization of suicide on suicide rates should be the focus of future research...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study on}} the {{problems}} of censorship and interpretation from 1984, (Censorship and Interpretation; The Conditions of Reading and Writing in Early Modern England), Annabel Patterson states that British authors of the seventeenth century often used the shelter of ambiguity as a protection from the threat of censorship. But as the text had to be understood by the intended readers, Patterson argues that the writer used a set of codes for guidance to the intended meaning of the text. One of the codes identified by Patterson was the use of historical texts, such as the classics, limiting authorial responsibility as well as providing a set of allusions directing the attention to the present day. It goes without saying that the author in late imperial China, writing under the threat of censorship, was able to use ambiguity as a protection from aggressive censorship. Some of the codes identified by Patterson in the writings from early modern England can also be traced in texts from late imperial China. But ambiguity could work in two ways; by using the cover of ambiguity the author also risked beeing accused of allusions never intended and thus becoming the victim of an arbitrary and hostile misinterpretation. How did authorities in the Qianlong reign react when faced with texts of a highly ambiguous, or even unintelligible nature; to what extent was the decoding arbitrary? In order to explore this issue, this paper examines a number of legal cases involving the writings of people who were classified as mentally insane by the <b>reporting</b> <b>official,</b> or others involved. One of the earliest cases is that of Ding Wenbin (Shandong, 1753), which implicated the governor of Jiangsu, Zhuang Yougong...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the extent to}} which type and labeling of harassment have an impact on <b>reporting</b> through <b>official</b> channels.

Environmental harassment was far more likely to be <b>reported</b> through <b>official</b> channels. We speculate that “individualized ” forms of harassment (personal, frequently directly physical in nature, leaving little room for misinterpretation by the victim or the perpetrator) may create a negative organizational image and therefore be more likely to be concealed. Since experiencing environmental harassment is strongly related to experiencing individualized harassment and {{is more likely to be}} <b>reported</b> through <b>official</b> channels, it may be the real key to creating zero-tolerance for any type of sexual harassment...|$|R
