"I am {{disappointed}} by Democrats {{who are more}} focused on how President Bush took America into the war in Iraq almost three years ago, and by <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more worried about whether the war will bring them down in next November's elections, than {{they are concerned about}} how we continue the progress in Iraq in the months and years ahead." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Party {{platform}} was drafted, Senator Owen of Oklahoma urged Wilson to take {{ideas from}} the Progressive Party platform of 1912 [...] "as a means of attaching to our party progressive <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in sympathy with us in so large a degree." [...] At Wilson's request, Owen highlighted federal legislation to promote workers' health and safety, prohibit child labour, provide unemployment compensation and establish minimum wages and maximum hours. Wilson, in turn, included in his draft platform a plank that called for all work performed by and {{for the federal government}} to provide a minimum wage, an eight-hour day and six-day workweek, health and safety measures, the prohibition of child labour, and (his own additions) safeguards for female workers and a retirement program.|$|E
60|$|I {{must not}} be {{understood}} as saying that every Senator and Representative who takes his pay is wrong in taking it. Indeed, I have already expressed an opinion that such payments were at first necessary, and I by no means now say that the necessity has as yet disappeared. In the minds of thorough democrats it will be considered much that the poorest {{man of the people}} should be enabled to go into the legislature, if such poorest man be worthy of that honor. I am not a thorough democrat, and consider that more would be gained by obtaining in the legislature that education, demeanor, and freedom from political temptation which easy circumstances produce. I am not, however, on this account inclined to quarrel with the democrats--not on that account if they can so manage their affairs that their poor and popular politicians shall be fairly honest men. But I am a thorough republican, regarding our own English form of government as the most purely republican that I know, and as such I have a close and warm sympathy with those Transatlantic anti-monarchical <b>republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> endeavoring to prove to the world that they have at length founded a political Utopia. I for one do not grudge them all the good they can do, all the honor they can win. But I grieve over the evil name which now taints them, and which has accompanied that wider spread of democracy which the last twenty years has produced. This longing for universal suffrage in all things--in voting for the President, in voting for judges, in voting for the Representatives, in dictating to Senators--has come up since the days of President Jackson, and with it has come corruption and unclean hands. Democracy must look to it, or the world at large will declare her to have failed.|$|E

5000|$|On June 15, 2009, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} {{analysis of the}} major provisions of the Affordable Health Choices Act. The CBO estimated the ten-year cost {{to the federal government}} of the major insurance-related provisions of the bill at approximately $1.0 trillion. Over the same ten-year period from 2010 to 2019, the CBO estimated that the bill would reduce the number of uninsured Americans by approximately 16 million. At about the same time, the Associated Press reported that the CBO had given Congressional officials an estimate of $1.6 trillion for the cost of a companion measure being developed by the Senate Finance Committee. [...] In response to these estimates, the Senate Finance Committee delayed action on its bill and began work on reducing the cost of the proposal to $1.0 trillion, and the debate over the Affordable Health Choices act became more acrimonious. Congressional Democrats were surprised by the magnitude of the estimates, and the uncertainty created by the estimates has increased the confidence of <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> critical of the Obama Administration's approach to health care.|$|E
50|$|With so many contenders, it was {{expected}} that the election would go to a run off as no single candidate would likely receive a majority of the votes. Because the district has been strongly Democratic in previous elections, with Democratic voter registrations exceeding Republican registrations by 45% to 27.5%, conventional wisdom held that the two Democrats, Hahn and California Secretary of State Debra Bowen, would compete in the general election. Media coverage had also centered on the two Democrats, ignoring Republican candidates, including Huey. Huey then beat Bowen for second place by more than 750 votes, scoring something of an upset. Huey attributed his strong performance in the primary to the message he directed at independents, Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> dissatisfied with the economy. The $500,000 that Huey invested in his own campaign and the direct mail advertising he sent to district homes in the conservative South Bay area also contributed to his victory, according to local sources. He was endorsed in the primary by local business leaders, California GOP congressmen Dana Rohrabacher, Ed Royce and Tom McClintock, and Indiana congressman Mike Pence.|$|E

5000|$|Lieberman {{defended his}} support of the Iraq Resolution; in a November 29, 2005 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, he praised {{the efforts of the}} U.S. {{military}} in the occupation of Iraq and criticized both parties:"I am disappointed by Democrats who are more focused on how President Bush took America into the war in Iraq almost three years ago, and by <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more worried about whether the war will bring them down in next November's elections, than they are concerned about how we continue the progress in Iraq in the months and years ahead."Later, on December 7, 2005, Lieberman said, [...] "It is time for Democrats who distrust President Bush to acknowledge that he will be Commander-in-Chief for three more critical years, and that in matters of war we undermine Presidential credibility at our nation’s peril. It is time for Republicans in the White House and Congress who distrust Democrats to acknowledge that greater Democratic involvement and support in the war in Iraq is critical to rebuilding the support of the American people that is essential to our success in that war. It is time for Americans and we their leaders to start working together again on the war on terrorism. To encourage that new American partnership, I propose that the President and the leadership of Congress establish a bipartisan Victory in Iraq Working Group, composed of members of both parties in Congress and high ranking national security officials of the Bush Administration." ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 2014, Kasich {{signed into}} law a bill which cut six days from Ohio's early voting period, {{including}} the [...] "golden week" [...] (a period {{at the beginning of}} early voting when voters could both register to vote and cast an in-person absentee ballot). The measures were hotly contested in the state legislature, passing on a party-line vote, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. This measure prompted two federal lawsuits. The first lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio on behalf of the NAACP and League of Women Voters of Ohio, resulted in a settlement in April 2015, in which the state agreed to provide evening and Sunday hours for early voting in elections in Ohio through 2018. The second lawsuit, Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, was brought in May 2015 by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias; plaintiffs argued that the Ohio bill eliminating [...] "golden week" [...] violated the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately burdened black, Latino and young voters. The federal district court agreed and struck down the legislation, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed that decision in a 2-1 vote, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal. In July 2015, Kasich said that it was [...] "pure demagoguery" [...] for Hillary Clinton to [...] "say that there are <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> deliberately trying to keep people from voting." [...] In April 2015, Kasich used his line-item veto power to veto a provision added to a highway-budget bill by Republicans in the state legislature that would have required college students who register to vote in Ohio to obtain a state driver's license and vehicle registration, imposing an estimated $75 in motor vehicle costs on out-of-state college students who wanted to vote in the state. The veto was celebrated by voting rights advocates, Ohio Democrats, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board, which viewed the proposal as effectively a [...] "poll tax" [...] motivated by a partisan desire to limit college-town voting.|$|E
40|$|Are Donald Trump’s {{supporters}} authoritarian, anti-establishment, or both? In {{new research}} into who supports The Donald, Bert Bakker, Matthijs Rooduijn and Gijs Schumacher find that Trump’s supporters {{are those who}} score low on the personality trait of agreeableness (they {{are more likely to}} support politicians who criticize the establishment), and those who are more authoritarian (they are more likely to vote for politicians who push for more restrictive immigration policies).

40|$|Last week, President Obama {{announced}} new executive {{action to}} stop the deportation of undocumented immigrants {{that have been in}} the country for more than five years. This step has raised criticisms from <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> against undocumented immigration and from some Democrats for not going far enough. Zoltan Hajnal looks at the Democratic Party’s immigration problem, writing that while Latinos and Asian Americans are an important voting group for the party, their support for immigration reform is outweighed by many whites’ concerns over immigration. He argues that as long as whites are a majority in America and remain skeptical of immigrants, advocating for immigrants’ rights will hurt the Democrats’ election chances...|$|E
40|$|The current {{government}} shutdown {{has been marked}} by the near complete failure of Republicans and Democrats to communicate and negotiate towards a solution. Rosalyn Cooperman looks at the reasons behind this lack of communication, arguing that because the majority of Republicans and Democrats have relatively safe seats in the House of Representatives, they have little incentive to adopt a compromising stance due to the threat of a primary challenger from within their own party at the next election. The two dozen <b>Republicans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in favor of a ‘clean’ Continuing Resolution on the budget, on the other hand, are mostly those who represent ‘swing’ districts, and therefore have no re-election incentive for taking an unyielding party line stance...|$|E
