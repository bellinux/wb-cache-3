25|$|The two-state highway {{begins as}} NY71 at a Yintersection with NY22 in Green River, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Hillsdale in Columbia County, New York. Both legs of the {{junction}} are two-lane, two-way roads; however, only the southern leg is officially designated as part of NY71. The north leg is also state-maintained but designated as NY980E, an unsigned reference route. NY71 heads southeastward from the Yintersection as a two-lane road named Nobletown Road, following the Green River through a narrow valley in the Taconic Mountains. It passes several homes in an otherwise wooded area {{on its way to}} the Massachusetts state line, from which the roadway continues as that state's Route71. Now in the town of Alford in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, Route71 changes names to Green River Valley Road, continuing through residential areas in the base of the river valley.

60|$|The wind {{rushing in}} my ears and beating against my face awoke me all at once. The trees ran madly past, and the water at my right was a silver blur. The beast beneath me snorted as he rose and fell. Fainter and fainter dropped the clamour behind me, which had risen as I started, and the leaps grew longer and longer. Then my head was cleared like a steamed window-pane in a cold blast. I saw the <b>road</b> <b>curve</b> in front of me, I put all my {{strength}} into the curb, and heeling at a fearful angle was swept into the busy Kensington Road. For the first time I {{knew what it was}} to fear a horse. The stallion's neck was stretched, his shoes rang on the cobbles, and my eyes were fixed on a narrow space between carriages coming together. In a flash I understood why the duke had insisted upon Hyde Park, and that nerved me some. I saw the frightened coachmen pulling their horses this way and that, I heard the cries of the foot-passengers, and then I was through, I know not how. Once more I summoned all my power, recalled the twist Astley had spoken of, and tried it. I bent his neck for an inch of rein. Next I got another inch, and then came a taste--the smallest taste--of mastery like elixir. The motion changed with it, became rougher, and the hoof-beats a fraction less frequent. He steered like a ship with sail reduced. In and out we dodged among the wagons, and I was beginning to think I had him, when suddenly, without a move of warning, he came down rigid with his feet planted together, and only a miracle and my tight grip restrained me from shooting over his head. There he stood shaking and snorting, nor any persuasion would move him. I resorted at last to the spurs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>curves</b> are an {{important}} feature of road infrastructure and many serious crashes occur on <b>road</b> <b>curves.</b> In Queensland, the number of fatalities is twice as many on curves as that on straight roads. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to reduce drivers’ exposure to crash risk on <b>road</b> <b>curves.</b> <b>Road</b> crashes in Australia and in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) have plateaued in the last five years (2004 to 2008) and the road safety community is desperately seeking innovative interventions to reduce the number of crashes. However, designing an innovative and effective intervention may prove to be difficult as it relies on providing theoretical foundation, coherence, understanding, and structure to both the design and validation of the efficiency of the new intervention. Researchers from multiple disciplines have developed various models to determine the contributing factors for crashes on <b>road</b> <b>curves</b> with a view towards reducing the crash rate. However, most of the existing methods are based on statistical analysis of contributing factors described in government crash reports. In order to further explore the contributing factors related to crashes on <b>road</b> <b>curves,</b> this thesis designs a novel method to analyse and validate these contributing factors. The use of crash claim reports from an insurance company is proposed for analysis using data mining techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use data mining techniques to analyse crashes on <b>road</b> <b>curves.</b> Text mining technique is employed as the reports consist of thousands of textual descriptions and hence, text mining is able to identify the contributing factors. Besides identifying the contributing factors, limited studies to date have investigated the relationships between these factors, especially for crashes on <b>road</b> <b>curves.</b> Thus, this study proposed the use of the rough set analysis technique to determine these relationships. The results from this analysis are used to assess the effect of these contributing factors on crash severity. The findings obtained through the use of data mining techniques presented in this thesis, have been found to be consistent with existing identified contributing factors. Furthermore, this thesis has identified new contributing factors towards crashes and the relationships between them. A significant pattern related with crash severity is the time of the day where severe road crashes occur more frequently in the evening or night time. Tree collision is another common pattern where crashes that occur in the morning and involves hitting a tree are likely to have a higher crash severity. Another factor that influences crash severity is the age of the driver. Most age groups face a high crash severity except for drivers between 60 and 100 years old, who have the lowest crash severity. The significant relationship identified between contributing factors consists of the time of the crash, the manufactured year of the vehicle, the age of the driver and hitting a tree. Having identified new contributing factors and relationships, a validation process is carried out using a traffic simulator in order to determine their accuracy. The validation process indicates that the results are accurate. This demonstrates that data mining techniques are a powerful tool in road safety research, and can be usefully applied within the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) domain. The research presented in this thesis provides an insight into the complexity of crashes on <b>road</b> <b>curves.</b> The findings of this research have important implications for both practitioners and academics. For road safety practitioners, the results from this research illustrate practical benefits for the design of interventions for <b>road</b> <b>curves</b> that will potentially help in decreasing related injuries and fatalities. For academics, this research opens up a new research methodology to assess crash severity, related to <b>road</b> crashes on <b>curves...</b>|$|R

50|$|After the {{intersection}} with Pike CR 1174 (formerly CR 31), the road descends into a valley then climbs a hill, that crests just before {{the intersection}} of Pike CR 2205 (formerly CR 47). East of Pike CRs 2214 and then 1165 (formerly part of CR 25), the road crosses a third bridge over the Conecuh River. Approaching Troy, a railroad line begins to flank {{the north side of}} the road while Pike CR 1101 runs along the north side of those tracks, as US 29/SR 10 gains the name Montgomery Street. SR 10 leaves the concurrency with US 29/SR 15 at a quarter-cloverleaf interchange with US 231 and unsigned SR 53. The ramps are on the southwest and southeast corners, due to the railroad line flanking {{the north side of the}} road. Three Notch Road is encountered again, as US 29/SR 15 leaves Montgomery Street to turn left and go north, crossing the same railroad line it passed by over US 231, which itself curves towards the north. In the meantime, the route runs northeast until after the intersection of Love Street, where it turns straight north.

40|$|Abstract: The {{emerging}} {{new idea}} of lane-keeping electronic stability control is investigated. In a critical situation, such as entering a <b>road</b> <b>curve</b> at excessive speed, the optimal behavior {{may differ from}} the behavior of traditional ESC, for example, by prioritizing braking over steering response. The important question that naturally arises is if this has {{a significant effect on}} safety. The main contribution here is to give a method for some first quantitative measures of this. It is based on optimal control, applied to a double-track chassis model with wheel dynamics and high-fidelity tire-force modeling. The severity of accidents grows with the square of the kinetic energy for high velocities, so using kinetic energy as a measure will at least not overestimate the usefulness of the new safety system principle. The main result is that the safety gain is significant compared to traditional approaches based on yaw rotation, for several situations and different road-condition parameters...|$|E
