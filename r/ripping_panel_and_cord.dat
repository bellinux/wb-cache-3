40|$|The study below {{comprises}} {{prospective analysis}} of patterns of allergen-specific T-cell reactivity in {{a cohort of}} 23 children bled at regular intervals from 6 - 10 weeks to 2 years of age, together with cross sectional studies on <b>panels</b> of <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> adult blood samples. The results indicate reciprocal patterns of responses to dietary and inhalant allergens, the former being frequent in infancy but rare in adults, whereas the latter are preserved and expand between infancy and adulthood. These {{findings are consistent with}} a recently proposed model for the development of immunity to environmental allergens which involves allergen-driven T-cell 2 ̆ 7 selection 2 ̆ 7 during early life leading to deletion of food allergen-specific T-cells via the induction of specific anergy, with concomitant selection and ultimately expansion of mutually exclusive TH-l-like or TH- 2 -like reactivity to inhalant allergens via Immune Deviation mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|Another of Wise's {{innovations}} was the <b>rip</b> <b>panel</b> for controlled deflation on landing. Prior to Wise's {{use of the}} <b>rip</b> <b>panel,</b> balloons would drag {{along the}} ground when landing {{and had to be}} secured by anchors and lines. Balloonists wishing to deflate their balloons would climb out of their baskets onto the netting surrounding the balloon, and having scaled {{to the top of the}} balloon would open the valve to allow the gas to escape. The weight of the balloonist would cause the balloon to collapse inwards and there had been a number of accidents where the balloonists had been killed after becoming entangled in the rigging. Wise also recognised that the heat from the sun played a valuable role in warming the gas in the balloon, and built a black balloon to utilize the effects. He was the first to observe the jet stream, noting there was a [...] "great river of air which always blows from west to east". On August 17, 1859 he made the first flight of local airmail in the U.S. from Lafayette, Indiana to Crawfordsville, Indiana in a balloon named Jupiter, [...] carrying 123 letters and 23 circulars of which one cover was discovered in 1957.His trip of 25 miles ended when he was forced to land by lack of buoyancy.|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} the wind abated greatly, and small, infrequent snowflakes came drifting by. Snow also spread more abundantly below, {{and the only}} trees were clumps of pine and spruce in the lower valleys. Kurt went with three men into the still intact gas-chambers, let out a certain quantity of gas from them, and prepared a series of <b>ripping</b> <b>panels</b> for the descent. Also the residue of the bombs and explosives in the magazine were thrown overboard and fell, detonating loudly, in the wilderness below. And about four o'clock in {{the afternoon}} upon a wide and rocky plain within sight of snow-crested cliffs, the Vaterland ripped and grounded.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{role of the}} {{placenta}} was assessed by comparing the profiles of methylmercury (MeHg), inorganic mercury (I-Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) in freeze-dried chorionic tissue of {{the placenta}} <b>and</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> tissue. The significance of the placenta <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> tissue as predictors of prenatal exposure to these trace elements in pregnant women and newborns was also examined by comparing the element profiles among placenta <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> tissue, <b>and</b> maternal <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> blood red blood cells (RBCs). The samples were collected from 48 mother–child pairs at birth {{in the general population}} of Japanese. The concentrations of all elements, except for MeHg, were significantly higher in placenta than in cord tissue. In particular, the Cd showed the highest placenta vs. cord tissue ratio (59 : 1), followed by I-Hg (2. 4 : 1), indicating that the placental barrier works most strongly against Cd among the examined toxic elements. Contrary to the other elements, the MeHg concentration in cord tissue was significantly higher (1. 6 times) than that in placenta, indicating its exceptionally high placental transfer. The MeHg in placenta showed significant correlations with total mercury (T-Hg) in maternal <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> RBCs (rs= 0. 80 and 0. 91, respectively). The MeHg in cord tissue also showed significant correlations with T-Hg in maternal <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> RBCs (rs= 0. 75 and 0. 85, respectively). Therefore, both placenta <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> tissue are useful for predicting maternal and fetal exposure to MeHg. The Se concentration in placenta showed significant but moderate correlations with that in maternal <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> RBCs (rs= 0. 38 and 0. 57, respectively). The Pb, Zn, and Cu concentrations in placenta <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> tissue showed no significant correlations with those in maternal <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> RBCs. As an exception, the Cd concentration in placenta showed a moderate but significant correlation (rs= 0. 41) with that in maternal RBCs, suggesting that the placenta is useful for predicting maternal exposure to Cd during gestation...|$|R
40|$|Asthma <b>and</b> <b>CORD</b> {{are both}} {{heterogeneous}} lung diseases including many different phenotypes. The classical asthma <b>and</b> <b>CORD</b> phenotypes {{are easy to}} discern because they reflect extremes of a phenotypical spectrum. Thus asthma in childhood <b>and</b> <b>CORD</b> in smokers have their own phenotypic expression with underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that differ importantly. In older adults, asthma <b>and</b> <b>CORD</b> {{are more difficult to}} differentiate and there exists a bronchodilator response in most but not all patients with asthma and persistent airway obstruction in most but not all patients with CORD where even up to 50 % have been reported to have some bronchodilator response as assessed with FEVi. Airway obstruction is generated in the large and small airways both in asthma <b>and</b> <b>CORD,</b> <b>and</b> this small airway obstruction is located more proximally in asthma, yet is found more distally in severe and older individuals with asthma, comparable to CORD. Though the underlying inflammation and remodelling processes in asthma and COPD are different in their extreme phenotypes, there are overlap phenotypes with eosinophilic inflammation even in stable COPD and neutrophilic inflammation in longstanding and severe asthma...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that in successful pregnancies increased arginase activity is a mechanism {{that contributes to}} the suppression of the maternal immune system. We identified the main type of arginase-expressing cells as a population of activated low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in term placentae. In the present study, we analyzed the phenotype of LDGs and compared it to the phenotype of normal density granulocytes (NDGs) in maternal peripheral blood, placental biopsies <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> blood. Our data reveal that only LDGs but no NDGs could be detected in placental biopsies. Phenotypically, NDGs and LDGs from both maternal <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> blood expressed different levels of maturation, activation and degranulation markers. NDGs from the maternal <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> blood were phenotypically similar, while maternal, <b>cord</b> <b>and</b> placental LDGs showed different expression levels of CD 66 b. LDGs present in cord blood expressed higher levels of arginase compared to maternal and placental LDGs. In summary, our results show that in maternal <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> blood, two phenotypically different populations of neutrophils can be identified, whereas in ter...|$|R

40|$|SummaryHematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) reside in hypoxic niches within bone marrow <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> blood. Yet, {{essentially}} all HSC {{studies have been}} performed with cells isolated and processed in non-physiologic ambient air. By collecting and manipulating bone marrow <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> blood in native conditions of hypoxia, we demonstrate that brief exposure to ambient oxygen decreases recovery of long-term repopulating HSCs and increases progenitor cells, a phenomenon we term extraphysiologic oxygen shock/stress (EPHOSS). Thus, true numbers of HSCs in the bone marrow <b>and</b> <b>cord</b> blood are routinely underestimated. We linked ROS production and induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) via cyclophilin D and p 53 as mechanisms of EPHOSS. The MPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A protects mouse bone marrow <b>and</b> human <b>cord</b> blood HSCs from EPHOSS during collection in air, resulting in increased recovery of transplantable HSCs. Mitigating EPHOSS during cell collection and processing by pharmacological means may be clinically advantageous for transplantation...|$|R
