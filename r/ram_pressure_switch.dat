The observational characteristics of the different stages of <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> stripping are presented. The dynamical models yield the 3 D velocity vectors of the galaxies, peak <b>ram</b> <b>pressures,</b> and times to peak <b>ram</b> <b>pressure.</b> In {{the case of a}} smooth, static, and spherical intracluster medium, peak <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> occurs during the galaxy's closest approach to the cluster center, i. e. when the galaxy's velocity vector is perpendicular to its distance vector from the cluster center (M 87).

The linear orbital segments derived in this way together with the intracluster medium density distribution derived from X-ray observations give estimates of the <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> that are on average a factor of 2 higher than derived from the dynamical simulations for NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569. Resolving this discrepancy would require either a 2 times higher intracluster medium density than derived from X-ray observations, or a 2 times higher stripping efficiency than assumed by the dynamical models. Compared to NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569, NGC 4388 requires a still 2 times higher local intracluster medium density or a direction which is moderately different from that derived from the dynamical model.

Radial orbits within the Virgo cluster’s gravitational potential are modeled and analyzed with respect to <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> stripping. The N-body model consists of 10000 gas cloud complexes which can have inelastic collisions. <b>Ram</b> <b>pressure</b> is modeled as an additional acceleration on the clouds located at {{the surface of the}} gas distribution {{in the direction of the}} galaxy’s motion within the cluster.

A region of low surface-density gas, which is more extended than the main Hi disk, is discovered northeast of the galaxy center. These data are compared to existing 6 cm polarized radio continuum emission, H, and optical broad band images. We observe a coincidence between the western Hi and polarized emission edges, on the one hand, and a faint H emission ridge, on the other. The polarized emission maxima are located within the gaps between the spiral arms and the faint H ridge.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} shown that the Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4330 shows signs of ongoing <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> {{stripping}} in multiple wavelengths: at {{the leading edge of the}} interaction, the Halpha and dust extinction curve sharply out of the disk; on the trailing side, a long Halpha/UV tail has been found which is located upwind of a long HI tail. We complete the multiwavelength study with IRAM 30 m HERA CO(2 - 1) and VLA 6 cm radio continuum observations of NGC 4330. The data are interpreted with the help of a dynamical model including <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> and, for the first time, star formation. Our best-fit model reproduces qualitatively the observed projected position, radial velocity of the galaxy, the molecular and atomic gas distribution and velocity field, and the UV distribution in the region where a gas tail is present. However, the observed red UV color on the windward side is currently not reproduced by the model. Based on our model, the galaxy moves to the north and still approaches the cluster center with the closest approach occurring in ~ 100 Myr. In contrast to other Virgo spiral galaxies affected by <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> stripping, NGC 4330 does not show an asymmetric ridge of polarized radio continuum emission.

We complete the multiwavelength study with IRAM 30 m HERA CO(2 - 1) and VLA 6 cm radio continuum observations of NGC 4330. The data are interpreted with the help of a dynamical model including <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> and, for the first time, star formation. Our best-fit model reproduces qualitatively the observed projected position, radial velocity of the galaxy, the molecular and atomic gas distribution and velocity field, and the UV distribution in the region where a gas tail is present. However, the observed red UV color on the windward side is currently not reproduced by the model. Based on our model, the galaxy moves to the north and still approaches the cluster center with the closest approach occurring in ~ 100 Myr. In contrast to other Virgo spiral galaxies affected by <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> stripping, NGC 4330 does not show an asymmetric ridge of polarized radio continuum emission. We suggest that this is due to the relatively slow compression of the ISM and the particular projection of NGC 4330. The observed offset between the HI and UV tails is well reproduced by our model. Since collapsing and starforming gas clouds decouple from the <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> wind, the UV-emitting young stars have the angular momentum of the gas at the time of their creation. On the other hand, the gas is constantly pushed by <b>ram</b> <b>pressure.</b> The reaction (phase change, star formation) of the multiphase ISM (molecular, atomic, ionized) to <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> is discussed in the framework of our dynamical model.

40|$|An X-ray {{observation}} of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3266 was obtained via the ROSAT PSPC. This information, along with spectroscopic data from the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-clusters Survey (i. e. WINGS), were used to investigate whether <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> is a mechanism that influences star formation. Galaxies exhibiting ongoing star formation are identified {{by the presence of}} strong Balmer lines (Hβ), known to correspond to early type stars. Older galaxies where a rapid increase in star formation has recently ceased, known as E+A galaxies, are identified by strong Hβ absorption coupled with little to no [OII] emission. The correlation between recent star formation and ""high"" <b>ram</b> <b>pressure,</b> as defined by Kapferer et al. (2009) as ≥ 5 x 10 - 11 dyn cm - 2, was tested and lead to a contradiction of the previously held belief that <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> influences star formation on the global cluster scale...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} CO (J = 2 - 1) mapping with the IRAM 30 -m HEtrodyne Receiver Array (HERA) of CGCG 97 - 079, an {{irregular}} galaxy in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 1367 (z = 0. 022). We find that similar to 80 per {{cent of the}} detected CO (J = 2 - 1) is projected within a 16 arcsec(2) (6. 5 kpc(2)) region {{to the north and}} west of the optical/NIR centre, with the intensity maximum offset similar to 10 arcsec (4 kpc) NW of the optical/NIR centre and similar to 7 arcsec (3 kpc) south-east of the HI intensity maximum. Evolutionary synthesis models indicate CGCG 97 - 079 experienced a burst of star formation similar to 10 (8) yr ago, most likely triggered by a tidal interaction with CGCG 97 - 073. For CGCG 97 - 079 we deduce an infall velocity to the cluster of similar to 1000 km s(- 1) and moderate <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> (P-ram approximate to 10 (- 11) dyne cm(- 2)). The observed offset in CGCG 97 - 079 of the highest density HI and CO (J = 2 - 1) from the stellar components has not previously been observed in galaxies currently undergoing <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> stripping, although previous detailed studies of gas morphology and kinematics during <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> stripping were restricted to significantly more massive galaxies with deeper gravitational potential wells. We conclude the observed cold gas density maxima offsets are most likely the result of <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> and/or the high-speed tidal interaction with CGCG 97 - 073. However <b>ram</b> <b>pressure</b> stripping is likely to be playing {{a major role in the}} perturbation of lower density gas...|$|R
