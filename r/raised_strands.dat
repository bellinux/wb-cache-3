40|$|Conclusions: The {{immunological}} {{profile of}} IgA deficiency and/or <b>raised</b> double <b>stranded</b> DNA {{in the absence}} of antinuclear factor together with raised inflammatory markers and symptoms suggestive of an immune diathesis should alert the physician to the possibility of gluten sensitivity. The presence of an enteropathy is no longer a prerequisite for the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity, which can solely present with extraintestinal symptoms and signs. Knowledge of the diverse manifestations of gluten sensitivity is essential in avoiding such misdiagnosis...|$|R

50|$|Melting curve {{analysis}} is {{an assessment of}} the dissociation-characteristics of double-stranded DNA during heating.

The temperature at which 50% of DNA is denatured is known as the melting point, though it is an inaccurate term as it has {{very little to do with}} a traditional melting point.|$|R

After a last show of Demuth's work in May, he retreated to Lake George for the summer, exhausted and depressed. The <b>Strands</b> <b>raised</b> nearly sixteen thousand dollars for a new gallery for Stieglitz, who reacted harshly, saying it was time for [...] "young ones" [...] to do some of the work he had been shouldering for so many years.

2500|$|The need on the Gallipoli {{peninsula}} for {{means to}} carry {{water to the}} troops was considered so urgent that in mid-April, a request was forwarded to Egypt for the Zion Mule Corps to be sent immediately, regardless of its lack of equipment. Its commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson, DSO, an Irish Protestant, and Captain Trumpeldor was Second-in-command. The Zion Mule Corps landed at Cape Helles from [...] four weeks after being <b>raised,</b> having been <b>stranded</b> at Mudros when its ship ran aground. The corps was embarked in the same ship as the Indian 9th Mule Corps bound for Gaba Tepe and so a detour to Helles was ordered. The Zion Mule Corps was disembarked under artillery fire from the Asiatic shore, with help of volunteers from the 9th Mule Corps and began carrying supplies forward immediately.|$|R
5000|$|An {{estimated}} 100,000 people {{evacuated from}} the United States Gulf Coast ahead of Opal, with 5 percent of evacuees seeking public shelters and {{over half of}} evacuees seeking shelter out of their home counties; in their post-storm assessment the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) noted that the landfalls of Hurricane Allison and Hurricane Erin on the Florida panhandle {{earlier in the year}} produced a dichotomous mood toward preparations for Hurricane Opal—some people may have taken a [...] "wait and see" [...] approach that resulted in complacency, while others affected by the widespread power outages caused by Erin may have acquired a greater sense of readiness toward the approaching hurricane. Regardless, the overall evacuation process was described as chaotic, and the failure to clear hurricane evacuation routes of casual or communal traffic was blamed for the relative unease during evacuations for Opal. Traffic congestion on these routes caused some evacuees to return to vulnerable areas along the coast while <b>raising</b> fears that <b>stranded</b> evacuees on highways could be subjected to potentially fatal hurricane-force winds.|$|R

Object recognition, visual robot guidance, and several other vision applications require models of objects or scenes. Computer vision {{has a tradition of}} building these models from inherent object characteristics. The problem is that such characteristics are difficult to extract. Recently, a pure view-based object recognition approach was proposed, that is surprisingly performant. It is based on a model that is extracted directly from raw image data. Limitations of both <b>strands</b> <b>raise</b> the question whether there is room for middle ground solutions, that combine the strengths but avoid the weaknesses. Two examples are discussed, where in each case the only input required are images, but where nevertheless substantial feature extraction and analysis are involved. These are non-Euclidean 3 D reconstruction from multiple, uncalibrated Views and scene description based on local, affinely invariant surface patches that can be extracted from single views. Both models are useful for robot vision tasks such as visual navigation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenic}} agent {{responsible for the}} expanded repeat diseases, a group of neurodegenerative diseases that includes Huntington's disease is not yet fully understood. Expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) {{is thought to be}} the toxic agent in certain cases, however, not all expanded repeat disease genes can encode a polyQ sequence. Since a repeat-containing RNA intermediary is common to all of these diseases, hairpin-forming single-stranded RNA has been investigated as a potential common {{pathogenic agent}}. More recently, it has become apparent that most of the expanded repeat disease loci have transcription occurring from both <b>strands,</b> <b>raising</b> the possibility that the complementary repeat RNAs could form a double-stranded structure. In our investigation using Drosophila models of these diseases, we identified a fortuitous integration event that models bidirectional repeat RNA transcription with the resultant flies exhibiting inducible pathology. We therefore established further lines of Drosophila expressing independent complementary repeat RNAs and found that these are toxic. The Dicer pathway is essential for this toxicity and in neuronal cells accounts for metabolism of the high copy number (CAG. CUG) 100 double-stranded RNAs down to (CAG) 7 single-stranded small RNAs. We also observe significant changes to the microRNA profile in neurons. These data identify a novel pathway through which double-stranded repeat RNA is toxic and capable of eliciting symptoms common to neurodegenerative human diseases resulting from dominantly inherited expanded repeats.

40|$|Computers {{have been}} used {{building}} design since the 1950 s. Their first use was in structural analysis and construction planning. The use of computers in building design analysis has included extensive developments in structural analysis as well as programs {{for the analysis of}} the HVAC and environmental performance of buildings. Recently, more sophisticated analyses of environmental behaviour and the behaviour of building users have been developed and implemented. Computer graphics was developed initially in the 1960 s and formed the basis of computer-aided drafting systems [...] called CAD systems. These early CAD systems were used during the documentation phase of building design. These CAD systems developed beyondsimply drafting to modelling the geometryof the building. Today's commercial CAD systems are used at various stages in the building design process and are integrated with analysis tools. This paper briefly traces these developments before introducingcurrent research on IT for building design that has the potential to impact the way buildings will be designed in the future. Three strands of research are presented. The first strand deals with virtual environments for designing and designing virual environments. In virtualenvironmentsthe focus moves away from documentsto models and from a virtual building model on a designer's computer that is then sent to other members of the design team to a building model in a virtual environment that is accessible by any authorised member of the design team anywhere at any time. The issue of designingwithin virtual environmentsis <b>raised.</b> The second <b>strand</b> deals with new ways of carrying out simulations of the behaviour of the building users rather than the behaviour of the building. The third strand deals with novel computati [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} I show how {{aesthetic}} disciplines, to which musicology belongs, {{have suffered from}} a crisis of creativity {{for the past decade}} or so. By crisis of creativity I mean the development of new theories, which can contribute to new knowledge about music, from both historical and contemporary prespectives. With help from theories that normally lies outside of the institutional discourse of musicology, I argue that what is known as an intermedial perspective can contribute to a new understandning of music. The aim with this article is thus to introduce the concept of intermediality and the discipline of intermedial studies into the discussion of musicology as a discipline. Two parallel strands are followed through which four questions are <b>raised.</b> The two <b>strands</b> are: 1) the ”interarts” strand, and 2) the Cultural Studies/media studies strand. The four questions are: 1) What characterises the intermedial perspective? 2) Which theories appear? 3) What are the similarities and differences between the ”interarts” and ”Cultural Studies/media studies strands? and finally, 4) Is there a place for a ”new” humanities discipline now and in the future? Question number four deals with the premise that society today is characterised by an intensive media culture, in which all cultural expressions are woven into one another, i. e. a multimodal and intermedial culture. If we to accept this premise, then for an intended humanities discipline to understand this culture, a specific, clearly formulated body of theory is needed. There appears to be an increasing demand for such a body of theory within different disciplinary fields that already has been formulated within the field of intermedial studies. My suggestion is that intermedial studies can function as a supplement to the other aesthetic disciplines...|$|R
40|$|The nfo (endonuclease IV) gene of Escherichia coli is {{induced by}} {{superoxide}} generators such as paraquat (methyl viologen). An nfo'-lacZ operon fusion {{was used to}} isolate extragenic mutations affecting its expression. The mutations also affected the expression of glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, Mn 2 (+) -superoxide dismutase (sodA), and three lacZ fusions to soi (superoxide-inducible) genes of unknown function. The mutations were located 2 kilobases clockwise of ssb at 92 min on the current linkage map. One set of mutations, in a new gene designated soxR, caused constitutive overexpression of nfo and the other genes. It included insertions or deletions affecting the carboxyl end of a 17 -kilodalton polypeptide. In a soxR mutant, the expression of sodA, unlike that of nfo, was also regulated independently by oxygen tension. Two other mutants were isolated in which the target genes were noninducible; they had an increased sensitivity to killing by superoxide-generating compounds. One had a Tn 10 insertion in or near soxR; the other had a multigene deletion encompassing soxR. Therefore, the region functions as a positive regulator because it encodes one or more products needed for the induction of nfo. Regulation {{is likely to be}} at the level of transcription because the mutations were able to affect the expression of an nfo'-lac operon fusion that contained the ribosome-binding site for lacZ. Some mutant plasmids that failed to suppress (or complement) constitutivity in trans had insertion mutations several hundred nucleotides upstream of soxR in the general region of a gene for a 13 -kilodalton protein encoded by the opposite <b>strand,</b> <b>raising</b> the possibility of a second regulatory gene in this region. The result define a new regulon, controlled by soxR, mediating {{at least part of the}} global response to superoxide in E. coli...|$|R
40|$|A very {{significant}} {{form of company}} activity determining its development and even survival is innovation activity. Raising capital {{for the implementation of}} innovation is an important but not the only factor in the introduction of innovation. Characteristics of innovation, and in particular the risk of failure, make for a significant difficulty in obtaining external financing, particularly from third parties, which is an obstacle to their development and implementation. The subject of discussion in the article is the hybrid formula mezzanine type of financing innovative projects implemented both in start-up companies and in already well established companies. The purpose of the article is to discuss the possibilities and to perform an analysis of the practices followed by mezzanine funds in Poland in respect to the innovation activities of Polish companies. Research presented in the article was conducted on the basis of information on investments performed by mezzanine funds in Poland. Of particular importance for the innovativeness of the economy is to have companies from the SME sector, and therefore we also carried out research in this group. Innovations are often initiated in special purpose companies, start-up, etc., that operate in the SME sector. Therefore, the financing of innovation cannot be ignored as a thread of innovation in SMEs. The study involved interviews in several companies in the sector. The study concerned the possibilities of financing innovation involving mezzanine, knowledge of hybrid forms of financing, preparedness for hybrid financing. Studies are not representative, but are rather sounding a view to clarify any further research. Hypothesis: mezzanine financing, utilizing its specific benefits, is increasingly used to finance the gap in the financing of innovation, in particular special purpose companies in the SME sector. So the hypothesis <b>raises</b> two <b>strands</b> of research. The first concerned the financing of innovation as seen from the mezzanine fund. The second concerns the willingness of enterprises to use this form of financing. The first part of the article is devoted to the embeddedness of mezzanine financing. For that purpose, the specific innovation feature decisive to the possibility of external financing was indicated. Various investment strategies of Private Equity Funds on a global scale were presented in a way intended to highlight the meaning and characteristics of mezzanine financing. Also, on the basis of statistical data, the potential market for innovation financing in Poland was indicated. Subsequently the essence of mezzanine type financing and its potential to support development and innovation was presented. Upon this background, an analysis of the possibilities for financing innovation in startups and established companies was conducted. Also, examples of mezzanine financing that took place in Poland in recent years were presented. The article, therefore, is constructed in the form of deductive-inductive analysis. The conducted research leads to the conclusion that there is a gradual development of mezzanine financing in Poland. The transactions are also diverse as to the industry sector {{and the size of the}} investment. There is also a noticeable lowering of the minimum quota of individual investments, which means that the popularity of this form of financing could increase. What needs to be noticed, however, is that mezzanine funds focus their activity on companies in good financial condition, which do not have the credit capacity for the implementation of all their development projects. They have the characteristics of a mature organization. So they have: a strategy, experienced management, good cash flow, good market position and growth potential...|$|R
