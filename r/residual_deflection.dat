40|$|The {{histories}} of corrosion {{loss of material}} have a big influence on the long-term mechanical performance of steel structures.

By the use of this new method, it is expected that the change of residual stresses and <b>residual</b> <b>deflections</b> due to corrosion can be accurately evaluated at an arbitrary point of structural lifetime. Herein, in order to verify the validity of the proposed method, an experiment is carried out to measure the change of residual stresses by cutting a groove into a box column that mimics a local corrosion pattern. From this experiment, it is observed that the change of the residual stresses and <b>residual</b> <b>deflections</b> caused by the groove on the surface of a plate is well predicted by the proposed method if only the residual stresses and <b>residual</b> <b>deflections</b> of the virgin plate without the groove are known in advance.

Critical aspects of conventional FRP-reinforced concrete members—such as interfacial bond strength, flexural crack formation, composite deformation behavior, and brittle failure mode—are briefly reviewed and compared to FRP reinforced ECC. The interaction of linear elastic FRP reinforcement and ECC matrix with ductile stress-strain behavior in tension results in nonlinear elastic flexural response characteristics with stable hysteretic behavior, small <b>residual</b> <b>deflection,</b> and ultimately gradual compression failure. Compatible deformations of reinforcement and matrix lead to low interfacial bond stress and prevent composite disintegration by bond splitting and cover spalling.

The incident kinetic energy and impact velocity were 4. 2 kJ and 5. 6 m/s, respectively. A higher reinforcement ratio exhibited lower maximum and <b>residual</b> <b>deflections</b> and better deflection recovery.

The uncoupled analysis employed the empirical graphs prescribed by the UFC Code to simulate the blast load (i.e., parameters, P_rα, t_A, and t_d in Eq.  1). For such relatively small Z values, the distribution of blast overpressure {{on the surface of the}} target structure will be highly nonuniform.

The numerical model accounts {{for the effects of}} strain rate and confinement of the reinforced concrete, which are fundamental to the successful prediction of the impact response. The sensitivity of the material model parameters used for the validation is also scrutinised and numerical tests are performed to examine their suitability to simulate the shear failure conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} response of axially loaded slender square concrete filled steel tube (CFST) columns under low velocity lateral impact loading. A finite element analysis (FEA) model was developed using the explicit dynamic nonlinear finite element code LS -DYNA in which the strain rate effects of both steel and concrete, contact between steel tube and concrete and confinement effect provided by the steel tube for the concrete were considered. The model also benefited from a relatively recent feature of LS-DYNA for applying a pre-loading in the explicit solver. The developed numerical model was verified for its accuracy and adequacy {{by comparing the results}} with experimental results available in the literature. The verified model was then employed to conduct a parametric study to investigate the influence of axial load level, impact location, support conditions, and slenderness ratio on the response of the CFST columns. A good agreement between the numerical and experimental results was achieved. The model could reasonably predict the impact load-deflection history and deformed shape of the column {{at the end of the}} impact event. The results of the parametric study showed that whilst impact location, axial load level and slenderness ratio can have a significant effect on the peak impact force, <b>residual</b> lateral <b>deflection</b> and maximum lateral deflection, the influence of support fixity is minimal. With an increase of axial load to up to a certain level, the peak force increases; however, a further increase in the axial load causes a decrease in the peak force. Both <b>residual</b> lateral <b>deflection</b> and maximum lateral deflection increase as axial load level increases. Shifting the impact location towards the supports increases the peak force and reduces both residual and maximum lateral deflections.

Recent terrorist incidents and accidental explosions have demonstrated the need to study the effects of such threats on structures in order to develop effective methods of reducing the overall impact of blast loads. With the arrival of innovative materials such as steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC), ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) and high strength steel reinforcement, research is required in order to successfully adapt these new materials in blast-resistant structures. Hence, the objective of this thesis to conduct an experimental parametric study with the purpose of investigating the implementation of these innovative materials in reinforced concrete slabs and panels. As part of the study, a total of fourteen one-way slab specimens with different combinations of concrete, steel fibres and steel reinforcement are tested under simulated blast loads using the University of Ottawa Shock-Tube Facility. The test program includes three slabs constructed with normal-strength concrete, five slabs constructed with SFRC and six slabs constructed with UHPFRC. Among these specimens, four are reinforced with high-performance steel reinforcement. The specimens are subjected to repeated blast loading with gradually increasing reflected pressure and reflected impulse until failure. The performance of the slabs is studied using various criteria such as failure load and mode, maximum and <b>residual</b> <b>deflections,</b> as well as tensile cracking, spalling and secondary fragmentation control.

40|$|The {{deterioration}} of steel in aging reinforced concrete bridges is a continual problem which {{could benefit from}} improved rehabilitation techniques that take advantage of enhanced and more durable materials such as fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Appropriately designed hybrid material systems benefit from the performance and durability advantages of FRP materials yet remain more cost effective than comparable all-composite systems. Development of rapid rehabilitation systems for the decks of concrete box girder bridges, which are increasingly common throughout the United States, is presented. One goal {{of this research is}} to assess and validate the use of FRP composite panels for use as both stay-in-place formwork and as the bottom longitudinal and transverse reinforcement in the deck of concrete box girder bridges. Performance assessments for full-scale two -cell box girder bridge specimens through monotonic and extensive cyclic loading provided validation for the FRP panel system bridge deck as a viable rehabilitation solution for box girder bridge decks. The FRP panel system performed comparably to a conventionally reinforced concrete bridge deck in terms of serviceability, deflection profiles, and system level structural interaction and performed superior to the RC bridge deck in terms of <b>residual</b> <b>deflections,</b> and structural response under cyclic loading. Assessment of a damaged FRP panel bridge deck system, which was repaired using a resin injection technique, showed superior performance for the repaired system in terms of integrity of the FRP panel interface and cyclic response. Rapid rehabilitation techniques for strengthening reinforced concrete box girder bridge deck overhangs using near-surface-mounted (NSM) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) were also evaluated. Analytical predictions of load carrying capacity and deflections provided correlation with experimental results, and the developed analysis methods provide an effective design tool for future research. Results from the laboratory testing of a bridge deck overhang strengthened with FRP showed significant increases in load carrying capacity as well as deformation capacity as compared to the as-built specimen without FRP.
