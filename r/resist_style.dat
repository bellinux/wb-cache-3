5000|$|The four {{forms of}} mental {{self-government}} are hierarchical, monarchic, oligarchic, and anarchic. The hierarchic style holds multiple goals simultaneously and prioritizes them. The oligarchic style is similar but differs in involving difficulty prioritizing. The monarchic style, in comparison, {{focuses on a}} single activity until completion. The anarchic <b>style</b> <b>resists</b> conformity to [...] "systems, rules, or particular approaches to problems." ...|$|R
25|$|A {{series of}} {{earthquakes}} during the 18th century severely damaged {{most of the}} colonial-era stone buildings of Charlestown. The Georgian stone buildings in Charlestown that are visible today had to be partially rebuilt after the earthquakes, and {{this led to the}} development of a new architectural style, consisting of a wooden upper floor over a stone ground floor; the new <b>style</b> <b>resisted</b> earthquake damage much more effectively.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the players, such as Dave [...] "Killer" [...] Carlson (Jerry Houser) {{embrace the}} shift, but Braden, a college-educated player {{with a clean}} <b>style,</b> <b>resists</b> every chance to fight. Braden's failing {{relationship}} with his bored wife Lily (Lindsay Crouse), puts further strain on him, and Dunlop feigns interest in her to provoke Braden. After realizing that she is truly depressed and falling into alcoholism, Dunlop establishes a friendship between Lily and Francine (Jennifer Warren), Dunlop's ex-wife.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band has}} done many shows since {{the release of}} their album [...] "Too Bad to be True" [...] and it showed that not only the undogmatic and open minded punk and {{hardcore}} audience loves Dallax but also the [...] "Ska Police" [...] could not <b>resist</b> the uptempo <b>style</b> of the band - sharp-edged brass and noisy and catchy guitar licks make their way straight {{to the people and}} urge them to dance and sing along to Dallax tunes.|$|R
50|$|Dinnerstein {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, and studied with Moses Soyer, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Julian E. Levi at the Art Students League of New York. From 1947 to 1950 Dinnerstein was also {{a student at the}} Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia. Upon his return to New York in the early 1950s, he was {{one of a group of}} recent Tyler {{graduates}} who <b>resisted</b> the prevailing <b>style</b> of Abstract Expressionism in order to paint in a figurative mode.|$|R
5000|$|Rodel Tapaya's current {{works are}} marked by labyrinthine {{patterns}} and recurring characters that transmit scenes and figures from folk stories in his pictorial world. His detailed execution and finish was described by critic Patrick Flores as a [...] "practice (that) pursues the process of myth-making, appropriating certain archetypes in the discourse of origin and expanding it to create a visual vocabulary that is entirely his own. The folk aesthetic in this highly mediated and idiosyncratic language becomes part of a contemporary reflection on {{a sense of belonging}} to a domain of culture. The <b>style</b> <b>resists</b> nativist appropriation of motif; rather it invents its own, making the artist’s effort an interesting intertext to prevailing mythologies." [...] These qualities have led him to receive positive reception from art collectors. He is one of Southeast Asia's most successful contemporary artist at auctions; the far-reaching appreciation of his works {{has been part of the}} wave that gained more attention for Southeast Asian contemporary art in recent years.|$|R
40|$|Appearance {{is one way}} {{in which}} lesbian and {{bisexual}} identities and affiliation to lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) subculture can be demonstrated. ‘Butch’ and ‘androgynous’ styles have been used by lesbian women to communicate a non-heterosexual identity. However, some LGB appearance researchers have argued {{that there has been a}} mainstreaming and diversification of lesbian style in the last couple of decades, which has resulted in less distinction between lesbian and straight looks. This research draws on the Social Identity approach to explore contemporary style in lesbian and bisexual communities. Fifteen lesbian and bisexual women took part in semi-structured interviews which were analysed using thematic analysis. Although some participants reported a diversification of lesbian style, most used the term ‘butch’ to describe lesbian style, and a ‘boyish’ look was viewed as the most common contemporary lesbian style. By contrast, most participants could not identify distinct bisexual appearance norms. The data provide evidence of conflicting desires (and expectations) to visibly project social identity by conforming to specific lesbian styles, and to be an authentic, unique individual by <b>resisting</b> these subcultural <b>styles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Exposition and {{narration}} as writing {{forms are}} often oppositional {{in terms of}} their purposes, stylistic elements, and organizational patterns. Recently there have been calls for “mixed” and “alternate” genre writing to allow for the intersection of academic investigation (typically exposition) and emotional investment (typically narration) previously limited by using either/or forms. The present study was an investigation into the writing process of writers choosing mixed genre forms. ^ Five interviews were conducted with writers of five mixed genre writing pieces published in refereed academic journals or books. The researcher sought to determine the following: What characterizes a piece of mixed genre writing, according to the writer, in terms of (a) purposes of the writer including but not limited to personal, communicative, learning, and political, (b) content, (c) writing strategies/processes, (d) learning processes, and (e) form(s) chosen. What are the influences, according to the writer, that cause these writers to choose this <b>style</b> or <b>resist</b> another <b>style,</b> including but not limited to, the politics of academia in general and the field in particular, the status of the writer in the field, and {{the context in which the}} piece is submitted? ^ Analysis of the case studies indicated that mixed genre writing gave participants a place to grapple with a problem or idea by synthesizing informational knowledge with personal knowledge. Furthermore, the participants all emphasized the learning they experienced during this writing process. These findings are not surprising given the foundational literature by Vygotsky (1962 / 1996), Britton (1970), and Berthoff (1981, 1984) suggesting that the linking of personal experience and academic exploration are essential for learning. The data further indicated that the narration/exposition opposition might be politically/institutionally motivated and/or maintained in spite of the fact that the kind of synthetic thinking prompted by mixed genre writing might best serve the learning interests of students. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{crime of}} sexual assault is {{substantially}} underreported; yet, when victims do report, often times they are met with skepticism and blaming attitudes by law enforcement. Literature shows that sexual assault victims report being further traumatized by the harsh methods used by police and investigators. The effects of rape are aggravated when victims have a negative experience upon reporting, making this a serious concern. Efforts {{have been made to}} improve victim treatment but with little success. With reform efforts dating back to the 1970 s, the question that must be asked is why is this still a problem? Most articles on this topic focus on the victims and their experiences; yet, there is a major gap in the literature when studying the detectives themselves and their experiences. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand why some detectives are resistant to using a sensitive interviewing style with victims. In depth interviews of 20 sexual assault detectives and sergeants from a large metropolitan police department were conducted. Five main reasons for <b>resisting</b> sensitive interviewing <b>styles</b> were found. Theoretical and practical applications of the findings are also discussed including advice to prevent sexual assault and recommendations to improve victim treatment from law enforcement...|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} earlier, this custom-built {{machine has}} three modes of operation: NIL, photolithography and laser lithography (Fig.  1 c depicts {{a schematic of}} the lithography mechanisms). To operate the tool, a substrate (of up to 150  mm square) must be pre-coated in UV-sensitive resist before mounting on the vacuum port of the hotplate base. The feet of the hotplate may be lowered or raised to level the system. To perform photolithography or NIL, a photomask or UV-transparent stamp of base 25  mm square needs to be loaded into the recessed vacuum port on the imprinter head. The CNC software (cncGraf Pro) may then be used to position the stepper head and lower it {{into contact with the}} resist coated substrate. As the mask/stamp contacts the substrate, the springs on the stepper head compress and the compression force is measured by the load cell. The CNC software can then be used to turn on the UV LED until the resist below the mask/stamp is cured. A calibration substrate is initially required to determine both the load and exposure dose required for optimum pattern transfer because the curing time is dependent on the thickness and type of resist used and the forward current applied to the UV LED as well as composition and thickness of the mask/stamp. Once the desired load and exposure dose are determined, the process of stepping out a pattern may be automated with G-code programming (the standard CNC language) or discrete moves may be initiated by the user as and when required. Provided the substrates are flat, the calibration load may be correlated to a Z position and utilised in the automation code as the imprint position (because one cannot assign a desired pressure in G-code but one can assign a Z position). The LED may be turned on with the G-code by triggering the spindle output. The automation code also requires a Z position above the substrate in order to define a safe level of withdrawal so that any desired change to the X and Y position may be accommodated. Once the desired series of exposures/imprints have been obtained, the substrate may be removed from the machine as the lithography stage is now complete. The third lithography mechanism is laser curing. The laser source is only designed to cure a point location on a resist-coated sample surface but through automated movement may expose the <b>resist</b> through freehand <b>style.</b> The speed of motion and intensity of light may be varied. The laser assembly is set up so that it is positioned at a distance defined by the objective. With the × 20 objective present in this report, the working distance is 15  mm.|$|R
