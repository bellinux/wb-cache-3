40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sensitivity analysis of <b>railpad</b> parameters on vertical railway track dynamics, incorporating the nonlinear {{behavior of the}} fastening (i. e., downward forces compress the <b>railpad</b> whereas upward forces are resisted by the clamps). For this purpose, solid railpads, rail-railpad contact and preloaded springs are defined in a three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element track model. In addition, railpads are modeled as Prony series so that measured frequency-dependent <b>railpad</b> properties for different clamp toe load, temperature, aging, and <b>railpad</b> type are considered. Through sensitivity analysis using time-domain and frequency-domain responses, {{the influence of the}} <b>railpad</b> parameters on the global track response is investigated. <b>Railpad</b> type, toe load and aging are identified as the most relevant parameters in the frequency range of 300 - 3, 000 Hz. Furthermore, the information obtained over track response changes due to fastening loosening and <b>railpad</b> wear could be used for monitoring the condition of fastenings.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method was}} developed to investigate the vertical dynamic behaviour of a railway track subjected to the loading of a moving train. The numerical simulations are {{carried out in the}} time-domain with what is known as a moving mass model. This doctoral thesis emphasises especially the influence on the train-track dynamics of the ballast mass (giving rise to inertia forces when a train passes), the influence of the non-linear characteristics of the <b>railpad</b> and of the sleeper support, and the part played by scatter in some track structure properties, such as varying <b>railpad</b> stiffness, varying ballast stiffness and varying sleeper spacing. Full-scale measurements in the field sometimes reveal a track resonance at low frequency (somewhere in the region of 20 to 150 Hz). This resonant behaviour cannot be modelled unless the ballast-subgrade inertia is included in the track model, which is done here. Both laboratory and full-scale field measurements have shown that the load deflection behaviour of the <b>railpad</b> and the sleeper support are non-linear. In a realistic demonstration example, the influence of a state dependent <b>railpad</b> on <b>railpad</b> compression and rail wear was investigated. It was shown that, for a weakly state dependent <b>railpad,</b> the difference in results compared with those obtained for a linear model is negligible. Measurements have also shown that track parameter values are not constant along the track. In fact, very dissimilar properties have been observed even between neighbouring sleepers. It is concluded that, if one wants to investigate the mean values and variations of selected track parameters, a method that does not restrict the variation and distribution of the stochastic variables is, while not necessary, certainly preferable...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of railway track with {{a section of}} unsupported sleepers is examined experimentally and a mathematical model of such track is presented. The principal function of ballast at frequencies above I 00 Hz is to damp vibration of the track while the resilience of the <b>railpad</b> attenuates forces transmitted to the sleeper. In the absence of ballast, concrete sleepers are likely to crack if there are modest wheel or railhead irregularities. ...|$|E
40|$|Resilient <b>railpads</b> in {{a variety}} of {{materials}} and with different surface profiling have been tested in the laboratory and in track. A laboratory impact test based on that initially developed at the Battelle Columbus Laboratories provides a reliable ranking {{of the extent to which}} <b>railpads</b> attenuate dynamic strain in concrete sleepers in track. The test is also a good indication of the average attenuation provided by a pad in track. Ifdynamic loads in track are particularly severe the fractional attenuation provided by a pad is greater than that indicated by the laboratory impact test. Laboratory resonance apparatus, in which the pad is the principal resilient element in a simple dynamic system, has been made tofind the <b>railpad’s</b> effective dynamic stiffness. There is good correlation between the stiffness measured in track and that measured in this apparatus. A pad’s dynamic stiffness is consistently at least as great as its tangent stiffness foundfrom the static loadldeflection curve. The load/defection behaviour of a pad in track can be found from measurements in an assembly of rail and sleeper in the laboratory. ...|$|R

This can potentially have different causes. Whilst this may not necessarily be relevant for the total passby noise level, it seems to indicate that the characteristics of the <b>railpads</b> or fastening system vary during the pass-by. This effect has been observed on different tracks and is clearly visible in a spectrogram taken over sufficiently long measurement time. Some examples of this phenomenon are presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R

Besides the already standardised method for direct roughness measurement, it is also possible to measure combined wheel-rail roughness from vertical railhead vibration during a train pass-by. This is a different quantity which has several applications. The measurement technique has significant practical benefits and has been in use for several years. There is currently still a need for measurement procedures for the following: - Assessment of noise control measures under operational conditions (rail and wheel dampers, roughness control, track/wheel geometry, <b>railpads,</b> shielding) - Separation techniques for track and vehicle contributions, and for separating rolling noise from other noise sources. Combined wheel/rail roughness and associated transfer functions offer an efficient means for this purpose. The method and procedures for the above applications are outlined here...|$|R
40|$|A {{vertical}} vehicle–track coupled dynamic model, {{consisting of}} a high-speed train on a continuously supported rail, is established in the frequency-domain. The solution is obtained efficiently by use of the Green's function method, which can determine the vibration response {{over a wide range}} of frequency without any limitations due to modal truncation. Moreover, real track irregularity spectra can be used conveniently as input. The effect of the flexibility of both track and car body on the entire vehicle–track coupled dynamic response is investigated. A multi-body model of a vehicle with either rigid or flexible car body is defined running on three kinds of track: a rigid rail, a track stiffness model and a Timoshenko beam model. The results show that neglecting the track flexibility leads to an overestimation of both the contact force and the whole vehicle vibration response. The car body flexibility affects the ride quality of the vehicle and the coupling through the track and can be significant in certain frequency ranges. Finally, the effect of <b>railpad</b> and ballast stiffness on the vehicle–track coupled vibration is analysed, indicating that the stiffness of the <b>railpad</b> has an influence on the system in a higher frequency range than the ballast...|$|E

40|$|Analytical and {{finite element}} {{solutions}} to the problem of a vibrating beam on an elastic foundation are presented. An application example is a concrete railway sleeper embedded in an elastic medium (the ballast). The sleeper is also elastically connected to the rails. Eigenfrequencies are calculated and vibration modes are discussed. The beam (sleeper) is divided into sections where each section {{may or may not be}} supported by the elastic foundation. The elastic connections to the rails are situated at the two joinings of the three sleeper sections. Some conclusions are that Euler-Bernoulli beam theory can be used to calculate two, or maximum three, eigenfrequencies of the sleeper. The foundation stiffness influences the lowest bending-mode eigenfrequency the most; higher eigenfrequencies are practically unaffected by the foundation stiffness. The influence of <b>railpad</b> (and rail) stiffness on the sleeper eigenfrequencies is negligible...|$|E

The method used is computationally efficient {{in the sense that}} a reduced number of coordinates is sufficient and doesn’t require high efficiency computers. The method proposes a modal substructuring approach of the system by modelling rails, sleepers and underlying structure with modal coordinates, the vehicle with physical lumped elements coordinates and by introducing interconnection elements between these structures (wheel-rail contact, <b>railpads</b> and ballast) by means of their interaction forces. The Frequency response function (FRF) is also calculated for both cases of track over a structure (a bridge, a viaduct [...] .) and for the simple vehicle-track program; for each case the vehicle effect on the FRF is then analyzed through the comparison of the FRFs obtained introducing or not a simplified vehicle on the system...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model (3 D FEM) of wheel/high rail rolling contact on curved track has been introduced in this article. The elastic-plastic model from FEM code ANSYS/LS-DYNA included a whole wheel, 680 mm of the high rail and some sub-components of the track (<b>railpads,</b> sleepers, and ballast). Furthermore, the rail was canted as in practical situation and the influences of angle of attack (AOA) were also investigated in detail. The obtained results have demonstrated that two-point contact pattern can potentially appear as the train enters a curved track. The stress states on two contact zones showed that the maximum stress at the rail gauge was higher than that at the rail head. Besides, the higher AOA {{could lead to a}} higher stress magnitude, especially at the rail gauge where damages appear frequently. This study can provide useful information for a future research on surface damage mechanism of the rail of a curved track...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} modelling of floating-slab {{tracks on}} rigid foundations. The model {{consists of an}} upper Euler–Bernoulli beam to account for both the rails and a lower Euler–Bernoulli beam {{to account for the}} slab. There are two continuous resilient layers in the model: one to account for <b>railpads</b> between the rails and the slab and one to account for slab-bearings underneath the slab. The Fourier transformation method is used to calculate displacements of such a track under an oscillating moving load. These results are used to calculate the cut-on frequencies and critical velocity of the track. The work in this paper also demonstrates some basic concepts in the context of vibration of infinite systems including dispersion curves, critical velocities, load-velocity lines and coupling of systems in the wavenumber-frequency domain. The paper offers a complete treatment of the issues important to the analysis of a double-beam system not elsewhere available in the published literature...|$|R
40|$|In {{railway track}} dynamics, the {{stiffness}} and damping properties of railpads {{have a significant}} effect on track vibration, decay rates as well forces transmitted to the track supporting structure. Many studies have shown that railpads exhibit pronounced nonlinear behaviour, with preload and frequency dependent properties. This paper presents a three parameter <b>railpad</b> model, together with its differential equation of motion and the required model parameters obtained from experimental data. A time domain model of a rail discretely supported on these railpads is then formulated using the finite element method. The model is subjected to static and dynamic loading in order to study the effects of preload and frequency on its dynamic behaviour. Results are shown as time histories and frequency spectra for the track displacements and reaction forces for various preload levels. They emphasise the necessity of accounting for nonlinear behaviour based on the large disparities (up to 20 dB) observed between the linear and nonlinear cases for the parameters used in this stud...|$|E
40|$|Railway {{deterioration}} has {{an immediate}} {{impact on our}} daily life. The correct functioning of trams, metros and trains is required to regularly transport {{hundreds of millions of}} passengers and tons of goods. A key aspect to guarantee the massive passenger and freight transport is to prevent or, at least, slow down railway deterioration. The main goal of this dissertation is to {{have a better understanding of}} track vibrations and interactions between components. In turn, such deeper understanding will enable us to slow down the deterioration through new, optimized track designs and maintenance measures, thus extending the service life of railway tracks and, consequently, lower their life-cycle costs. Therefore, we focus on measuring and modeling the vertical dynamics of railway tracks. The first part of the dissertation focuses on the in-depth analysis of extensive field hammer test measurements. Hammer tests are simple and inexpensive, yet they provide valuable information about the characteristic frequencies of tracks. To assess the potential of hammer tests to be employed for track deterioration investigation, we designed and conducted a feasibility study on insulated rail joints (IRJs) in the field. First, a reference dynamic response is defined and then it is compared to the response of three different damaged IRJs. Three characteristic frequency bands related to the damaged IRJs are derived independently of the type of damage. In view of these promising results, a Frequency Response Function (FRF) -based statistical method is proposed to identify characteristic frequencies of railway track defects. The method compares a damaged track state to a healthy state, which, in this case, is defined following the concepts of control charts employed in process monitoring. The FRF-based statistical method is tested at squats of different severity in two tracks types. For both squats and damaged IRJs, the identified characteristic frequencies agree with those found with an extensively validated vehicle-borne detection system (i. e. Axle Box Acceleration (ABA) system). This means we are indeed able to identify characteristic frequencies of defects using hammer tests. In the second part of the dissertation, a three-dimensional finite element (3 D FE) model of tracks with monoblock sleepers is developed to study in-detail track vertical dynamics. This sleeper type is used worldwide, but its dynamic behavior is often not accurately considered in track models. To study the track dynamics, hammer tests are numerically reproduced applying an Implicit–Explicit FE procedure. First, the equilibrium state of the track is calculated and then the response of the track to hammer excitation is simulated in the time domain. Next, our 3 D FE model and field measurements are combined by fitting simulations to measurements, so that (1) the model is validated and the accuracy to reproduce measurements is determined, (2) the in-service track parameters are derived, and (3) insight is gained into the contribution of components to track dynamics and the effect of simplifications in modeling. After validating our 3 D FE model with measurements and performing a comprehensive analysis, we find that the frequency response between 300 and 3000 Hz is defined by seven characteristic features and vibration modes. This is an important result for understanding track dynamics, given that the tracks with biblock sleepers only have four such features. The bending modes of monoblock sleeper and the stronger coupling between the two rails cause two of the additional features. The third additional feature occurs in the frequency range dominated by the rail-railpad-sleeper interaction. With the 3 D FE model as basis, the influence of the representation of this interaction into the numerically calculated vertical dynamics is investigated. For this purpose, four fastening representations are developed: (1) commonly used spring-damper pair, (2) area covering spring-damper pairs, (3) solid <b>railpad</b> connected to the rail, and (4) solid <b>railpad</b> in frictional contact with the rail and fixed to the support by preloaded springs, which represent the clamps. Their comparison shows that the overall numerical reproduction of the measurements improves the more realistic is the representation of the fastening. If the accuracy of the fastening models is quantified, the model with solid railpads and clamps reproduce the seven characteristics at a maximum frequency difference of 6 %, whereas for the conventional model, the difference can be as high as 27 %. The lateral and longitudinal dimensions of the <b>railpad,</b> and the lateral and longitudinal constraints between the rail and support applied by the fastening, are both relevant aspects to consider when modeling fastenings. By examining field measurements and numerical models, useful information is gained for track design and for the development of maintenance measures. Regarding measurements, if field hammer tests are analyzed by employing the FRF-based statistical method, characteristic frequencies of track defects can be identified and can become valuable input data for the development of vehicle-born detection systems, such as ABA systems. Concerning the 3 D FE model, a deep insight into the vertical dynamics of tracks with monoblock sleepers is obtained and the comprehensive study of fastening representation has indicated the need to model this track component more realistically, so that the track dynamics at high frequencies can be correctly reproduced. This finding should be considered in vehicle-track models to improve the reproduction of vehicle-track high frequency dynamics. A more realistic fastening modeling is especially required to represent tracks with rail defects since the defect's development may be related to the condition of the fastening. Thus, the advanced fastening models presented in this research are expected to significantly contribute to the investigation of fastening degradation and track defects. In addition, the evolution of in-service track parameters (i. e. stiffness and damping of <b>railpad</b> and ballast) identified during the fitting process can be monitored and it may become valuable input data for the planning of maintenance. Overall, our combination of measurements and numerical models contributes to the understanding of track dynamics. Furthermore, we have provided models and tools that can be used for the investigation and monitoring of track deterioration. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|When {{studying}} the dynamic behaviour of a structure, e g a railway track, {{it is important}} for the analyst to model both stiffness and damping accurately. Mathematical models including fractional derivatives have been found to work well for many materials. Such models are linear and causal. They result in linear differential equations with noninteger-order derivatives when incorporated into the equations of motion of the structure. Different methods to solve such equations exist. A modal synthesis solution method is discussed. The order of the fractional derivatives is assumed (approximated) to be a rational number. A state-space vector containing fractional derivatives of the displacements is introduced and the system of equations is expanded. The eigenmodes of the expanded system are used to transform the equations into a set of decoupled modal equations. The solutions of the modal equations, weighted by the eigenmodes, are superposed to give the physical response of the transiently loaded structure. Ways to reduce the computational effort are proposed. It is found that the matrices of the expanded system need not be numerically established. Equations of motion with fractional derivatives require initial conditions on both fractional and integer-order derivatives of the displacements. A model with fractional integrals instead of fractional derivatives is suggested. When this model is incorporated into the equations of motion, the solution of the resulting equations require initial conditions on displacements and velocities only. Further, the fractional integral model implies a unique relationship between stress and strain, whereas the fractional derivative model requires initial conditions. A time integration method is outlined for the numerical solution of the equations of motion when they are based on the fractional integral model. A fractional calculus model of the dynamic behaviour of railpads is proposed. In a railway track, railpads are placed between the steel rails and the concrete sleepers. They protect the sleepers from wear and they provide electrical insulation. More important, when {{studying the}} dynamic behaviour of the track, is the influence of the railpads on the stiffness and damping of the whole track structure. The stiffness and damping of studded rubber railpads have been measured as functions of frequency, both in a test rig and in a complete track. The stiffness is found to increase weakly with the frequency, but to increase strongly with the static preload. The loss factor is found to be nearly independent of the preload and to increase only slightly with the frequency. The parameters of the fractional derivative <b>railpad</b> model are fitted to experimental data from the laboratory measurements. A different set of parameters is needed for each level of preload since, as mentioned, the fractional derivative model is linear...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{generated}} by underground railways transmits to nearby buildings causing annoyance to inhabitants and malfunctioning to sensitive equipment. Vibration can be isolated through countermeasures {{by reducing the}} stiffness of <b>railpads,</b> using floating-slab tracks and/or supporting buildings on springs. Modelling of vibration from underground railways has recently gained more importance {{on account of the}} need to evaluate accurately the performance of vibration countermeasures before these are implemented. This paper develops an existing model, reported by Forrest and Hunt, for calculating vibration from underground railways. The model, known as the Pipe-in-Pipe model, has been developed in this paper to account for anti-symmetrical inputs and therefore to model tangential forces at the tunnel wall. Moreover, three different arrangements of supports are considered for floating-slab tracks, one which can be used to model directly-fixed slabs. The paper also investigates the wave-guided solution of the track, the tunnel, the surrounding soil and the coupled system. It is shown that the dynamics of the track have significant effect on the results calculated in the wavenumber–frequency domain and therefore an important role on controlling vibration from underground railways...|$|R
40|$|An {{infinite}} Bernoulli-Euler beam (representing the “combined rail” {{consisting of}} the rail and longitudinal sleeper) mounted on periodic flexible point supports (representing the <b>railpads)</b> has already {{proven to be a}} suitable mathematical model for the floating ladder track (FLT), to define its natural vibrations and its forced response due to a moving load. Adopting deliberately conservative parameters for the existing FLT design, we present further results for the response to a steadily (uniformly) moving load when the periodic supports are assumed to be elastic, and then introduce the mass and viscous damping of the periodic supports. Typical support damping significantly moderates the resulting steady deflexion at any load speed, and in particular substantially reduces the magnitude of the resonant response at the critical speed. The linear mathematical analysis is then extended to include the inertia of the load that otherwise moves uniformly along the beam, generating overstability at supercritical speeds - i. e. at load speeds notably above the critical speed predicted for the resonant response when the load inertia is neglected. Neither the resonance nor the overstability should prevent the safe implementation of the FLT design in modern high speed rail systems. Roger J. Hosking and Fausto Milinazz...|$|R

In particular, we have studied this matter from a two-dimensional (2 D) finite element model to a fully coupled three-dimensional (3 D) multi-body finite element model. The vehicle and track are coupled via a non-linear Hertz contact mechanism. The method of Lagrange multipliers {{is used for the}} contact constraint enforcement between wheel and rail. Distributed elevation irregularities are generated based on power spectral density (PSD) distributions which are taken into account for the interaction. The numerical simulations are performed in the time domain, using a direct integration method for solving the transient problem due to the contact nonlinearities. The results obtained include contact forces, forces transmitted to the infrastructure (sleeper) by <b>railpads</b> and envelopes of relevant results for several track irregularities and speed ranges.

40|$|Wheel flats are {{the sources}} of high {{magnitude}} impact forces at the wheel-rail interface, which can induce high levels of local stresses leading to fatigue damage, and failure of various vehicle and track components. With demands for increased load and speed, the issue of wheel flats and a strategy for effective maintenance and in-time replacement of defective wheels has become an important concern for heavy haul operators. A comprehensive coupled vehicle-track model is thus {{required in order to}} predict the impact forces and the resulting component stresses in the presence of wheel flats. This study presents the dynamic response of an Euler- Bernoulli beam supported on two-parameter Pasternak foundation subjected to moving load as well as moving mass. Dynamic responses of the beam in terms of normalized deflection and bending moment have been investigated for different velocity ratios under moving load and moving mass conditions. The effect of moving load velocity on dynamic deflection and bending moment responses of the beam have been investigated. The effect of foundation parameters such as, stiffness and shear modulus on dynamic deflection and bending moment responses have also been investigated for both moving load and moving mass at constant speeds. This dissertation research concerns about modeling of a three-dimensional railway vehicle- track model that can accurately predict the wheel-rail interactions in the presence of wheel defects. This study presents a three-dimensional track system model using two Timoshenko beams supported on discrete elastic supports, where the sleepers are considered as rigid masses, and the rail pad and ballast as spring-damper elements. The vehicle system is modeled as a three-dimensional 17 - DOF lumped mass model comprising a full car body, two bogies and four wheelsets. The railway track is modeled as a pair of three-dimensional flexible beams that considers two parallel Timoshenko beams periodically supported by lumped masses representing the sleepers. The wheel-rail contact is modeled using nonlinear Hertzian contact theory. The developed model is validated with the existing measured data and analytical solutions available in literature. The nonlinear model is then employed to investigate the wheel-rail impact forces that arise in the wheel-rail interface due to the presence of single as well as multiple wheel flats. The effects of single and multiple wheel flats on the responses of vehicle and track components in terms of displacements and acceleration responses are investigated for both defective wheel and the flat-free wheel. The characteristics of the bounce, pitch and roll motions of the bogie due to a single wheel flat are also investigated. The study shows that nonlinear <b>railpad</b> and ballast model gives better prediction of the wheel-rail impact force than that of the linear model when compared with the experimental data. The results clearly show that presence of wheel flat within the same wheelset has significant effect on the impact force, displacement and acceleration responses of that wheelset. This study further presents the modeling of a MEMS based accelerometer in order to detect the presence of a wheel flat in the railway vehicle. The proposed accelerometer can survive in a dynamic shock environment with acceleration up to ± 150 g. Simulations of the accelerometer are performed under various operating conditions {{in order to determine the}} optimum configuration. ...|$|E

An investigation was carried out on the leading and trailing axles of the third locomotive, where the axle load is more severe than that on {{the first and second}} locomotives. Two types of locomotives (AC and DC) currently run in Australia were evaluated under diverse practical situations of in-service wheel-rail contact (wheel loads, angle of attack and adhesion level). A commercial finite element method software LS-DYNA was utilised to build a comprehensive wheel/rail contact model that was followed by an analysis for temperature and wear. This numerical model was constructed based on Australian standard wheel/rail profiles (ANZR 1 wheel and 60. kg rail) and sub-components of the track such as <b>railpads,</b> sleepers and ballast. Moreover an analytical method and a shakedown diagram approach were also applied to evaluate the temperature rise on the rail and the response of the material, respectively. Calculation of the wear volume of the rail was based on Archard[U+ 05 F 3]s wear model. The results showed that the stress, heat and wear produced by AC locomotive were more severe than that by DC locomotive.

40|$|Rail {{corrugation}} in cornering {{is examined}} via a non-linear time-domain {{model of a}} bogie cornering. The model is computationally fast due to a modal description of a wheelset that includes bending and twisting modes of its axle as well as flexing of wheel hubs. The modal wheelset model is tuned to match finite element predictions of its natural frequencies. The rails are also modelled using modal parameters found by fitting field measured receptance data. The model predicts corrugation over a range of wavelengths from one wavelength per sleeper to shorter wavelengths below 100 mm. It is found that a range of wavelengths around 100 mm, can be excited on a curve of 300 m radius, in addition to longer wavelengths associated more with track or primary suspension dynamics. The mix of frequencies present changes as corrugation grows, the wavelengths around 100 mm dominating at later times. Stick-slip between wheel and rail is evident, especially on the leading axle, and contributes to both long and shorter wavelength corrugation. The shorter wavelengths relate to a peak lateral response of the track, and a minimum vertical response. The sliding oscillation causing wear is mainly a stick-slip oscillation of lateral creep. Parametric excitation from crossing sleepers is represented by changing the track parameters. It is shown that sleeper crossing excitation can have an important influence {{on the extent of}} stick-slip oscillation, especially with stiff <b>railpads</b> on concrete sleepers, and a coefficient of friction that decreases with increased sliding...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the dynamic behaviour of railway tracks at high frequencies, in both vertical and lateral directions, {{is important for the}} assessment of rolling noise. Although many analytical models {{can be found in the}} literature, these mostly focus on the vertical vibration of the track. Studies of the lateral vibration are less common while the coupling between the vertical and lateral directions has received very little attention. In this paper, a model of a beam on an elastic foundation is introduced that accounts for the coupling of the vertical and lateral vibration behaviour. The model allows for the effects of beam curvature, asymmetry of the cross-section, shear deformation, rotary inertia and warping. Consideration is given to the fact that the loads at the rail head, as well as those exerted by the <b>railpads</b> at the rail foot, may not be applied through the centroid of the section. The track is subjected to a non-moving harmonic load and the solution is obtained in the wavenumber domain using the Fourier transform method. Results are presented as dispersion curves for the free rail and are validated with the aid of a Finite Element software. Closed form analytical expressions are derived, using contour integration, for the forced response.

Consideration is given {{to the fact that the}} loads at the rail head, as well as those exerted by the <b>railpads</b> at the rail foot, may not act through the centroid of the section.

40|$|Squats {{have become}} a major tricky problem in the track of many railways. In {{the quest for the}} root causes of squats, it is {{observed}} that they are occasionally found at locations of track stiffness changes such as at fish-plated insulated joints and at switches and crossings. Obviously, there should be other factors in the track, which, together with the stiffness change, have played important roles otherwise there will be squats at all such locations. A validated hybrid multibody-finite element model of vehicle–track vertical interaction is extended to simulate the frictional dynamic rolling contact at a fish-plated insulated joint in order to identify such factors. Elastic– plastic rail material property is taken into account. It is found that it is track short defect in the preload condition of the bolts and the contact between the fishplates and the rail head, which together with the stiffness change, causes large normal and longitudinal contact force variation at the fishplate end so that differential wear and differential plastic deformation may accumulate at a fixed location. With proper wavelength, the accumulated rail top geometry deviation may grow into a squat. The significance of the present work lies in that other track short defects such as damaged and improper <b>railpads</b> and fastening, and ballast voids may also have such effects, which may be responsible for {{a large portion of the}} many squats in the tracks. This gives the direction for further work...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{finite element}} method (FEM) {{has been applied to}} {{evaluate}} the wheel/rail contact stress under different contact conditions. The elastic-plastic model coded in ANSYS/LS-DYNA includes a whole wheel, 680 mm of the canted rail, and sub-components of the track (<b>railpads,</b> sleepers, and ballast). The three values of friction coefficient 0. 4, 0. 2 and 0. 07 have been chosen to model the dry, wet and oily environmental contacts, respectively. The high mechanical stresses exerted at the contact area will cause the temperature rise, which results in decreasing of the yield strength of the wheel/rail. The growth of temperature is a major source of the various microstructure changes that occurs on the rail surface, especially the formation of White Etching Layer (WEL). Therefore, a theoretical calculation of heat generation has also been implemented in the current research. The output data from the FEM models have been considered as the input for the theoretical thermal model to examine temperature rising on and beneath the rail surface. The combination of {{finite element method}} for contact stress and theoretical thermal method for temperature variation would provide a better understanding about wheel/rail contact under a variety of contact conditions (dry, wet, and oily). Various scenarios of damage mechanisms of rail have been considered in the paper. The obtained results from the model have revealed that the influence of environmental conditions on normal contact stress, pressure and contact area is negligible. In contrast, the magnitude of the Von-Mises stress and lateral and longitudinal stresses components can be significantly varied depending on the friction conditions. Moreover, the environmental condition has shown a major effect on the temperature rising at the contact zone...|$|R

Due to the large cost and available load conditions limitation, experimental investigation is not always the best choice for the dynamic effect study of railway track structure. Comparatively speaking, an accurate mathematical modeling and numerical solution of the dynamic interaction of the track structural components reveals distinct advantage for understanding the response behavior of the track structure. The purpose of this thesis is to study the influence of design parameters on dynamic response of the railway track structure by implementing Finite Element Method (FEM). According to the complexity, different railway track systems have been simulated, including: Beam on discrete support model, Discretely support track including ballast mass model and Rail on sleeper on continuum model. The rail and sleeper have been modeled by Euler-Bernoulli beam element. Spring and dashpot has been used for the simulation of <b>railpads</b> and the connection between the sleeper and ballast ground. Track components have been studied separately and comparisons have been made between different models. The finite element analysis is divided into three categories: eigenvalue analysis, dynamic analysis and general static analysis. The eigenfrequencies and corresponding vibration modes were extracted from all the models. The main part of the finite element modeling involves the steady-state dynamic analysis, in which receptance functions were obtained and used as the criterion for evaluating the dynamic properties of track components. Dynamic explicit analysis has been used for the simulation of a moving load, and the train speed effect has been studied. The displacement of the trackbed has been evaluated and compared to the measurement taken in Sweden in the static analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|The high {{frequency}} dynamic behaviour of railway track, in both vertical and lateral directions, strongly affects {{the generation of}} rolling noise {{as well as other}} phenomena such as rail corrugation. One aspect that has received little attention is the coupling between the vertical and lateral directions. This thesis sets out to build an analytical model of a railway track with three principal targets: to improve the modelling for lateral vibration compared with existing models, to identify the most important sources of coupling between the vertical and lateral directions and to quantify the implications for rolling noise phenomena. Simple models for the axial, torsional, vertical and lateral vibrations of beams are first introduced. The results from these models are analysed based on their dispersion curves and their characteristic behaviour is identified. Furthermore, effects of cross-section asymmetry, shear deformation, rotational inertia, restrained warping and curvature are considered, as well as the fact that the loads at the rail head do not always act through the centroid of the rail section. These beam models are then brought together to formulate a fully coupled beam model. An elastic foundation is then introduced to the beam model to represent the <b>railpads</b> and the dispersion characteristics of the whole track are discussed. Subsequently, the effect of the foundation location is investigated, as well as the inclusion of additional layers of masses and springs, representing the sleepers and ballast. Two different sleeper models are introduced. The first is that of a simple mass allowed to translate and rotate, representing a single block of a bibloc sleeper. The second is that of a flexible finite length beam accounting for vertical, lateral, axial and torsional vibration, representing a monobloc sleeper, which is more widely used in railway tracks. The response of the beam model is compared against measurements performed on sleepers in the laboratory. An average error of less that 1 % is observed for the natural frequency of all modes, excluding the first mode. This mode is most influenced by the sleeper cross-section variation which is not directly accounted for in the model...|$|R
40|$|A {{general and}} well-structured method is {{advanced}} {{for analysis of}} the vertical dynamic interaction between a train and its track. The trains studied are modelled as linear or non-linear discrete mass-spring-damper systems. For the track structure, a linear three- dimensional continuous model is established where the rails are discretely supported, via <b>railpads,</b> by flexible sleepers on an elastic foundation. The complex-valued modal parameters of the track structure are solved for. This means that this structure {{is described as a}} modal component governed by fully decoupled equations of motion. Imperfections on the running surfaces of wheels and rails are incorporated in the algebraic constraint equations matching the train and the track. Possible loss of contact and recovered contact between a vehicle and its track are considered. The system of coupled first-order differential equations governing the motion of the train and the track and the set of algebraic constraint equations are together compactly expressed in one unified matrix format by use of an extended state-space vector. A time-variant initial-value problem is thereby formulated such that its solution can be determined in a straight-forward manner by use of any one of several existing time- stepping methods available in standard subroutine libraries. A method for determining the eigenfrequencies of structures containing non-discretized beam members in plane bending-shearing vibration is developed. Each beam member may rest on a general Winkler-type elastic foundation. The method can preferably be implemented within the Wittrick-Williams bisection algorithm. An investigation of the influence of a number of selected track parameters on the dynamic interaction is performed by use of a two-level fractional factorial design method. This technique allows for a rational parametric search towards a combination of numerical levels of these parameters which minimizes the bending stresses in the track. Comprehensive full-scale field experiments on a portion of a recently built railway track for high-speed trains are reported. Different train speeds and axle loads were tested. Flexible and solid wheels without and with wheelflats were instrumented for measurement of transient vertical wheel/rail contact forces. Accelerations and strains in the track structure were measured in parallel. The location of the instrumented wheelset in relation to the instrumented portion of the track was determined at each instant of time. The track parameters used in the numerical simulations were determined at the test-site. Numerical application examples are given in which the influences of three types of practically important imperfections in the compound vehicle/track system are investigated. Physical explanations of the calculated interaction behaviour are offered...|$|R
40|$|In wheel-rail contact, the {{locomotive}} adhesion characterises {{the capability of}} {{the locomotive}} to convert available friction into traction at the interface. Recently developed AC (Alternating Current) drive induces a higher adhesion level compared to DC (Direct Current) drive. This significantly affects the wheel-rail contact conditions such as damage initiation, high contact temperature due to frictional rolling, and wear of the rails. Three-dimensional (3 D) elasto-plastic finite element model (FEM) {{was used in this}} thesis to examine the wheel-rail contact on a straight track. Some sub-components of the track such as <b>railpads,</b> sleepers and ballast were also included in the model. Rolling contact stress states and material response of wheel/ rail under three contact situations (high adhesion, low adhesion and full slip) were investigated. Canted and non-canted rails were considered to determine the effect of the cant angle on the contact stress levels. Furthermore, the effects of contact curvature on the contact zone and contact pressure were also observed, and the response of material was predicted by a shakedown diagram. The more complicated rolling phenomenon of the wheel on a curved track was also investigated numerically in this thesis. Due to the influences of super-elevation (also called track cant), angle of attack (AOA) and rail cant, stress states on the high rail are significantly different from that on the low rail. The new and worn profiles were considered in the simulation to examine different contact situations: new wheel/new rail, new wheel/worn rail, and worn wheel/worn rail contacts. Material responses, the formation of rail corrugation and fatigue defects on both low and high rails were anticipated based on the results from simulations. In order to compare stress states AC and DC locomotives, two locomotive models of AC (C 44 ACi) and DC (Cv 40 - 9 i) currently run in Australia were evaluated under diverse operational situations (wheel loads, angle of attack and adhesion level). The software LS-DYNA was employed to build up a comprehensive wheel/rail contact model. The numerical model was constructed based on Australian wheel/rail profiles. Moreover the analytical method was also applied to evaluate the temperature rise on the rail, respectively. Calculation of wear volume on rail was eventually performed using the Archard’s wear model. Finally a 3 D coupled thermal-mechanical FE model was developed to examine the temperature rise due to high adhesion contact and the thermal influence on residual stress-strain, wear and rail life. The numerical model employed the moving heat source code developed by Goldak. The mechanical and thermal properties of the rail material were governed by temperature. The influence of repeated multi-passes from multiple wheels on one point of the rail was also taken into account. Moreover the formation of white etching layer (WEL) on the rail surface combined with rolling cycles can potentially lead to rail damage. A sub- 2 D FE model of WEL was also carried out to examine the stress state on the WEL if formed on the rail surface. The current thesis focuses on modelling wheel-rail contact under high adhesion condition, and explanation of the subsequent damage formation on the rail. The model provides {{a better understanding of the}} influences of high adhesion condition on contact stress states, damage initiation and also temperature rise on the rail. To the best of the author’s knowledge, the simulation of wheel-rail contact under high adhesion condition has not been studied elsewhere, and is presented in this study for the first time...|$|R
