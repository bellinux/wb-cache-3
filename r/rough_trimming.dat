Procured clinical-grade pancreases were shipped in either F 6 H 8 S 5 or in standard preservation solutions, that is, University of Wisconsin (UW) or Custodiol. F 6 H 5 S 5 was preoxygenated for at least 15 min. Included clinical-grade pancreases were procured in UW or Custodiol. Upon arrival at the islet isolation laboratory, the duodenum was removed followed by <b>rough</b> <b>trimming</b> while F 6 H 8 S 5 was oxygenated for 15 - 20 min. Trimmed pancreases were immersed into oxygenated F 6 H 8 S 5 and stored at 4 C overnight followed by subsequent islet isolation. Pancreas preservation using F 6 H 8 S 5 proved as effective as UW and Custadiol when used within CIT up to 10 h, {{in terms of both}} isolation outcome and islet functionality. Preservation in F 6 H 8 S 5 of pancreases with extended CIT gave results similar to controls with CIT < 10 h for both isolated islet functionality and isolation outcome. This study of clinically obtained pancreases indicates a clear benefit of using F 6 H 8 S 5 on pancreases with extended CIT as it seems to allow extended cold ischemic time without affecting islet function and islet numbers...|$|E
40|$|The {{fisheries}} and fish processing industries have high labor costs. In part, {{this is due}} to visual inspection tasks, which are found in these industries, being so complex that humans are needed to do the inspection. One large class of inspection tasks is defect detection. This involves discerning whether a part or product is defective. Machine vision is a technology with the potential for solving many visually-based defect detection tasks, and has been successfully applied in automation systems in many industries (Hirano et. al. 2006). In this dissertation, machine vision is used successfully for defect detection in a number of specific applications in the {{fisheries and}} fish processing industries, and the particular challenges of applying machine vision, to these types of applications, are highlighted. Methods and approaches for meeting these challenges are discussed, with reference to their successful use the applications presented in this dissertation. A brief summary of each of the applications is presented in the following sections. The first application that was addressed, and the initial topic of this dissertation, was automatic sorting of cod viscera. Cod viscera are a valuable byproduct, containing different fractions. When the cod viscera is sorted into separate fractions, such as liver, roe and stomach, its value increases substantially. Sorting of cod viscera is done manually, and is a laborious process in the cod fisheries. This was the motivation for developing a method for automatic sorting of cod viscera, using machine vision and a robot. We developed and implemented hand-eye coordination algorithms for a 5 -DOF robot with a stereo camera platform. Assuming that a viscera fraction could be identified in images from both cameras, we thus had a method of directing the robot tool to the fraction. The remaining challenge was to identify the fraction in the images. Towards this end, we tested several approaches, culminating in a combination of color and texture features together with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. We found the fraction detection, in visible light images, to be a very difficult problem to solve, and it was not solved adequately to be useful for automatic sorting of the cod viscera within the time-frame given. In light of this, the focus of this dissertation was changed – to encompass machine vision for defect detection in a number of specific fisheries and fish processing applications. The second application is a cod fisheries application – detecting nematodes and skin remnants, in cod fillets, using multi-spectral images in the visible and near-infrared. A combination of contrast-invariant Gabor texture features and linear discriminant analysis showed promising results for detecting both nematodes and skin remnants. The pixel-wise detection rate and false-alarm rate for nematode detection was on the order of 99 % and 1 % respectively, and for skin remnant detection approximately 90 % and 10 %. Combining this with multi-spectral features gave even better results. The data set was not large enough to draw any definitive conclusions in terms of detection rate and false-alarm rate in an industrial setting, but the results are promising enough to merit further investigation into the use of Gabor texture features for detecting nematodes and skin remnants in cod fillets. The third application is a fish processing application, and involves quality sorting of whole Atlantic salmon into the classes ‘superior/ordinary’ and ‘production’, in which case the ‘production’ are seen as being defective with respect to the ‘superior/ordinary’. Salmon characterized as ‘production’ may have several deviations from ‘superior/ordinary’ salmon, including a humpback or short tail. The approach taken, to solve the sorting problem described here, was to first segment the image in order to extract the salmon silhouette and orient it properly, independent of its original orientation. From this silhouette image, specific geometrical descriptive parameters were extracted. In the feature-space spanned by these descriptors, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was done to maximally discriminate between ‘production’ and ‘superior/ordinary’. This performance of this approach was analyzed using a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation procedure, and this showed that approximately 90 % of salmon could be correctly classified as ‘superior/ordinary’ or ‘production’. This machine vision system was further developed to discriminate between the more similar classes ‘superior’ and ‘ordinary’, and tested on a larger data set. The sorting accuracy for this system was also approximately 90 %. Thus, the system is well suited as part of automated system for quality sorting of whole Atlantic salmon. The fourth application is in the longline fisheries, and the task here is to detect defective longline hooks. In longline fishing, lines of up to 50 - 60 kilometers are used, each containing up to 40 000 hooks. Today, baiting, shooting (setting the line out in the sea) and hauling (pulling it back on board after soaking for some time in the sea) is almost completely automated. Between each hauling and the next shooting, the gear (line and hooks) is manually inspected, and any defective hooks are corrected or replaced. This manually-executed maintenance task is extremely labor-intensive. A machine vision system is presented, that can potentially automate this task. Combining knowledge from the fishermen, on what denotes a ‘defective’ hook, and machine vision knowledge, a set of features were automatically extracted from images of the hooks. Thousands of classifiers were automatically explored, and each classifier was plotted in the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) plane. From all of these, the classifiers on the ROC convex hull (ROCCH) were selected. On tests with more than 400 hooks, the classifiers on the ROOCH were found capable of detecting 97. 4 % of ‘defective’ hooks with zero false positives. Together with an automatic and mechanized hook replacement and repair system, this machine vision approach can automate the maintenance phase of longline fishing. The fifth application is in the pelagic fisheries and fish processing, and is the task of weight and quality grading of whole pelagic fish. In this work, the goal was to develop a single machine vision system {{that could be used to}} automatically perform both weight and quality grading – a labor-intensive task that is done manually today. This involved finding the optics, illumination and imaging modalities that could be used to weigh the fish automatically and detect most of the important defect types that could occur. The types of defects that occur in whole pelagic fish are many, including: split fish, superficial wounds, such as cuts scrapes, and deformations due to pressure and injuries. An imaging and illumination system, that combined 3 D range imaging, laser scatter imaging and diffuse gloss imaging, was developed and implemented in a prototype sorting station. Experiments showed that these imaging modalities could be used to detect all the defect types at a high processing speed. The prototype machine vision system was integrated with a conveyor belt and robot, and demonstrated the feasibility of using machine vision to automatically weigh whole pelagic and detect those fish that are defective. The main focus of this work was to develop the optical, imaging and illumination part of the machine vision system, and demonstrate proof-of-concept machine vision algorithms that could discriminate between defective and non-defective fish. The sixth application is detection of melanin spots in Atlantic salmon fillets. One of the manual operations done in salmon processing plants is to inspect the fillets and discard or process those that have melanin spots. Melanin spots are dark spots that reduce the quality grade of the fillet, and they are present in a substantial percentage of fillets. Melanin spots are caused by an inflammatory condition most often induced by vaccination. For the melanin spot detection application, a machine vision system using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was developed that could detect 93 % of melanin spots. At this detection rate the number of false alarms was very high, but an investigation showed that these false alarms were entirely due to two main causes: 1. uneven illumination and 2. blood, viscera and fin remnants near the belly flap. By improving the illumination uniformity, and cleaning and trimming the fillets before inspection, we thus have a method for accurate detection of melanin spots. This system uses RGB images, and can thus be easily integrated in a fillet processing line where other quality parameters, such as trimming grade, pigmentation and shape, are measured using machine vision with RGB cameras. The seventh application is automatic trimming of salmon fillets, in which fin and tail remnants, belly fat, back fat and belly membranes are detected and removed. Trimming fillets is today done manually, after <b>rough</b> <b>trimming</b> in mechanical trimming machines. This application was developed into a prototype sorting station, with conveyor belt, robot and camera and illumination housing. As part of this complete prototype, a machine vision system had to be developed that could distinguish between the ‘defective’ and ‘non-defective’ parts of the fillet. The solution that was found involved using a 3 D camera with blue LED illumination. This gave use both the required 3 D data needed to perform the trimming, and the illumination needed to acquire images in which the ‘defective’ parts of the fillet were clearly discriminated. Once the images clearly distinguished between objects to be trimmed off (‘defective’ parts) and the remaining fillet, the subsequent image processing was much simplified. The work in this application illustrates the importance of looking at the entire machine vision system, and its context, as a whole. The prototype was fully functioning and demonstrated all the necessary parts needed in an automatic salmon fillet trimming station. The eighth application is automatic sorting of salmonid eggs. Salmon breeding companies can produce up to 100 million eggs per year, and these must be manually inspected before delivery to the hatcheries. This is a highly laborious and costly task, and is therefore very desirable to automate. This manual sorting is needed to remove unfertilized eggs, dead eggs and fertilized eggs with defects. A machine vision system, including optics, illumination and image processing, was developed that can sort more than 100 000 eggs per hour with a sorting error of less than 1 %. This machine vision system was demonstrated in a prototype sorting machine, and then implemented in an industrialized sorting machine. These sorting machines are now successfully in use at several salmon breeding facilities. The applications developed and described in this thesis demonstrate the effectiveness of machine vision for defect detection in fisheries and fish processing applications. The work on these applications shows that in order to be successful, all aspects of the application, and their context, must be taken into account. In each application there are specific constraints that make each application unique. Even so, there are some commonalities between many applications, in terms of the challenges involved. These commonalities have been highlighted in this dissertation, and appropriate methods and approaches have been found to meet them. Being aware of these challenges, and of the relevant methods and approaches to meeting them, increases the probability of successfully solving an application. As such, the work in this dissertation, and understanding of the lessons learnt in it, will benefit future applications of machine vision for defect detection in the fisheries and fish processing industries. Through continuing improvements in machine vision technology, and increasing domainspecific knowledge of how to apply this technology to fisheries and fish processing applications, almost all such applications can be partially or fully automated in the future. This dissertation shows that this vision is indeed a possibility, and hints at the directions needed to realize it.   PhD i informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologiPhD in Information and Communications Technolog...|$|E

Machining speed and surface characteristics were the major performance characteristics in WEDM process. Investigation shows that in rough cutting operation, machining speed and surface roughness increases with increasing discharge energy across the electrodes. Different values of machining speed and surface roughness were obtained for four work materials under the similar conditions of discharge energy. Due to the different values of thermal conductivity, melting and boiling temperatures, depth and size of surface craters on machined surface vary for each work material. Trim cutting operation at similar discharge parameters but with different wire offset were performed for four work materials. Micro-hardness profiles underneath the machined surface after <b>rough</b> and <b>trim</b> cutting operation were observed. Result shows that using single trim cutting operation with appropriate wire offset, surface characteristics can be improved irrespective of the rough cutting operation...|$|R

First, the influence of discharge energy (DE) in rough cut is evaluated for machining rate (MR) and surface roughness (SR) and compared with trim cut without any metal powder additives in dielectric fluid. The effect of Al and Si metal powders (varying concentration of 1 g/L, 2 g/L and 3 g/L) in dielectric fluid is studied separately and comparison is also made for MR, SR, recast layer and micro hardness of machined Nimonic- 90. From the results {{it is observed that}} using trim cut, a fine and uniform surface texture is obtained irrespective of the high discharge energy of rough cut. Al and Si powders additives show a significant reduction in MR for trim cutting operation whereas a remarkable modification is obtained in surface textures after trim cut using metal powder mixed dielectric.

40|$|Dynamic crack {{behaviors}} at glass interfaces {{were investigated}} to understand dynamic failure mechanisms of glass. To produce highly intensive and rapidly increasing loading, glass specimens jointed with epoxy adhesive in edge-to-edge configurations were impacted on their notched edges with plastic projectiles. Cracks {{developed from the}} notch and propagated into the interfaces between glass plates at the maximum speed. The patterns of crack propagation through the interfaces were observed {{to depend on the}} interface’s conditions. Crack propagation stops at the interface where no adhesive was applied. The crack penetrates through the interface where two glass plates were bonded directly without any space. If the interface has finite thickness of an adhesive layer, a crack passing through the interface branches into multiple cracks immediately when it extends to the second glass plate. Both of the slow crack speed in the epoxy adhesive and resistance for crack initiation in the second glass account for the delay in crack propagation at the interface. The surface conditions of glass at the interface affect the resistance for crack initiation. Mirror-like polished surfaces have better resistance than <b>rough</b> surfaces <b>trimmed</b> by a water jet. If the polished surface is etched with hydrofluoric acid to remove surface flaws, the glass surfaces have higher strength and resistance for damage. This etched glass even ceases crack propagation completely with a sufficiently thick adhesive layer. ^ Crack branching has been an open topic. Exact explanation has not been given yet. As the consistent shape of crack branching are created with the proposed method, diagnostics experiments were conducted to reveal the nature of crack branching. To investigate interaction between stress propagation and crack branching, stress histories synchronizing with high speed images were measured. Two types of specimen were used to vary stress distribution during crack propagation. The apex angle of spreading branched cracks increases in specimens having smaller width in dimension. The reflected waves from boundaries reaches cracks earlier because of the short traveling distance in the direction transverse to the cracks. These reflected waves interact with the crack and cause change of the branching shape. ^ The fluctuation of stress intensity factors were observed with methods of caustics. A dark circular shadow at the ends of crack tips represents the stress intensity. The primary crack propagating early and carrying main load from the projectile can be switched if it stops at interface. Then, other cracks begin to receive the intensive load and are eventually extended to the second glass through the adhesive layer while other cracks still stay at the interface. ^ The crack initiation, propagation and its interaction with interfaces were simulated with peridynamics. Peridynamics is a mathematical reformulation of continuum model by integrating pairwise penitential functions between two particles. These bond-based mechanics can represent discontinuity in peridynamics while traditional continuum mechanics cannot handle the discontinuity. The results from peridynamics show good agreements with experimental results in terms of the crack speeds and the branching shapes. Although the dimension of adhesive layers was not modeled exactly because of limitation of grid spacing, the resistance from interface to prevent crack propagation was shown in analogue with experimental results. The size of horizon where particle deformation and failure are computed, affect the interaction of cracks with interfaces. ...|$|R
