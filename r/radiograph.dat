5|$|Lung cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest <b>radiograph.</b> However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest <b>radiograph</b> or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and radiological features.|$|E
5|$|CT {{screening}} {{is associated}} with a high rate of falsely positive tests which may result in unneeded treatment. For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans. Other concerns include radiation exposure and the cost of testing along with follow up. Research has not found two other available tests—sputum cytology or chest <b>radiograph</b> (CXR) screening tests—to have any benefit.|$|E

5|$|Performing a chest <b>radiograph</b> {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports {{symptoms}} that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest <b>radiograph</b> performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Occipital Atlanto-Axial Malformation (OAAM). This is a {{condition}} where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and {{at the base of}} the skull are fused or malformed. Symptoms range from mild incoordination to the paralysis of both front and rear legs. Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse, in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks. This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1month of age, and a <b>radiograph</b> can diagnose the condition. There is no genetic test for OAAM, and the hereditary component of this condition is not well researched at present.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{observes that}} there are many spirals in nature, from the horns of {{ruminants}} to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a <b>radiograph)</b> have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E
25|$|Contrast {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in radiographic density between adjacent portions of the image. The range between black and white on the final <b>radiograph.</b> High contrast, or short-scale contrast, means there is little gray on the <b>radiograph,</b> and there are fewer gray shades between black and white. Low contrast, or long-scale contrast, means there is much gray on the <b>radiograph,</b> and there are many gray shades between black and white.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{in space}} between the lung and the chest wall is termed a pleural effusion. There needs {{to be at least}} 75ml of pleural fluid in order to blunt the costophrenic angle on the lateral chest <b>radiograph,</b> and 200ml on the posteroanterior chest <b>radiograph.</b> On a lateral decubitus, amounts as small as 50ml of fluid are possible. Pleural effusions {{typically}} have a meniscus visible on an erect chest <b>radiograph,</b> but loculated effusions (as occur with an empyema) may have a lenticular shape (the fluid making an obtuse angle with the chest wall).|$|E

40|$|It is {{extremely}} important to assess variations between the most used <b>radiographs</b> in dental practice, since minimum distortion on obtained images may change diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis for the patient. For this, {{the distance between the}} enamel-cementum junction and the alveolar bone crest was measured on conventional and digitized periapical, bitewing, and panoramic <b>radiographs</b> and compared among them. From a total of 1484 records, 39 sets of <b>radiographs</b> that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study sample were selected. The measurements were grouped according to the intensity of bone loss. Statistically significant difference was found in the averages of the measurements assessed in <b>radiographs</b> with absence of bone loss between conventional panoramic and periapical <b>radiographs,</b> between digitized panoramic and periapical <b>radiographs</b> and between digitized bitewing and panoramic <b>radiographs.</b> By analyzing the results of this work and considering the research protocol used, one can conclude that small losses in height of alveolar bone crest observed in panoramic <b>radiographs</b> should be cautiously evaluated, as they may be overestimated...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{this study}} were to test whether {{lightening}} of the overexposed <b>radiographs</b> improve determination of endodontic files length and whether lightened <b>radiographs</b> are comparable with ideally exposed <b>radiographs.</b> Material and Methods: Four dried human skull coated with soft tissue-equivalent wax used for exposing <b>radiographs</b> of the upper molars. First, the endodontic file was placed in full length of the root and four series of <b>radiographs</b> obtained. The time to expose the first series was unchanged (standard group) but increased for the other three series.   Two series of overexposed <b>radiographs</b> set as test groups (one lightened with copper sulfate reducer and the other lightened with sodium hypochlorite) and one series set as control group. Then the endodontic file placed 2 mm short in the root and four series of <b>radiographs</b> obtained like the former. A viewer evaluated <b>radiographs.</b> ROC curves were obtained and areas under the curves were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity and Cohen’s kappa was calculated. Results: The average area under ROC curves was 1, 0. 995, 1 and 0. 643 for the standard, Copper sulfate, sodium hypochlorite and the control group, respectively. Sodium hypochlorite show a better performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity compared to Copper sulfate.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the effect of elimination of daily routine chest <b>radiographs</b> on chest radiographic practice in cardiothoracic surgery patients {{in the intensive care unit}} and the post-intensive care unit ward. METHODS: We used a prospective, comparative study design with an intervention in a 28 -bed intensive care unit/post-intensive care unit ward (including a 4 -bed medium-care unit) in a university hospital. Cardiothoracic surgery patients were admitted to the intensive care unit during a period of 6 months (3 months before intervention and 3 months after intervention). Daily routine chest <b>radiographs</b> in the intensive care unit were eliminated; all chest <b>radiographs</b> required a clinical indication. Routine chest <b>radiographs</b> were not performed in the post-intensive care unit ward, both before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Before intervention, in the intensive care unit 353 daily routine chest <b>radiographs</b> and 261 on-demand chest <b>radiographs</b> were obtained in 175 patients; after intervention, 275 on-demand chest <b>radiographs</b> were obtained in 163 patients. Before intervention, in the post-intensive care unit ward 413 on-demand chest <b>radiographs</b> were obtained in 167 patients; after intervention, 445 on-demand chest <b>radiographs</b> were obtained in 161 patients. In the intensive care unit the number of chest <b>radiographs</b> per patient day decreased from 1. 8 +/- 0. 6 to 1. 1 +/- 0. 6. In the post-intensive care unit ward the number of chest <b>radiographs</b> per patient per day was 0. 4 +/- 0. 2, both before and after the intervention. Slightly more unexpected abnormalities were found in the on-demand chest <b>radiographs</b> after the intervention. No negative influence on chest radiography timing, length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, and readmission rate was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of daily routine chest <b>radiographs</b> led to a decrease of the total number of chest <b>radiographs</b> obtained per patient per day in the intensive care unit and did not change chest radiography practice in the post-intensive care unit war...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{develop a}} {{computer-aided}} method {{that reduces the}} variability of Cobb angle measurement for scoliosis assessment. Methods. A deep neural network (DNN) was trained with vertebral patches extracted from spinal model <b>radiographs.</b> The Cobb angle of the spinal curve was calculated automatically from the vertebral slopes predicted by the DNN. Sixty-five in vivo <b>radiographs</b> and 40 model <b>radiographs</b> were analyzed. An experienced surgeon performed manual measurements on the aforementioned <b>radiographs.</b> Two examiners used both the proposed and the manual measurement methods to analyze the aforementioned <b>radiographs.</b> Results. For model <b>radiographs,</b> the intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0. 98, and the mean absolute differences were less than 3 °. This indicates that the proposed system showed high repeatability for measurements of model <b>radiographs.</b> For the in vivo <b>radiographs,</b> the reliabilities were lower than those from the model <b>radiographs,</b> and {{the differences between the}} computer-aided measurement and the manual measurement by the surgeon were higher than 5 °. Conclusion. The variability of Cobb angle measurements can be reduced if the DNN system is trained with enough vertebral patches. Training data of in vivo <b>radiographs</b> must be included to improve the performance of DNN. Significance. Vertebral slopes can be predicted by DNN. The computer-aided system can be used to perform automatic measurements of Cobb angle, which is used to make reliable and objective assessments of scoliosis...|$|R
