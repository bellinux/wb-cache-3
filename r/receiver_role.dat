40|$|The {{application}} of signaling games (Lewis, 1969) to explain conventional language use is man-ifoldly examined by employing various dynamics that generate cultural evolution in a multi-agent setup (as an overview see Huttegger and Zollman, 2011). Particularly prominent {{in combination with}} repeated signaling games are the replicator dynamics (cf. Wärneryd, 1993; Huttegger, 2007), different imitation dynamics (cf.

This thesis aims to investigate the role of the phone on the negotiation process as well as, the automatic analysis of non-verbal behavioural cues during conversations using mobile telephones, by following the Social Signal Processing approach. The work in this thesis includes the collection of a corpus of 60 mobile phone conversations involving 120 subjects, development of methods for the detection of non-verbal behavioural events (laughter, fillers, speech and silence) and the inference of characteristics influencing social interactions (personality traits and conflict handling style) from speech and movements while using the mobile telephone, as well as the analysis of several factors that influence the outcome of decision-making processes while using mobile phones (gender, age, personality, conflict handling style and caller versus <b>receiver</b> <b>role).</b> The findings show {{that it is possible to}} recognise behavioural events at levels well above chance level, by employing statistical language models, and that personality traits and conflict handling styles can be partially recognised. Among the factors analysed, participant role (caller versus receiver) was the most important in determining the outcome of negotiation processes in the case of disagreement between parties. Finally, the corpus collected for the experiments (the SSPNet-Mobile Corpus) has been used in an international benchmarking campaign and constitutes a valuable resource for future research in Social Signal Processing and more generally in the area of human-human communication...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{as a moral}} {{affect and}} trait, {{gratitude}} has been acquiring growing attention in social psychology. Previous research showed those who are grateful were motivated not only to reciprocate the benefactor, but also to make altruistic behavior towards other people. By reviewing previous studies, we found two approaches on exploring the gratitude-altruism link: one {{is to examine the}} relationship of correlation between gratitude being a personality trait and altruistic tendency using questionnaires as research method; another is to probe into the causality of gratitude and altruistic behaviors by experimental methods. The present research consists of five studies combining correlative studies and experimental designs, trying to explore the effect of gratitude on altruistic tendency and altruistic behavior from perspective of trait and situation. Participants are 1769 Chinese undergraduates and 332 community residents. Firstly, results of study one showed dispositional gratitude was significantly positively correlated with altruistic tendency: higher dispositional gratitude, higher altruistic tendency. When social desirability, Big Five, and grateful mood were controlled, the correlation of gratitude and altruism still remained relatively significant. Secondly, results of the most experiments showed: main effects of both dispositional gratitude and situational gratitude were significant. For example, people with high dispositional gratitude showed higher altruistic tendency than people with low dispositional gratitude; People in high condition of gratitude arousing showed higher altruistic tendency than people in low condition of gratitude arousing as well as the control group. Thirdly, data analyses showed that the interaction effect of dispositional gratitude and situational gratitude on general altruistic tendency and altruistic behavior was significant. Compared with people with high dispositional gratitude, those with low dispositional gratitude was relatively more sensitive to condition of gratitude arousing. The latter show enhanced altruistic tendency in condition of gratitude arousing than in control condition. This interaction effect was also represented in three different condition of altruistic behavior. (1) As for beneficiaries of altruistic behavior, people with low dispositional gratitude showed enhanced altruistic behavior in condition of gratitude arousing towards strangers rather than friends and relatives. (2) As for the <b>receiver</b> <b>role</b> of altruistic behavior, people with low dispositional gratitude showed less “reject” or more “acceptance” in condition of gratitude arousing than that of the control condition. (3) When it comes to the cost of altruistic behavior, people with low dispositional gratitude showed enhanced altruistic tendency in condition of gratitude arousing than that of the control condition. However, altruistic behaviors of high cost in real life were more affected by dispositional gratitude. 感激作为一种道德情感和特质的功能日益受到社会心理学家的关注。研究表明，感激不仅驱动受助者回报施助者, 而且会激发针对第三方的利他行为。近年来，研究者或者通过相关研究考察感激特质与利他行为倾向之间的关联，或者通过实验研究证实感激情境或事件对利他行为的影响。 本研究以中国大学生和社区居民为对象，通过五项子研究（包括三项问卷调查和八项实验研究），首次从特质与情境的角度系统探索了感激对一般利他倾向以及三种条件下利他行为的影响。其中大学生样本 1769 人，社区居民 332 人。主要结果如下： 首先，相关研究的结果表明，无论是大学生群体，还是社区居民群体，特质感激与利他行为倾向之间都存在显著相关。在对社会称许性、“大五”人格和感激心境等变量控制后，感激-利他的显著相关仍然存在，感激特质仍能单独预测利他行为。 其次，实验研究表明，感激特质会影响利他行为倾向，感激特质越高，利他倾向越高；感激情境也会影响利他行为倾向，相对于低感激情境和控制条件，高感激情境会增强利他行为倾向。 第三，感激特质与感激情境对一般利他倾向和行为存在交互效应。高感激特质者较少受情境的影响，而低感激特质者更容易受感激情境的唤起而强化利他行为。这种交互效应在利他行为变量的三个方面具体表现为： （ 1 ）针对不同对象的利他行为：低感激特质者更容易受情境启动，从而增强针对陌生人（而不是亲人和朋友）的利他行为倾向。 （ 2 ）针对利他行为的“接受者”角色：对于低感激特质者，感激情境的唤起不仅导致更多的“付出”，还导致更多的“接纳”和更少的“拒绝”。 （ 3 ）针对不同代价的利他行为：对于低感激特质者，感激情境会增强低代价利他行为，而高代价的利他行为更多地受感激特质的影响...|$|E

In essence, the <b>receiver’s</b> <b>role</b> is to selec-tively jam the sender’s transmission {{at the level of}} bits, bytes, or packets. We then design a class of secure codes, which we call dialog codes, for diverse channel models and receiver models.

By way of experimental validation, we study the chan-nel jamming characteristics of extant mote radios — specifically, CC 2420 (IEEE 802. 15. 4) and CC 1000 — in experiments, observe their time-varying channel behav-ior, and demonstrate the correctness and robustness of implementations of our dialog codes at the byte-level and at the packet-level in the presence of dynamic chan-nel fluctuations...|$|R
5000|$|What {{characteristics}} distinguish {{an interactive}} story from {{another form of}} interactive media is subject to much debate. Interactivity and storytelling are both polysemic terms, and the phrase [...] "interactive storytelling" [...] does not inherently distinguish it from other kinds of storytelling, {{many of which are}} already interactive to some extent. Some of the literature associated with the term [...] "interactive storytelling" [...] is actually about transmedia storytelling, which is not a form of entertainment, but a marketing strategy for building a compelling brand across digital platforms. Varying levels of interactivity are a function of the [...] "relatedness of transmitted messages with previous exchanges of information where sender and <b>receiver</b> <b>roles</b> become interchangeable." [...] Storytelling, in this case, refers to the process of active creation and authoring rather than the final product and its passive reception. Interactive storytelling by this definition can entail any media that allows the user to generate several unique dramatic narratives. Though its final goal is a fully unauthored AI environment with a comprehensive human-level understanding of narrative construction (i.e., the Holodeck), projects that use branching stories and variable gates are considered experimental prototypes in the same genre.|$|R

We tested these objectives in a natural population by recording the resident males' song and then challenging them by song playbacks. The residents' approach to intruder stimuli and behavioural responses were monitored. We found that intruder repertoire size did not evoke different responses by the residents. Rather, the resident's approach distance and behavioural response was predicted by his own repertoire size, suggesting that song in penduline tits is involved in male-male communication, and repertoire size may function as a reliable signal of the resident male's ability and willingness to defend his nest and avert possible intruders...|$|R

40|$|This paper takes Kent and Taylor’s (2002) call {{to develop}} a {{dialogic}} theory of public relations and suggests that a necessary first step is the modelling {{of the process of}} dialogic communication in public relations. In order to achieve this, extant literature from a range of fields is reviewed, seeking {{to develop a}} definition of dialogic communication that is meaningful to the practice of contemporary public relations. A simple transmission model of communication is used as a starting point. This is synthesised with concepts relating specifically to dialogue, taken here in its broadest sense rather than defined as any one particular outcome. The definition that emerges from this review leads to the conclusion that dialogic communication in public relations involves the interaction of three roles – those of sender, receiver, and responder. These three roles are shown to be adopted at different times by both participants involved in dialogic communication. It is further suggested that variations occur in how these roles are conducted: the sender and <b>receiver</b> <b>roles</b> can be approached in a passive or an active way, while the responder role can be classified as being either resistant or responsive to the information received in dialogic communication. The final modelling of the definition derived provides a framework which can be tested in the field to determine whether variations in the conduct of the roles in dialogic communication actually exist, and if so, whether they can be linked to the different types of outcome from dialogic communication identified previously in the literature...|$|R

5000|$|The wide <b>receiver's</b> {{principal}} <b>role</b> is {{to catch}} passes from the quarterback. On passing plays, the receiver attempts to avoid, outmaneuver, or simply outrun defenders (typically cornerbacks and/or safeties) {{in the area}} of his pass route. If the receiver becomes open, or has an unobstructed path to the destination of a catch, he may then become the quarterback's target. Once a pass is thrown in his direction, the receiver's goal is to first catch the ball and then attempt to run downfield. Some receivers are perceived as a deep threat because of their flat-out speed, while others may be possession receivers known for not dropping passes, running crossing routes across the middle of the field, and generally, converting third down situations. A receiver's height also contributes to their expected role; taller receivers tend to play further to the outside and run deep more often, shorter receivers tend to play inside and run more routes underneath the top of the defense.|$|R
40|$|Coordination is a {{temporally}} unfolding {{process of}} work integration enacted by individuals in context. Despite a well-established literature on coordination {{there has been}} very limited consideration of the individuals enacting the process. To address this critical void, I draw from both micro- and macro-organizational literatures to advance and test a contextualized meso-theory concerning how coordination occurs across entities and how to improve it. Notably, I examine contextual features of both the setting and the situation. The setting of cross-unit coordination during a sequentially interdependent task (i. e., patient handoffs) creates knowledge and motivational asymmetries between units, which places a premium on certain individual and situational features. Specifically, I consider the influence of: 1) ability (i. e., job competence) and non-ability (i. e., personality, efficacy) individual characteristics; 2) alignment between individuals (i. e., goal congruence); and 3) situational context (i. e., workload pressure, situational strength), on the coordination process. In turn, I explore {{the impact of the}} coordination process on proximal (e. g., handoff quality) and distal outcomes (e. g., patient outcomes). In addition, I reify the coordination construct in the study context and advance a methodology to index it as a multi-dimensional and temporally unfolding process. Finally, I use a multi-source, multi-level, interrupted time series design in which situational strength is manipulated via a work process intervention. Observational data were collected on 382 patients (146 pre-intervention, 236 post-intervention) and from the 27 individuals engaged in patient handoffs from the operating room to the post-anesthesia care unit, at a large community hospital in the southwest United States. Select comparative data were collected on all 2, 357 individuals transferred between those two units during the 16 week study period. Although many of the hypothesized results were not supported, there were important differences between the effects of the individuals in the sender and <b>receiver</b> <b>roles.</b> Notably, those effects varied across the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods as the situational strength intervention successfully reduced the variance attributable to individuals in both roles. Furthermore, as anticipated, the intervention strongly positively influenced coordination, which in turn enhanced proximal outcomes and distal patient outcomes. Implications for both the advancement and application of coordination theory are discussed...|$|R

The inversion procedure carried out herein is similar to Matched-Field Processing (MFP) : the problem was posed as an optimisation problem where the replica field was obtained for candidate solutions. The objective function was the root mean square error (RMSE) between the observed transmission loss (TL) and that generated by forward mod-elling. The search of the solution was carried out with a genetic algorithm (GA), in an attempt to minimise that error. Empirical distributions were generated with candidate solutions of final GA generations, in order obtain a solution of the inverse problem as a maximum a posteriori estimate. The empirical distributions were in general compact and the RMSE achieved values below 1 dB.

50|$|A typical {{offense is}} made up of a quarterback, five {{offensive}} linemen, two wide receivers, a running back, a fullback, and a tight end, however teams will vary their personnel on the field to fit any given play. A quarterback is essentially the leader of the offense. It is most often their responsibility to pass along the play called {{to the rest of the}} players in the huddle before any given play. A quarterback is the primary ball handler on offense. It is their responsibility to call the snap count for the ball to enter play. Once the ball is hiked into play, it is their job to either hand the ball off to one of their running backs, or scout the field for an open receiver to throw the ball to. In some instances, the quarterback will run the ball themselves. A quarterback is guarded by their offensive linemen. The offensive line {{is made up}} of a left and right tackle, a left and right guard, and a center. It is the center's responsibility to hike the ball to the quarterback. An offensive line has two different jobs. When the offense runs a pass play, it is their job to guard the quarterback from the defense that are rushing. When the offense runs a run play, it is their job to clear a path for the running back to run through. The running back also has multiple roles. They will either take the ball from the quarterback and run, move up and help the offensive line block, or go out and catch a pass. While the role of the fullback is deteriorating currently among professional leagues, it is their primary responsibility to lead the running back. Running backs and fullbacks are sometimes also called a halfback, a wingback, or a slotback. Like the running back, the tight end also has multiple roles. They will either help the offensive line protect the quarterback, block on run plays, or run or catch the ball themselves. The wide <b>receivers</b> primary <b>role</b> is to run out into the field of play and catch the ball, although they will also block in some instances.|$|R

The example of phonology in a monosyllabic words with have the same form both for English and Indonesian, such as in BUS, it is differed in pronunciation, it can be [b i s] or [b 0 s] in Indonesian, but in English the pronunciation is [bAs]; the English suffix of ITY become ITAS in Indonesian such as in QUALITY becomes KUALITAS (Q as the first consonant of word become K), and also the consonant clusters such as in PSYCHOLOGY become PSIKOLOGI. There are also the importation of prefixes in morphology, such as PRO-, MULTY-/POLI-; SUB-;AUTO. The importation of English words without substitution due to new culture or substitute the native/old words, such as MEETING, SHOOTING, ACTING, and CAMPING. The enrichment of morphology can be observed in forming words from Arabic, e. g. from A-L-M paradigmatically will result: (1) ALAM world with its content and it is created by God, 2. place, environment, 3. area, region, 4. scope, range; (2) ALIM: 1. clever in science, having a lot of sciences; 2. virtuous, godly, pious; (3) AMAL good deed or charity; (4) AMIL a person who collects obligatory alms made annually under Muslim law; (5) ULAMA (plural form from ALIM) expert in Islamic religio...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{talks about}} a theory which {{considered one of the}} most important theories which is put for discussion, analysis, development in Arab critic, which is "the theory of meaning of meaning " which is stated by Abdel-Qahir Al- Jirjani "the founder of morphology "and the prominent of language sciences in his age. And the historians agreed to describe him with science and religion, and called him Al- Imam, and he was famous as grammarian, before he put morphology and he died in four hundred seventy one, or it said in four hundred seventy four. The problem of meaning has significant place in recognition fields, including oral (grammar, morphology, syntax and evidences) and phonology (methodology and literature). The history of this problem expands for a long time, until now, there have been more and more of later reasoning establishes it's expanded pages on previous says, from here, we will review some old texts to reveal their light sides, and to work on developing them if there are some gaps. Investigated in these pages the theory with it's different dimensions, with giving notes and comments on it's all contents, then I followed Al- Jirjani attempts to develop them, in addition, we reoffered to the attainted of modern Arab critics toward the theory, between who against and who with it, until the speech focused finally on the <b>receiver</b> and his <b>role</b> in explaining the literature text...|$|R
40|$|Secure, {{anonymous}} and unobservable communication {{is becoming increasingly}} important due to the gradual erosion of privacy in many aspects of everyday life. This prompts the need for various anonymity- and privacy-enhancing techniques, e. g., group signatures, anonymous e-cash and secret handshakes. In this paper, we investigate an interesting and practical cryptographic construct – Oblivious Signature-Based Envelopes (OS-BEs) recently introduced in [15]. OSBEs are very useful in anonymous communication since they allow a sender to communicate information to a receiver such that the <b>receiver’s</b> rights (or <b>roles)</b> are unknown to the sender. At the same time, a receiver can obtain the information {{only if it is}} authorized to access it. This makes OSBEs a natural fit for anonymity-oriented and privacy-preserving applications, such as Automated Trust Negotiation and Oblivious Subscriptions. Previous results yielded three OSBE constructs: one based on RSA and two based on Identity-Based Encryption (IBE). Our work focuses on the ElGamal signature family: we succeed in constructing practical and secure OSBE schemes for several well-known signature schemes, including: Schnorr, Nyberg-Rueppel, ElGamal and DSA. As experiments with the prototype implementation illustrate, our schemes are more efficient than previous techniques. Furthermore, we show that some OSBE schemes, despite offering affiliation privacy for the receiver, introduce no additional cost over schemes that do not offer this feature. NOTE: An earlier incarnation of this paper was previously submitted to another security conference. The present version is a result of a major revision. In particular, it includes a thorough proof of security for the Schnorr-OSBE scheme as well as an in-depth discussion of implementation and efficiency/experiments. ...|$|R
