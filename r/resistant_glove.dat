The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the controlling of hazards potential in CDU III PT. Pertamina (Persero) RU III Plaju in 2011. Method: This study was a qualitative study. The methods of data collection were using in-depth interview and observation. The total of informants in this study was 7 people. Results: Hazards potential in CDU III were noise, fire, risk of falling from height, falling objects, electric shock, risk of H 2 S and CO, NH 3, being hit and squeezed, chief stumbling, hand scraped, stumbling, slipped, and flash. The controlling of hazards potential in PT. Pertamina was good enough, even though there were still some constraints in the implementation. Conclusion: The controlling techniques applied in PT. Pertamina were elimination, substitution, isolation, maintenance and broken equipments repair. The administrative controlling applied in PT. Pertamina were SIKA, training, safety talk, working time arrangements, hazard warning signs, and CSMS. The personal protective equipments provided by PT.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 For {{the purpose}} of {{providing}} protection against potential environmental and physical threats, many animal species have developed hierarchical and heterogeneous biological materials. In turn, scientists and engineers {{have been inspired by}} the design of these biological materials and are working to apply this knowledge to develop “biologically inspired” engineered materials and structures. For example, puncture resistant materials are developed to provide protection against needles, thorns and other sharp objects, which may pierce soft flesh. Many natural armors are designed to have high puncture resistance and high flexibility. Unfortunately, these two properties are usually hard to achieve at the same time since most hard materials are also very stiff. In this study, we evaluate the puncture resistance and flexibility of fish scale structures. Elasmoid fish scales possess a unique balance of stiffness, strength and low weight to provide protection against predators and not interfere with locomotion. In this investigation the biological design of fish scales is dissected and then applied to pursue improved material designs for puncture <b>resistant</b> <b>gloves...</b>|$|R

A total of 47 persons with GTS were identified during 2 months in 1992 after seeking emergency treatment in a five county area of Kentucky. Nicotine can be absorbed from the wet tobacco surface through the skin of the workers. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe weakness with changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Abdominal cramping, headaches and difficulty in breathing were frequently reported. Recommendations offered to help workers avoid this problem included not working in wet tobacco, wearing protective clothing which may reduce the amount of nicotine absorbed through the skin such as chemical <b>resistant</b> <b>gloves</b> and plastic aprons, changing to dry clothing as quickly as possible once clothes have become wet, and informing the doctor of nicotine exposure if the worker does become ill which will assist in obtaining a correct diagnosis more quickly.

50|$|The {{most common}} uses for {{metallic}} fibers is upholstery fabric and textiles such as lamé and brocade. Many people also use metallic fibers in weaving and needlepoint. Increasingly common today are metallic fibers in clothing, anything from party and evening wear to club clothing, cold weather and survival clothing, and everyday wear. Metallic yarns are woven, braided, and knit into many fashionable fabrics and trims. For additional variety, metallic yarns are twisted with other fibers such as wool, nylon, cotton, and synthetic blends to produce yarns which add novelty effects {{to the end}} cloth or trim. Stainless steel and other metal fibers are used in communication lines such as phone lines and cable television lines. Stainless steel fibers are also used in carpets. They are dispersed throughout the carpet with other fibers so they are not detected. The presence of the fibers helps to conduct electricity so that the static shock is reduced. These types of carpets are often used in computer-use areas where the chance of producing static is much greater.

40|$|Parental {{exposure}} to pesticides {{may contribute to}} childhood cancer risk. Through the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective study of pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina, we examined childhood cancer risk and associations with parental pesticide application. Identifying information for 17, 357 children of Iowa pesticide applicators was provided by parents via questionnaires (1993 – 1997) and matched against the Iowa Cancer Registry. Fifty incident childhood cancers were identified (1975 – 1998). Risk of all childhood cancers combined was increased [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 1. 36; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 03 – 1. 79]. Risk of all lymphomas combined was also increased (SIR = 2. 18; 95 % CI, 1. 13 – 4. 19), as was risk of Hodgkin’s lymphoma (SIR = 2. 56; 95 % CI, 1. 06 – 6. 14). We used logistic regression to explore associations between self-reported parental pesticide application practices and childhood cancer risk. No association was detected between frequency of parental pesticide application and childhood cancer risk.

40|$|Gloves are an {{important}} aspect of personal protective equipment. They protect workers from chemical hazards as well as reduce the risk of exposure to infectious material. Chemical <b>resistant</b> <b>gloves</b> are made from a variety of polymer materials such as plastic, rubber, and synthetic rubber, as not one material provides protection against all chemicals. One type of polymer material may adequately protect against a specific chemical, but may not adequately protect against another. Experiments, such as degradation tests, are used to determine which material is most effective for each chemical tested. Current methods of degradation ratings are based on weight change, which can be expensive. The method described in this study provides an inexpensive alternative to gravimetric analysis. This method uses surface area change as a way to determine the degradation of a polymer material. The percent change data were compared between the weight change and the surface area change. The regression line given was Y= 0. 4841 x + 0. 0187 and the R 2 value was 0. 9096. There is a strong correlation (Pearson r = 0. 9519; p ≤ 0. 05) between percent weight change and percent surface area change. The Change for surface area is about half that of the weight change, which indicates that the surface area method is more sensitive than the gravimetric determination.

40|$|Introduction: Police {{officers}} {{are at an}} elevated risk for needle-stick injuries (NSI), which pose a serious and costly occupational health risk for HIV and viral hepatitis. However, research on NSIs among police officers is limited, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the legality of syringe possession in Mexico, half of people who inject drugs (PWID) in Tijuana report extrajudicial syringe-related arrests and confiscation by police, which {{has been associated with}} needle-sharing and HIV infection. We assessed the prevalence and correlates of NSIs among Tijuana police officers to inform efforts to improve occupational safety and simultaneously reduce HIV risks among police and PWID. Methods: Tijuana's Department of Municipal Public Safety (SSPM) is among Mexico's largest. Our binational, multi-sectoral team analyzed de-identified data from SSPM's 2014 anonymous self-administered occupational health survey. The prevalence of NSI and syringe disposal practices was determined. Logistic regression with robust variance estimation via generalized estimating equations identified factors associated with ever having an occupational NSI. Results: Approximately one-quarter of the Tijuana police force was given the occupational health survey (N= 503). Respondents were predominantly male (86. 5 %) and ≤ 35 years old (42. 6 %). Nearly one in six officers reported ever having a NSI while working at SSPM (15. 3 %), of whom 14. 3 % reported a NSI within the past year. Most participants reported encountering needles/syringes while on duty (n= 473, 94 %); factors independently associated with elevated odds of NSIs included frequently finding syringes that contain drugs (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) : 2. 98; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 56 – 5. 67) and breaking used needles (AOR: 2. 25; 95 % CI: 1. 29 – 3. 91), while protective factors included being willing to contact emergency services in case of NSIs (AOR: 0. 39; 95 % CI: 0. 22 – 0. 69), and wearing needle-stick <b>resistant</b> <b>gloves</b> (AOR: 0. 43; 95 % CI: 0. 19 – 0. 91). Conclusions: Tijuana police face an elevated and unaddressed occupational NSI burden associated with unsafe syringe-handling practices, exposing them to substantial risk of HIV and other blood-borne infections. These findings spurred the development and tailoring of training to reduce NSI by modifying officer knowledge, attitudes and enforcement practices (e. g. syringe confiscation) – factors that also impact HIV transmission among PWID {{and other members of the}} community...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was that {{multiple layers of}} disposable nitrile gloves would protect longer against 2 -butoxyethanol (2 -BE) than a single layer relative to standardized breakthrough time (SBRT) and steady state permeation rate (SSPR). Many industries such as aerospace, automotive, recycling, and waste disposal facilities utilize 2 -BE. The resistance of disposable blue powder- free nitrile gloves (Kimberly-Clark) against 2 -BE was tested in single, double, and triple layers. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Method F 739 - 12 for permeation resistance under continuous contact was used. For each run set, four 1 -inch diameter permeation cells (three cells with 10 mL 2 -BE as challenge and one air blank (1)) were used with 10 mL deionized water as the collection solvent in a water bath shaken at 72. 3 ï¿½ 0. 58 revolution/minute (4. 82 ï¿½ 0. 04 cm/second) at 35. 0 ï¿½ 0. 5 ï¿½C. 0. 1 mL aliquots were sampled at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 135, 240, 360, and 480 minutes. Capillary column gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- MS) utilized mass to charge ratios 2 -BE at m/z= 57 and 87, and 4 -bromophenol (4 -BP) internal standard at m/z= 174 (1). The retention times for 2 -BE and 4 -BP were 4. 8 min and 7. 9 min. SBRT were found between 5 to 10 minutes for single, between 10 to 20 minutes for double, and between 30 to 40 minutes for triple layers, though thus not statistically different at p≤ 0. 050. Single gloving had a rating of ‘poor,’ while double and triple gloving were ‘good,’ based on Kimberly Clark Professional permeation breakthrough time criteria. The other statistically different comparison was for the mass/area permeation at 30 minutes for the triple layer relative to a single layer. The average SSPR were 41. 20 ï¿½ 8. 81 μg/cm 2 /min for single gloving, 48. 48 ï¿½ 55. 57 μg/cm 2 /min for double gloving, and 5. 39 ï¿½ 4. 64 μg/cm 2 /min for triple gloving. Both single and double gloving had a rating of good, and triple gloving had a rating of very good based on Ansell permeation rate criteria for Chemical <b>Resistant</b> <b>Gloves.</b> Thus, multiple layers did tend to prolong SBRT, but only triple layers definitely lowered the SSPR...|$|R
40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a government program that provides technical assistance to drycleaning shops. The program manager was concerned about occupational exposures to two new drycleaning solvents: SolvonK 4 and DF- 2000. In May 2013, we visited one drycleaning shop that used SolvonK 4 and two that used DF- 2000. SolvonK 4 contains primarily butylal and small amounts of n-butanol and formaldehyde. DF- 2000 {{is a mixture of}} C 11 to C 15 aliphatic-branched hydrocarbons. We observed work practices, collected air samples for drycleaning solvents and other chemicals produced or used during drycleaning, and evaluated potential skin exposures to these chemicals. Our evaluations measured the highest air concentrations of drycleaning solvents during loading and unloading of the drycleaning machines and when pressing fabrics. In the SolvonK 4 shop, we documented inhalation and dermal exposures to butylal (no OELs exist and the long-term human health effects of SolvonK 4 are unknown), and found low concentrations of formaldehyde and butanol. It is unknown if the formaldehyde originated from the drycleaning solvent or from other sources such as furnishings and clothing. We observed that employees without personal protective equipment mixed SolvonK 4 with a pretreatment product and sprayed the mixture onto fabrics. In the DF- 2000 shops, we measured airborne concentrations of DF- 2000 that were well below OELs for petroleum naphthas. We saw employees without adequate personal protective equipment cleaning the stills in the SolvonK 4 and DF- 2000 drycleaning machines. We recommended the drycleaning shops (1) brush pretreatments onto fabrics instead of spraying, (2) regularly inspect and maintain the drycleaning machine according to the manufacturers' recommendations, (3) provide eye protection and chemical <b>resistant</b> <b>gloves</b> to employees, and (4) clean the shop regularly with a high efficiency particulate air filter vacuum cleaner or wet methods.

By mass, polonium-210 is around 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide (the [...] for 210Po is less than 1 microgram for an average adult (see below) compared with about 250 milligrams for hydrogen cyanide). The main hazard is its intense radioactivity (as an alpha emitter), which {{makes it difficult to}} handle safely. Even in microgram amounts, handling 210Po is extremely dangerous, requiring specialized equipment (a negative pressure alpha glove box equipped with high-performance filters), adequate monitoring, and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination. Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested, inhaled, or absorbed, although they do not penetrate the epidermis and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body. Wearing chemically <b>resistant</b> and intact <b>gloves</b> is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous diffusion of polonium directly through the skin. Polonium delivered in concentrated nitric acid can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves (e.g., latex gloves) or the acid may damage the gloves.|$|R
