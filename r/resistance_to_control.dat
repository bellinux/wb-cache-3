40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) {{has become}} a serious issue worldwide. The World Health Organisation now ascribes the third {{leading cause of death}} globally to AMR (WHO, 2011 d, 2008). One potential solution to the issue lies in the introduction of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) within hospitals to monitor and control inappropriate prescription by clinicians. However, clinicians often display resistance to using such systems, leading to an ineffective take-up within the clinical setting. One such system, called GUIDANCE, was introduced into a major hospital in Melbourne, Australia some years ago. This thesis uses the qualitative theory-building methodology advocated by Strauss and Corbin (1990, 1998) to analyse the emergent phenomenon of ‘inappropriate prescription: clinicians’ <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> measures’. An in-depth study was conducted at a hospital over the period 2009 - 2012, involving 46 interviews with various clinicians, attendance at management meetings, and analysis of relevant documentation. The study found that, while the extant literature argues that inappropriate prescription of antibiotics causes and exacerbates the problem of antimicrobial resistance, clinicians in general tend to show resistance to the adoption of control measures based on clinical decision support systems. The phenomenon and core category of ‘inappropriate prescription: clinicians’ <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> measures’ is examined in the thesis in terms of its associated context, conditions, strategies, and consequences. The thesis contributes to the theoretical and practical literature in relation to the nature of resistance to CDSS. Emphasis is placed on the psycho-social variables that constitute the essence of the resistance process. The thesis contributes to the literature by presenting a framework of an aligned system of clinicians’ non-resistance and argues that such a system could avoid the deleterious effects of psychological maladjustment that may otherwise be encountered within the context of clinicians’ <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> measures. The essence of any attempt to eliminate the potency of resistance to change must be based on simultaneous efforts to negotiate a new and revised personal compact for clinicians that reflects mutual acceptance of the changing perceptions of the role of clinicians in the evolving nature of healthcare systems worldwide...|$|E

30|$|As {{a result}} of a long period of fire exclusion, heavy accumulations of fuels in many western forests are of concern to {{managers}} and the public (Leopold et al. 1963, Towell 1969, Kilgore 1972). These altered fuel conditions can promote uncharacteristically intense and/or extensive fires that may have undesirable effects (Hartesveldt 1964, Kilgore 1972, van Wagtendonk 1985). Intense fire can increase the risk of damage to life and property in wildland-urban interface areas and lead to severe fire effects on natural resources.

Like manipulation and bribery, electoral control describes ways {{of changing the}} outcome of an election; unlike manipulation or bribery attempts, control actions [...] -such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters [...] -modify the participative structure of an election. Via such actions one can try to either make a favorite candidate win ("constructive control") or prevent a despised candidate from winning ("destructive control"). Computational complexity {{can be used to}} protect elections from control attempts, i. e., proving an election system resistant to some type of control shows that the success of the corresponding control action, though not impossible, is computationally prohibitive.

Hospital-based antimicrobial management programs-also called "antimicrobial stewardship programs"-are primarily based on education coupled with a "front-end" approach (i. e., restricting the availability of selected antimicrobial agents) or a "back-end" approach (i. e., reviewing broad-spectrum empirical therapy and then streamlining or discontinuing therapy, as indicated, on the basis of culture and susceptibility testing results and clinical response). Institutional efforts to optimize antimicrobial use should concentrate on patient outcomes, should have multidisciplinary support, and should use a combination of interventions customized to the needs, resources, and information technology infrastructure of the health care institution. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the computational aspects of approval voting and some of its variants, with a particular focus on the complexity of problems that model various ways of tampering with the outcome of an election: manipulation, control, and bribery. For example, in control settings, the election’s chair seeks to alter the outcome of an election via control actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. In particular, sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting (SP-AV), a variant of approval voting proposed by Brams and Sanver [BS 06], is computationally resistant to 19 of the 22 common types of control. Thus, among those natural voting systems for which winner determination is easy, SP-AV is the system currently known to display the broadest <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> We also present the known complexity results for various types of bribery.
