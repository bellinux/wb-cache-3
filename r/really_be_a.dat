According to Shabbethai Bass, Rashi was expressing the opinion that the reference to a mother was only present to ensure that birds were clearly excluded from the prohibition; Bass argued that Rashi regarded the ban on boiling meat in its mother's milk to <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more general ban on boiling meat in milk, regardless {{of the relationship between}} the source of the meat and that of the milk.|$|E

They have plans for films, and we have plans to intermingle with them, and it's the name of our show. The second to last episode is called [...] "Ragtag", and that's a term we've used; we wanted to create this ragtag group, but within this giant organization with billions of dollars and support all over the globe and satellite feeds on their luxurious plane. Now we have a chance to start them over and figure out what it's like to <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> secret again." ...|$|E
500|$|Downstairs, {{the church}} {{president}} tries to convince Stan's parents {{to allow their}} son to participate. He tells to Stan the great secret behind the church — a condensed {{version of the story}} of Xenu, based directly on the Scientology Operating Thetan III document, and accompanied by an onscreen caption reading [...] "This is what Scientologists actually believe". He then begs Stan to continue writing where [...] "L. Ron" [...] left off. Stan, impressed by the story, does so. He shows his writings to the Scientology president, who initially approves of the work, but when Stan says [...] "to <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> church, you can't charge money to help", the president reveals to Stan that the church is in reality a global money-making scam. He asks that Stan continue with that in mind. Stan appears to agree and keeps writing.|$|E

500|$|Marco {{was later}} {{killed in a}} bush fire disaster. Describing the filming process, Blair stated: [...] "Shooting the scenes for the bush fire and {{everything}} surrounding it - the wedding - the funeral - was so draining. It was full on." [...] Blair had to film scenes involving Carmella singing at Marco's funeral, which she deemed [...] "close to home" [...] because she had done it at her grandmother's funeral. She found it distressing, as they filmed in a real graveyard. She had previously been reluctant to sing on-screen but felt it was justified for Marco's funeral. Blair commented on Carmella's repetitive bad luck, stating: [...] "She's gone through so much already, just {{to get to this}} point. This should <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> happy time for her, but it's not." [...] After all the hurdles she faced, Carmella became a stronger person. Blair said it saw her become well-equipped to look after her child.|$|E
500|$|... "The Front" [...] {{was written}} by Adam I. Lapidus and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. In the early 1990s, Lapidus saw a news report on television about three 13-year-old girls - Renee Carter, Sarah Creef, and Amy Crosby - who had written a script for Tiny Toon Adventures, titled [...] "Buster And Babs Go Hawaiian". The show's executive producer, Steven Spielberg, liked the script {{so much that he}} brought the three to Hollywood to work with the show's writing staff. Upon seeing the report, Lapidus thought, [...] "That would <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> neat idea for Bart and Lisa." [...] He wrote a spec script, which made its way via executive producer James L. Brooks to the Simpsons staff, who hired Lapidus to write the episode. [...] "The Front" [...] is the only Simpsons episode written by Lapidus, causing some dispute among the show's fans as to whether he actually exists or was perhaps a pseudonym. Lapidus' mother-in-law came upon one such debate on an Internet forum.|$|E
500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this feeling that something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where you go and come back to and go and come back to and have it <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the negativism surrounding the album, Aguilera claimed that Bionic was ahead of its time.

[...] The resort was still small though for Disney standards. The resort described itself as having the rustic charm of a quiet country inn. Rooms were decorated in a bright and airy style. [...] The sitting area had pale green paint, an oak table and chairs, along with a chandelier and a pull out couch.|$|E

US Airways President Scott Kirby said that US Airways was the last viable airline in the U.S. to merge and that any potential merger would be with one of three U.S. carriers: United Airlines, American Airlines or Delta Air Lines. [...] Kirby also commented that US Airways' membership in the Star Alliance would make a merger with United Airlines easier, but added that [...] "it's not meaningful enough to <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor". [...] Among the 10 largest domestic airlines, consumers scored US Airways last for overall customer satisfaction in a May 2011 Consumer Reports survey.|$|E
2500|$|By 1937, in {{tune with}} the National Christian Party regime, Cantacuzino had embraced eugenics, racism, and antisemitism. At a meeting in Cluj, she {{proposed}} the introduction of legislation banning all [...] "foreigners" [...] and minorities from marrying Romanian state employees, as well as 10-year reviews for all Romanian citizenship applications. Additionally, she and the GFR envisaged state bonuses for [...] "eugenic" [...] marriages between full-blooded Romanian youths. Meanwhile, her connections in the international feminist movement became alarmed by the growth of antisemitic violence. In a December 1933 letter to Cantacuzino, Cécile Brunschvicg inquired: [...] "there is talk of terrible antisemitic campaigns in Romania, and of the development of a Nazi spirit in your country. Is this true? [...] It would <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> deplorable if [...] spirit were to win over a Latin country that is so sane, and so very close to our hearts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The British {{military}} {{was well aware}} of the dangers posed by German artillery dominating the Dover Strait and on 4 September 1940 the Chief of Naval Staff issued a memo stating that if the Germans [...] "…could get possession of the Dover defile and capture its gun defences from us, then, holding these points {{on both sides of the}} Straits, they would be in a position largely to deny those waters to our naval forces". Should the Dover defile be lost, he concluded, the Royal Navy could do little to interrupt the flow of German supplies and reinforcements across the Channel, at least by day, and he further warned that [...] "…there might <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> chance that they (the Germans) might be able to bring a serious weight of attack to bear on this country". The very next day the Chiefs of Staff, after discussing the importance of the defile, decided to reinforce the Dover coast with more ground troops.|$|E

2500|$|In fact, she had by now begun {{appearing}} in public almost exclusively as a male. [...] She began {{to refer to}} herself as Mr. Charles Brown and {{although there is no}} way of telling why she chose the name Brown, there is a possibility that it was chosen because of her elder sister, Catherine Brown. She boasted further that a young heiress fell in love with her, believing her to <b>really</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> man, and proposed marriage. [...] This resulted, not surprisingly, in disappointment for both Charke and the hopeful heiress. Although the identity of the young woman remains [...] "shadowy", many historians believe that she is indeed [...] "Mrs. Brown". [...] Unable to earn a living in the sanctioned theatres, Charlotte began to work any job she could to support herself and Catherine, but she was always attracted to jobs she could perform as a man. [...] Therefore, she was a valet to Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey, and then even took up as a sausage maker. [...] Anglesey was famous as a bigamist and libertine, and lived with a paramour during Charlotte's employ. Charlotte claimed that when Anglesey was not entertaining guests, the trio would dine together as friendly equals. As a valet's service would indeed be personal, normally including dressing one's master for the day, the entire arrangement would have been quite unusual. [...] (Anglesey was soon a central party to an infamous scandal, being dispossessed of his lands—but allowed to continue using his title—after a court ruled that he had sold his young kinsman, James Annesley, who had a better claim to the inheritance, into slavery.) ...|$|E
