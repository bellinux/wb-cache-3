5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (<b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (<b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E

50|$|A {{change to}} any of this {{information}} might <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different premium being charged if the change <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different actuarial class or risk level for that variable.

25|$|This <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of {{function}} of the cycle, and <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accumulation of glutamate. This glutamate further stimulates the NMDA receptors, thus acting synergistically with quinolinic acid to increase its neurotoxic effect by increasing the levels of glutamate, as well as inhibiting its uptake. In this way, quinolinic acid self-potentiates its own toxicity. Furthermore, quinolinic acid <b>results</b> <b>in</b> changes of the biochemistry {{and structure of the}} astrocytes themselves, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> apoptotic response. A loss of astrocytes <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pro-inflammatory effect, further increasing the initial inflammatory response which initiates quinolinic acid production.|$|R
