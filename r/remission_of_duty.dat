60|$|So grave {{a crisis}} {{could only be}} met by daring remedies. With the highest courage, moral courage no less than political, Peel {{resolved}} to ask parliament to let him raise four or five millions a year by income-tax, in order to lower the duties on the great articles of consumption, and by reforming the tariff both to relieve trade, and to stimulate and replenish the reciprocal flow of export and import. That he at this time, or perhaps in truth at any time, had acquired complete mastery of those deeper principles and wider aspects of free trade of which Adam Smith had been the great exponent--principles afterwards enforced by the genius of Cobden with such admirable still, persistency, and patriotic spirit--there was nothing to show. Such a scheme had no originality in it. Huskisson, and men of less conspicuous name, had ten years earlier urged {{the necessity of a}} new general system of taxation, based upon <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> on raw materials and on articles of consumption, and upon the imposition of an income-tax. The famous report of the committee on import duties of 1840, often rightly called the charter of free trade, and of which Peel, not much to his credit, had at this moment not read a word,[154] laid the foundations of the great policy of tariff reform with which the names of Peel and Gladstone are associated in history. The policy advocated in 1830 in the admirable treatise of Sir Henry Parnell is exactly the policy of Peel in 1842, as he acknowledged. After all it is an idle quarrel between the closet strategist and the victorious commander; between the man who first discerns some great truth of government, and the man who gets the thing, or even a part of the thing, actually done.|$|E

50|$|Myrina was a {{very strong}} place, though not very large, and had a good harbor. Pliny the Elder {{mentions}} the fame of its oysters and that it bore the surname of Sebastopolis; while, according to Syncellus, it was also called Smyrna. An inscription (Bulletin de correspondance hellenique, V, 283) tells us that Myrina formed part of the Kingdom of Pergamon in the 3rd century BC. For some time Myrina was occupied by Philip V of Macedon; but the Romans compelled him to evacuate it, and declared the place free.Under Roman rule, Myrina was part of the Roman province of Asia Prima. It twice suffered severe earthquakes; first in the reign of Tiberius, on which occasion it received a <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> on account <b>of</b> the loss it had sustained; and a second time in the reign of Trajan. The town was restored each time, and continued to exist until a late period. It was the birthplace of Agathias, a Byzantine poet and historian of the 6th century. Myrina minted coins in Antiquity, some of which survive.|$|R

Having been faithful to King Henry VI of England throughout his disputed reign, he was rewarded with certain commercial privileges, consisting, chiefly, in an entire <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> the customary <b>duties</b> on exported wool. In 1456, he had permission {{to go on a}} pilgrimage, and in 1460, the king settled on him, as in part, a recompense for the expenses and losses incurred in his service, an annuity of £40, arising out of certain manors forfeited by the Earl of Salisbury.|$|R
60|$|Never was {{a method}} of {{defeating}} the oppressions of monopoly more forcible, more simple, or more equitable: no sort of plausible objection could be made; {{and it was in}} vain to think of evading it. It was therefore met with the confidence of avowed and determined injustice. The Presidency of Calcutta openly denied to the prince the power of protecting the trade of his subjects by the <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> his own <b>duties.</b> It was evident that his authority drew to its period: many reasons and motives concurred, and his fall was hastened by the odium of the oppressions which he exercised voluntarily, as well as of those to which he was obliged to submit.|$|R

The American civil war by arresting the supply of cotton had half ruined Lancashire. The same cause had diminished the export trade to America by six millions sterling. Three bad seasons spoiled the crops. There was distress in Ireland. Yet the chancellor had a revenue in excess of expenditure by the noble figure of three millions and three quarters. Mr. Gladstone naturally took the opportunity of surveying the effects of four years of his financial policy. He admitted that they had been four years of tension, and this tension had been enhanced by his large <b>remissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> and by taking in hand the completion of the great work of commercial legislation. The end of it all was a growth of wealth, as he called it, almost intoxicating. The value of British goods sent to France had risen from four millions and three quarters to nearly nine millions and one quarter, in other words had about doubled under the operations of the treaty of commerce.(45) If to this were added foreign and colonial produce sent through us, and acquired by us in exchange for our own produce, the value had risen from nine and a half in 1859 to twenty-one and three quarters in 1862. In Mr. Gladstone’s own description later, the export trade of 1860, in spite of a bad harvest, was so stimulated by the liberating customs act, that it rose at once from a hundred and thirty millions to a hundred and thirty-five. The next year it fell to a hundred and twenty-five, and in 1862 it fell by another million owing to the withdrawal, by reason of the American war, of the material of our greatest manufacture. In 1866 it rose to a hundred and eighty-eight millions.(46) Then under the head of income-tax, and comparing 1842 with 1862, over the same area, and with the same limitations, the aggregate amount of assessed income had risen from one hundred and fifty-six millions to two hundred and twenty-one. Other tests and figures need not detain us.|$|R

40|$|In {{this double}} case report, we present two special cases of {{pituitary}} apoplexy. First, we describe {{a patient with}} growth hormone deficiency despite clinical suspicion of acromegaly. Imaging showed evidence of a recent pituitary apoplexy, which might have caused spontaneous <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> the acromegaly before presentation at our outpatient clinic. Second, we describe a patient who presented with spontaneous <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> Cushing's disease after pituitary apoplexy, followed by a spontaneous <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> a relapse of the Cushing's disease due to a second pituitary apoplexy. These cases show that patients in spontaneous <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> hormonally active pituitary adenomas should be suspected of a pituitary apoplexy. Furthermore, even after spontaneous remission following pituitary apoplexy, careful long-term follow-up of these patients is mandatory, as relapses of hormonal hypersecretion can occur...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{determinants}} {{that cause}} impaired {{quality of life}} (QOL) in patients in long-term <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> Cushing's syndrome (CS) are unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to get more insight into the patient and disease characteristics related to impaired QOL in these patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The QOL of 123 patients in <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> CS (age 52. 2 +/- 12. 0 years, 106 women, duration <b>of</b> <b>remission</b> 13. 3 +/- 10. 4 years, 80 % pituitary CS), assessed with seven validated questionnaires, was compared with the QOL of an age- and sex-matched control group (n= 105). To investigate the influence of the aetiology of CS on QOL, patients in <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> pituitary and adrenal CS were compared. Furthermore, the influence of hormonal deficiencies, treatment strategy, duration <b>of</b> <b>remission,</b> gender and age on QOL was investigated. RESULTS: QOL in the total patient group and each patient subgroup was significantly worse on practically all dimensions of questionnaires compared with the control group (P< 0. 05), except for patients in <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> pituitary CS without hormonal deficiencies who had an impaired QOL on 50 % of the QOL dimensions. Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in QOL between different patient groups, especially no difference between patients in <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> adrenal and pituitary CS. Female gender and a shorter duration <b>of</b> <b>remission</b> had a negative influence on QOL in the patient group. CONCLUSIONS: QOL remains impaired in patients in long-term <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> CS regardless of aetiology, presence of hormonal deficiencies and treatment strategies. More research is needed to establish the causes...|$|R
