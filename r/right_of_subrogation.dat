50|$|In Commercial Union v Lotter, {{the buyer}} of a luxury motor vehicle did not {{disclose}} to the insurer that the vehicle had been stolen from another country.

The insurance company argued that its <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> was diminished {{by the fact that the}} vehicle in question was a stolen vehicle when the insurance policy was taken out: The insured had no title to the vehicle, so the insurance company could not sue a negligent third party, in terms of its <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation,</b> for the full costs of repairing any damage to the vehicle.|$|E

It first introduces the topic and then considers the juridical basis <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> It also attempts to sketch the historical origins and derivation of the modern law <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> Subrogation is generally divided into two categories by civilian and American writers, namely legal subrogation and contractual subrogation. Irish and English courts have not always been careful to make it clear which category they were applying. This has led to considerable confusion and controversy as to the relevance <b>of</b> intention to <b>subrogation.</b> Some authors have laid down the broad proposition that subrogation is a remedy to reverse unjust enrichment and nothing more. This thesis disputes the universal application of the ?restitutionary hypothesis. ...|$|R

Mr X claims under his policy of insurance governed by English lqw with Z Co, who pays the claim. It will be a matter of English law whether Z Co is subrogated to any right of action which Mr X might have had against Mr Y under the original contract of bailment.|$|E

It notes that the government's judges will tend to be biased in favor of government, since that is the entity from which they receive their salaries and power.

5000|$|Linda and Morris Tannehill {{believe that}} big {{businesses}} {{will tend to}} pay {{the bulk of the}} defense costs (since they stand to lose the most {{in the event of an}} attack); they would then pass on the costs to their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the whole population. A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement, requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim would be filed with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation,</b> and the insurer would hire a private defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the [...] "altruistic" [...] insurer out of business. However, the private defense agency's activity need not be limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including reasonable collection costs), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy assets, as privateers did in the 18th and 19th centuries under letters of marque and reprisal. Prisoners of war also used to have shadow prices (ransoms) which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another potential alternative to taxation.|$|E
40|$|Extract: This text is a {{study of}} the tumultuous {{doctrine}} of subrogation. The doctrine of marshalling of securities, which is based on subrogation, will be treated in a separate text. Chapter 1 emphasises the distinction between subrogation and assignment. Chapter 2 examines the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> to the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of indemnity. The importance, in practice, of the distinc¬ tion between the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of exoneration and the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of reimbursement is also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 addresses the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation.</b> It examines the discrete situations where the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> is enlivened. Chapter 4 deals with those situations where the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> vests in a person (other than a surety) who discharges a third party 2 ̆ 7 s debt to a secured creditor. It also examines the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> of a surety who discharges the principal debtor 2 ̆ 7 s debt to the secured creditor. Chapter 5 examines the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> of a putative lender who purports to lend money to an ultra vires borrower who then uses the proceeds of the putative loan to discharge its intra vires debts. Chapter 6 discusses those situations where a third party payer does not have any right to be subrogated to the (former) right of the payee against the debtor...|$|E

40|$|This article explores some of {{the rules}} {{governing}} the liability of joint tenants and their guarantors for rent under a lease. Where a lease is granted {{to more than one}} person, it may be important to decide whether they are liable to the landlord individually or collectively for the rent. Moreover, if a guarantor is made a party to the lease, is he guaranteeing the liability of just one or all the tenants named in the lease? If the guarantor discharges the liability to pay rent to the landlord, can he recover the amount from the defaulting tenant(s) ? Finally, does the guarantor have a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> in these circumstances...|$|E

A number of recent decisions have contemplated or recognised a right of equitable subrogation available to secured creditors whose security has been diminished by the application of ss 433 or 561. However, it remains unclear whether ss 433 and 561 impose trust obligations and whether a breach of a trust obligation is necessary for equitable subrogation to be available. This article argues that a statutory <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> should be enshrined in legislation whereby a secured creditor may recover from the free assets of the company to the extent that his or her security has been diminished...|$|E
40|$|Subrogation {{means that}} a person who indemnifies another is {{entitled}} to step into the shoes of the person and take over whatever right he may have against third parties. But, it is found that the insurers are not always successful in their subrogation claims against the wrongdoer in the construction industry. Thus, {{in order to understand the}} insurers? <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> claim in construction contract, this master project has been carried out with the intention to identify circumstances that do not allow insurers to exercise their rights of subrogation. This project has been carried out mainly through documentary analysis of the relevant cases repeated in law journals, such as Malayan Law Journal, Singapore Law Report, Building Law Report, etc. Eighteen cases has been chosen to be analysed in accordance with the feature of <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> against co-insured and the waiver of subrogation clauses in the standard forms of contract. The result showed that, in conjunction with insurance clauses, construction contracts do include provisions that require the insurance policies to be in the form of joint names of the employer, contractor, subcontractor and all related third parties. This would lead to the insurers not being able to exercise the usual rights of subrogation against any of the joint insured. Besides that, the construction contracts also require the insurance policies to contain cross liability or waiver of subrogation clauses. The clauses provide that the insurances carrier, after settling and paying a claim, cannot pursue the damage paid for by the insured parties? insurance carrier. These effectively prevent an insurer from seeking recovery from the party at fault. So, where a loss has been caused by a subcontractor and the principal contractor seeked recovery, the insurer cannot pursue the claim from the subcontractor...|$|E

40|$|The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) {{was enacted}} in 1974 {{to protect the}} pension <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> {{employees}} nationwide. However, due to its broad preemptive powers, ERISA has since developed into a tool used by health insurers to recover {{millions of dollars in}} tort damages meant to benefit employees with ERISA health plans. This practice, known as subrogation, has been met with legislative backlash in the form of state antisubrogation statutes, which attempt to limit the enforceability <b>of</b> <b>subrogation</b> clauses found in almost all ERISA health plans. However, many courts have held that ERISA preempts these antisubrogation statutes, thereby affirming insurers’ ability to recover funds intended to compensate injured victims. These decisions often have disastrous and life changing consequences for injured employees. After examining ERISA’s preemptive clauses and the Supreme Court cases delineating their limits, this Note argues that state antisubrogation statutes should be upheld against preemption challenges. This result is necessary to preserve ERISA’s original purpose: protection of employees nationwide...|$|R
50|$|Outside {{of these}} {{categories}} exist a range of doctrines which also provide restitutionary or analogous remedies.

Certain statutory frameworks providing for restitutionary remedies have been said to rest on the principle of unjust enrichment.|$|R
