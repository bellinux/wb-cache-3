50|$|The riot gun {{versions}} of the pistol grip Model 500 (Persuader, Cruiser, <b>Road</b> <b>Blocker,</b> and Mariner) are available with an 18.5 in and 20 in barrel depending on magazine capacity. The 590 is only available with a 20 in barrel and flush-fit magazine tube. The 590A1 is available with a 14 in, 18.5-inch, or 20 in barrel. One model sold as Model 590-SP (catalog item 51663) is technically a 590A1, as it uses the heavy barrel and military trigger group, but unlike models designated 590A1 it is sold on the civilian market.|$|E

40|$|This Master Thesis {{is about}} the design of {{processes}} to forecast Project Business demands in a fully outsourced manufacturing set up. Due {{to the complexity of}} the topic a System Engineering methodology has been used in order to structure and analyze the system, deduce systematic objectives, find potential solutions and make methodically supported decisions. The research problem: “How to design processes to improve demand forecast for Project Business to external suppliers?“ shows to be an unsolved topic of interests of the supply chain community as seen in the recent study published by the German Association of Materials Management, Purchasing and Logistics (Wittenbrink, 2014). This Master Thesis is an applied research conducted at the premises of the HILTI Corporation headquarters in Schaan (Liechtenstein), from September 2013 until February 2014. The HILTI Corporation {{is one of the leading}} companies in providing technologically superior products, systems and services to the construction professionals. In more detail the study was developed at HILTI’s Business Unit Installation Systems in the frame of a new strategy work to professionalize and scale up Project Business. The research material was collected from several one to one meetings with internal and external parties involved in the processes, as well as company data bases. A workshop in a form of experience-exchange was undertaken with an expert of the Swiss National Railway Company as a benchmark touch point. The research results drawn from the case study are as follow: An aggregation of opportunity demand by probability at a product level is needed in order to visualize <b>road</b> <b>blockers</b> and anticipate decisions to increase the Supply Chain responsiveness. A postponement strategy furthest upstream at a raw material level, needs to be implemented for a product line (Installation channels) with critical raw material lead time. A value stream mapping approach for complex multi-component products is a valuable activity to detect bottlenecks and prepare upgrading measures following a Theory of Constrains approach. In spite of the limited resources of this work, not only incremental solutions are presented and developed but also a desired path of further improvement measures is detailed...|$|R
