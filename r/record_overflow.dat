50|$|The road {{victory over}} Stanford was Idaho's only {{win in the}} PCC in 1947, and {{struggled}} on offense with just thirteen points scored in their four losses. That included a humbling 21-0 shutout at home to Montana for the Little Brown Stein on a Friday afternoon in November; the Grizzlies had also won with a shutout the previous year, 19-0 in Missoula. The season finale the next week in Boise was an improvement, with a 13-6 upset of Utah in the rain at Public School Field to finish at 4-4. It was the first Vandal football game in Boise in five years and had a <b>record</b> <b>overflow</b> crowd; Idaho improved its record in Boise games (southern homecoming) to 12-0-2 (they won the next three years, then only three of nine from 1951-59).|$|E

40|$|Road {{construction}} and usage {{have a wide}} range of direct and indirect negative effects on protected areas. The impact of state roads on protected areas in Vojvodina was reviewed in this article, based on the orientation values of habitat loss and secondary negative effects originating from traffic functioning. Results of the assessment indicate that the use of existing roads constructed on habitats within the national ecological network exceeded the capacity of individual PA-protected areas (e. g., in case of Straža Natural Monument). <b>Recorded</b> capacity <b>overflow</b> on other PAs occurs solely as a consequence of overlapping between protected areas and areas of influence of roads routed along the borders of protected areas (which is the case with Slano Kopovo Special Nature Reserve and Selevenjske pustare Special Nature Reserve).

The study methodology included geomorphological photointerpretation, the measurement and calculation of morphometric parameters, the estimation {{of the time of}} concentration, the characterization of the pluviometric regime, and the analysis of extreme precipitation events. The analyzed basin is a system in which hydrological responses are determined by morphometric characteristics; this trait is evidenced by the short time of concentration that results from this system’s location in a mountainous environment and by the magnitude of extreme precipitation events...|$|R
40|$|Amphetamine (AMPH) {{is known}} to raise {{extracellular}} dopamine (DA) levels by inducing stimulation-independent DA efflux via reverse transport through the DA transporter and by inhibiting DA re-uptake. In contrast, recent studies indicate that AMPH decreases stimulation-dependent vesicular DA release. One candidate mechanism for this effect is the AMPH-mediated redistribution of DA from vesicles to the cytosol. In addition, the inhibition of stimulation-dependent release may occur because of D 2 autoreceptor activation by DA that is released via reverse transport. We used the D 2 receptor antagonist sulpiride and mice lacking the D 2 receptor to address this issue. To evaluate carefully AMPH effects on release and uptake, we <b>recorded</b> stimulated DA <b>overflow</b> in striatal slices by using continuous amperometry and cyclic voltammetry. Recordings were fit by a random walk simulation of DA diffusion, including uptake wit...|$|R
40|$|Variable-length {{records are}} very {{frequent}} in database environments. This work gives {{a set of}} algorithms for maintaining {{a new model of}} static hashed files designed to accommodate variable-length records. Two special techniques for variable-length records are used. First, records are ordered by length and not by key value, e. g., the shortest (longest) records are stored in the main (overflow) blocks. Second, at the cost of a small directory for the <b>overflow</b> <b>records</b> stored in the main file blocks, the successful and unsuccessful searches are faster. The directory consists of the triplet key value, record length, and pointer to the overfiow block. In addition, this work reports a simulation of the file structure. Numerical results show the benefits of the model. These two techniques may be applied in any primary key file organization that uses overflow chaining, including the recent versions of dynamic hashing. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The integer {{data type}} is ostensibly very simple, but {{integers}} can easily overflow {{in a simple}} program. A malicious user can manipulate an unchecked integer input to overflow which can produce a security breach. An integer overflow can cause a program to crash. In recent years, integer overflows resulted {{in more than two}} hundred <b>recorded</b> vulnerabilities. Integer <b>overflow</b> is a challenging topic to address when teaching C/C++ or Java in an introductory software development course. Most novice students are unaware that simple integer input or calculations can generate errors, or worse yet, silently deliver vulnerability in a system. This paper describes laboratory exercises that inform students about the nuances of integer behavior and how these can lead to security vulnerabilities. We illustrate techniques that educators can use to teach students to discover integer overflows and replace them with robust code. Even at the introductory level, we can reinforce a secure coding frame of mind such that our students will never blindly trust user input or perfor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: When a file {{is loaded}} into a {{direct access storage device}} using key-to-address transformations, {{the number and}} size of storage blocks can be selected. In this study, a {{selection}} that minimizes the combined cost of storage space and accesses to the storage device is determined for the case where no record additions or deletions occur after loading. The analysis {{is based on the assumption}} that for a given set of keys, a transformation exists that gives a uniform probability distribution over the available addresses. Under this assumption, formulas are derived for the average number of <b>overflow</b> <b>records</b> and for the average number of accesses required to retrieve a record. Given these formulas, the costs are expressed as a function of storage used, number of accesses, cost per unit of storage, and cost per access. Minima are computed for a range of block sizes and operational conditions. The results seem to indicate that current file design practices are abundant with storage space. Finally, the results are condensed in an easy to use approximate formula...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} brain activation {{in children with}} developmental coordination disorder (DCD) to reveal areas that may contribute to poor movement execution and/or abundant motor overflow. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 13 boys with DCD (mean age = 9. 6 years ± 0. 8) and 13 typically developing controls (mean age = 9. 3 years ± 0. 6) were scanned performing two tasks (finger sequencing and hand clenching) with their dominant hand, while a four-finger motion sensor <b>recorded</b> contralateral motor <b>overflow</b> on their non-dominant hand. Despite displaying increased motor overflow on both functional tasks during scanning, there were no obvious activation deficits in the DCD group to explain the abundant motor overflow seen. However, children with DCD were found to display decreased activation in the left superior frontal gyrus on the finger-sequencing task, an area which plays an integral role in executive and spatially oriented processing. Decreased activation was also seen in the left inferior frontal gyrus, an area typically active during the observation and imitation of hand movements. Finally, increased activation in the right postcentral gyrus was seen in children with DCD, which may reflect increased reliance on somatosensory information during the execution of complex fine motor tasks...|$|R
40|$|In the United Kingdom few river {{catchments}} have <b>overflow</b> <b>records</b> {{longer than}} 35 years. The wealth of precipitation {{data in the}} United Kingdom enables long records of riverflow to be produced with a catchment model calibrated over the recent period. For most parts of England and Wales it is shown that monthly sequences of riverflow that account for 90 – 95 per cent of the variance of the measured riverflow can be produced back to 1860. Reconstructions are made on 10 catchments (size range 400 – 4500 km 2) in both upland and lowland Britain. Reliable reconstructions are possible using as few as 4 rainguage records. The reconstructions provide not only a valuable database {{for the study of}} the effect of climatic change on riverflow, but also allow stationarity, homoscedasticy and changes in the frequency of extreme events to be examined. It is shown that on the 10 catchments extreme droughts with a duration of 18 months are three times more likely to have occurred between 1925 and 1979 than between 1870 and 1924. The significance of this and other findings are discussed in the context of water resource analysis. The reconstructed riverflows, apart from their obvious use for water resource analysis, also provide a valuable climatological database for the possible further extension of riverflow using proxy climate indicators such as tree rings...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{changes in}} the helium and carbon isotopic {{composition}} of shallow thermal waters vs. gas and a crater fumarolic gas have been recorded at Stromboli prior and during the 2002 – 2003 eruption. The 3 He/ 4 He ratios corrected for air contamination (Rc/Ra), and δ 13 C of fumarolic gases gradually increased from May to November 2002 before the eruption onset. These variations imply early degassing of a gas-rich magma at depth that likely fed both the intense Strombolian activity and small lava <b>overflows</b> <b>recorded</b> during that period. The lava effusion of late December 2002 was shortly preceded by a marked Rc/Ra decrease both in water and fumarolic gases. Comparison of He/CO 2 and CH 4 /CO 2 ratios in dissolved gas and with δ 13 CCO 2 values rules out the Rc/Ra decrease due to an increasing input of radiogenic 4 He. The Rc/Ra decrease is attributed to the He isotope fractionation during rapid magma ascent and degassing. A new uprising of 3 He-rich magma probably occurred in January to February 2003, when Rc/Ra ratios displayed the highest values in dissolved gases ever measured before (4. 56 Rc/Ra). The increase in He/CO 2 and CH 4 /CO 2 ratios and decrease in δ 13 C of dissolved CO 2 was recorded after the 5 April 2003 explosive paroxysm, likely caused by enhanced gas-water interaction inducing CO 2 dissolution. No anomalous Rc/Ra values were recorded in the same period, when usual Strombolian activity gradually resumed...|$|R
