5|$|<b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to remove them.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee {{attempted}} to answer Tech's score in its following possession. The Hokies' kickoff {{resulted in a}} touchback, so the Volunteers began from their 20-yard line. Montario Hardesty gained a first down with a 10-yard run, then Crompton gained another first down with an 11-yard pass. Tennessee continued to advance on running plays and a 14-yard pass by Crompton, pushing the ball inside the Tech 30-yard line. Once there, however, the Hokies rallied by sacking Crompton for a seven-yard loss. A two-yard run and an incomplete pass kept Tennessee from gaining another first down, setting up a fourth down. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> an offensive play and possibly gain a first down or turn the ball over on downs, Tennessee punted, forcing Virginia Tech's offense to start from its 11-yard line.|$|E

5|$|The Eagles' post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 33-yard line, and on the first play after the kick, Boston College committed a personal foul penalty when Tyrod Taylor was hit out of bounds. Following the penalty, the ball was advanced to the Tech 42-yard line and the Hokies were given a first down. Tech completed two short passes, advancing to the 50-yard line, but the Hokies punted after not gaining another first down. The kick sailed out of bounds, and the Eagles returned to offense with 19 seconds remaining in the first half. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to score quickly, Boston College elected to run out the clock with Virginia Tech leading, 14–7.|$|E
5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E
5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a move that would be far less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{are known}} for the great number of deities they honoured, a {{capacity}} that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists. As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to eradicate them. One way that Rome promoted stability among diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By {{the height of the}} Empire, numerous cults of pseudo-foreign gods (Roman reinventions of foreign gods) were cultivated at Rome and in the provinces, among them cults of Cybele, Isis, Epona, and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue {{in the sense that it}} is for competing monotheistic systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{were made}} to {{consolidate}} the newly captured positions. The 41st Division, on the right flank, had reached its portion of the Blue Line and captured Flers but the 47th Division lagged behind. The New Zealanders remained exposed to enfilade fire along their left flank and German artillery fire also hampered attempts to shore up their positions. The 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade began {{an attack on the}} final objective, Red Line, at 10:50am and secured a portion of the Grove Alley trenches by midday despite heavy casualties. However, the 47th Division had still not been able to secure its first objective while the 41st Division had to withdraw from Flers village. This left the New Zealanders in a salient exposed to heavy machine gun fire on both flanks. At 2:00pm Germans were spotted advancing from the northeast. Captain Lindsay Inglis, the senior surviving officer in this area of Grove Alley, gave orders to strengthen the corresponding section of the line. When a platoon began moving to effect the order, this was misinterpreted as a withdrawal and the remaining elements of the battalion began to pull out to Flers village. Inglis was able to check the withdrawal, but with only 120 men, he opted to dig in where they were <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to reoccupy Grove Alley.|$|E

On second and goal, Norton tackled Anderson at the 1, and then he and Tolbert dropped Anderson for no gain on the next play. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> another fourth down conversion, Chicago settled for Kevin Butler's 19-yard field goal to make the score 10-3 with 15 {{seconds left in the}} half.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Hastings, the Norman army {{advanced}} through Kent into Surrey, {{where they}} defeated an English force which attacked them at Southwark and then burned that suburb. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>try</b> to attack London across the river, the Normans continued west through Surrey, crossed the Thames at Wallingford in Berkshire and descended on London from the north-west.
