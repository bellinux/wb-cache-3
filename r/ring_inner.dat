50|$|He {{began his}} career working with Max Reinhardt in Vienna. When Reinhardt moved to the United States in the early 1930s, Horner {{travelled}} with Max Reinhardt's production group acting as his stage manager. Max Reinhardt's staging of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1934) for the summer Hollywood Bowl season in Los Angeles, Harry Horner was the production's stage manager and alas an actor in the production. Following Max Reinhardt to New York, Harry Horner assisted Reinhardt in his staging of the Biblical musical spectacle The Eternal Road (Der Weg der Verheissung); the production had music by Kurt Weill; conducted by Harry Horner; opening at the Manhattan Opera House 1/7/1937-5/15/1937 with scenic design, costume design and lighting by Norman Bel Geddes. Max Reinhardt, disgusted with Norman Bel Geddes lack of interest by not showing up for production rehearsals, pressed Harry Horner into acting as art director supervising the sets, costumes, and the lighting. Because Horner had been faithful to Reinhardt as his stage manager, Reinhardt {{knew that he could}} depend upon Horner's many faceted talents and abilities. Consequently, Harry Horner fell into the scenic design craft and was employed as a stage designer. Harry Horner designed the scenery for the drama Lady In The Dark, a drama with a musical dream sequence (music: Kurt Weill); opening January 23, 1941 - June 15, 1941 (reopening 10/2/41-5/30/42, revived 2/27/43-5/15/43). Harry Horner's stage design legacy is the first use of a center stage donut turntable <b>ring,</b> <b>inner</b> and outer turntable rings moving simultaneously and in reverse of each other. The innovative stage design for Lady In The Dark was the first turntable usage on a Broadway stage. During World War II, he served as production designer and set designer for the U.S. Army Air Forces show Winged Victory.|$|E

40|$|In cancer {{patients}} who have undergone total surgical removal of the larynx, ideally voice rehabilitation should be performed using a shunt valve (placed in a fistula of the tracheo-esophageal wall) and a tracheostoma valve (TSV) to enable hands-free tracheo-esophageal speech. A tracheostoma is created by suturing the trachea into the lower anterior part of the neck, and a TSV is a device that can be placed at the stoma. Unfortunately, many patients are unable to use a TSV, mainly due to fixation difficulties. To improve the fixation of the TSV, tracheostoma tissue connector (TS-TC) prototypes have been designed. Prototype 1 consisted of a titanium <b>ring,</b> <b>inner</b> diameter 30 mm, with a circular polypropylene mesh glued to it with silicone adhesive. Four holes had been drilled into the ring for the insertion of sub- and percutaneous screws. Prototype 2 consisted of a silicone rubber <b>ring,</b> <b>inner</b> diameter 30 mm, combined with polypropylene mesh and four titanium inserts that functioned as a base plate for the insertion of sub- and percutaneous screws. In adult female goats a tracheostoma was created and the prototypes were implanted. After 6 weeks of subcutaneous implantation, percutaneous screws were inserted. After twelve weeks, the experiment was terminated and the implants with the surrounding tissues were processed and examined histologically. The clinical appearance during weeks 7 - 12 varied from very poor to relatively good. Histologically, the implants showed a uniform inflammatory response. We found that all the tissue surrounding the screws showed signs of epithelial down growth. It was concluded that the two-stage implantation procedure of our prototype TS-TCs in this animal model was unsuccessful. Additional research efforts are necessary to improve tissue immobilization and to devise reliable fixation systems for TSVs. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

In this study, the combustion process is manipulated passively using high‐strength, oxidation‐resistant porous inert materials (PIM) rings located within the reaction zone. Effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated from noise measurements acquired in a swirl‐stabilized combustor replicating typical features of a gas turbine combustor. Atmospheric pressure experiments using methane fuel were conducted for a fixed air flow rate and equivalence ratios of 0. 7 and 0. 8.

40|$|The role of {{the strain}} state in {{epitaxial}} (001) -oriented Cu/Ni(14 nm) /Cu rings is investigated {{using a combination of}} magnetic force microscopy and finite-element calculations. Rings with an external diameter of 3 and 2 μm and linewidth W larger than 400 nm show two different structures: domains with magnetization oriented in the radial direction exist at the inner and outer radius, separated by an area in the interior of the ring consisting of stripe domains with perpendicular magnetization. The former is the sole magnetic structure observed for W < 400 nm. Micromagnetic calculations on narrow-linewidth structures indicate that the radial domain-wall structure consists of elliptical Bloch lines with a shorter and longer length along the tangential and radial directions, respectively. Finite-element calculations show that the anisotropic relaxation of the in-plane strain is larger at the <b>ring</b> <b>inner</b> and outer edges than in the interior part of the ring and accounts for the reorientation of the magnetization direction.
