The verification benchmarks are: a Z-shaped cantilever, a twisted cantilever beam, a hemispherical shell, and Lee's frame {{at room temperature}} and at elevated temperature.

40|$|AbstractSteel-concrete {{composite}} structures are structures that combine {{the advantages of}} both used materials. An advantage of such structures is their high bending resistance, which has {{a positive effect on}} the overall weight of the structure. The disadvantage could otherwise be a slightly complicated design of individual elements. The paper describes an experiment with two simply supported 6 m long steel-concrete composite beams loaded in their thirds. The each beam is made of standard steel <b>rolled</b> <b>profile</b> and concrete slab concreted into the transversally oriented trapezoidal metal sheet with rib height equal to 135 mm, although European standard restricts the rib height only to 80 mm for common use. The research is focused mainly on deflection of beam, whether partial or full shear connected and also deals with the possibility of modelling these structures using the finite elements method. The shear resistance of stud in narrow and wide concrete rib is investigated too...|$|E

40|$|Cold {{roll forming}} is an {{incremental}} {{sheet metal forming}} process used to supply products to numerous industries such as automotive, architecture and construction, etc. In recent {{years there has been}} an increase in the demand by customers for high value products, through the forming of high strength materials, or complex profiles. Such demands increase the challenges faced by the tooling designer to bring a successful product through from design to manufacture, on time and within specification. Finite element (FE) simulations are increasingly applied in industry due to the desired advantage of reducing design iterations by allowing the designer to investigate the effects of parameter changes, without the risk of expensive tooling costs. Some successful validation of the numerical modelling of the cold roll forming process can be found in literature, in particular when analysing the strain distribution across the material or comparing the final <b>rolled</b> <b>profile</b> geometry. However, cold roll forming is a continuous process and no one has published work on the measurement of the profile on a pass to pass basis, in particular, the three dimensional geometry of the profile. Experimental trials were carried out to obtain a 3 D point cloud model of the top surface of a roll formed section. This investigation aimed to quantify how accurate FE simulation may be in relation to physical data...|$|E

Improving the uniformity of slab heating temperature, decreasing the bending force, and increasing the deformation of the last pass were also used to control the strip convex rib [73]. Lu, et al.

40|$|ABSTRACT: 3 D-Strip <b>Profile</b> <b>Rolling</b> should {{enable the}} {{production}} of blanks with a defined thickness profile in latitudinal and longitudinal direction. The production chain of 3 D-Strip <b>Profile</b> <b>Rolling</b> will combine Flexible Rolling in a first production step with Strip <b>Profile</b> <b>Rolling</b> in a second step. The control system to adjust the roll gap during 3 D-Strip <b>Profile</b> <b>Rolling</b> is currently under development. Nevertheless, some first experiments have shown the general feasibility to produce 3 D-profiled blanks. In 3 D-Strip <b>Profile</b> <b>Rolling</b> the material will strain harden differently on different locations. This results in {{a variation of the}} material properties of the strip. Lateral spread, elastic roll stand deformation and local deformation will be influenced by this variation. To investigate these influences on the complete production process, the complete production chain needs to be modelled in the future with aid of finite element simulations.
