5|$|In fact, {{building}} a society the Shaftesbury way {{is not a}} matter of imprisoning a presumed evil spirit of mankind. It is a matter of beauty and truth. Both Goethe and Voltaire were influenced by the 3rd Lord Shaftesbury. The former particularly <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> that we must cultivate our garden. We all know about large prize-winning marrows, but are not succulent baby courgettes more perfect? Small is beautiful too...|$|E
5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Morinobu Endo of CNRS {{observed}} hollow {{tubes of}} rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique. The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core. This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|E

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote that [...] "the episode sings when it reinvents the old and {{introduces}} the new." [...] However, Shearman and Pearson criticized the bringing back of Gibson Praise, noting that [...] "the return of Gibson Praise almost derails the episode altogether [...] he only manages to make an episode that seemed {{as if it was}} giving The X-Files a bold new beginning feel like it's about to offer more of the same old stooge." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a moderately positive review of the episode. He noted, [...] "In many ways, 'Within' <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> why we tune into The X-Files every week. However, it also <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> why the road ahead will be difficult. Fox Mulder may be gone, but he will never be forgotten. Or replaced." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN gave it an 8.5 rating, {{stating that}} it was [...] "Great" [...] and [...] "Overall, {{this was a great}} return to form for an appearance from Sideshow Bob. The vengeful character has been let down by recent episodes, but 'The Bob Next Door' has <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> what makes Bob so much fun." [...] Canning later named [...] "The Bob Next Door" [...] the best episode of the season tied with [...] "The Squirt and the Whale". TV Fanatic gave the episode four out of five and stated that they enjoyed the plot twists but thought the jokes were unfunny, remarking that [...] "the episode just didn't have the same humor as say, 'Cape Feare'." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Neill {{was highly}} {{regarded}} for his style and entertainment values.

He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe how good they were." [...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say [...] "the art of batting, he <b>reminded</b> <b>us,</b> was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant" [...] Wisden opined that [...] "A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty.

500|$|Discussing the album's {{reception}} in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote: [...] "Harrison's worldly critics, {{who had long}} found his sermons insufferable, responded like bulls to a red flag to Extra Texture, which contains a number of treatises on how reviewers always 'miss the point.'" [...] Even Harrison's loyal [...] "disciples", Schaffner continued, tended to view the album as [...] "plodding and aimless". Rolling Stones reviewer, Dave Marsh, highlighted [...] "You" [...] as a return to All Things Must Pass-style grandeur, and [...] "Can't Stop Thinking About You" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as [...] "the most effective nine minutes of music" [...] the artist had made since 1970. Generally, on an album that was [...] "sketchy at best", however, Marsh bemoaned the over-reliance on [...] "merely competent" [...] keyboards and Harrison's [...] "affectingly feeble voice", before concluding: [...] "Harrison {{is no longer a}} Beatle, as he has <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> more than we have asked. But if he learned nothing else from his experience in that organization, it ought to have been that a good guitar player isn't worth much without a band." ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{the press}} the horse {{received}} {{was viewed as}} giving a needed boost to the sport. Jockey and sports analyst Gary Stevens noted prior to the Belmont, [...] "I haven't heard Thoroughbred horse racing mentioned on CNN for a long time, and it was {{right at the top}} of the hour... He's brought us mainstream again for the first time in a lot of years." [...] Post-Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta. In December, when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award, Coburn said, [...] "We have always said Chrome is the 'People's Horse' and we are thrilled that the public feels the same way we do about him." [...] In announcing the Moment of the Year, Keith Chamblin of NTRA stated, [...] "the fans <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> that nothing trumps an awesome performance by a legendary horse." [...] When the horse won the 2016 Vox Populi award, Perry Martin said, [...] "I'm proud to witness the love and devotion of Chrome's fans. They've always seen what I've seen in him." ...|$|E
500|$|CNN's Henry Hanks {{wrote the}} episode [...] "is {{reason enough to}} bring this series back for another season," [...] and praised Noble's {{performance}} as Emmy-worthy; Hanks also loved the [...] "genius" [...] musical score written by composers Michael Giacchino and Chris Tilton. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode with an A-, explaining that, like the other reviewers, he loved the opening sequence with Peter on the lake, the newest mythology details, {{as well as how}} Walternate discovered the prime universe. Murray also loved the [...] "mood" [...] of the episode, but had minor problems with the plot, as he thought it was now harder to believe Olivia, Peter, and Walter were strangers {{to each other in the}} first season. James Poniewozik of Time magazine concluded that the episode [...] "was not the revelation that 'Peter' was, though a phase-shifting Olivia’s mistaking of Walternate for Walter was one of the series’ most mindblowing moments (and, again, a Lostian bit of disorienting sleight of hand). But it was again an effective detour in which Fringe <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> that time has parallels just as space does, and that the past is emotionally overlaid on the present just as its Over There is overlaid on our world." ...|$|E

500|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{completed}} recording House of Music in September 1996, and {{the album}} was then mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. House of Music was named after a record store in the band's native Oakland, which had closed several {{years prior to the}} album's release. In an interview for Billboard, Wiggins said, [...] "We title all our albums {{at the end of the}} project. We sat back and listened to everything, and it <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> of this mom-and-pop store around our way in Oakland." [...] "We grew up in a house of music," [...] Wiggins continued, remarking how their father was a blue guitarist and music had a unifying effect on people. According to Billboards Shawnee Smith, the album's title described a varied, complete work distinct from a contemporary music market oversaturated by [...] "retro-soul groups". The cover and booklet photos were taken by photographer William Claxton, who captured Tony! Toni! Toné! dressed in casual and formal, retro clothing. This departure from the more outré wardrobe of the band's past was interpreted by journalist Brandon Ousley as an effort to promote [...] "the elegance of 1960s-era Black America and legendary soul acts to a modern generation".|$|E
500|$|MTV Unplugged +3 {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Allmusic editor Shawn M.

Haney wrote [...] "Gradually, the power and esteem of these tales lift to new heights and remain at a peak with the breathtaking, moment-making performance of [...] "I'll Be There," [...] a charming song first cut by The Jackson 5." [...] Writing for the St. Petersburg Times, Sabrina Miller called Carey an [...] "artiste" [...] and wrote [...] "Programs like MTV Unplugged showcase talent like hers with an exclamation point." [...] Journalist and writer from The New York Times Jon Pareles branded the performance [...] "shrewd", and claimed Carey's cover of [...] "I'll Be There" [...] "set off fireworks". A writer for Entertainment Weekly called the show a [...] "vocal Tour de force", and wrote [...] "in addition to her breathtaking pipes, she has developed a commanding stage presence." [...] Additionally, they felt Carey's performance of [...] "I'll Be There" [...] was [...] "killer" [...] and concluded their review with [...] "In the process, this rare public appearance <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> there was a big-league performer inside that party dress." ...|$|E
500|$|Dana Stevens of Slate {{called it}} [...] "the herald of another blessed event: {{the arrival of}} a great {{director}} by the name of Alfonso Cuarón."

[...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film a [...] "superbly directed political thriller", raining accolades on the long chase scenes. [...] "Easily one of the best films of the year" [...] said Ethan Alter of Film Journal International, with scenes that [...] "dazzle you with their technical complexity and visual virtuosity." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent praised the accuracy of Cuarón's portrait of the United Kingdom, but he criticized some of the film's futuristic scenes as [...] "run-of-the-mill future fantasy." [...] Film Comment's critics' poll of the best films of 2006 ranked the film number 19 while the 2006 readers' poll ranked it number two. On their list of the best movies of 2006, The A.V. Club, the San Francisco Chronicle, Slate, and The Washington Post placed the film at number one. Entertainment Weekly ranked the film seventh on its end-of-the-decade, top ten list, saying, [...] "Alfonso Cuarón's dystopian 2006 film <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> that adrenaline-juicing action sequences can work best when the future looks just as grimy as today." ...|$|E

500|$|At age twenty, Del Rey {{signed a}} USD$10,000 {{recording}} contract {{and moved to}} a trailer park in New Jersey. The album that she recorded was later shelved, catalyzing her to pivot her focus. Instead, she began work in community service, and for the next five years, worked at homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitation centers. She was quoted in an interview as saying, [...] "The only passionate people I met in New York, were social workers." [...] A few years later, Del Rey signed to 5 Point Records, an independent record label owned by David Kahne. With the label, she released the three-track EP, Kill Kill, in October 2008 and a full-length studio album Lana Del Ray in 2010. After hearing Del Rey's demo, Kahne contacted her; she obliged, knowing his reputation as a producer and his wish to produce music other than pop. Del Rey also explained why she then changed her stage name from Lizzy Grant to Lana Del Rey: [...] "I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba – Lana Del Rey <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> of the glamour of the seaside.

500|$|Hilary Hughes from USA Today {{also noticed}} Gaga's vocal range, {{especially}} during the acoustic interpretation of [...] "Dope" [...] and [...] "Just Dance".

[...] Hardeep Phull from New York Post appreciated the stage setup and the homage to old New York industrial setting and gave positive feedback for Gaga's choice to be an entertainer with the performances of [...] "You and I", [...] "Just Dance", and [...] "Applause". Jordan Runtagh from VH1 applauded Gaga's camaraderie with her fans, also noting that [...] "the abundance of movie cameras <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> that this was a special moment, one that will go down in history. And not just because these are the last performances at this storied venue. It's something more." [...] Runtagh believed that the performances solidified Gaga as a respectable entertainer and would generate further interest for the upcoming [...] tour. Amanda Holpuch from The Guardian complimented Gaga's vocals and her outfits, but felt that the show lacked [...] "something outrageous" [...] from the singer. She added that the most surprising incident of the night was when Gaga climbed a ladder to reach the mezzanine floors and sing from there.|$|E
