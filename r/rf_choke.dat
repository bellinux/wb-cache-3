50|$|For UHF TV a {{wide range}} of good designs exist, these include a ferrite <b>RF</b> <b>choke</b> on the {{downlead}} and some networks of passive components.|$|E
50|$|A modern form of choke {{used for}} {{eliminating}} digital RF noise from lines is the ferrite bead, a cylindrical or torus-shaped core of ferrite slipped over a wire. These are often seen on computer cables. A typical <b>RF</b> <b>choke</b> value could be 2 millihenries.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Homemade 1:1 balun using a {{toroidal}} {{core and}} coaxial cable. This simple <b>RF</b> <b>choke</b> {{works as a}} balun by preventing signals passing along {{the outside of the}} braid. Such a device can be used to cure television interference by acting as a braid-breaker.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of <b>RF</b> <b>chokes</b> can often reduce greatly the RF current flowing through a TV set and hence improve the immunity of the installation.|$|R
5000|$|Decoupling or {{filtering}} at critical points such as cable entries and high-speed switches, using <b>RF</b> <b>chokes</b> and/or RC elements. A {{line filter}} implements these measures between a device and a line.|$|R
50|$|The grid leak {{detector}} circuit output, often {{taken from the}} plate of the detector tube, may require additional filtering to remove remnants of the carrier portion of the received signal. <b>RF</b> <b>chokes</b> and/or capacitors may be employed.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>RF</b> <b>choke</b> {{can be used}} {{in place}} of a balun. If a coil is made using coaxial cable near to the feed point of a {{balanced}} antenna, then the RF current that flows on the outer surface of the coaxial cable can be attenuated. One way of doing this would be to pass the cable through a ferrite toroid.(Straw 2005, 2526) ...|$|E
50|$|RF chokes are a well used {{method for}} {{filtering}} many leads on communication equipment. In {{common with the}} braid breaker the intention is to suppress common mode signals. One popular method of making an <b>RF</b> <b>choke</b> {{is to use a}} large ferrite bead where the cable passes through the hole. Such chokes can often be seen on the power connection leads of laptops and on the video signal leads of computer monitors.|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} R1 {{would depend on}} the JFET or triode chosen, and perhaps be a 200 kilohm preset, {{adjusted}} to give lowest distortion in the output signal. The time constant of C2 with R1 would be chosen to fall somewhere between the highest audio (modulation) frequency but well below the lowest carrier (modulated) frequency encountered. The RF filter in the supply line, C4 and the RFC (<b>RF</b> <b>Choke),</b> is less essential than in the original plate detector, but can reduce inter-stage RF interference and instability.|$|E

50|$|I still {{remember}} that during {{my visit to}} Alwaye Hamfest in 92, I saw at the hombrew exhibits many hams practically winding <b>RF</b> <b>chokes,</b> modulation transformers, etc., etching BFO & VFO pcbs, wiring them on the spot and many needy hams benefited by sharing this kind of homebrewing at a common place, while at the Salem Hamfest in 93 there was a complete hombrew workshop to assemble a HF Tx/Rx being conducted.|$|R
5000|$|In operation, the coherer is {{included}} in two separate electrical circuits. One is the antenna-ground circuit shown in the untuned receiver circuit diagram below. The other is the battery-sounder relay circuit including battery B1 and relay R in the diagram. A radio signal from the antenna-ground circuit [...] "turns on" [...] the coherer, enabling current flow in the battery-sounder circuit, activating the sounder, S. The coils, L, act as <b>RF</b> <b>chokes</b> to prevent the RF signal power from leaking away through the relay circuit.|$|R
50|$|Passive {{measurement}} of an electrically small antenna requires a quarter-wavelength <b>RF</b> <b>choke</b> or ferrite bead {{to be added}} to the end of the feeding coaxial cable to limit or prevent the current from flowing onto the surface of the cable. Current flowing on the exterior of the feeding cable increases the electrical size and radiation aperture of the antenna, resulting in erroneous measurement result. The quarter-wavelength choke are narrow-band and the ferrite beads are lossy at higher frequency greater than 1 GHz. These techniques are not without problems; the quarter-wavelength choke technique allows currents to travel up to 0.25 wavelengths from the antenna and increases the effective size, whereas the lossy choke (e.g. ferrite bead) technique introduces losses that should be considered.|$|E

50|$|RF MEMS {{components}} are biased electrostatically using a bipolar NRZ drive voltage, {{as shown in}} Fig. 2, {{in order to avoid}} dielectric charging and to increase the lifetime of the device. Dielectric charges exert a permanent electrostatic force on the beam. The use of a bipolar NRZ drive voltage instead of a DC drive voltage avoids dielectric charging whereas the electrostatic force exerted on the beam is maintained, because the electrostatic force varies quadratically with the DC drive voltage. Electrostatic biasing implies no current flow, allowing high-resistivity bias lines to be used instead of <b>RF</b> <b>chokes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Power line {{communication}} (PLC) {{technology is}} at {{a tipping point}} and may become ubiquitous as a home networking technology. However, there are concerns regarding RF interference between PLC networks and other radio operators. It is imperative that the interference dynamics of PLC systems be fully understood in advance of any large-scale roll-out. In this work, we experiment with two interference scenarios: notch-infilling due to non-linear mixing and mitigation of radiated emissions using <b>RF</b> <b>chokes.</b> In our controlled test bed environment, we measure RF emissions from the power line devices in the 1 MHz to 30 MHz range. Through the results and simulation, we demonstrate {{that the effect of}} non-linear devices may be less of a concern than initially thought, and that simple methods can be employed to control local RF interference...|$|R
40|$|RF window {{designs of}} the Pillbox type {{were capable of}} {{transmitting}} peak rf power up to about 10 MW. The power levels now being produced by advanced high frequency power sources is beyond the level that can safely be transmitted through a single rf window of conventional design. New approaches are required to keep the rf electric fields at a manageable level {{in the vicinity of}} the rf window. This paper describes some of the recent rf window designs at SLAC and elsewhere and some of the test results. Windows that operate in larger waveguide in higher order modes such as TE 01 and in a mix of modes such as TE 11, TM 11 and TE 12 are described. <b>RF</b> <b>chokes</b> and corona shields, circular polarization and forced electric field reduction are also discussed. ...|$|R

To realize a wide IF bandwidth, an SIS mixer must be designed with low IF capacitance and inductance. This paper describes an SIS mixer in which the RF circuit is effectively decoupled from the IF circuit, and a compact high-impedance <b>RF</b> <b>choke</b> circuit is used, resulting in low output capacitance and inductance...|$|E

50|$|Other {{equipment}} aboard {{may also}} {{interfere with the}} reception of low-power SSB or digital signals. Usual candidates include anything with a badly suppressed electric motor, such as a fridge, fans, or an electronic self-steering system, {{as well as many}} depth sounders and some radar systems. Better suppression of DC motors may be retrofitted and <b>RF</b> <b>chokes</b> can be made by winding some turns of the power and transducer leads through a suitable ferrite bead. Failing this, {{it may be necessary to}} shut off these items during important radio reception times. One radio receiver that may be overlooked is the Navtex, if fitted. By tuning the HF rig down to its relevant frequencies (e.g. 518 kHz) it may be possible to identify sources of interference that are limiting its range, and switch them off or improve their EMC characteristics. Once this is done and these frequencies are quiet, far from land it is surprising what range Navtex can achieve, especially at night.|$|R
40|$|Typically, magnetically tunable antennas utilize large {{external}} magnets or coils {{to provide}} the magneto-static bias. In this work, we present a novel concept of combining the antenna and the bias coil in one structure. A helical antenna has been optimized to act as the bias coil in a ten layer ferrite LTCC package, thus performing two functions. This not only reduces the overall size of the system by {{getting rid of the}} external bias source but also eliminates demagnetization effect (fields lost at air-to-substrate interface), which reduces the required magneto-static field strength and makes the design efficient. <b>RF</b> <b>choking</b> inductor and DC blocking capacitor have been monolithically integrated as package elements to allow the magnetostatic and microwave excitation at the same time. The design has been optimized for its low frequency and high frequency performance in two different simulators. A measured tuning range of 10 % is achieved at a center frequency of 13 GHz.

40|$|A 10 GHz hybrid YBCO/GaAs {{microwave}} oscillator proximity {{coupled to}} a circular microstrip antenna has been designed, fabricated, and characterized. The oscillator was a reflection mode type using a GaAs MESFET as the active element. The feedline, transmission lines, <b>RF</b> <b>chokes,</b> and bias lines were all fabricated from YBCO superconducting thin films on a 1 cm x 1 cm lanthanum aluminate substrate. The output feedline of the oscillator was wire bonded to a superconducting feedline {{on a second}} 1 cm x 1 cm lanthanum aluminate substrate, which was in turn proximity coupled to a circular microstrip patch antenna.

40|$|A {{rigorous}} and novel design procedure is constituted for an ultra-wideband (UWB) low noise amplifier (LNA) by exploiting the 3 D electromagnetic simulator based support vector regression machine (SVRM) microstrip line model. First of all, {{in order to}} design input and output matching circuits (IMC-OMC), source ZS and load ZL 					 termination impedance of matching circuit, which are necessary to obtain required input VSWR (Vireq), noise (Freq), and gain (GTreq), are determined using performance characterisation of employed transistor, NE 3512 S 02, between 3 and 8 [*]GHz frequencies.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 45). The {{separation of}} analog and digital devices {{using the same}} power source is critical for proper circuit operation. At frequencies above 1 GHz a conventional approach {{such as the use}} of <b>RF</b> <b>chokes</b> do not work due to the parasitic effects of the components. Electromagnetic Band-Gap (EBG) structures have been proposed in the literature to suppress noise coupled through a shared power plane. The power filtering created using these EBG structures will create noise isolation between these two types of devices so the operation of each device will not hinder one another. However, design equations for EBG structures to date, are not accurate and do not cover all unit cell types. In this thesis, novel microwave filters are investigated for power filtering and compared with EBG structures for power plane isolation between the analog and digital components. A key research topic is a new design approach, called the virtual ground fence. A virtual ground fence is based on simple quarter-wavelength micro-strip filters. Hardware measurements on passive test structures have confirmed 20 dB increase in isolation level at the operating frequency. An active test structure based on a low-noise amplifier (LNA) has confirmed that the noise figure of the LNA was maintained approximately constant in the presence of digital noise on a shared power distribution networ...|$|R

40|$|Series-fed {{coplanar}} waveguide embedding circuits {{are being developed}} for terahertz mixers using, in particular, submicron-sized superconducting devices, such as hot electron bolometers as the nonlinear element. Although these mixers show promising performance, they usually also show a considerable downward shift in the center frequency, when compared with simulations obtained by using simplified models.

To facilitate low-voltage operation with 0. 8 - 1. 2 -V supply, the mixer employs a folded Gilbert cell topology with PMOS devices for LO switches and utilizes on-chip broadband <b>RF</b> <b>chokes</b> for biasing. The folded toplogy allows the transconductance and LO stages to have different bias current. By setting the bias current in the PMOS switches near zero, the mixer DC offset due to device mismatch is greatly reduced. The effect of supply voltage on the mixer performance is studied. The mixer consumes 2. 5 and 5. 8 mW from a 0. 8 -V and 1. 2 -V supply, respectively. Under a 1. 2 -V supply, the mixer achieves a voltage conversion gain (CG) of 5. 3 - 8. 2 dB, a single-sideband noise figure (NF) of 9. 6 - 13. 5 dB, a second-order intermodualtion intercept point (IIP 2) of 37. 3 - 43. 4 dBm, and a third-order intermodualtion intercept point (HP 3) of- 3. 2 to - 0. 3 dBm between 3 - 7 GHz.
