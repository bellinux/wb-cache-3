5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 15:25, {{and without}} warning, {{a series of}} violent explosions tore through the <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> of the ship. She capsized five minutes later. Some thought {{that she had been}} torpedoed by a German U-boat or detonated a submarine-laid mine, but {{examination}} of the wreckage revealed that the explosions were internal. The divers sent to investigate the ship reported that the explosions began in either the rear 9.2-inch shellroom or the 3-pounder and small arms magazine. The Admiralty court-martial into the causes of her loss concluded that it was caused by an internal ammunition explosion, possibly due to faulty cordite. The Admiralty issued a revised list of the dead and missing that totaled 390 in January 1916, but did not list the women and children on board that day. Losses are listed from 390 to 421.|$|E

5000|$|A {{lodgement}} is an enclave {{taken by}} and defended {{by force of}} arms against determined opposition made by increasing {{the size of a}} bridgehead, beachhead or airhead into a substantial defended area, the <b>rear</b> <b>parts</b> of whichat the least are out of direct line of fire.|$|R
5|$|The basic {{arthropod}} {{central nervous}} system consists {{of a pair of}} nerve cords running below the gut, with paired ganglia as local control centers in all segments; a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia for the head segments ahead of and behind the mouth, so that the esophagus is encircled by this conglomeration of ganglia. Except for the primitive Mesothelae, of which the Liphistiidae are the sole surviving family, spiders have the much more centralized nervous system that is typical of arachnids: all the ganglia of all segments behind the esophagus are fused, so that the cephalothorax is largely filled with nervous tissue and there are no ganglia in the abdomen; in the Mesothelae, the ganglia of the abdomen and the <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> of the cephalothorax remain unfused.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a notable}} but {{variable}} trend towards fusion of other ganglia into the brain. The brains of horseshoe crabs {{include all the}} ganglia of the prosoma plus those {{of the first two}} opisthosomal segments, while the other opisthosomal segments retain separate pairs of ganglia. In most living arachnids, except scorpions if they are true arachnids, all the ganglia, including those that would normally be in the opisthosoma, are fused into a single mass in the prosoma and there are no ganglia in the opisthosoma. However, in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as the most primitive living spiders, the ganglia of the opisthosoma and the <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> of the prosoma remain unfused, and in scorpions the ganglia of the cephalothorax are fused but the abdomen retains separate pairs of ganglia.|$|E
50|$|The A9, {{designed}} by Bertone, {{was the last}} prototype of Anadol. It was a 4-door sedan with a very modern design for the early 1980s. The <b>rear</b> <b>parts</b> of the car resembled the future Peugeot 405, while the overall form resembled the Volvo sedans of the mid-1980s.|$|R
50|$|The crew {{compartment}} occupies {{the central and}} <b>rear</b> <b>parts</b> of the hull and is used for accommodating the crew, installing the assemblies required for operation of the crew, and placing various equipment, ammunition, and SPTA. The {{crew compartment}} is divided into the driving compartment, fighting compartment, and troop compartment.|$|R
50|$|The south facade is {{topped by}} a pediment, carved with {{the arms of the}} Setons of Touch. The <b>rear</b> <b>parts</b> of the {{building}} date to the 16th and 17th centuries, including the tower house which stands on the eastern side. The 18th-century stable block has since been converted and leased as offices.|$|R
5|$|With a few exceptions, adult {{amphibians}} are predators, {{feeding on}} virtually anything that moves {{that they can}} swallow. The diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders. The sirens (Siren spp.) often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a Brazilian tree frog (Xenohyla truncata) includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet. The Mexican burrowing toad (Rhinophrynus dorsalis) has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites. It projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> first, their tongues being hinged at the front.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Only the <b>rear</b> <b>part</b> of {{the skull}} is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout {{equipped}} with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the external naris (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half {{of the skull}}, diagonally above the eye socket, which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The infratemporal fenestra, located below the eye socket, was long and narrow. Behind the eye socket was the supratemporal fenestra, which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been located {{in front of the}} eye socket, although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull, the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with Dicraeosaurus but absent in other sauropods included the fused frontal bones and the notably long basipterygoid processes, bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate.|$|E
25|$|The wake {{produced}} is {{very small}} and drag {{is dominated by the}} friction component. Therefore, such a body (here an airfoil) is described as streamlined, whereas for bodies with fluid flow at high angles of attack, boundary layer separation takes place. This mainly occurs due to adverse pressure gradients at the top and <b>rear</b> <b>parts</b> of an airfoil.|$|R
5000|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{was that}} the agricultural land of a single farmer was awkwardly spread out, often over two or more linear miles, necessitating a long travel time to reach <b>rear</b> <b>parts</b> of the lot.

5|$|Parasites {{can also}} be {{aggressive}} mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks, coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a songbird. In this way, it can {{bridge the gap between}} hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like the ripe fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (<b>rear</b> <b>part)</b> is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} doing vortex {{generator}} model with new high to overcome unstable airflow problem in <b>rear</b> car <b>parts.</b> So, with addition vortex generator on <b>rear</b> <b>parts</b> of proton iswara type Hybrid Electrical Vehicle (HEY) will decrease instability air movement on <b>rear</b> car <b>parts.</b> Beside that, addition of vortex generator in rear roof of car is to decrease high pressure and zero velocity area. It is because to make stability of car. Design of vortex generator is done based on shape Proton Iswara vortex generator {{but only with}} different high. The vortex generator high is determined based on this study. In this study, 3 velocities (90, 100 and 110 km/h) will analyze using cosmosfioworks. Each velocity of car model will analyze with and without vortex generator. Based on this study, addition of vortex generator on rear car able to decrease total area of high pressure and low or zero velocity. This can be seen with decreasing of airflow in the rear car. It is because the vortex generator can be reduce the turbulent boundary layer flow...|$|R

50|$|Raft {{construction}} differs {{depending on}} the watercourse. Rocky and windy rivers saw rafts of simple, yet sometimes smart, construction. For example, the front parts of the logs were joined together by wooden bars, while the <b>rear</b> <b>parts</b> were loosely roped together. The resulting slack allowed for easy adaptation for narrow and windy waterbeds. Wide and quiet rivers, like the Mississippi River, allowed huge rafts to travel in caravans and even be chained into strings.|$|R
