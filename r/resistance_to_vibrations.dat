While a number of well-regarded simulation environments exist for HDDs, the same is not yet true for SSDs. This is due to SSDs having been in the storage market for relatively less time as well as the lack of information (hardware configuration and software methods) about state-of-the-art SSDs that is publicly available. We describe the design and implementation of FlashSim, a simulator aimed at filling this void in performance evaluation of emerging storage systems that employ SSDs. FlashSim is an event-driven simulator that follows the objected-oriented programming paradigm for modularity. We have validated the performance of FlashSim against a number of commercial SSDs for behavioral similarity. We have also used FlashSim to compare the performance of SSD devices employing different Flash Translation Layer (FTL) schemes, and analyzed the energy consumption of different FTL schemes in the SSD. FlashSim has been written to be inter-operable with the well-regarded DiskSim simulator, thus enabling the simulation of a variety of “hybrid ” storage systems employing combinations of SSDs and HDDs. Given the current interest in such hybrid systems as opposed to systems with SSDs replacing HDDs (due to higher price), we believe this to be an especially useful feature of FlashSim. We have made FlashSim freely available for download with the hope that it would be of use to researchers exploring the design of SSD-based systems. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{major factors}} putting {{limitation}} to high productivity and good product surface quality is machining vibration. A lot {{of scientific research}} has been concentrated controlling the vibration while machining. There is a good sum of research going in department of production engineering at KTH to find out {{ways to reduce the}} machining vibration and enhancing the productivity but so far, they have been concentrated only on use of conventional steel as there of cutting tool. This they have tried by introducing damping in the conventional steel tooling system or by coating the tool with different composition of materials to improve the tool resistances to vibration. In this paper, the research has been concentrated to finding out an alternative material to conventional steel, which is more resistance to machining vibration. The theory in the paper is mainly concentrated to give the basic understanding about frequency response function, forced vibration, and stability lobe diagram (SLD) and their applications. Through experimental modal analysis (EMA), machining tests and surface roughness of the machined surface (toolox 33 plates), SSAB toolox 44 steel cutting tool is compared against its counterpart the conventional steel (H 13). The natural frequencies and damping factor are obtained for both free hanging and attached to machine condition. Afterwards, a stability lobe diagram is being plotted using the EMA data. Machining tests are being conducted according to SLD to their limits to determine and verify the material capability until tools starts showing vibrations. In the end, the results is being compared by analyzing the sound emitted during the machining process and determining the surface roughness of the machined surface both visually and by white light interferometry. Then comparing the toolox 44 with conventional steel (H 13), to find out which one is more <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>vibrations...</b>|$|E

Strict performance requirements such as effective acoustic separation of inter-tenancy floors, thermal mass, fire resistance, limitation of deflection, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>vibrations</b> and effective diaphragm action are very hard to comply with if only timber is used. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the preliminary and some ongoing research in the short- and long-term carried out mainly at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, for the realisation of a semi-prefabricated laminated veneer lumber (LVL) -concrete composite floor system in both the local and Australasian market. The paper discusses a novel semi-prefabricated LVLconcrete composite system where panels made from LVL joists and plywood flooring are prefabricated off-site. Once the panels are lifted onto the supports and connected side-by-side, a concrete topping is cast-in-situ so as to form a continuous slab connecting all the panels. Composite action between the concrete topping and the panels is achieved using different types of connectors, such as various forms of notches cut from the LVL joists and reinforced with coach screws or toothed metal plates pressed in the LVL joists. After pointing out the advantages of the proposed system over traditional only-timber and only-concrete floor solutions, the paper describes push-out tests in the short-term on connections used in the LVL-concrete composite. Tests to failure of small LVL-concrete composite blocks (push-out tests) with different types and shapes of connection systems were performed at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia. The results are parametrically evaluated and discussed in detail. The failure mechanism of the notched connection is highlighted together with the strength and stiffness values for each tested connection system. Subsequently, the four best connection systems were identified and used in beam specimens of 8 - 10 m in span.
