5|$|In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked an {{election}} controversy when it {{drew attention to}} Warren's Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directory entries from 1986 to 1995, which listed her as a minority professor. According to the AALS, the directory was compiled by information supplied by law school deans, based on questionnaires filled out by individual teachers. Warren stated that she had self-identified as having Native American ancestry {{in order to meet}} others with a similar background. Harvard Law School had listed her as a minority professor in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren said that she was unaware of this until she <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in a newspaper during the 2012 election.|$|E
25|$|Emma Smith {{claimed that}} {{the very first time}} she ever became aware of a {{polygamy}} revelation being attributed to Joseph Smith was when she <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in 1853 in Orson Pratt's booklet The Seer. Many of the Latter Day Saints who joined the RLDS Church in the midwestern United States had broken with Brigham Young and/or James Strang because of opposition to polygamy. Emma's continuing public denial of the practice seemed to lend strength to their cause, and opposition to polygamy became a tenet of the RLDS Church. Over the years, many RLDS Church historians attempted to prove that the practice had originated with Brigham Young.|$|E

25|$|Barbara Stanwyck asked Jack L. Warner to buy {{the rights}} to the book for her.

Rand agreed, on the condition that not a single word of her dialogue be changed. The Fountainhead went into production, with Mervyn LeRoy hired to direct, but the production was delayed. LeRoy said that the delay {{was the result of the}} influence of the War Production Board, spurred by Rand's anti-Russian politics. Stanwyck was not told of the decision to cast Neal in the role she coveted until she <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in the Hollywood trade papers. This led to her leaving Warner Bros.|$|E

Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E

Emma campaigned publicly against polygamy, and was the main signatory of a petition in 1842, with a thousand female signatures, denying that Smith was connected with polygamy. As president of the Ladies' Relief Society, Emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy, and denying her husband as its creator or participant. Even on her deathbed, Emma denied Joseph's involvement with polygamy, stating, [...] "No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband's death, that I have now, or ever had any knowledge of...

[...] He {{was chairman of the}} Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of Yorkshire Cricket Club, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in The New York Times: [...] "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas." [...] Pinter approved of the [...] "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression." [...] After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running. [...] The BBC Radio 4 memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.|$|E

Harvard Law School had publicized her minority status in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren {{said that she was}} unaware of this until she <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in a newspaper during the 2012 election.

Former colleagues and supervisors at universities where she had worked stated that Warren's ancestry played no role in her hiring. [...] Warren responded to the allegations, saying that she had self-identified as a minority in the directories in order to meet others with similar tribal roots. Her brothers defended her, stating that they [...] "grew up listening to our mother and grandmother and other relatives talk about our family's Cherokee and Delaware heritage". In her 2014 autobiography, Warren described the allegations as untrue and hurtful. The New England Historic Genealogical Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as part Cherokee, but could not find the primary document and found no proof of her descent. The Oklahoma Historical Society said that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration.|$|E
