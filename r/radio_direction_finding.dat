5|$|MacArthur began organising {{large scale}} {{intelligence}} services {{shortly after his}} arrival in Australia. On 15 April 1942, the joint Australian-US Central Bureau signals intelligence organisation was established at Melbourne. Central Bureau's headquarters moved to Brisbane in July 1942 and Manila in May 1945. Australians made up half the strength of Central Bureau, which was expanded to over 4,000personnel by 1945. The Australian Army and RAAF also provided most of the Allied radio interception capability in the SWPA, {{and the number of}} Australian radio interception units was greatly expanded between 1942 and 1945. Central Bureau broke a number of Japanese codes and the intelligence gained from these decryptions and <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> greatly assisted Allied forces in the SWPA.|$|E
5|$|Frances Elizabeth Somerville Alexander (née Caldwell; 13 December 1908 – 15 October 1958) was a British geologist, academic, and physicist, whose wartime {{work with}} radar and radio led to early {{developments}} in radio astronomy. Alexander earned her PhD from Newnham College, Cambridge, {{and worked in}} <b>Radio</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finding</b> at Singapore Naval Base from 1938 to 1941. In January 1941, unable to return to Singapore from New Zealand, she became Head of Operations Research in New Zealand's Radio Development Lab, Wellington. In 1945, Alexander correctly interpreted that anomalous radar signals picked up on Norfolk Island were caused by the sun. This interpretation became pioneering {{work in the field}} of radio astronomy, making her one of the first women scientists to work in that field, albeit briefly.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of <b>radio,</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E

25|$|In February 1941, Captain Abe Sinkov and Lieutenant Leo Rosen of the US Army, and US Naval Lieutenants Robert Weeks and Prescott Currier, {{arrived at}} Bletchley Park bringing, amongst other things, {{a replica of}} the 'Purple' cipher machine for the Bletchley Park's Japanese section in Hut 7.

25|$|This technique, {{known as}} <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (RDF), is useful but only {{moderately}} accurate.

25|$|Through {{a series}} of misunderstandings or errors (the details of which are still controversial), the final {{approach}} to Howland Island using radio navigation was not successful. Fred Noonan had earlier written about problems affecting the accuracy of <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> in navigation. Another cited cause of possible confusion was that the Itasca and Earhart planned their communication schedule using time systems set a half-hour apart, with Earhart using Greenwich Civil Time (GCT) and the Itasca under a Naval time zone designation system.|$|E
25|$|A fleet {{formed in}} several short columns could change its heading faster than one formed {{in a single}} long column. Since most command signals were made with flags or signal lamps between ships, the {{flagship}} was usually placed {{at the head of}} the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation. Wireless telegraphy was in use, though security (<b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding),</b> encryption, and the limitation of the radio sets made their extensive use more problematic. Command and control of such huge fleets remained difficult.|$|E
25|$|The CNO {{orders of}} September 4 {{directed}} the patrols {{to report the}} movements of ships of warring nations in cipher.

5000|$|Wymondham {{played a}} part in the Second World War that is very poorly documented. It was home to one of MI6's <b>Radio</b> Security Service <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> stations; the type at Wymondham was a [...] "Spaced Loop" [...] design newly {{developed}} by the National Physical Laboratory. Unfortunately, this was soon found to be unsatisfactory and was converted to the more traditional Adcock type. The station at Wymondham was located at latitude=52.583333, longitude=1.121667, just north of Tuttles Lane and east of Melton Road. Based on information from one of the wartime operators it transpires that another spaced loop station was later installed alongside the first in 1944 after the Normandy invasion. This may have been due to increased interest in transmissions from western Europe where the shorter distance made the spaced loop more reliable.|$|R
500|$|The first combat-capable Block 3.0 {{aircraft}} first flew in 2001. Increment 2, {{the first}} F-22 upgrade program, was implemented in 2005 and enables the aircraft to employ Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). Increment 3.1 provides improved ground-attack capability through {{synthetic aperture radar}} mapping and <b>radio</b> emitter <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> electronic attack and the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB); testing began in 2009 and the first upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2012. Increment 3.2 is a two-part upgrade process; 3.2A focuses on electronic warfare, communications and identification, while 3.2B will allow the F-22 to fully exploit the AIM-9X and AIM-120D missiles. The subsequent Increment 3.3 may include the adoption of an open avionics platform and air traffic control updates. Upgrades due in 2015 will allow the F-22 to employ the AIM-9X and have full Link 16 reception and transmission capability. The F-22 fleet is planned to have 36 Block 20 training and 149 Block 30/35 combat aircraft by 2016. The Increment 3.2B upgrade planned for 2018 will include a new stores management system to show the correct symbols for the AIM-9X Sidewinder and AIM-120D AMRAAM with improved control of them. [...] In 2017, the USAF is defining requirements for next-generation sensors for the F-22, which involves designing new hardware and antennas. Subsequent upgrades are also focusing on an open avionics platform to enable faster future upgrades.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{smart antenna}} systems, The {{localization}} {{and direction of}} desired source(s) must be known. In this paper, we introduce a method called “DMSAE ” (<b>Direction</b> <b>finding</b> of Multiple Sources by Alternating Eliminations) to find the <b>radio</b> <b>directions</b> of signals impinging on an arbitrary antenna array {{and the number of}} the signals. This method which is based on the Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) algorithm, can not only detect the direction and the number of sources, simultaneously, but also has better resolution ability compared to the other conventional <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> algorithms. This method can also detect very weak sources when other powerful sources exist in the environment. In this method an iterative approach is employed for the detection and elimination of all sources by a null steering algorithm. I...|$|R
25|$|Amateur {{radio and}} some {{cellular}} or PCS wireless systems use direction finding or triangulation of transmitter signals radiated by the mobile. This {{is sometimes called}} <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> or RDF. The simplest forms of these systems calculate the bearing from two fixed sites to the mobile. This creates a triangle with endpoints at the two fixed points and the mobile. Trigonometry tells you roughly where the mobile transmitter is located. In wireless telephone systems, the phones transmit continually when off-hook, making continual tracking and the collection of many location samples possible. This is one type of location system required by Federal Communications Commission Rules for wireless Enhanced 911.|$|E
25|$|On 18 July Carey flew several missions. He was {{vectored}} by ground-control {{onto the}} intruder by Chain Home <b>Radio</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finding</b> (RDF) facilities. The RDF sent {{a report to}} the main operations room of Fighter Command Headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory. After determining it was hostile, they ordered the operations room, staffed by Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) personnel, to plot the course allowing the Fighter Controller at Group Headquarters to guide RAF fighters to the approximate location of the enemy. On this occasion the interception went well until the German pilot was able to escape into a large layer of cloud and flee to France.|$|E
25|$|As {{the liner}} steamed across the ocean, the British Admiralty had been {{tracking}} {{the movements of}} , commanded by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger, through wireless intercepts and <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding.</b> The submarine left Borkum on 30 April, heading north west across the North Sea. On 2 May she had reached Peterhead and proceeded around the north of Scotland and Ireland, and then along the western and southern coasts of Ireland, to enter the Irish Sea from the south. Although the submarine's departure, destination, and expected arrival time were known to Room 40 in the Admiralty, {{the activities of the}} decoding department were considered so secret that they were unknown even to the normal intelligence division which tracked enemy ships or to the trade division responsible for warning merchant vessels. Only the very highest officers in the admiralty saw the information and passed on warnings only when they felt it essential.|$|E
50|$|The Bellini-Tosi {{direction}} finder was {{a type of}} <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> finder that was widely used from World War I to World War II. It used the signals from two crossed antennas, or four individual antennas simulating two crossed ones, to re-create the radio signal in a small area between two loops of wire. The operator could then measure the angle to the target radio source by performing <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> within this small area. The advantage to the Bellini-Tosi system is that the antennas do not move, allowing them to be built at any required size.|$|R

The role of high frequency directional radio stations was to assist fighter pilots to get their bearings during airborne patrols. The station was linked by telephone to RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne and was responsible for keeping the RAAF Command informed of all developments. The Operations Centre was also responsible for activating air raid warnings. It also provided position plots for courier and civil aircraft operating between Brisbane and New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|High-frequency <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> usually {{known by}} its {{abbreviation}} HF/DF or nickname huff-duff, is the common name for a type of <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> finder (RDF) introduced in World War II. High frequency (HF) refers to a radio band that can efficiently communicate over long distances; for example, between U-boats and their land-based headquarters. HF/DF was primarily used to catch enemy radios while they transmitted, although it was also used to locate friendly aircraft as a navigation aid. The basic technique remains in use to this day {{as one of the}} fundamental disciplines of signals intelligence, although typically incorporated into a larger suite of radio systems and radars instead of being a stand-alone system.|$|R
25|$|To {{prevent their}} camp being located or {{compromised}} by German <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> equipment or informers, Tonkin regularly moved its location. The location of new camps {{had to be}} close to water and a drop zone for parachute supply. The camp located near to Verrières was near to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson and had an adequate water supply. The SAS Squadron had been at Verrières between 25 June and 1 July. The local population had also become aware of the camp and Tonkin was warned by Maingard that if the locals knew, informers would soon tell the Germans. Tonkin ordered the squadron to move to a new camp just south in the Bois des Cartes. This new camp was also close to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson where they were expecting a supply drop over the night of 3/4 July. On their arrival at the new camp at Bois des Cartes, the water supply from the well failed and due to this Tonkin decided to return to Verrières until a more suitable camp site could be found.|$|E
25|$|Requiring {{the task}} force commander's {{permission}} to send out the relief force and to accompany it, Townsend telephoned Jackson. Concerned {{for the safety of}} the entire force, Jackson was initially reluctant to authorise its dispatch should it weaken the position at Nui Dat. Although he was unsure of the size of the Viet Cong facing D Company, from Smith's reports it appeared to be at least a regular battalion. Intelligence suggested it was likely from the 275th Regiment, although the location of its remaining two battalions were unknown, as was that of D445 Battalion. The whereabouts of the 274th Regiment was equally unclear. While <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> suggested it may have been near Phuoc Tuy's northern border, three weeks earlier it had been reported close to the western side of the Australian TAOR, and one of its battalions had (incorrectly) been believed involved in an attack on Phu My in the south-west of the province on 11 August. Consequently, Jackson reasoned that if the battle unfolding near Long Tan was the opening phase of an attack on Nui Dat the main assault was still to come, and he would need the bulk of his forces to defend {{the task force}} base. He considered the commitment of A Company would tie up the bulk of 6 RAR and the artillery. Yet Townsend believed Nui Dat's defences sufficient to deter such an attack, even if they remained incomplete, while the strategic reserve held by US II FFV could also be enacted if required. Ultimately Jackson gave in-principle support to the plan but would not release the relief force until he thought it warranted.|$|E
500|$|The first {{indications}} of incoming air raids were {{received by the}} Chain Home <b>Radio</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finding</b> (RDF) facilities, which were located along the coastlines of Britain. In most circumstances, RDF could pick up formations of Luftwaffe aircraft as they organised over their own airfields in northern France and Belgium. Once the raiding aircraft moved inland, the formations were also plotted by the ROC. The information from RDF and the Observer Corps were sent through to the main operations room of Fighter Command Headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory. The plots were assessed {{to determine whether they}} were [...] "hostile" [...] or [...] "friendly". If hostile, the information was sent to the main [...] "operations room", which was in a large underground bunker.|$|E
50|$|During the 1942-1943 Winter Offensive, {{intelligence}} was always concerning convoys with {{particular emphasis on}} US-UK lanes. During 1943, when U-boat operations moved to a defensive Battle of the Atlantic Campaign Climax, a distinct type of message began to be exchanged, which eventually became commonplace, i.e. Allied contact and attack reports. Defense situations reports, became remarkable for their length and new editions. Reports of distant areas, like the Caribbean became more common. By Winter 1943-44, and the resumption of an offensive war against Allied convoys (Battle of Atlantic Final Years) brought back convoy messages. With the difficulties of finding convoys to attack, and with the Allies now reading all communications that the Kriegsmarine sent, concurrently, with daily allied operations, new types of intelligence messages including <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (<b>Direction</b> <b>finding)</b> (<b>Radio</b> <b>direction</b> finder) on positions of Allied units and special reports from intercept parties aboard U-boats became more prominent. Particular concerns included Allied location devices, the positions of U.S. Navy Escort carrier groups (In an attempt to ensure that U-boats surface safely). Attempts were made to evaluate new kinds of underwater sounds, particularity related to ASDIC, search buoys and countering devices for acoustic torpedo.|$|R

500|$|The {{keystone}} of the British defence was {{the complex}} infrastructure of detection, command, and control {{that ran the}} battle. This was the [...] "Dowding System", after its chief architect, Air Chief Marshal Sir H.C.T. [...] "Stuffy" [...] Dowding, the commander-in-chief of RAF Fighter Command. Dowding modernised a system created up from 1917 by Major General E B Ashmore. The core of Dowding's system was implemented by Dowding himself: the use of <b>Radio</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finding</b> (RDF or radar) was at his behest, and its use, supplemented by information by the Royal Observer Corps (ROC), was crucial to the RAF's ability to efficiently intercept incoming enemy aircraft. The technology was named RDF with misleading intent – the vague description would disguise the full nature of the system to the enemy if its existence ever became known.|$|E
500|$|The Dowding system {{relied on}} a private {{telephone}} network forwarding information from the CH stations, Royal Observer Corps (ROC), and pipsqueak <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (RDF) to a central room where the reports were plotted on a large map.

Details from these maps would then be sent to each Group's Sectors, covering one or two main airbases, {{and from there to}} the pilots via radio. This process took time, during which the target aircraft moved. As the CH systems were only accurate to about 1km at best, subsequent reports were scattered and could not place a target more accurately than about [...] This was fine for daytime interceptions; the pilots would have normally spotted their targets within this range.|$|E

The Barracudas executed their dive bombing attack at 6:36 am and struck Tirpitz with a 1,600-pound bomb and four 500-pound bombs within a minute. The German defences at Kaafjord received little warning of the incoming raid, and the smokescreen hid the British aircraft from sight. As a result, the gunners had to fire blindly and only shot down one of the Barracudas; all three airmen died. The second wave landed on the carriers between 7:20 and 7:58 am. A damaged Hellcat had to ditch near the Canadian destroyer [...] and one of the Corsairs suffered heavy damage {{as a result of a}} landing accident; both pilots survived.|$|E
