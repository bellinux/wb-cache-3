This report describes {{the development of a}} new life cycle cost analysis methodology for portland cement concrete pavements which considers all aspects of pavement design, construction, maintenance and user impacts throughout the analysis period.

30|$|Here, {{we set up}} this {{structure}} to signify a human resource term that quantifies the ratio of profit compared to the total workforce value. The arena of maintenance engineering has as its mainstay a yearning for a superior {{understanding of how the}} human <b>reliability</b> <b>concept</b> with respect to return-on-investment, can influence the performance of workforce as a whole. Up till now, the maintenance engineering field has been limited by its orientation towards the hardware aspect of reliability (see also Sarker and Yu 1995). There is a great deal to achieve from a superior inclusion of return-on-investment as an influencing factor in maintenance optimisation structural development. Maintenance investigations are positioned to an advantage from a more powerful commitment with return-on-investment concept, as an avenue of bringing modelling into reality, in a manner hitherto largely under-explored. Through this approach, fresh knowledge will be developed and new insights will emerge.|$|E

In this paper, taking a pile foundation as an example, an attempt is made to put together the reliability design methodology and the performance based design concept. First an performance matrix for a pile foundation is proposed: there are four factors which need to be determined to obtain a reasonable performance matrix of a structure. Namely, load frequency in given structure design life, structure performance (i. e., limit states), importance level of structure and probability of attaining each limit state under given conditions. Reliability analysis is carried out for two actual pile foundation cases. Problems are identified in processing such performance based design on pile foundations...|$|E
