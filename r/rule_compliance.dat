In this paper we extend this list with several data-related atomic <b>compliance</b> <b>rules.</b> We further show how control-flow-related <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> and data-related <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> can be combined.

500|$|The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued {{guidelines}} for hybrid and other near-silent vehicles in January 2010. In the United States the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 {{was approved by}} the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives in December 2010. The act does not stipulate a specific speed for the simulated noise but requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for an alert sound. A proposed rule was published for comment by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in January, 2013. It would require hybrids and electric vehicles traveling at less than [...] to emit warning sounds that pedestrians must be able to hear over background noises. According to the NHTSA proposal carmakers would be able to pick the sounds the vehicles make from a range of choices, and similar vehicles would have to make the same sounds. The rules were scheduled to go into effect in September 2014. However, in January 2015 the NHTSA rescheduled the date for a final ruling to the end of 2015.

2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of the two-factor model was challenged by studies that suggested a third factor (interactional justice) may be involved. [...] Bies and Moag (1986) argue that interactional justice is distinct from procedural justice because it represents the social exchange component of the interaction {{and the quality of}} treatment whereas procedural justice represents the processes that were used to arrive at the decision outcomes. [...] Generally researchers are in agreement regarding the distinction between procedural and distributive justice but there is more controversy over the distinction between interactional and procedural justice (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001). [...] Colquitt (2001) demonstrated that a four-factor model (including procedural, distributive, interpersonal, and informational justice) fit the data significantly better than a two or three factor model.

40|$|Abstract. For {{enterprises}} it {{has become}} crucial to check compliance of their business processes with certain rules such as medical guidelines or financial regulations. When automating compliance checks on pro-cess models, existing approaches have mainly addressed process-specific <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> so far, i. e., rules that correspond to a particular pro-cess model. However, in practice, we will rather find process-independent <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> that are nevertheless to be checked over process models. Thus, in this paper, we present an approach that enables the instantiation and verification of process-independent <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> over process models using domain models. For this, we provide an intuitive visualiza-tion of <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> and <b>compliance</b> <b>rule</b> instances at user level and show how rules and instances can be formalized and verified at system level. The overall approach is validated by a pattern-based comparison to existing approaches and {{by means of a}} prototypical implementation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{fundamental}} {{challenge for}} any process-aware {{information system is}} to ensure compliance of modeled and executed business pro-cesses with imposed <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> stemming from guidelines, stan-dards and laws. Such <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> usually refer to multiple process perspectives including control flow, time, resources, data, and interac-tions with business partners. On one hand, <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> should be comprehensible for domain experts who must define and apply them. On the other, {{they should have a}} precise semantics such that they can be au-tomatically processed. In this context, providing a visual <b>compliance</b> <b>rule</b> language seems promising as it allows hiding formal details and offers an intuitive way of modeling. So far, visual <b>compliance</b> <b>rule</b> languages have focused on the control flow perspective, but lack adequate support for the other perspectives. To remedy this drawback, this paper provides an approach that extends visual <b>compliance</b> <b>rule</b> languages with the ability to consider data, time, resources, and partner interactions when model-ing business process <b>compliance</b> <b>rules.</b> Overall, this extension will foster business process compliance support in practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Process {{compliance}} {{deals with}} {{the ability of a}} company to ensure that its business processes comply with domain-specific regula-tions and <b>rules.</b> So far, <b>compliance</b> issues have been mainly addressed for intra-organizational business processes, whereas there exists only lit-tle work dealing with compliance in the context of cross-organizational processes that involve multiple business partners. As opposed to intra-organizational processes, for a cross-organizational process, compliance must be addressed at different modeling levels, ranging from interaction models to public process models to private processes of the partners. Ac-cordingly, there exist different levels for modeling <b>compliance</b> <b>rules.</b> In particular, we distinguish between local <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> of a particular partner and global <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> to be obeyed by all partners involved in the cross-organizational process.

For this purpose, we introduce the no-tion of compliability, which shall guarantee that an interaction model is not conflicting with a set of imposed global <b>compliance</b> <b>rules.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Process-aware {{information}} systems must ensure compliance {{of the business}} processes they implement with global <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> re-lated to security constraints, domain-specific guidelines, standards, and laws. Usually, respective <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> cover multiple process per-spectives; i. e., they not only deal with the control flow perspective that restricts the sequence in which the process activities shall be executed, but also refer to other process perspectives like data, time, and resource. Although there are various approaches for specifying <b>compliance</b> <b>rules</b> (e. g., based on temporal logic and narrative patterns), only few languages allow for the visual modeling of <b>compliance</b> <b>rules.</b> In turn, existing visual languages focus on the control flow perspective, but treat the other pro-cess perspectives as second class citizens. To remedy this drawback, this paper presents an approach for the visual modeling of business process <b>compliance</b> <b>rules,</b> including the resource perspective. The suitability {{of this approach is}} evaluated in a case study that was performed by business analysts in the healthcare domain. ...|$|R
