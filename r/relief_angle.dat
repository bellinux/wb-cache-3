5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are {{counterbore}} cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|E

The results show that the stress <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> along incline are 75. 5 and 77. 7 degrees, the ones along strike are 78. 4 and 83. 5 degrees in the sense of protection when the advancing distance is 300 m.

According the simulation results and the water inrush coefficient method of effective water-resisting seam, the water inrush risk area of lower protective coal seam was divided, and the feasibility of exploiting protective coal seam was analysed and judged.

40|$|Face-hobbing is the {{dominant}} and the most productive machining process for manufacturing bevel and hypoid gears. Bevel gears {{are one of the}} most important power transmission components, in automobile to aerospace industries, where the power is transmitted between two non-parallel axes. In current industries, the face-hobbing process confronts two major challenges, the tool wear and trial and error experiments to select machining parameters. In the present work, these two problems are targeted. The tool wear in face-hobbing happens at the tool corners of the cutting blades due to the multi-flank chip formation and large gradient of working rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> along the cutting edge at the corners. In addition, the cutting fluid absence contributes in the tool wear phenomena. In the present work, a cutting tool design method is proposed in order to improve the tool wear characteristics especially at the tool corners. The rake and relief surfaces of the conventional cutting blades are re-designed in such a way that normal rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> during the face-hobbing process are kept constant and consequently the gradients of these two angles are minimized, theoretically to zero. Using mathematical tool wear characterization relationship and also FEM simulation, the improvements in tool wear are approved. In addition, in the present thesis, semi-analytical methods are proposed to optimize the face-hobbing process in order to select appropriate machining settings. The optimization problem is constructed in such a way that the machining time is minimized subject to the tool rake wear or cutting force related constraints. In order to predict the tool rake wear (crater wear depth), methods are proposed to calculate un-deformed chip geometry, cutting forces, normal stresses, interface cutting temperature and chip sliding velocity. The un-deformed chip geometry is obtained using two proposed methods numerically and semi-analytically. In the numerical method, the workpiece in-process model is obtained and then the un-deformed chip geometry is approximated using the in-process model. In the semi-analytical method, an un-deformed chip boundary theory is constructed in such a way that the boundary curves of the un-deformed chip are formulated by closed form equations. The obtained un-deformed chip geometry is discretized along the cutting edge of the blades. Each infinitesimal element is considered as a small oblique cut. The differential cutting forces are predicted for each individual element using oblique cutting transformation theory. The total cutting forces are derived by integrating the differential cutting forces along the cutting edge. The proposed methods are applied on case studies of non-generated face-hobbing of gears to show the capability of the methods to find the un-deformed chip geometry, predict cutting forces and finally find the optimum machining parameters in non-generated face-hobbing...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of shear textures and band-like {{features in the}} microstructure of commercially pure (CP) aluminum have been studied {{as a function of}} backpressure and die <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> during equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) through a die with a 90 ◦ die channel angle. Microtexture data were acquired by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) following one pass and four repetitive passes by route A. In a 90 ◦ die with zero <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> the microtexture data indicate that ECAP involves simple shear on a shear plane and in a shear direction that are rotated away from the plane of the die channel intersection toward the die exit channel. This rotation reflects the spreading of shear deformation through a fan-shaped region around the plane of the die channel intersection. The superposition of backpressure suppresses this spreading and the texture data indicate that deformation is confined to the plane of the die channel intersection, while the introduction of a <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> at the outer corner of the die channel intersection promotes spreading and leads to further rotation of the shear plane and shear direction toward the axis of the die exit channel. Splitting of shear texture components is observed after the initial ECAP pass. Such splitting appears in the microstructure as band-like features separated by sub-grains. Band-like features became apparent in the microstructure after the initial pass and persisted through four ECAP passes by route A; these features become more prominent with increasing die <b>relief</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|E

The crystals with 0. 3 ?x? 0. 6 were composed {{of both the}} α' (orthorhombic) - and twinned β (monoclinic) -phases. On {{the basis of the}} lattice correspondence between the two phases and their cell parameters, the phenomenological crystallographic theory has been applied to determine the habit planes and shape deformations upon α'-to-β martensitic transformation. The habit planes, which define the coherent interphase boundaries between α and β, were nearly parallel to either (100) or (001). Because the transformation was accompanied by a small volumetric shrinkage of ～ 0. 3 %, the parent α'-phase would elastically accommodate the strains upon the polysynthetic twin formation of the β-phase. At 293 K, the crystals with x= 0. 6 were composed of ～ 92. 5 mass% α' and ～ 7. 5 mass% β. During further cooling in liquid nitrogen, the α'-to-β transformation proceeded which increases the phase composition of β up to ～ 56. 3 %. The transformation is accompanied by the formation of plate-like surfaee reliefs. The surface <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> have been determined from both observations (7. 4 ± 0. 2 °) and calculations based on a phenomenological analysis (7. 55 °). The fair agreement of these values indicates that the transformation is martensitic and mainly governed by a shear mechanism. The shape memory effect has been demonstrated by the reproducibility of the surface reliefs. The coherency at the interface boundaries between the α'- and β-phases as well as the effective strain accommodation substantially account for the thermoelasticity of the solid solutions...|$|R

The trend of the principal forces recorded during cutting clearly showed the so-called `size effect': the unit cutting force (also known as `specific energy') was a decreasing function of the depth of cut, tending to infinity for vanishingly small values of t. A previous force scheme, assuming a significant influence of the friction generated by the work material sliding along the tool flank on the overall cutting forces, was utilized to interpret the cutting data, and to differently define the unit cutting force.

It is highly relevant to properly and periodically maintain the most important sites of electric traction equipment, which are of vital importance to the entire system of electric traction; these are the places which are significant in ceaseless operation of the entire system. Maintenance of {{the condition of the}} pantograph is one of such sites. It is relevant and highly important because the pantograph facilitates the supply to train engines. Since electricity supply to train engines proceeds also at a high speed of the train, the mechanical impact may inevitably damage the pantograph. This happens when the train moves at a high speed; also it is impacted by friction and other causes: meteorological phenomena, alteration of railway <b>relief,</b> <b>angles</b> of railway tilt etc. Regular examination is required to identify the condition of the pantograph. The aim of the research: grounding on analysis of theoretical and practical materials and the results of investigation of possibilities for diagnostics of the pantograph, to process the signal caused by oscillations of the pantograph, which is received from a testing stand, and to identify it by attributing to different classes of the condition of the pantograph. The object of the research: an automated system of identification of defects in electric traction pantographs. Objectives of the research: 1. 	to create a method of signal identification and classification, which is suitable for the automated system of detection of defects in pantographs; 2. 	to select an algorithm of signal transformation, which allows proper identification of characteristics of the signals of oscillations caused by pantographs; 3. 	to investigate precision of a suggested method of classification in identifying a defect and separating signals of defectless pantographs from signals of damaged pantographs.

The objectives were to examine the factors and processes influencing gully development. The data used were obtained through measurements of the parameters such as gully length, width and depth at four locations. Also examine were slope <b>angles,</b> <b>relief</b> and vegetation of the topography and mapping of the gully patterns. The data were subjected to laboratory and statistical analysis. The findings revealed that factors that influence gullying (process) along the floodplain are rainfall amount, runoff taking advantage of footpaths, wheeled-tracks and soil texture. It was also revealed that human activities such as sand mining contribute to gullying processes by influencing mass wasting processes like slumping through undermining of channel banks leading to caving as well as collapse of channels. The construction of new houses along the road due to population pressure accelerated the gullying processes. The River Ngaddabul annual floods also contribute towards gullying (processes) by deepening the channels, leading to the initiation of new gullies on the slopes. In view of these, the study recommended that drainage channel should be constructed in the gully affected areas to check the volume of runoff influencing gullying.

Results:Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed patent laser peripheral iridotomies OU. the anterior chamber was relatively deep in the center but 360 degrees narrow at the periphery, associated with an abnormally elevated iris contour OU. On dark-room gonioscopy, the angles were occludable with few areas of peripheral anterior synechiae.

At relatively high temperatures primary ? forms predominantly on prior bcc ? grain boundaries, whereas at lower temperatures so-called bainitic ? plates nucleate both at grain boundaries and intragranularly. This morphological transition with decreasing temperature {{is associated with a}} change in transformation mechanism. The combined results of EPMA, OM and dilatometry show that the growth of these bainitic ? plates is partitionless, and not accompanied by a volume change. Subsequently, a posttransformation redistribution of Fe takes place, which causes a dilatation that can be modelled based on the diffusion of Fe and the interface-area density. This mechanism as well as the formed microstructure are similar to bainite in steel, and therefore we chose to denote this transformation product as bainitic ?. In addition, the AFM observations on bainitic ? plates show an invariant plane strain surface <b>relief</b> with tilt <b>angles</b> that are consistent with the Burgers’ transformation model based on shear. In contrast, the AFM results show that the formation of primary ? is accompanied by an irregular dip on a free surface, which is in agreement with the volume decrease measured using dilatometry. Furthermore, the EPMA results show that primary ? is formed by a partitioning transformation. The change in transformation mechanism with decreasing temperature is supported by the observed trend in both the dilatation and the volume fraction ? as a function of temperature.

60|$|Emerging from fragant bowers {{of orange}} trees, you {{suddenly}} perceive before you tall and glittering gates rising from a noble range of marble steps. These you ascend, and entering, {{find yourself in}} a large quadrangular colonnade of white marble. It surrounds a small lake, studded by three or four gaudy barques, fastened to the land by silken cords. The colonnade terminates towards the water by a very noble marble balustrade, the top of which is covered with groups of various kinds of fish in high <b>relief.</b> At each <b>angle</b> of the colonnade the balustrade gives way to a flight of steps which are guarded by crocodiles of immense size, admirably sculptured in white marble. On the farther side the colonnade opens into {{a great number of}} very brilliant banqueting-rooms, which you enter by withdrawing curtains of scarlet cloth, a colour vividly contrasting with the white shining marble of which the whole kiosk is formed. It is a frequent diversion of the Pasha himself to row some favourite Circassians in one of the barques and to overset his precious freight {{in the midst of the}} lake. As his Highness piques himself upon wearing a caftan of calico, and a juba or exterior robe of coarse cloth, a ducking has not for him the same terrors it would offer to a less eccentric Osmanli. The fair Circassians shrieking, with their streaming hair and dripping finery, the Nubian eunuchs rushing to their aid, plunging into the water from the balustrade, or dashing down the t marble steps,--all this forms an agreeable relaxation after the labours of the Divan.|$|R
40|$|The {{extractive}} {{phase of}} broad-scale mining can have major impacts on landscapes and associated ecosystems. Post-mining ecological rehabilitation typically starts with reconstructing topography. A fairly common industry practice {{has been to}} use landform elements such as plateaus, terraces, and gentle slopes for stabilisation purposes. However, this approach {{can lead to the}} generation of fairly uniform landforms that do not necessarily reflect natural ecosystems. Previous research in undisturbed and agricultural landscapes shows that ecological attributes and diversity in microclimates is positively correlated with landform heterogeneity. An objective {{of this study was to}} investigate if those findings are still valid in post-mining rehabilitating landscapes on North Stradbroke Island, Queensland, Australia. We investigated the relationship between landform heterogeneity and status of ecological recovery. The landform heterogeneity is measured through variance in three landform characteristics (relief, slope, aspect) using remote sensing data and the status of ecological recovery is represented by ecological indicators measured through field surveys. The results indicate strong correlations between landform heterogeneity indices and native vegetation species richness with sensitivity to the spatial scale of investigation. It is recognised that climate, substrate and rehabilitation practices act as primary drivers of rehabilitation success. However, the results indicate that, in some examples, landform heterogeneity (heterogeneity in <b>relief</b> and slope <b>angles)</b> contributes up to 30 to 50 per cent of the variance in native vegetation species richness. While the primary drivers of ecological recovery are difficult to control over extensive areas and extended time periods, landform heterogeneity provides a tool to indirectly control the micro-environmental parameters to improve ecological recovery. Reducing the uncertainties in the choice of ecological and landform indices and the degree of landform heterogeneity suitable for particular rehabilitating landscapes would be site specific. The introduction of desired landform heterogeneity may provide a very effective tool for significant improvement in ecological rehabilitation across broad-scale post-mine landscapes, an outcome of benefit to industry, government and local communities...|$|R
