50|$|The ripper is {{the long}} claw-like device {{on the back}} of the bulldozer. Rippers can come as a single (single shank/giant ripper) or in groups of two or more (multi shank rippers). Usually, a single shank is {{preferred}} for heavy ripping. The <b>ripper</b> <b>shank</b> is fitted with a replaceable tungsten steel alloy tip, referred to as a 'boot'.Ripping rock breaks the ground surface rock or pavement into small rubble easy to handle and transport, which can then be removed so grading can take place. With agricultural ripping, a farmer breaks up rocky or very hard earth (such as podzol hardpan), which is otherwise unploughable, in order to farm it. For example, much of the best land in the California wine country consists of old lava flows. The grower shatters the lava with heavy bulldozers so surface crops or trees can be planted.Some bulldozers are equipped with a less common rear attachment referred to as a stumpbuster, which is a single spike that protrudes horizontally and can be raised to get it (mostly) out of the way. A stumpbuster is used to split a tree stump. A bulldozer with a stumpbuster is used for landclearing operations, and is often equipped with a brush-rake blade.|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} an {{analysis}} and comparison of a three-point mounted ripper {{compared to a}} drawbar pull behind ripper. This will provide Baptista Farms with better insight into which method would better suit their needs. Since there are different situations created by different soil types, <b>ripper</b> <b>shank</b> configuration, soil moisture content, and tractor setup, an in depth analysis is needed. The result of this project will be a hitch method that will provide less tractor wear, while still providing the desired ripper depth and acceptable wheel slip. Also, the project includes a results and discussion section that presents recommendations for a better, more accurate test and a conclusion to which method is recommended for Baptista Farms...|$|E
