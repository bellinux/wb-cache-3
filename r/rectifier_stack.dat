50|$|When {{the supply}} of new Champs ceased in 1956, the {{production}} of FFR Land Rovers commenced, initially as 12Volt Rover Mk III and Mk V FFR's, but from 1958 (the start of the Series II Land Rover production - military designation Rover Mk VI) FFR switched to 24 Volt. The standard dynamo generator was initially replaced by a 40 Amp alternator with external <b>rectifier</b> <b>stack</b> mounted {{in front of the}} radiator for cooling giving the vehicle a distinctive appearance seen {{from the front of the}} vehicle, behind the radiator grille. Later vehicles were fitted with the AC90 alternator system manufactured by CAV which became a standardised system in light and medium British vehicles. FFR Land Rovers also had the front wing-mounted boxes for the 'Tuner Radio Frequency Antenna (TRFA)' antenna tuning units.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, vacuum tube thermionic diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal <b>rectifier</b> <b>stacks</b> were used. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum tube rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, Schottky diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|R
40|$|A cascade accelerating-voltage {{generator}} with {{inductive coupling}} and parallel power {{supply to the}} cascades is examined. The basic parameters and dimensions of a generator for a voltage of 500 kW and power 10 kW are presented. The generator is designed to power a tandem charged-particle accelerator. Energy-stabilized (to within ± 0. 1 %) charged-particle beams are used to study the structure of nuclei (resonance interaction of γ-rays with nuclei) and for solving the problems of using fast neutrons for therapeutic purposes. The layout of the generator units {{is similar to that}} in the ELV accelerators [1]. The appearance of rf <b>rectifier</b> <b>stacks</b> (RHC manufactured by Electronic Devices Co., 2 PF 140 manufactured by Semtech Co., and KTs 108 V) and bipolar transistors with an insulated gate (IGBT) on the market has stimulated the development of an rf compact generator and switching the power supply frequency from 400 Hz to 20 kHz.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new isolated ac-dc power converter achieving both {{high power factor}} and converter miniaturization suitable for many low power ac-dc applications. The proposed ac-dc converter architecture comprises a line-frequency <b>rectifier,</b> a <b>stack</b> of capacitors, a set of regulating converters, and a multi-input isolated bus converter. Among many suitable circuit implementations, the prototype system utilizes the resonant-transition buck converter as a regulating converter, and the capacitively-aided isolated bus converter for the isolated bus converter. The converter is miniaturized by operating at high frequency (1 – 10 MHz range), and it buffers the ac-line frequency energy {{with a pair of}} stacked ceramic capacitors (1 μΕ and 150 μΕ, 100 V rating) without a requirement for electrolytic capacitors. The prototype converter is implemented to operate from 120 Vac to 12 V, and up to 50 W output as an example isolated ac-dc converter for power supply applications. The prototype converter demonstrates with 88 % efficiency and 0. 86 power factor, and provides 50 W/in 3 power density, which is five times higher than the power density of typical conventional designs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new power conversion architecture for single-phase grid interface. The proposed architecture {{is suitable for}} realizing miniaturized ac-dc converters operating at high frequencies (HF, above 3 MHz) and high power factor, {{without the need for}} electrolytic capacitors. It comprises of a line-frequency <b>rectifier,</b> a <b>stack</b> of capacitors, a set of regulating converters, and a power combining converter (or set of power combining converters). The regulating converters have inputs connected to capacitors on the capacitor stack, and provide regulated outputs while also achieving high power factor, with twice-line-frequency energy buffered on the capacitor stack. The power combining converter combines power from the individual regulated outputs to a single output, and may also provide isolation. While this architecture can be utilized with a variety of circuit topologies, it is especially suited for systems operating at HF (above 3 MHz), and we introduce circuit implementations that enable efficient operation in this range. The proposed approach is demonstrated for an LED driver operating from 120 V[subscript ac], and supplying a 35 V, 30 W output. The prototype converter operates at a (variable) switching frequency of 5 - 10 MHz and an efficiency of > 93 %. The converter achieves a displacement power density of 130 W/in[superscript 3], while providing a 0. 89 power factor, without the use of electrolytic capacitors...|$|R
40|$|The European Spallation Source (Lund, Sweden) is an under {{construction}} multi-disciplinary research facility {{to be based}} around a Linear Particle Accelerator which is to provide 2. 86 ms long proton pulses at 2 GeV at a pulse repetition rate of 14 Hz, representing an average beam power of 5 MW. To accommodate {{the requirements of the}} proton linac, a large number of klystrons driven by power electronic modulators will be needed. Conventional long pulse modulators are pulse transformer based and commonly exhibit poor efficiency, low power density, large footprint and cost. In addition, these topologies due to their nature in combination with the above cited high peak power requirement for short periods of time commonly produce prohibitive levels of flicker and harmonic content while operating at suboptimal power factor, problems usually corrected by both costly and spacious external grid compensators. This paper presents the stacked multi-level (SML) klystron modulator topology, a novel, modular concept based on high-frequency transformers and <b>rectifier</b> bridges <b>stacked</b> in series, believed to better suit the application and better satisfy ESS requirements, directly addressing the mentioned shortcomings of conventional topologies. The development of this new klystron modulator topology has included the design and construction of a reduced scale prototype with the potential of delivering long (3. 5 ms) high quality dc pulses (0 - 99 % rise time of less than 100 μs and flat top ripple less than that of 0. 15 %) of high voltage (115 kV) and high power (peak power > 2 MW) while on its own maintaining excellent AC grid power quality (low flicker operation < 0. 2 %, sinusoidal current absorption with total harmonic distortion < 3 %, and unitary power factor). The paper in detail describes the essential features of the topology and outlines the working principle, presenting results from both simulation and experimental work...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{introduce}} two large-step-down {{dc-dc converter}} architectures {{that are designed}} to provide zero-voltage switching of the power devices. While the techniques used in these converters {{can be used in a}} wide range of applications, the operating voltage and power levels used in this thesis are for data centers, where dc distribution power delivery is expected to see its first deployment. The nominal 380 V bus voltage will need to be converted to 12 V using a high-efficiency dc-dc converter that can deliver several hundred watts of power to each rack to power the servers. The converters are expected to operate efficiently across a wide input voltage range of 260 V to 410 V and down to powers in the tens of watts range. The first converter architecture is based on the concept of an Impedance Control Network (ICN) resonant converter. Using phase-shift control along with a specifically designed impedance network, this converter can maintain resistive loading of the inverters as the input voltage varies. To back down in power, the converter can be efficiently operated using burst (on/off) mode control. To deliver lower power, we introduce an additional control technique using Variable Frequency Multiplier (VFX) inverters and/or rectifiers. The second converter architecture combines the properties of an active bridge converter with multiple stacked inverters, a multi-winding single core transformer, and a reconfigurable <b>rectifier.</b> The <b>stacked</b> inverter topology improves the range of powers over which zero-voltage switching can be achieved. The multi-winding transformer and reconfigurable rectifier further extend the efficient operating range to very low powers by reducing core loss and increasing zero-voltage switching capability. Both proposed architectures are suitable for large-step-down, wide-input voltage, wide-output power applications such as dc-dc converters for dc distribution. by Samantha Joellyn Gunter. Thesis: Ph.
