40|$|Coating of {{particulate}} solids by a {{thin film}} layer is of interest in many industrial applications such as seed and tablet coating. In seed processing, seeds are commonly coated with a protective coating layer consisting of fertilisers and crop protection products. <b>Rotary</b> drum <b>batch</b> coaters are typically used for this purpose. The coater consists of a cylindrical vessel with a rotating spray disk in the centre, onto which the coating liquid is fed. The seeds are driven around the vessel by its rotating base, and are mixed by two baffles; one {{on either side of}} the vessel. In the present study, DEM simulations are used to analyse the seed coating process. Corn seed is used as a model material and its shape is captured using X-Ray micro-tomography (XRT). The shape is incorporated into the simulations by the clumping multiple spheres to form a particle assembly. The coating uniformity of the seeds is predicted by implementing a coating model, whereby the coating mechanism is represented in the DEM by considering that once a droplet contacts a corn seed, it is removed from the simulation and its mass is attributed to the coating mass of the corn seed. The distribution of mass of sprayed spheres on the corn seeds and the coefficient of variation are evaluated for a range of process conditions, such as spinning disk rotational speed, droplets size and baffle arrangement and designs. In addition to evaluation of coating uniformity of particles, the scale-up rules for <b>rotary</b> drum <b>batch</b> coaters are investigated and reported. The outcome provides guidelines on scale-up rules and improvement of coating uniformity for <b>rotary</b> <b>batch</b> seed coaters...|$|R

To achieve a constant Ni-concentration and pH, we utilized a control system including photometric-, pH-sensors and a <b>batch</b> <b>feeder.</b> A decreasing pH value leads to increasing phosphorous concentrations. Furthermore, we devised a complexometric titration technique to analyze the chemical composition of electroless NiP and confirmed its accuracy by comparison to well-established gravimetric analysis. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) at temperatures ranging from 86 K to 373 K of electroless NiP layers containing different phosphorous concentrations was analyzed using a push-rod dilatometer. Finally, we demonstrate that the CTE of electroless NiP is precisely adjustable via the deposition parameters of the electrolyte...|$|R
40|$|In {{the seed}} {{processing}} industry, <b>rotary</b> <b>batch</b> seed coaters {{are widely used}} for providing a protective coating layer to the seeds consisting of various ingredients including fertilisers and crop protection chemicals. Seed motion and mixing are important in ensuring uniform coating; hence {{the focus of this}} work is to address the mixing efficiency and coating uniformity of corn seeds in a <b>rotary</b> <b>batch</b> seed mixer. In the present study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to analyse the motion and coating uniformity of the seeds. A comprehensive study has been carried out addressing the influence of the shape of corn seeds for accurately simulating their flow in the mixer using two commonly used techniques: (i) manipulation of coefficient of rolling friction of spherical particles, and (ii) clumping multiple spheres. Both methods were successful in simulating the flow of seeds in the mixer, however the former method is found to be an empirical approach rather than predictive. A coating model is used for predicting the coating uniformity of corn seeds in the mixer. Effect of various process parameters on variation of coating mass among the seeds is investigated. For the seed mixer, the baffle clearance gap, baffle geometry and position of the atomiser disc were found to be the key influential process parameters affecting the coating uniformity of corn seeds. Other process parameters such as the base rotational speed, baffle angle, width and curvature had less effects on coating variability. A study has also been carried out on tailoring the existing methods of measuring the extent of breakage of particles for seeds. Four breakage criteria were proposed and assessed for consideration of mass of broken seeds, and the most suitable methods are suggested. The simulations developed here are generic and can be applied {{to a wide range of}} coating processes, such as particle and tablet coating. The proposed methodology for measuring the extent of breakage of corn seeds can also be used for other types of seeds...|$|R

40|$|The work {{includes}} the mechanical analysis of mechanical feeders and batchers that find application in various technological processes and industrial fields. Feeders are usually classified {{according to their}} design features into two groups: conveyor-type feeders and non-conveyor feeders. Batchers are used to batch solid bulk materials. Less frequently, they are used for liquids. In terms of a batching method, they are divided into volumetric and weighting batchers. Weighting batchers do not provide for sufficient batching accuracy. Automatic weighting batchers include a mass controlling sensor and systems for automatic material feed and automatic mass discharge control. In terms of operating principle, batchers are divided into gravitational batchers and batchers with forced feed of material using conveyors and pumps. Improved consumption of raw materials, decreased loss of materials, ease of use in automatic control systems of industrial facilities allows increasing the quality of technological processes and improve labor conditions. The <b>batch</b> <b>feeder</b> suggested by the authors is a volumetric batcher that has no comparable counterparts among conveyor-type feeders and allows solving the problem of targeted feeding of bulk material batches increasing reliability and hermeticity of the device...|$|R
40|$|In {{the seed}} {{processing}} industry, <b>rotary</b> <b>batch</b> seed coaters {{are widely used}} for providing a protective coating layer (consisting of various ingredients including fertilisers and crop protection chemicals) on the seeds. Seed motion and mixing are important in ensuring uniform coating. In the batch seed coater, {{the base of a}} cylindrical vessel rotates, whilst the cylindrical wall is stationary and two baffles turn the bed over for mixing. In the present study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to simulate the effect of particle shape on motion and mixing in this device. Corn seed is used as a model material and the effect of its shape on motion is analysed by considering two approaches: (1) manipulation of rolling friction to account for shape as it is commonly used in the field; (2) approximation of the actual shape by a number of overlapping spheres of various sizes. The geometry of corn seeds is captured using X-Ray micro tomography and then the ASG 2013 software (Cogency, South Africa) is used to generate and optimise the arrangement of the overlapping spheres. A comparison is made of the predicted tangential and radial velocity distributions of the particles from DEM and those measured experimentally. It is concluded that for rapid shearing systems with short collisional contacts a small number of clumped spheres suffices to provide a reasonable agreement with experimental results. Equally well, manipulating the rolling friction coefficient can provide results that match experiments but its most suitable value is unknown a priori, hence the approach is empirical rather than predictive...|$|R
40|$|Glass {{production}} is an energy intensive process, primarily requiring high temperature (≈ 1500 oC) heat, usually provided by combustion of fossil fuels. Concerns {{about the future}} depletion of fossil fuels and the emissions due to their combustion have driven a shift towards the use of alternative energy sources. Concentrated solar radiation is the only form of renewable energy which could directly provide the high temperature process heat required for glass production, without the otherwise necessary intermediate conversion to electricity and thereby avoiding the associated efficiency and capital costs. The technology for concentrating solar radiation using fields of heliostat mirrors to collectively generate a high intensity beam at a central focal point, is already well developed. However, {{the ability to use}} of such a solar beam to effect a viable glass making process involves significant challenges associated with the fact that glass furnaces typically require continuous and consistent process heat smoothly distributed, over large areas while concentrated solar radiation is only intermittently available and provides heat over relatively small areas with steep intensity gradients. In this project, experiments were conducted to incrementally develop and investigate the feasibility of an efficient and scalable process for manufacturing useful glasses with the primary process heat demand provided by a realistic concentrated solar beam. A High Flux Solar Simulator (HFSS) consisting of an array of xenon arc lamps, each coupled with an ellipsoidal reflector, was used to generate an artificial, controllable ‘solar’ beam. First, the HFSS beam was used to directly irradiate pure silica and soda-lime-silica glass forming batches contained inside insulated, refractory crucibles and directly irradiated by a realistic solar beam (intensity < 2000 kW/m 2). All silicate batches generated complete melt pools with full conversion from crystalline raw materials, to x-ray amorphous glasses but only soda-lime-silica batches would generate melts with sufficient fluidity to homogenise and remove entrained gases (fining) and thereby produce transparent glasses. Next, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate factors affecting the continuity of the process. Glass forming batch, directly irradiated by a vertical HFSS beam, was contained inside a modified apparatus which enabled the melt produced to sustain a continuous flow. A specially made <b>batch</b> <b>feeder</b> enabled additional raw materials to be intermittently fed into the melting zone while the beam was still on. It was demonstrated that a semi-continuous glass melting process could be realised using primarily concentrated solar heat. However, secondary heating was necessary to sustain the flow beyond the focal spot of the beam while avoiding fracture of the crucible due to thermal gradients induced by the beam. Also, the efficiency of this process was very poor (3 - 4...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the optimization for a placement machine in printed circuit board (PCB) assembly when family setup strategy is adopted. Design/methodology/approach - A complete mathematical model is developed for the integrated problem to optimize feeder arrangement and component placement sequences so as to minimize the makespan for a set of PCB batches. Owing to the complexity of the problem, a specific genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. Findings - The established model is able to find the minimal makespan for a set of PCB batches through determining the feeder arrangement and placement sequences. However, exact solutions to the problem are not practical due to the complexity. Experimental tests show that the proposed GA can solve the problem both effectively and efficiently. Research limitations/implications - When a placement machine is set up for production of a set of PCB <b>batches,</b> the <b>feeder</b> arrangement of the machine together with the component placement sequencing for each PCB type should be solved simultaneously so as to minimize the overall makespan. Practical implications - The paper investigates the optimization for PCB assembly with family setup strategy, which is adopted by many PCB manufacturers for reducing both setup costs and human errors.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. South Africa has {{an annual}} {{sugarcane}} milling capacity of about 22 million tonnes on average producing about 3. 3 million tonnes of dry bagasse, of which one third is surplus to factory requirements. Currently surplus bagasse {{is used for}} furfural, pulp and paper and cogeneration but significant amounts still remain. This prompted the need to find viable alternative and appropriate technology to utilize the surplus. A laboratory pilot plant was used to investigate the production of activated carbon from bagasse. Experiments were carried out to investigate conditions for making the best activated carbon in a <b>rotary</b> <b>batch</b> kiln, and also to examine potential ene rgy recovery from process gases using Gas Chromatography. Derived results from the laboratory experiments were used to develop a conceptual design for a demonstration plant sited within a sugar mill. The conceptual design was evaluated for economic and environmental impacts using a robust Excel spreadsheet and GABI- 3 modelling software respectively. Excellent activated carbon was produced from sugarcane bagasse by a two-stage physical process involving pyrolysis and gasification with steam. The best operating conditions were pyrolysis at 700 °C for 1 hr and activation at 850 °C for 1 hr, a heating rate of 10 °C/min and a steam flow of 15 g/g of char per hour. The active carbon yield was 7 % on dry bagasse basis with a Methylene Blue Number of 257 mglg of carbon. The active carbon had a sugar decolourisation capacity of 20 % at a carbon dosage rate of 0. 7 wt% on Brix using clear juice (l 2 °Brix) and 70 % at 0. 5 wt% on Brix using brown liquor (65 °Brix). The Freundlich isotherm showed that the bagasse-based activated carbon was a suitable adsorbent for sugar colour bodies. Gas analysis results revealed that the off gases from the pyrolysis and activation stages had calorific values of about 63 MJ and 31 MJ per kg of activated carbon respectively. The total combustion energy of 94 MJ/kg of active carbon was enough to satisfy the process energy requirements for drying, pyrolysis and activation. By burning combustibles like tar, methane, carbon monoxide, ethylene and hydrogen for process thermal energy needs, {{the environmental impact of}} the manufacturing process was reduced to a Global Warming Potential of llkg CO 2 Equiv per kg of carbon produced. The demonstration plant requires a capital investment of US$lOA million to give a competitive bagasse-based activated carbon (BPAC) selling price of US$ 1. 80 per kg and IRR, ROI and Investment payback time of 17. 93 %, 23. 93 % and 3. 80 years respectively. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to investigate the effect of possible variation in the main project forecasts which are BPAe selling price, bagasse buying price, capital investment and production costs on IRR, ROI and payback time. The benefits of process integration within a sugar mill would be expected to improve the business feasibility; If bagasse was free the IRR would increase to 28. 59 % and even better to 32. 12 % if extra boiler and electricity capacity was also available at the mill...|$|R

Models representing the percentage of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, solubilized hemicellulose and the enzymatic conversion of cellulose to glucose were predictive and significant. Phosphoric acid concentration of 0. 20 % at temperature of 186 °C, during 8 and 24 min, was shown to be very effective in solubilizing hemicellulose from sugarcane bagasse, reaching solubilization of 96 % and 98 %, respectively. Relatively low amounts of inhibitors were produced, and the phosphoric acid remaining in the hemicellulosic hydrolysate is at adequate levels for supplying phosphorous requirement during subsequent fermentation...|$|R

The plant has two pyrolysis unit, {{each of them}} consists of a horizontal axis <b>rotary</b> type <b>batch</b> mode reactor with a recycling capacity of 4. 5 tons/run. Solid tire wastes in half/whole size are feed into the reactor chamber, operating at 420 oC with a light over-pressure of 0. 03 bar. The reactor is heated externally by burning product pyrolysis liquids for first three hours and by burning product pyro-gas for rest five hours. The products distribution at optimum reactor operating condition were found oil: 45 wt%, char: 35 wt%, and gases: 10 wt%, {{in addition to the}} steel cords: 10 wt% of solid tire waste. The product liquids have been found to have a high gross calorific value (GCV) of around 44 MJ/kg, which would encourage their use as replacements for conventional liquid fuels. Pyrolytic char may be used as a solid fuel, activated carbon, priters ink etc. Pyrolysis gas contains high concentrations of methane, ethane, butadiene and other hydrocarbon gases with a GCV of approximately 37 MJ/m 3, a value sufficient to provide the energy required by the tire pyrolysis process.

40|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of cubic meters of contaminated sediments are dredged from US harbors and waterways annually for maintenance of navigation, environmental remediation, or both. In recent years, inexpensive ocean dumping has been largely eliminated as a disposal alternative causing {{a crisis in the}} management of sediment. This paper presents a new beneficial use alternative for contaminated dredged material, which is to use dredged material as a feedstock in the conventional manufacture of Portland cement. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the process at the bench and pilot scales, and presents a summary of practical and economic considerations. A bench scale manufacture was carried out with feedstock mixtures containing 1 – 12 % dredged material from the New York/New Jersey (NY/NJ) harbor. The clinkers were quantitatively analyzed with X-ray powder diffraction and differences in phase concentrations were observed in the clinker samples manufactured with dredged material (decreased alite and increased belite) suggesting that additional burn time was needed to account for the quartz present in the sediments. The free chloride concentrations in the clinker samples were below ACI limits for cement used with reinforcing steel; however, the chloride in the dredged material remains a manufacturing concern and is expected to increase annual maintenance costs. A pilot scale manufacture was carried out in a <b>batch</b> <b>rotary</b> kiln; X-ray diffraction analysis and ASTM tests for strength, soundness, and setting time suggested that with better optimized burning conditions, dredged material can be successfully incorporated into full scale manufacture...|$|R
40|$|Growth arrested Swiss mouse {{embryonic}} 3 T 3 {{cells are}} used as feeders to support the growth of epidermal keratinocytes and several other target cells. The 3 T 3 cells have been extensively subcultured owing to their popularity and wide distribution in the world and, as a consequence selective inclusion of variants is a strong possibility in them. Inadvertently selected variants expressing innate resistance to mitomycin C may continue to proliferate even after treatment with such growth arresting agents. The failure of growth arrest {{can lead to a}} serious risk of proliferative feeder contamination in target cell cultures. In this study, we passaged Swiss 3 T 3 cells (CCL- 92, ATCC) by different seeding densities and incubation periods. We tested the resultant cultures for differences in anchorage-independent growth, resumption of proliferation after mitomycin C treatment and occurrence of proliferative feeder contaminants in an epidermal keratinocyte co-culture system. The study revealed subculture dependent differential responses. The cultures of a particular subculture procedure displayed unique cell size distribution and disintegrated completely in 6 weeks following mitomycin C treatment, but their repeated subculture resulted in feeder regrowth as late as 11 weeks after the growth arrest. In contrast, mitomycin C failed to inhibit cell proliferation in cultures of the other subculture schemes and also in a clone that was established from a transformation focus of super-confluent culture. The resultant proliferative feeder cells contaminated the keratinocyte cultures. The anchorage-independent growth appeared in late passages as compared with the expression of mitomycin C resistance in earlier passages. The feeder regrowth was prevented by identifying a safe subculture protocol that discouraged the inclusion of resistant variants. We advocate routine anchorage-independent growth assay and absolute confirmation of feeder disintegration to qualify <b>feeder</b> <b>batches</b> and caution on the use of fetal bovine serum...|$|R
