50|$|<b>Resistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (RTL) is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} built using resistors as the input network and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) as switching devices. RTL is the earliest class of transistorized digital logic circuit used; other classes include diode-transistor logic (DTL) and transistor-transistor logic (TTL). RTL circuits were first constructed with discrete components, but in 1961 it became the first digital logic family to be produced as a monolithic integrated circuit.

50|$|To build a {{functionally}} complete logic system, relays, valves (vacuum tubes), or transistors can be used. The simplest {{family of}} logic gates using bipolar transistors is called <b>resistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (RTL). Unlike simple diode logic gates (which {{do not have}} a gain element), RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to produce more complex logic functions. RTL gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed and better density, the resistors used in RTL were replaced by diodes resulting in diode-transistor logic (DTL). Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) then supplanted DTL. As integrated circuits became more complex, bipolar transistors were replaced with smaller field-effect transistors (MOSFETs); see PMOS and NMOS. To reduce power consumption still further, most contemporary chip implementations of digital systems now use CMOS logic. CMOS uses complementary (both n-channel and p-channel) MOSFET devices to achieve a high speed with low power dissipation.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the logic}} {{circuitry}} of the 1401 was {{a type of}} diode-transistor logic (DTL), that IBM referred to as CTDL (Complemented Transistor Diode Logic). Other IBM circuit types used were referred to as: Alloy (some logic, but mostly various non-logic functions, named for the germanium-alloy transistors used), CTRL (Complemented Transistor Resistor Logic, a type of <b>resistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (RTL)). Later upgrades (e.g., the TAU-9 tape interface) used a faster type of DTL using [...] "drift" [...] transistors (a type of transistor invented by Herbert Kroemer in 1953) for their speed, that IBM referred to as SDTDL (Saturated Drift Transistor Diode Logic). Typical logic levels of these circuits were (S & U Level) high: 0 V to -0.5V, low: -6 V to -12 V; (T Level) high: 6 V to 1 V, low: -5.5 V to -6 V.|$|E
5000|$|Direct-coupled {{transistor}} logic (DCTL) {{is similar}} to <b>resistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (RTL) but the input transistor bases are connected directly to the collector outputs without any base resistors. Consequently, DCTL gates have fewer components, are more economical, and are simpler to fabricate onto integrated circuits than RTL gates. Unfortunately, DCTL has much smaller signal levels, has more susceptibility to ground noise, and requires matched transistor characteristics. The transistors are also heavily overdriven; {{that is a good}} feature in that it reduces the saturation voltage of the output transistors, but it also slows the circuit down due to a high stored charge in the base. [...] Gate fan-out is limited due to [...] "current hogging": if the transistor base-emitter voltages (...) are not well matched, then the base-emitter junction of one transistor may conduct most of the input drive current at such a low base-emitter voltage that other input transistors fail to turn on.|$|E
50|$|Within {{a couple}} of years of its founding, the company's first computer, the 820, was created as a special project for one customer. SEL's early computers, such as the 810A, the 8500, and the 8600, used wire-wrap {{construction}} to create the numerous system boards and backplane (called a swingplane). Components were low-scale <b>resistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (RTL) integrated circuits comprising a few transistors per chip, and core memory was used. The 840A used all integrated circuit logic. It had up to 16K of 24-bit word core memory, all directly addressable. Cycle time was 1.75 microseconds. It also had three hardware index registers, priority interrupts with 60 levels, memory parity, and memory protect. By 1967, over 30 840A systems had been sold. Software included the 840A Real-Time Monitor, a FORTRAN IV compiler, MNEMBLER Assembler, Mathematical and Utility Routine Library, and Diagnostic Routines. Supported peripherals included: disc storage (24 Mbit, removable), 45-ips 9-track magnetic tape, card reader, card punch, 300 LPM line printer, and various data acquisition interfaces.|$|E
5000|$|The NCR 315 Data Processing System, {{released}} in January 1962 by NCR, was a second-generation computer. All {{printed circuit boards}} used <b>resistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> to create the various logic elements. It used 12-bit slab memory structure using core memory. The instructions could use a memory slab as either two 6-bit alphanumeric characters or as three 4-bit BCD characters. Basic memory was 5000 [...] "slabs" [...] of handmade core memory, which was expandable {{to a maximum of}} 40,000 slabs in four refrigerator-size cabinets. The main processor included three cabinets and a console section that housed the power supply, keyboard, output writer (an IBM electric typewriter), and a panel of lights that indicated the current status of the program counter, registers, arithmetic accumulator, and system errors. Input/Output was by direct parallel connections to each type of peripheral through a two-cable bundle with 1-inch-thick cables. Some devices like magnetic tape and the CRAM were daisy-chained to allow multiple drives to be connected.|$|E
50|$|An {{inverter}} circuit outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic-level to its input. Its main {{function is to}} invert the input signal applied. If the applied input is low then the output becomes high and vice versa. Inverters can be constructed using a single NMOS transistor or a single PMOS transistor coupled with a resistor. Since this 'resistive-drain' approach uses only a single type of transistor, it can be fabricated at low cost. However, because current flows through the resistor {{in one of the}} two states, the resistive-drain configuration is disadvantaged for power consumption and processing speed. Alternatively, inverters can be constructed using two complementary transistors in a CMOS configuration. This configuration greatly reduces power consumption since one of the transistors is always off in both logic states. Processing speed can also be improved due to the relatively low resistance compared to the NMOS-only or PMOS-only type devices. Inverters can also be constructed with bipolar junction transistors (BJT) in either a <b>resistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> (RTL) or a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) configuration.|$|E
40|$|Conventional CMOS-technology {{defined by}} optical {{lithography}} will reach its physical limits {{within the next}} years together with technologies adopted for data storage. This work presents and combines the alternative concepts of resistively switching devices, usable as nonvolatile memory elements or switches, and nano crossbar architecture, which defer these physical limits sustainably. The nano crossbar architecture consists of a functional component that is integrated between two perpendicularly crossing metallization lines. This configuration allows for a high integration density due to a minimal footprint of 4 F² (F = minimum Feature size). The basic elements are straight metallization lines with excellent scaling capability and fabricated by competitive technologies such as nano imprint lithography. The functional component can be composed of reversibly switching TiO 2, which is integrated into metal/ insulator/ metal elements (MIM). This can be operated by corresponding set- and reset- voltages between at least two resistance states, which represent a logic " 0 " or " 1 ". The state is nonvolatile and can be nondestructively determined by voltages below these programming values. The field of application includes memory matrices, which are also named passive ReRAM (Resistive Random Access Memory), elements of the DRL (Diode-Resistor Logic) and RTL (<b>Resistor-Transistor</b> <b>Logic),</b> as well as router and multiplexer. Because of their passive properties, an active control circuitry, which is currently based upon CMOS, is necessary. For this reason, all materials and fabrication technologies are CMOS compatible. The developed and optimized lift-off metallization in combination with electron beam direct writing is a flexible method to fabricate metallization lines with different metals and with a width of 50 nm. The fabricated devices comprise crossbar arrays with a size of 64 × 64 bit and a 30 nm thermally evaporated electrode of a Pt/ Ti double layer. These were examined in terms of ballistic charge transfer mechanisms, since {{the dimensions of the}} conductor were in the range of the electron mean free path. The experimental results could be explained by the models of Fuchs-Sondheimer and Mayadas-Shatzkes. Finally, the metal lines offered a high yield and a good scalability with low resistances per unit length. The TiO 2 thin film was reactively sputtered or deposited by ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition). Subsequently, the electrical transfer from the insulating to the switching state, also called electroforming, was examined in detail and allowed for a reliable bipolar switching. The required operating voltages and currents of 100 × 100 nm² large cells are 2 V and several 100 µA, respectively, which are appropriate values for a combination with CMOS technology. Additionally, the gained resistance ratio of more than 100 offers a good detection of the stored information. This information is nonvolatile without any degradation for more than 10 ^ 5 s, also at elevated temperatures of 85 °C. The switching speed was measured by short voltage pulses and is less than 10 ns. At the same time, it is possible to vary the value of the HRS (High Resistive State) depending on the pulse length and amplitude. The multitude of achievable states enables the development of a multi-bit storage element that increases the storage density without an increase of the technological complexity. The interaction of adjacent functional elements was examined by programming of a set of neighboring junctions inside of an array. The subsequent readout of these elements showed no mutual influence for distances above 200 nm and the switching characteristic was consistent with that one of single elements. Each junction that was not electroformed inhibited parasitic currents in the bypasses of an array. The number of programmable bits is thus limited due to the high electroforming voltages of the examined material system. The combination of both concepts shows the high potential of resistively switching elements in nano crossbar architecture. However, the operation of a complete array with the combination of Pt/TiO 2 /Ti/Pt has to be optimized in respect of the electroforming. Nevertheless, this material system offers a high potential for future ReRAM applications, first of all in combination with a select transistor...|$|E
