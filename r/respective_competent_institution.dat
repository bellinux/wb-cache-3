The Swedish merger was much better prepared, more radical, and invested more time and money in its process compared to the Icelandic merger, which was less radical and characterized by decisions from the top. Interestingly, the Icelandic merger, which sought to curtail the growth of expenditures but did not demand savings, achieved outcomes that reflected its main goals.
