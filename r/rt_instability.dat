All existing 3 D hydrodynamical simulations predict strong global mixing of the burning products due to Rayleigh-Taylor (<b>RT)</b> <b>instabilities,</b> which is in contradiction with observations. As a first step and to study the flame physics we present a set of computational magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models in rectangular flux tubes, resembling a small inner region of a WD. We consider initial magnetic fields up to 10 ^ 12 G of various orientation. We find an increasing suppression of <b>RT</b> <b>instabilities</b> starting at about 10 ^ 9 G. The front speed tends to decrease with increasing magnitude up to about 10 ^ 11 G. For even higher fields new small scale finger-like structures develop, which increase the burning speed by a factor of 3 to 5 above the field-free RT-dominated regime. We suggest that the new instability may provide sufficiently accelerated energy production during the distributed burning regime to go over the Chapman-Jougey limit and trigger a detonation. Finally we discuss the possible origins of high magnetic fields during the final stage of the progenitor evolution or the explosion. Comment: Submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} {{planetary}} nebulae (PNe) through {{the interstellar medium}} (ISM) is thought {{to lead to a}} variety of observational consequences, including the formation of bright rims; deformation and fragmentation of the shells; and a shift of the central stars away from the geometric centres of the envelopes. These and other characteristics have been noted through imaging in the visual wavelength regime. We report further observations of such shells taken in the mid-infrared (MIR), acquired through programs of IRAC imaging undertaken using the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). NGC 2440 and NGC 6629 are shown to possess likely interacting halos, together with ram-pressure stripped material to one side of their shells. Similarly, the outer halos of NGC 3242 and NGC 6772 appear to have been fragmented through Rayleigh-Taylor (<b>RT)</b> <b>instabilities,</b> leading to a possible flow of ISM material towards the inner portions of their envelopes. If this interpretation is correct, then it would suggest that NGC 3242 is moving towards the NE; a suggestion which is also supported through the presence of a 60 microns tail extending in the opposite direction, and curved bands of H-alpha emission in the direction of motion - components which may arise through <b>RT</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the magnetized ISM.

40|$|The {{pressure}} {{exerted by}} massive stars' radiation fields {{is an important}} mechanism regulating their formation. Detailed simulation of massive star formation therefore requires an accurate treatment of radiation. However, all published simulations have either used a diffusion approximation of limited validity; have only been able to simulate a single star fixed in space, thereby suppressing potentially-important instabilities; or did not provide adequate resolution at locations where instabilities may develop. To remedy this we have developed a new, highly accurate radiation algorithm that properly treats the absorption of the direct radiation field from stars and the re-emission and processing by interstellar dust. We use our new tool to perform three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations {{of the collapse of}} massive pre-stellar cores with laminar and turbulent initial conditions and properly resolve regions where we expect instabilities to grow. We find that mass is channeled to the stellar system via gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor (<b>RT)</b> <b>instabilities,</b> in agreement with previous results using stars capable of moving, but in disagreement with methods where the star is held fixed or with simulations that do not adequately resolve the development of <b>RT</b> <b>instabilities.</b> For laminar initial conditions, proper treatment of the direct radiation field produces later onset of instability, but does not suppress it entirely provided the edges of radiation-dominated bubbles are adequately resolved. Instabilities arise immediately for turbulent pre-stellar cores because the initial turbulence seeds the instabilities.

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that {{the best and most}} efficient approach to tackle the two-fluid mixing problem is using the unsteady laminar model. Although it is a 2 D simulation and contrary to a 2 D DNS it filters some of the spatial and temporal scales, this approach gives us enough information about mixing dynamics in the system. The model captures the mixing mechanisms of molecular diffusion, KH and <b>RT</b> <b>instabilities</b> very well. These are the most important mechanisms observed in a laminar-turbulent configuration of the two-fluid mixing. At the same time, the unsteady laminar model takes up much less computational capacity compared to 3 D LES and even 2 D DNS. In addition, considering the industrial pipe flow observations explained in the introduction section, we found that the URANS is not a suitable tool to model the crude oil flow mixing as it noticeably does not capture the main mixing mechanisms affecting the mixing dynamics. On the other hand, the unsteady laminar model predictions conform with what is observed in batching.|$|R

30|$|As noted already, {{turbulence}} {{is inherently}} 3 D in nature, {{which means the}} turbulent flows are characterized by 3 D time-dependent structures. Therefore, to examine whether the 3 D mixing dynamics in our system lead to a significantly different result from that in the 2 D system, we use the so-called dynamic Smagorinsky Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model  (ANSYS-Fluent, Inc. 2013) in a 3 D version of our 2 D channel. The LES approach assumes that momentum, mass and energy are transported mostly by large eddies. Therefore, only large eddies are resolved. Small eddies, however, are not resolved; instead, these small eddies and their effects on the resolved scales are modeled. Since the KH and <b>RT</b> <b>instabilities</b> are generally large scale, {{it is expected that}} their role will appear in the mixing dynamics predicted by LES. Resolving only the large eddies allows us to use coarser mesh and larger time-step sizes in LES which reduces the computational cost compared to the case with the 3 D unsteady laminar model (pseudo-DNS).

An estimate of three key turbulence length scales (the Taylor and Kolmogorov microscales and a viscous diffusion scale), however, shows that the temporal duration of the present flow is insufficient to allow for the development of a turbulent inertial subrange.

A particular feature is a strong increase of viscosity with depth, resulting {{from the fact that the}} effective pressure increases with depth. Observations suggest that more than one wavelength is generally present (e. g. diapirism and loadcasting) which requires at least three layers with uniform properties to be present. Three layers permit wavelength growth maxima at two distinct wavelengths. We investigate whether an effective-pressure dependent rheology is consistent with <b>RT</b> <b>instabilities,</b> and whether the non-uniformity it produces is able to increase the number of growth-rate maxima. The investigation starts from the point where sediment in an underlying layer is less dense than the overlying sediment, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability starts to operate. The mechanics of two layers of finite thickness but infinite extent are modelled by the Stokes equations. The equation set is linearized, and the Fourier transform taken in order to describe the periodic horizontal variation of flow fields at a specified wavelength. The influences of layer thickness and viscosity ratio on the flow fields are considered. It is found that, for a given wavelength, layer thickness has a far stronger influence on flow fields than does viscosity ratio. For all configurations inspected, the dependence of growth rate on wavenumber exhibited one maximum, meaning that a variable viscosity model does not produce multiple wavelengths. Maximum growth rates occur at wavelengths corresponding to the layer thicknesses. We infer that loading instabilities occurring at wavelengths around the layer thicknesses are consistent with the effective-pressure-dependent viscous model...|$|R
