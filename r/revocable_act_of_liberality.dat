60|$|And so {{the little}} conference ended. George had {{certainly}} gained nothing. Caroline had gained this, {{that she had}} made known her resolution, and had, nevertheless, not lost her lover. To all the expressions of her determination not to marry till George should be a barrister, aunt Mary had added a little clause--that such decision might at any moment be changed by some new <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> on the part of uncle Bertram. In aunt Mary's mind, the rich uncle, the rich grandfather, was still the god that was to come down upon the stage and relieve them from their great difficulty.|$|R
60|$|Though {{it must be}} very evident, from what-preceded {{this open}} avowal, that Wilder was not ignorant of the {{character}} of the ship on board of which he had just ventured, yet did he not receive the acknowledgment without embarrassment. The reputation of this renowned freebooter, his daring, his <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> and licentiousness so frequently blended, and his desperate disregard of life on all occasions, were probably crowding together in the recollection of our more youthful adventurer, and caused him to feel that species of responsible hesitation to which we are all more or less subject on the occurrence of important events, be they ever so much expected.|$|R
60|$|Nelson, in {{remembrance of}} an old and {{uninterrupted}} friendship, appointed Alexander Davison sole prize agent for the captured ships: upon which Davison ordered medals to be struck in gold, for the captains; in silver, for the lieutenants and warrant officers; in gilt metal for the petty officers; and in copper for the seamen and marines. The cost <b>of</b> this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> amounted nearly to L2000. It is worthy of record on another account;--for some of the gallant men, who received no other honorary badge of their conduct on that memorable day than this copper medal from a private individual, years afterwards, when they died upon a foreign station, made it their last request, that the medals might carefully be sent home to their respective friends. So sensible are brave men of honour, in whatever rank they may be placed.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{knew that}} the speaker was sincere. It was an offer {{perfectly}} characteristic of his friend, the Western millionaire, who had halted by his side. And he knew also that the slow lifting of his bridle-rein, preparatory to starting forward again, was the business-like gesture {{of a man who}} wasted no time even over his <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> impulsive <b>liberality.</b> In another moment he would dismiss the unaccepted offer from his mind--without concern and without resentment.|$|R
6000|$|The {{leave-taking}} of Mr. Vimpany, on {{the previous}} evening, was the first event which the maid had to relate. She had been present when the doctor said good-bye to the master and mistress. Business in London was the reason he gave for going away. The master had taken the excuse as if he really believed in it, {{and seemed to be}} glad to get rid of his friend. The mistress expressed her opinion that Mr. Vimpany's return to London must have been brought about by an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> {{on the part of the}} most generous of living men. [...] "Your friend has, as I believe, got some money from my friend," [...] she said to her husband. My lord had looked at her very strangely when she spoke of Mr. Mountjoy in that way, and had walked out of the room. As soon as his back was turned, Fanny had obtained leave of absence. She had carried out her intention of watching the terminus, and had seen Mr. Vimpany take his place among the passengers to London by the mail train.|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{he praised}} me, {{while all the}} others joined in, till the din was awful. Saduko thanked me also in his {{magnificent}} manner. Yet I {{do not think that}} he was altogether pleased, although my great gift relieved him from the necessity of sharing up the spoil with his companions. The truth was, or so I believe, that he understood that henceforth the Amangwane would love me better than they loved him. This, indeed, proved to be the case, for I am sure that there was no man among all those wild fellows who would not have served me to the death, and to this day my name is a power among them and their descendants. Also it has grown into something of a proverb among all those Kafirs who know the story. They talk <b>of</b> any great <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> in an idiom as [...] "a gift of Macumazana," [...] and in the same way of one who makes any remarkable renunciation, as [...] "a wearer of Macumazana's blanket," [...] or as [...] "he who has stolen Macumazana's shadow." ...|$|R

And doubtless many believers will be eager to subscribe their names. For what is it to enter the fire, to one whose faith is firm?

For in his place, if you believed the fire would not burn you, which of you, my friends, would not enter it as readily as you would walk along the dry bed of the Mugnone?" ...|$|R
40|$|The Comatula-collection of the Leyden Museum {{is one of}} {{considerable}} importance, owing to its containing {{a large proportion of}} the types of the species described by Johannes Müller in his classical memoir ¹), »Ueber die Gattung Comatula Lam. und ihre Arten. ” Müller’s descriptions, however, are notoriously incomplete, and have undergone no revision since their publication nearly forty jears ago, during which time a very large number of Comatulae have been discovered. Some of these have been referred with more or less success to one or other of Müller’s species, but without careful comparison with his types no accurate specific determinatious have been at all possible. When I visited the Leyden Museum last autumn for the purpose of examining the seven types of Müllerian species which it contains, I was not surprised to find a number of other Comatulae in the collection. Thanks to the good offices of my friend Dr. Hubrecht, to whom I am indebted for many <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> kindness, the whole of the foreign Comatula-collection numbering twentyfive specimens was sent over to my laboratory at Eton, in order that I might study it in more detail than was possible during a short visit to the Museum. For this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> on the part of the Director, Dr. Schlegel, I would here express my heartiest thanks...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} I quitted the Retreat, and saw {{no more of}} Mr. Miller, at that time; but I carried away with me many resolutions {{that would have been}} very admirable, had they only been adhered to. How {{short-lived}} they were, and how completely I was the slave of a vicious habit, will be seen, when I confess that I landed in New York a good deal the worse for having treated some militia-men who were in the steamer, to nearly a dozen glasses of hot-stuff, in crossing the bay. I had plenty of money, and a sailor's disposition to get rid of it, carelessly, and what I thought generously. It was Evacuation-Day, and severely cold, and the hot-stuff pleased everybody, on such an occasion. Nor was this all. In passing Whitehall slip, I saw the Ohio's first-cutter lying there, and it happened that I not only knew the officer of the boat, who {{had been one of the}} midshipmen of the Constellation, but that I knew most of its crew. I was hailed, of course, and then I asked leave to treat the men. The permission was obtained, and this second <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> reduced me to the necessity of going into port, under a pilot's charge. Still I had not absolutely forgotten the sermon, nor all my good resolutions.|$|R
6000|$|Such was {{the state}} of feeling {{among some of the}} {{principal}} actors of our tale, when the sudden death of Daggett occurred. The body was not removed from the house of the Widow White, but the next morning it was conveyed to the [...] "grave-yard"--'church-yard' would have sounded too episcopal--and interred in a corner that was bestowed on the unhonoured and unknown. It was then, only, that the deacon believed he was the sole depository of the important secrets. He had the charts in his possession, and no more revelations could pass the lips of Daggett. Should the friends of the deceased sailor hear of his death, and come to look after his effects, there was very little probability of their finding anything among them to furnish a clue to either the new sealing-ground, or to the buried treasure of the pirate. In order to be secured, he even went a little beyond his usual precautions, actually discharging all indebtedness of the deceased to the Widow White out of his own pocket, by giving to her the sum of ten dollars. This was handsome compensation in her eyes as well as in his, and he quieted the suspicions so great and unusual an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> would be apt to awaken, by saying, [...] "he would look to the friends, or if they failed him, to the effects, for his returns; for it was better he should lose by the stranger, than a lone widow." [...] He also paid for the coffin, the digging of the grave, and the other light expenses of the interment. In a word, the deacon endeavoured to hush all impertinent inquiries by applying the salve of silver, wherever it was needed.|$|R
6000|$|There was a moment, too, {{when the}} colonel thought of {{presenting}} me to Madame de Dolomien, {{by the way}} of assuring his favor in the royal circle, but {{when he came to}} count up the money he should lose in the way of profits, this idea became painful, and it was abandoned. As often happened with this gentleman, he reasoned so long in all his <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberality,</b> that he supposed a sufficient sacrifice had been made in the mental discussions, and he never got beyond what surgeons call the [...] "first intention" [...] of his moral cures. The evening he went to court, therefore, I was carefully consigned to a carton in the colonel's trunk, whence I did not again issue until my arrival in America. Of the voyage, therefore, I have little to say, not having had a sight of the ocean at all. I cannot affirm that I was absolutely sea-sick, but, on the other hand, I cannot add that I was perfectly well during any part of the passage. The pent air of the state-room, and a certain heaviness about the brain, quite incapacitated me from enjoying any thing that passed, and that was a happy moment when our trunk was taken on deck to be examined. The custom-house officers at New York were not men likely to pick out a pocket-handkerchief from a gentleman's--I beg pardon, from a colonel's--wardrobe, and I passed unnoticed among sundry other of my employer's speculations. I call the colonel my EMPLOYER, though this was not strictly true; for, Heaven be praised! he never did employ me; but ever since my arrival in America, my gorge has so risen against the word [...] "master," [...] that I cannot make up my mind to write it. I know there is an ingenious substitute, as the following little dialogue will show, but my early education under the astronomer and the delicate minded Adrienne, has rendered me averse to false taste, and I find the substitute as disagreeable as the original. The conversation to which I allude, occurred between me and a very respectable looking shirt, that I happened to be hanging next to on a line, a few days after my arrival; the colonel having judged it prudent to get me washed and properly ironed, before he carried me into the [...] "market." ...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{philosophical}} and political debates relentlessly investigated {{the nature and}} the limits of political community and a number of very different criticisms have been put forward against the predominance of individualistic and utilitarian principles in contemporary societies. In this contribution, I will discuss the role of gift theory in interpreting modern and contemporary visions of political community. Hence, I will focus on the basic tenets of the ideas <b>of</b> <b>liberality</b> and political exchange expressed in “civil conversazione”, reason of state and in sovereignty theories in order to highlight how the multifaceted and controversial implications <b>of</b> the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> princely/sovereign “liberality”. The plurality of political relations established through liberality, largesse and dépense may, in fact, help us in understanding the dark face of political community as well as the political nature of homo oeconomicus.
