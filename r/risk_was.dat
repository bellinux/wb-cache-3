5|$|A {{moderate}} {{risk for}} severe weather was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center two days prior to the event. The storm then moved across {{the most of the}} Midwest on October 18, where a moderate <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> in effect also for two days for most of Illinois, Indiana and parts of Kentucky, although the moderate <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> revised further to the south and east to include western Ohio, western Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas and a larger portion of Kentucky while Michigan and Wisconsin were no longer under a moderate risk. A slight risk of severe weather was forecast for a large area from beyond the Canada–US border to the Florida Panhandle and Mobile Bay. Dew points above 70°F (21°C) were reported well into the Ohio Valley, and dew points above 60°F (16°C) were reported as far north as northern Ontario.|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} for the Normandy {{landings}} (codenamed Operation Overlord) drew near in early 1944, Groves considered that <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> sufficient to send an officer to brief the Supreme Commander General Dwight D.

On 8 April 1944, Peterson reported to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and met with Eisenhower, his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, Assistant Chief of Staff (G-2) (Intelligence), Major General John Whiteley, and his Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) (Operations), Major General Harold R.

5|$|In {{the early-morning}} hours of Sunday March 29, forecasters at the Twin Cities NWS noticed {{that due to}} the model's {{prediction}} of strong wind shear and instability, the tornado <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> quite high for their region. Area forecast discussions during this period mentioned the possibility of F3-strength tornadoes later in the day. Also {{on the morning of}} March 29, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Day1 moderate risk of severe weather. This moderate risk area was more narrow than the previous day's outlook, encompassing only southwest Wisconsin, northern Iowa and the southern third of Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} was French {{reaction to the}} attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the upcoming French legislative elections, Mitterrand would be reluctant {{to start a new}} risky and costly expedition to save Habré; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French President could not politically <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Opération Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the French Air Force bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the N'Djamena Airport, causing minimal damage.|$|E
5|$|On April4, 2015, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued their Day 6 {{severe weather}} outlook, {{highlighting}} a substantial and widespread risk for severe weather from southeastern Oklahoma to northeastern Illinois valid for April9. This threat area was maintained in the Day 5 outlook and narrowed to a corridor from southern Missouri into northern Illinois in the Day 4 outlook. On April7, a Day 3 Enhanced <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> issued across most of Illinois, eastern Missouri, and small portions of adjacent states.

5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
2500|$|Specific <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> the <b>risk</b> {{associated}} with individual assets - within a portfolio these <b>risks</b> can <b>be</b> reduced through diversification (specific risks [...] "cancel out").

Systematic risk (a.k.a. portfolio risk or market risk) {{refers to the}} risk common to all securities—except for selling short as noted below, systematic <b>risk</b> cannot <b>be</b> diversified away (within one market). Within the market portfolio, asset specific <b>risk</b> will <b>be</b> diversified away to the extent possible.

30|$|A {{case study}} of {{undefined}} and subjective MPD, i.e., dental cement, is presented here. The existing MPD process is mapped with the standard phase gate process with necessary customization. A total of twenty <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> explored during five phases of the MPD. These <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> categorized as: technical, strategy and market risks based on the source of occurrence. RPN for each <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> calculated using traditional FMEA and fuzzy FMEA; their results <b>are</b> compared. The <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> further categorized as critical, moderate, low level and negligible risks based on their RPN and the criticality.

30|$|General RP bias: In general, {{perceived}} <b>risk</b> {{of events}} <b>is</b> {{correlated with the}} actual <b>risk.</b> However, there <b>are</b> some biases {{in the sense that}} small <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> overestimated and high <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> underestimated (Sjöberg 2000; Lichtenstein et al. 1978; Thompson and Mingay 1991; Mbaye and Kouabenan 2013).|$|R
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E
5|$|At a {{collective}} level, the <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> even greater, as the hugely dangerous Illyrian revolt proved. The central Illyrian tribes were tough and spartan shepherds of the Bosnian mountains and excellent soldier-material. Their territory formed {{part of the}} strategic province of Illyricum, recently expanded to include {{the territory of the}} Pannonii, Celticised Illyrian tribes based on {{the west bank of the}} Danube who were subjugated by Rome in 12–9BC (the Bellum Pannonicum). By the start of the Common Era, they were an important recruitment base for the auxilia. But discontent was festering among the Illyrian tribes, largely due to what they saw as the rapacity of Roman tax officials. In AD 6, several regiments of Dalmatae, a warlike Illyrian tribe, were ordered to report to a designated location to prepare to join Augustus' stepson and senior military commander Tiberius in a war against the Germans. Instead they mutinied at the assembly point, and defeated a Roman force sent against them. The Dalmatae were soon joined by the Breuci, another Illyrian tribe that supplied several auxiliary regiments. They gave battle to a second Roman force from Moesia. They lost, but inflicted heavy casualties. The rebels were now joined by a large number of other Illyrian tribes. The Dalmatae attacked the port of Salona and overran the Adriatic coast, defeating a Roman force and exposing the Roman heartland of Italy to the fear of a rebel invasion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1870s South Australia's defence was solely {{dependent}} on the volunteer military, and a few artillery pieces purchased during earlier war scares. British troops had been withdrawn from the Australian colonies in 1870, leaving the state dependent on its own military resources. In {{a report to the}} government in 1866, Colonel Freeling and Major Peter Scratchley recommended establishment of a permanent military force. In 1876 the South Australian government, along with those from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland requested from the War Office that Major General Sir William Jervois, a noted coastal fortification expert, be appointed to advise on defence needs. He arrived in Sydney in mid-1877 with then Lieutenant Colonel Scratchley. The 1877 report, delivered after he became South Australian Governor, called for three batteries, at Largs Bay, Semaphore and Glenelg, connected by a military road and supported by field gun emplacements, naval elements and mobile forces. He determined that South Australia's most probable defence <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> an attack by up to two ships rather than a larger force, and this formed the basis of the final fortification design. His report called for Military Road to be extended to Marino, an electro-contact torpedo station be established on Torrens Island and that a gun boat be provided. In November 1878 the government passed the Military Forces Act, which provided for the raising of a permanent military force and reserve. Two volunteer reserve rifle companies were formed in 1878 and a permanent artillery unit in 1882.|$|E

5|$|From 1988, {{environmental}} groups started opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, who stated that the road would have a negative impact for local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. They therefore recommended that the municipalities select a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last. He argued that the tolls could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern Bømlø, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer driving time to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.|$|E
