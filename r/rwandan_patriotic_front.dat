5|$|Katyusha-like MRLs {{were also}} {{allegedly}} {{used by the}} <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> during its 1990 invasion of Rwanda, through the 1994 genocide. They were effective in battle, but translated into much anti-Tutsi sentiment in the local media.|$|E
5|$|They {{remained}} {{de facto}} senior officers, but the change {{caused them to}} accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. They joined an organisation called the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> (RPF), a refugee association which had been operating under various names since 1979. Rwigyema became the RPF leader shortly after joining and, while still working for the Ugandan army, he and Kagame completed their invasion plans.|$|E
5|$|The Rwandan Civil War was a {{conflict}} in the African republic of Rwanda, between the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) and the rebel <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> (RPF). The war was fought in two phases. The first phase began on 1 October 1990, with an RPF invasion of the north east of the country from Uganda. This phase ended on 4 August 1993, with {{the signing of the}} Arusha Accords. The second phase took place following the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994, and the outbreak of the Rwandan genocide. The RPF resumed fighting on 7 April, and the civil war ended with an RPF victory on 18 July 1994.|$|E
40|$|Some {{scholars}} include {{changes in}} spirituality, {{such as a}} greater commitment to their religious beliefs or an enhanced understanding of spiritual matters, {{in the definition of}} posttraumatic growth; others conclude that questions of spirituality should be excluded from this definition. This article highlights the fundamental difference of religion to other domains of posttraumatic growth because religions are ideologies (and other domains of growth are not). As ideologies, it is argued that religions can affect different levels of identity in different ways. Based on testimonial evidence from Rwandan genocide survivors, the article demonstrates that although religious beliefs can bring existential comfort at the individual level, they can also lead to a state of false consciousness at the collective level. In Rwanda, the dominant religious ideology facilitated the spiritual and moral climate in which genocide became possible. Today, religious interpretations of the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front’s</b> (RPF) leadership provide spiritual backing to a government which has become increasingly authoritarian...|$|R
2500|$|The Gacaca court (...) is {{a system}} of {{community}} justice inspired by Rwandan tradition where gacaca can be loosely translated to [...] "justice amongst the grass". This traditional, communal justice was adapted in 2001 to fit the needs of Rwanda {{in the wake of}} the 1994 Rwandan Genocide (also known as [...] "Hutu vs Tutsi" [...] ) where an estimated 800,000 people were killed, tortured and raped. After the genocide, the new <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front's</b> government struggled to pursue justice on such a massive scale, and therein to develop just means for the humane detention and prosecution of the more than 100,000 people accused of genocide, war crimes, and related crimes against humanity. By 2000, approximately 130,000 alleged genocide perpetrators populated Rwanda's prisons (Reyntjens & Vandeginste 2005, 110). Using the justice system Rwanda had in place, the trial of such massive numbers of alleged perpetrators would take well over 100 years during which Rwanda's economy would crumble as a massive amount of their population awaited trial in prison. For this reason they chose to adapt and create a large-scale justice system, which would work alongside the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, in order to heal as a people and to thrive as a country.|$|R
50|$|On 22 April 1995 the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Army {{killed more}} than 4,000 people in the Kibeho massacre.|$|R
5|$|Hunter gatherers {{settled the}} {{territory}} in the stone and iron ages, followed later by Bantu peoples. The population coalesced first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-18th century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during the First World War. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. The Tutsi-led <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> launched a civil war in 1990. Social tensions erupted in the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1.3 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> (RPF), a rebel group {{composed}} of nearly 500,000 Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the Rwandan Civil War. The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government {{for failing to}} democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 Arusha Accords with the RPF. The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide, which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{was born}} to a Tutsi family in {{southern}} Rwanda. His mother was younger sister to King Ndahindurwa's wife. When he was two years old, the Rwandan Revolution ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to Uganda, where he {{spent the rest of}} his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in Yoweri Museveni's rebel army, becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the Ugandan presidency. Kagame joined the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> (RPF), which invaded Rwanda in 1990; leader Fred Rwigyema died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated. The assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was the starting point of the genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed {{a little more than a}} million Tutsi and moderate Hutu combined. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E
50|$|The PSP contested the 2008 {{elections}} {{as part of}} the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Front-led coalition, {{winning a}} single seat. It did not run in the 2013 elections.|$|R
50|$|In October 2002, {{president}} Paul Kagame appointed James Kabarebe to {{the position}} of Chief of Defence Staff of the Rwandan Defence Forces (formerly <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Army).|$|R

5|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda. Largely composed of former Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers, it includes the Rwanda Land Force, Rwanda Air Force and specialised units. After the successful conquest {{of the country in}} 1994 {{in the aftermath of the}} Rwandan Genocide, the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and the RDF, a military division which was to serve as the official army of the Rwandan state. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of {{the national}} budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi and lingering concerns about Uganda's intentions towards its former ally. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the NRA {{captured}} Kampala with a {{force of}} 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president, he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, {{with the goal of}} allowing the refugees to return home. In addition to fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention, it renamed itself to the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front,</b> and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988, a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, with Kagame assuming the vice-presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice-president, but resented the loss of the leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{which was}} to become the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> (RPF) was founded in 1979. It was known initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association, and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU). It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan president Milton Obote. Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, Idi Amin, including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame had joined Yoweri Museveni's rebel Front for National Salvation (FRONASA). FRONASA fought alongside Obote to defeat Amin in 1979, but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the 1980 general election. Museveni, along with Rwigyema and Kagame, formed a new rebel army, the National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in {{what became known as}} the Ugandan Bush War. President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency, and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to Nairobi, Kenya. In 1982 Ankole youths attacked the Rwandans, with the authority of Obote, causing many more to join Museveni's NRA.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} {{a victory for the}} <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Front-led coalition, which won 40 of the 53 elected seats in the new Chamber of Deputies, and {{eighteen}} of the 27 reserved for women, youth and the handicapped. Voter turnout was 96.5%.|$|R
50|$|General James Kabarebe (born 1959) is a Rwandan {{military}} officer {{who has served}} as the Rwandan Minister of Defence since April 2010. He served as a <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Army Commander and was an Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo strategist.|$|R
50|$|The {{party was}} founded on 18 August 1991. It joined the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Front-led {{coalition}} for the 2003 parliamentary elections, winning a single seat. It remained part of the coalition for the 2008 and 2013 elections, retaining its one seat on both occasions.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} is young and predominantly rural, with a density {{among the highest}} in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda, although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by an ordered administrative hierarchy since pre-colonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.|$|E

50|$|The {{party was}} {{established}} in 1992. It joined the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Front-led alliance prior to the 2003 parliamentary elections, winning a single seat. It remained part of the alliance for the 2008 parliamentary elections, retaining its one seat. However, it lost its seat in the 2013 elections.|$|R
25|$|RTLM was {{established}} in 1993, primarily railing against on-going peace talks between President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose family supported the radio station, and the Tutsi <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front.</b> It became a popular station since it offered frequent contemporary musical selections, unlike state radio, and quickly developed a faithful audience among youth-aged Rwandans, who later made {{up the bulk of}} the Interahamwe militia.|$|E
25|$|While Tutsi {{remained}} {{in control of}} Burundi, the conflict resulted in genocide in Rwanda as well. A Tutsi rebel group, the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front,</b> invaded Rwanda from Uganda, which started a civil war against Rwanda's Hutu government in 1990. A peace agreement was signed, but violence erupted again, culminating in the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, when Hutu extremists killed an estimated 800,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsis.|$|E
25|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) (in Kinyarwanda: Ingabo z'u Rwanda; in French: Forces rwandaises de défense) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda. The country's armed forces were originally known as the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), but following {{the victory of the}} <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> in the country's civil war in 1994, it was renamed to the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), and later to its current name.|$|E

50|$|While {{there was}} general unrest in eastern Zaire, the {{rebellion}} was unlikely a grassroots movement; Uganda president Yoweri Museveni, who supported and {{worked closely with}} Rwanda in the First Congo War, later recalled that the rebellion was incited by Zairian Tutsi who had been recruited by the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Army (RPA).|$|R

25|$|The First Congo War {{began in}} 1996 as Rwanda grew {{increasingly}} concerned {{that members of}} Rassemblement Démocratique pour le Rwanda Hutu militias, who were carrying out cross-border raids from Zaire, were planning an invasion of Rwanda. The militias, mostly Hutu, had entrenched themselves in refugee camps in eastern Zaire, where many had fled to escape the Tutsi-dominated <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> (RPF) {{in the aftermath of}} the Rwandan Genocide of 1994.|$|E
25|$|As {{revealed}} through {{testimony at}} the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the genocide was brutally efficient, lasting {{for a total}} of 100 days and leading to the murder of 800,000 Tutsi, Hutu moderates and Twa. Over two million people were displaced internally or in neighboring countries. The genocide ended when the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front</b> gained control of Rwanda on July 18, 1994, though recrimination, retribution, and criminal prosecutions continue to the present day.|$|E
25|$|The Forces armées rwandaises (FAR) was the {{national}} army of Rwanda until July 1994, when the government collapsed {{in the aftermath of}} the Genocide against Tutsi and the war with the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Front.</b> The FAR was estimated at 7,000 strong, including approximately 1,200 members of the Gendarmerie. Elite troops included the Presidential Guard, estimated at between 1,000-1,300 troops, as well as the Paracommando and Reconnaissance units. These two units were of battalion strength by 1994, and then counted a total of 800 troops.|$|E
