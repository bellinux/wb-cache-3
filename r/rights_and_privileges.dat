5|$|Henry le Despenser {{continued}} to be controversial after his fighting career was over, {{mainly because of the}} vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt was a {{rebellion}} against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies in Palestine. It was a collective {{reaction to the}} gradual elimination of the unofficial <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> previously enjoyed by the various societal groups in the region under Ottoman rule. While the local peasantry constituted {{the bulk of the}} rebel forces, urban notables and Bedouin tribes also formed {{an integral part of the}} revolt.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{ordered an}} inquest into the {{revenues}} and resources of his bishopric, {{along with the}} customs of the see. This took place in 1183, {{and when it was}} finished, the results were entered into a register that became known as the Boldon Book. Hugh also fought a long-running disagreement with his own cathedral chapter over the right to oversee the monks, a conflict that lasted about 40 years. This led to the monks forging many documents purporting to show that earlier bishops had granted the monks <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> exempting them from episcopal oversight. He also fought with Archbishop Roger of York over lands they both held in each other's see.|$|E

5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally {{assumed to}} be subject to their fathers, then to their husbands after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal term for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women would achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.|$|E
5|$|Edward I's {{frequent}} military campaigns put a great financial {{strain on}} the nation. There were several ways through which the king could raise money for war, including customs duties, money lending and lay subsidies. In 1275, EdwardI negotiated {{an agreement with the}} domestic merchant community that secured a permanent duty on wool. In 1303, a similar agreement was reached with foreign merchants, in return for certain <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges.</b> The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the Riccardi, a group of bankers from Lucca in Italy. This was in return for their service as money lenders to the crown, which helped finance the Welsh Wars. When the war with France broke out, the French king confiscated the Riccardi's assets, and the bank went bankrupt. After this, the Frescobaldi of Florence took over the role as money lenders to the English crown.|$|E
5|$|Society in {{the urban}} {{settlements}} of the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office as a burgess, alderman, bailies, or {{as a member of}} the burgh council. Below them were craftsmen and workers that made up the majority of the urban population. Both merchants and craftsmen often served a long apprenticeship, acquiring skills and status, before they became freemen of a burgh, and could enjoy certain <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges.</b> Major sources of trade included the export of wool, fish, coal, salt and cattle. Imports included wine, sugar and other luxury goods. Important crafts included metal working, carpentry, leather working, pottery and later brewing and wig-making. There were frequent disputes between the burgesses and craftsmen over rights and political control of the burgh, occasionally bursting into violence, as occurred at Perth in the first half of the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench, is {{a member}} of Pension, the {{governing}} body of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of Bencher developed during the 16th century when the Readers, for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This was a rare practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was Nicholas Bacon in 1550, then Edward Stanhope in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.|$|E
5|$|His reward, however, {{was to be}} the university's first Keeper of the Archives, {{appointed}} on 11 August 1634. The new statute {{governing the}} position noted the losses that Oxford had suffered because of the careless keeping of its archives, and the need for an experienced person to take charge of them and to advise the university's officers in defending its interests. He was to be paid not less than £40 annually, with a levy of one shilling from each graduate and undergraduate. Thereafter, he sought to obtain royal confirmation of Oxford's <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges,</b> to keep the city of Oxford subordinate to the university, and to match the position of Cambridge. A new royal charter was obtained in 1636 to confirm the revised statutes. Under Twyne and his successor as Keeper (Gerard Langbaine), the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden presses that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, news of Henry's {{death had}} reached Stephen of Blois, {{conveniently}} placed in Boulogne, {{and he left}} for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen reached the edge of London by 8 December {{and over the next}} week he began to seize power in England. The crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> in return, and his brother, Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, delivered the support of the Church to Stephen. Stephen had sworn to support Matilda in 1127, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath, and suggested that the King had changed his mind on his deathbed. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 26 December.|$|E

5|$|The {{crowds in}} London {{traditionally}} claimed {{a right to}} elect the king of England, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> in return. Henry of Blois delivered {{the support of the}} church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, who was both the Bishop of Salisbury and the Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen. On 15 December, Henry delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.|$|E
5|$|Things {{came to a}} head {{in autumn}} 1246, when Kaliman of Bulgaria died, leaving the country {{in the hands of a}} regency for his younger brother Michael Asen (r. 1246–57). Vatatzes quickly {{attacked}} Bulgaria, and within three months captured most of Thrace and all of eastern and northern Macedonia, while Michael II of Epirus also took advantage of the opportunity to expand into Albania and northwestern Macedonia. At the close of this campaign in November, as Vatatzes was encamped at Melnik, he was informed of a conspiracy to depose Demetrios and deliver Thessalonica to him in exchange for a chrysobull guaranteeing the traditional <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> of the city. Vatatzes readily granted this, and sent envoys to Demetrios calling for him to appear in person at his camp. Demetrios, suspicious of Vatatzes' intentions, refused, and the Nicaeans marched on Thessalonica. After a few days, the conspirators opened one of the gates to the Nicaean army, and the city was quickly captured. Demetrios was captured and exiled to Lentiana in Bithynia, while Thessalonica and all of Macedonia were placed under the governance of the Grand Domestic Andronikos Palaiologos. Theodore himself, isolated and without power in his refuge at Vodena, apparently remained uninvolved in these events.|$|E

5000|$|... 3.Good {{health care}} is a {{constitutional}} opportunity of Americans. Today {{health care is}} very expensive. If it is free, it certainly will not satisfy the high expectations of Americans. Do they often perceive death as an option? The choice is between the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>privilege</b> of having health care. It depends on the state’s economic situation and societal and political support. In this respect today, Americans are divided almost equally between the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>privilege.</b> Due to almost 16 percent of the population not having health insurance (50 million) and high inequality (for 2000, 40.8% are below perfect distribution, according to the Gini coefficient, comparable to Morocco’s and in contrast to Norway's 25.8% in 2000 (2007 World Development Indicators, World Bank, pp. 67 -68), in times when 10 percent are unemployed and another 5 percent is out of statistics, to have a privilege of health care may lead to a lack of social tranquility which is expected by the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, basic health care should be perceived as the controlled right. It means that certain medical help is secured but its use is controlled and if it is abused by unwise life styles, it can be suspended.|$|R
