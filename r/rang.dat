40|$|Abstract. We in {{this note}} {{consider}} a new concept, so called pi-McCoy, which unifies McCoy <b>rings</b> and IFP <b>rings.</b> The classes of McCoy <b>rings</b> and IFP <b>rings</b> {{do not contain}} full matrix <b>rings</b> and upper (lower) triangular matrix <b>rings,</b> but the class of pi-McCoy <b>rings</b> contain upper (lower) trian-gular matrix <b>rings</b> and many kinds of full matrix <b>rings.</b> We first study {{the basic structure of}} pi-McCoy <b>rings,</b> observing the relations among pi-McCoy <b>rings,</b> Abelian <b>rings,</b> 2 -primal <b>rings,</b> directly finite <b>rings,</b> and (pi-) regular <b>rings.</b> It is proved that the n by n full matrix <b>rings</b> (n ≥ 2) over reduced <b>rings</b> are not pi-McCoy, finding pi-McCoy matrix <b>rings</b> over non-reduced <b>rings.</b> It is shown that the pi-McCoyness is preserved by polynomial <b>rings</b> (when they are of bounded index of nilpotency) and classical quotient <b>rings.</b> Several kinds of extensions of pi-McCoy <b>rings</b> are also examined. 1. Basic properties of pi-McCoy <b>rings</b> Throughout this note every <b>ring</b> is associative with identity unless otherwise stated. We use R[x] to denote the polynomial <b>ring</b> with an indeterminate...|$|R

50|$|Right nonsingular <b>rings</b> are a {{very broad}} class, {{including}} reduced <b>rings,</b> right (semi)hereditary <b>rings,</b> von Neumann regular <b>rings,</b> domains, semisimple <b>rings,</b> Baer <b>rings</b> and right Rickart <b>rings.</b>|$|R
5|$|The show's {{production}} designer is Naomi Slodki. Previous art {{directors have}} included Henry Lickel, Dennis Roof, Bob <b>Rang,</b> and Ed Flesh (who also designed sets for other game {{shows such as}} The $25,000 Pyramid, Name That Tune, and Wheel of Fortune).|$|E
5|$|A shot <b>rang</b> out. It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E
5|$|Between 270 and 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers began {{developing}} {{more elaborate}} mechanized water clocks. The added complexity {{was aimed at}} regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks <b>rang</b> bells and gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe.|$|E
50|$|In algebra, a semiprimitive <b>ring</b> or Jacobson semisimple <b>ring</b> or J-semisimple <b>ring</b> is a <b>ring</b> whose Jacobson radical is zero. This {{is a type}} of <b>ring</b> {{more general}} than a semisimple <b>ring,</b> but where simple modules still provide enough {{information}} about the <b>ring.</b> <b>Rings</b> such as the <b>ring</b> of integers are semiprimitive, and an artinian semiprimitive <b>ring</b> is just a semisimple <b>ring.</b> Semiprimitive <b>rings</b> can be understood as subdirect products of primitive <b>rings,</b> which are described by the Jacobson density theorem.|$|R
40|$|This article deals {{mostly with}} the {{following}} question: when is the classical <b>ring</b> of quotients of a commutative <b>ring</b> a <b>ring</b> of stable range 1 ? We introduce the concepts of a <b>ring</b> of (von Neumann) regular range 1, a <b>ring</b> of semihereditary range 1, a <b>ring</b> of regular range 1, a semihereditary local <b>ring,</b> a regular local <b>ring.</b> We find relationships between the introduced classes of <b>rings</b> and known ones, in particular, it is established that a commutative indecomposable almost clean <b>ring</b> is a regular local <b>ring.</b> A commutative any <b>ring</b> of idempotent regular range 1 is an almost clean <b>ring.</b> It is shown that any commutative indecomposable almost clean Bezout <b>ring</b> is an Hermite <b>ring,</b> any commutative semihereditary <b>ring</b> is a <b>ring</b> of idempotent regular range 1. The classical <b>ring</b> of quotients of a commutative Bezout <b>ring</b> is a (von Neumann) regular local <b>ring</b> {{if and only if}} R is a commutative semihereditary local <b>ring...</b>|$|R

5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello <b>rang</b> a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
5|$|On March 28 North Vietnamese forces {{closed in}} on Da Nang, and they {{subjected}} Da Nang Air Base to heavy artillery bombardment. Under adverse conditions, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was able to fly about 130 aircraft out of the city, {{but they had to}} abandon 180 aircraft, including 33 A-37 Dragonflys, due to chaos, confusion, poor discipline and the breakdown of airfield security. On March 29, the North Vietnamese captured Da Nang, followed by Quy Nhon on April 1 and Tuy Hòa and Nha Trang on April 2. At Phan <b>Rang</b> Air Base, remnants of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force continued to battle North Vietnamese troops for two days after ground units of the ARVN had given up the fight. Elements of the ARVN Airborne Division were also committed into the fight, but they were overwhelmed by the North Vietnamese and Phan <b>Rang</b> was captured on April 16.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline transport: The ancient Chinese {{made use}} of {{channels}} and pipe systems for public works. The Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang <b>Rang</b> (d. 189AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang. These chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} <b>ring</b> theory, {{the class}} of Frobenius <b>rings</b> and their generalizations are the extension of work done on Frobenius algebras. Perhaps the most important generalization is that of quasi-Frobenius <b>rings</b> (QF <b>rings),</b> which are in turn generalized by right pseudo-Frobenius <b>rings</b> (PF <b>rings)</b> and right finitely pseudo-Frobenius <b>rings</b> (FPF <b>rings).</b> Other diverse generalizations of quasi-Frobenius <b>rings</b> include QF-1, QF-2 and QF-3 <b>rings.</b>|$|R

40|$|As a {{generalization}} of α-skew McCoy <b>rings,</b> we introduce {{the concept of}} α-skew π-McCoy <b>rings,</b> and we study the relationships with another two new generalizations, α-skew π 1 -McCoy <b>rings</b> and α-skew π 2 -McCoy <b>rings,</b> observing the relations with α-skew McCoy <b>rings,</b> π-McCoy <b>rings,</b> α-skew Armendariz <b>rings,</b> π-regular <b>rings,</b> {{and other kinds of}} <b>rings.</b> Also, we investigate conditions such that α-skew π 1 -McCoy <b>rings</b> imply α-skew π-McCoy <b>rings</b> and α-skew π 2 -McCoy <b>rings.</b> We show that in the case where R is a nonreduced <b>ring,</b> if R is 2 -primal, then R is an α-skew π-McCoy <b>ring.</b> And, let R be a weak (α,δ) -compatible ring; if R is an α-skew π 1 -McCoy <b>ring,</b> then R is α-skew π 2 -McCoy...|$|R
5|$|Placed on {{an upper}} {{floor of the}} State House, the bell was rung {{in the early years}} of {{independence}} on the Fourth of July and on Washington's Birthday, as well as on Election Day to remind voters to hand in their ballots. It also <b>rang</b> to call students at the University of Pennsylvania to their classes at nearby Philosophical Hall. Until 1799, when the state capital was moved to Lancaster, it again <b>rang</b> to summon legislators into session. When Pennsylvania, having no further use for its State House, proposed to tear it down and sell the land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, together with the building, including the bell, for $70,000, equal to $ today. In 1828, the city sold the second Lester and Pack bell to St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church, which was burned down by an anti-Catholic mob in the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844. The remains of the bell were recast; the new bell is now located at Villanova University.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the wreck, Mariners' Church in Detroit <b>rang</b> its bell 29times; once for each life lost. The church {{continued}} to hold an annual memorial, reading {{the names of the}} crewmen and ringing the church bell, until 2006 when the church broadened its memorial ceremony to commemorate all lives lost on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell <b>rang,</b> however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked {{his hands behind his}} neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At the end of the match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him {{in the back of the}} head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a clean <b>ring</b> is a <b>ring</b> {{in which}} every element can be written as the sum of a unit and an idempotent. A <b>ring</b> is a local <b>ring</b> {{if and only if}} it is clean and has no idempotents other than 0 and 1. The {{endomorphism}} <b>ring</b> of a continuous module is a clean <b>ring.</b> Every clean <b>ring</b> is an exchange <b>ring.</b> A matrix <b>ring</b> over a clean <b>ring</b> is itself clean.|$|R
5000|$|This {{section will}} deal mainly with Noetherian serial <b>rings</b> and their subclass, Artinian serial <b>rings.</b> In general, <b>rings</b> are first {{broken down into}} indecomposable <b>rings.</b> Once the {{structure}} of these <b>rings</b> are known, the decomposable <b>rings</b> are direct products of the indecomposable ones. Also, for semiperfect <b>rings</b> such as serial <b>rings,</b> the basic <b>ring</b> is Morita equivalent to the original <b>ring.</b> Thus if R is a serial <b>ring</b> with basic <b>ring</b> B, {{and the structure of}} B is known, the theory of Morita equivalence gives that [...] where P is some finitely generated progenerator B. This is why the results are phrased in terms of indecomposable, basic <b>rings.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractSymmetric <b>rings</b> were {{introduced}} by Lambek to unify sheaf representations of commutative <b>rings</b> and reduced <b>rings.</b> We continue {{the study of}} symmetric <b>rings,</b> discussing basic examples and extensions. From any given reduced <b>ring</b> we first construct a nonreduced symmetric <b>ring,</b> and observe {{the form of the}} minimal noncommutative symmetric <b>ring</b> of order 16 up to isomorphism. We next show that polynomial <b>rings</b> over symmetric <b>rings</b> need not be symmetric and that classical right quotient <b>rings</b> of right Ore symmetric <b>rings</b> are symmetric. We also construct more examples of symmetric <b>rings</b> and counterexamples to several naturally raised situations in the process...|$|R
5|$|The third match saw Big Show face Snitsky. The match {{began with}} Big Show and Snitsky brawling as the bell <b>rang.</b> Big Show {{was able to}} perform a big slap to the chest and headbutt. Snitsky then took the upper hand over Big Show, as he applied an armbar hold, after {{countering}} a chokeslam. Big Show delivered a Spinebuster and got the victory after a successful chokeslam.|$|E
5|$|Under Emperor Ling (r.168–189 AD) the eunuchs had the {{partisan}} prohibitions renewed and expanded, while also auctioning off top government offices.

5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone <b>rang</b> from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
