25|$|The {{plans and}} {{designs for the}} new {{cemetery}} were drawn up by the Commission's architect, Barry Edwards. One of the immediate problems faced was deciding on a suitable location. The original location of the mass graves was considered as a site for the cemetery (and was offered as such by the landowner), but the ground {{was found to be}} too prone to flooding. The site that was chosen was nearby, about 120metres to the southwest of the original battlefield mass graves, but on a higher piece of land just outside the village of Fromelles. The overall cemetery shape is hexagonal, and the design incorporated radial rows of headstones leading towards a <b>raised</b> <b>Cross</b> of Sacrifice on the southern side of the cemetery. This higher location for the cemetery allowed the deliberate placement of the Cross of Sacrifice at a place where it would be visible on the skyline when viewed from the nearby V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial. This memorial is one of several locations in and around Fromelles where those who fell in the battle are commemorated. The Fromelles battlefield of 1916 would also be visible from the elevated Cross of Sacrifice terrace. Another consideration in the design was the cemetery orientation, with the headstones orientated to the south to avoid shadows and to increase the daytime visibility of the headstone inscriptions. The exact layout of the burial plots was left flexible as the number of burials needed was not known at that point. A small car park was included in the design. Unlike earlier CWGC cemeteries, this modern cemetery was designed to include ramps to allow accessibility for wheelchair users.|$|E

25|$|On {{the south}} aisle wall are three {{monument}}s all of white marble on black marble back plates. One is to Mrs Penelope Cholmeley (died 1821 aged 75 years), {{the sister of}} Montague Chomeley. Her remains were interred at Twyford, Middlesex. The monument back plate is straight sided with top and bottom curved and facetted. The raised inscription plaque is oblong with a 45° cut at each corner, over which is a moulded shelf, on which sits an urn with 'cloth' swagging attached and topped with a flambeau. Floriate devices are a boss {{each side of the}} urn, bell flower ribbons hanging from the shelf either side of the plaque, and an oval flower and leaf spray below. The second is a double dedication: firstly to Sir Montague Cholmeley (died 1851 aged 59 years); secondly to Dame Elizabeth, his wife (died 1822), daughter and co-heiress of John Harrison of Norton Place, north from Lincoln. This monument back plate is straight sided with top deeply curved and bottom partly curved. The raised inscription plaque is rectilinear, and sits on a square-edged stepped shelf supported by curved brackets with embossed acanthus decoration, with a device of two strapped palm leaves below. At each side of the plaque is a hanging folded drape attached to a moulded cornice. At each side of the cornice top is a conch shell which provides the holding point for a plain swag that springs from a knot above; between the swagging is a <b>raised</b> <b>cross.</b> The monument was provided by George Wilcox of Piccadilly. Above this monument is one smaller to James Harrison Cholmeley (1808–1854), of a scrolled plaque on a straight sided back plate with a pointed top; above the scroll sits a decorative crest.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{north-east}} {{corner of}} the north transept are brass plaques to William Turnor, died 1473, and his two wives Margery and Margaret. A brick tomb is also to William Turnor with the [...] "figures of man in fur-edged gown, with belt and bag, and of two women in belted dresses and veiled head-dresses, with inscription and two inscribed scrolls, indents of two shields and figures of children." [...] Further north chancel memorials are to Joseph Hammond, died 1762, with the inscription [...] "Buried near this place lies the body of Joseph Hammond died June 1762 aged 61 years. He was a tender husband, a kind master and true friend. A sincere Christian." [...] Joseph Hammond's wife and son are also memorialised by plaque. A further north transept stone floor slab memorial is to Thomas Meade, died 1653. Meade's brother, Rev Joseph Meade (1586-1639), was born at Berden Priory, educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, and became an English scholar whose 1641 Key of the Revelation became an influential treatise on the Book of Revelation. A worn floor slab to Thomasine, died 1656, the wife of Thomas Meade, lies in the nave. Further north transept memorials are of two coffin lids, one defaced with {{a part of a}} <b>raised</b> <b>cross,</b> and the other of Purbeck marble, upturned and used as a wall bracket; both 13th century.

50|$|The 1946 presbytery {{is located}} within the churchyard, {{approximately}} 10 metres north-west of the church. It is an idiosyncratic structure, having single layer (4 in) brick external walls in stretcher bond set high on a substantial concrete column and beam frame. In plan it comprises a rectangular brick core of three non-connecting rooms, {{each of which has}} front and back French doors with Arctic glass and fanlight above, opening to a wide encircling verandah. This verandah was open initially but has been enclosed with fibrous cement sheeting and windows, and lined internally with fibreboard. The street elevation has a <b>raised</b> <b>cross</b> centrally mounted. The whole is surmounted by a hipped roof of corrugated metal sheeting. The upper level is accessed on the southern side via a set of steps with a metal balustrade.|$|E

Aisles run along the eastern and western sides and through the centre of the nave. The sanctuary at the southern end is raised one step above the nave with vestries on either side. The timber pews, like most furniture in the church, have chambered corners painted an off-white colour. The collection plates are made from seven interlocking triangular pieces of timber.|$|E
5000|$|The board {{consists}} of a <b>raised,</b> <b>cross</b> shaped platform divided into squares on which the pieces move surrounded by a circular [...] "canal". Each player has 8 pieces (or [...] "men") and a boat of the same color which is located at one of [...] "docks" [...] {{at the ends of}} the cross. The initial position of all the pieces and boats is always the same. The winner is the first player to successfully move five of their eight pieces into their own boat. Players take turns to move one piece to an adjacent square in any direction (including diagonals). Pieces can move further by jumping over one or more of their own or opponents' pieces, making a series of jumps where possible. When a player jumps into their boat, all the boats are moved clockwise around the board, one quarter turn. As a result, players will often find their own boat moves away from the dock they have moved one of their pieces to, giving the game its name.|$|E

5000|$|In 1900, Glenny won a mural {{competition}} {{to decorate the}} Pan-American Exposition's New York State Building. Her painting, Blessing of the Cross by Father Milet, 1688 depicts a scene from New York history where a priest, Pierre Milet, erected a cross following the rescue of a starving garrison. The scene shows Milet, surrounded by {{a small group of}} soldiers and American Indians, blessing the <b>raised</b> <b>cross</b> while a faint figure of Christ hovers behind him. In addition to Blessing of the Cross by Father Milet, 1688, Glenny had four other works displayed in the Exposition's Exhibit of Fine Arts, including The Maid of the Mist, The Coral Harp, and The Figure of Electricity. The Exhibit boasted the largest collection of contemporary American artists such as Mary Cassatt, John Singer Sargent, and James McNeill Whistler. Many of the works exhibited emphasized the achievements of American society and technology. Glenny's cover design for the booklet, [...] "Music at the Pan-American Exposition: Organists, Orchestras, Bands", also known as The Coral Harp demonstrates her creativity representing the idyllic, idealized female form. The coral color choice was not an accident. As part of the spectacle of the Pan-American Exposition, each building was painted a different, vibrant color, with the Temple of Music painted red and salmon.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Community Health Fund (CHF) was {{introduced}} in Tanzania {{as part of the}} Ministry of Health’s (MOHSW) endeavour to make health care affordable and available to the rural population and the informal sector. The scheme started in 1996 with Igunga acting as a pilot district, and was later expanded to other districts. Despite of its apparent benefits, enrolment level in all districts has remained far below the projected target. Objectives: The main objective {{of this study was to}} assess community knowledge and views on social, economic and demographic factors influencing CHF membership and participation in Magu district. Methods and materials: The study adopted a cross-sectional study design involving 200 household heads. Data collection methods included administering of questionnaire and an in-depth interview to the key informants in the district. In order to answer all the objectives data was analysed to get frequencies, percentages and where the need <b>raised</b> <b>cross</b> tabulation was done to get interpretations using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: The study findings revealed that 55 % of community members interviewed reported inadequate information dissemination which caused poor understanding of the scheme. Major concerns were pointed out such as poor services delivery attributed by lack of medicine, community ability to pay, poor management of CHF funds, longer waiting time of health service especially in public health facilities, poor infrastructures just to mention a few. Conclusion: The decision to enrol in CHF membership is moulded by a combination of many factors including, education, gender, economic status, awareness strategies, improved health services and low margin of social inequality within the community...|$|E
