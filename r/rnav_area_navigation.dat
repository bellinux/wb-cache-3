40|$|Air traffic {{systems have}} long relied on {{automated}} short-term conflict prediction algorithms to warn controllers of impending conflicts (losses of separation). The complexity of terminal airspace has proven difficult for such systems as it {{often leads to}} excessive false alerts. Thus, the legacy system, called Conflict Alert, which provides short-term alerts in both en-route and terminal airspace currently, is often inhibited or degraded in areas where frequent false alerts occur, even though the alerts are provided only when an aircraft is in dangerous proximity of other aircraft. This research investigates how a minimal level of flight intent information {{may be used to}} improve short-term conflict detection in terminal airspace such that it can be used by the controller to maintain legal aircraft separation. The flight intent information includes a site-specific nominal arrival route and inferred altitude clearances in addition to the flight plan that includes the <b>RNAV</b> (<b>Area</b> <b>Navigation)</b> departure route. A new tactical conflict detection algorithm is proposed, which uses a single analytic trajectory, determined by the flight intent and the current state information of the aircraft, and includes a complex set of current, dynamic separation standards for terminal airspace to define losses of separation. The new algorithm is compared with an algorithm that imitates a known en-route algorithm and another that imitates Conflict Alert by analysis of false-alert rate and alert lead time with recent real-world data of arrival and departure operations and a large set of operational error cases from Dallas/Fort Worth TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control). The new algorithm yielded a false-alert rate of two per hour and an average alert lead time of 38 seconds. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an <b>area</b> <b>navigation</b> program and the implementation of this software on a microcomputer-based Loran-C receiver to provide high-quality, practical <b>area</b> <b>navigation</b> information for general aviation are described. This software provides range and bearing angle to a selected waypoint, cross-track error, course deviation indication (CDI), ground speed, and {{estimated time of arrival}} at the waypoint. The range/bearing calculation, using an elliptical Earth model, provides very good accuracy; the error does not exceed more than -. 012 nm (range) or 0. 09 degree (bearing) for a maximum range to 530 nm. The alpha-beta filtering is applied {{in order to reduce the}} random noise on Loran-C raw data and in the ground speed calculation. Due to alpha-beta filtering, the ground speed calculation has good stability for constant or low-accelerative flight. The execution time of this software is approximately 0. 2 second.
