2500|$|In Windows Vista, the Start menu has {{undergone}} major changes, with the taskbar icon no longer labeled [...] "Start" [...] but instead has the Windows pearl orb. At the top level, the Start menu, as in Windows XP, has two columns of menu choices. Under the default configuration, the [...] "Run," [...] and [...] "Printers" [...] options do not appear. However, those items {{can be added}} to the Start menu. One of the chief additions with Windows Vista is a Search pane or box, where users may begin typing immediately. The contents of the Start menu itself are indexed and searchable, besides the global search index. If indexing is turned on, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. This allows the Start menu to act as a fast and powerful application launcher. The Start menu search also doubles as the <b>Run</b> <b>command</b> from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The <b>Run</b> <b>command</b> can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu.|$|E
2500|$|By 917, Xu Zhigao {{was said}} to have built Sheng Prefecture into such a prosperous city that, when his adoptive father Xu Wen visited, he came to like the city, and {{therefore}} set his headquarters there. [...] He promoted Xu Zhigao to be the military prefect (團練使, Tuanlianshi) of Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), where his headquarters had previously been, despite Xu Zhigao's wishes to be given Xuan Prefecture (宣州, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui). [...] Initially, Xu Zhigao was not happy, but Song privately advised him to accept the <b>Run</b> <b>command,</b> pointing out that Run Prefecture was just across the Yangtze River from the Wu capital Guangling — easy for him to take advantage of any disturbances that might rise as a result of misdeeds by Xu Zhigao's adoptive brother Xu Zhixun, whom, as Xu Wen's oldest biological son, Xu Wen had left in charge at Guangling as junior regent. [...] Given Song's analysis, Xu Zhigao changed his attitude and accepted the <b>Run</b> <b>command</b> gladly. [...] When, as Song anticipated, the senior general Zhu Jin started an uprising at Guangling in 918 and killed Xu Zhixun, Xu Zhigao was able to cross the river easily and put down the disturbance quickly. [...] With Xu Wen's other biological sons all being young, Xu Wen thus left Xu Zhigao as the junior regent at Guangling, replacing Xu Zhixun.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista and its successors added {{minor changes}} to the menu. Prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Start menu {{consisted}} of a group of menus and sub-menus that cascaded and expanded, obscuring the initially visible portions of the screen beneath them. In Windows Vista, however, cascading menus were replaced by a sliding window in the left pane of the Start menu. Whenever All Programs item is clicked, the contents of the left pane slide off the left edge of the Start menu and the All Programs menu slides in from the right edge of the left column. This menu presents a tree view of it hierarchy that expands towards the bottom, with a vertical scrollbar whenever needed. Also added in Windows Vista is a Search box that allows users to search for the Start menu shortcuts or other files and folders. The search box features incremental search: If indexing is not turned off, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. Since the found items can be immediately opened, the Start menu search box replaces the function of <b>Run</b> <b>command</b> from previous versions of Windows. The <b>Run</b> <b>command</b> can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the search results pane covers both columns of the Start menu. The search box is extended to support searching Control Panel items. The right column in Windows 7 links to Libraries instead of ordinary folders. Most importantly, however, items on the Start menu support Jump lists through cascade buttons on their right. Unlike prior versions, the ability to revert to the [...] "Classic" [...] Start menu design is no longer available.|$|E

2500|$|The {{search engine}} uses {{indexing}} {{to allow for}} a quick display of results for a given search. Advanced options allow the user to choose the file type, how it should be indexed, the properties only, or the properties and the file contents. The Start menu search also doubles as the <b>Run</b> <b>command</b> from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The indexed search platform is based on Microsoft's Windows Desktop Search 3.0 (Windows Search version 4.0 in Vista SP2), allowing third-party applications (e.g. Microsoft Outlook 2007) to use the indexing platform to store metadata and perform searches on Windows Vista or Windows XP (with the Windows Desktop Search redistributable installed). This is in contrast to the search engine of Windows XP, which takes some time to display results, and only after the user has finished typing the search string. The Windows Vista search allows users to add multiple filters to continually refine search results (Such as [...] "File contains the word 'example'"). It is also possible to search across RSS and Atom feeds, straight from Windows Explorer. Windows search uses IFilters that are used by Windows Desktop Search as well. The IFilter interface can be implemented by software makers so that files created by their applications can be better integrated with search and indexing programs.|$|E
