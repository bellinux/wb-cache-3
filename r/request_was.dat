5|$|In {{the case}} of mothers of young children, Russian law allows for {{deferment}} of a prison sentence until the child reaches the age of 14. Such a <b>request</b> <b>was</b> controversially granted in 2011 to Anna Shavenkova, who had been sentenced to two years and six months prison for vehicular manslaughter. It was alleged that her <b>request</b> <b>was</b> granted because of her family connections.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{publicity}} the correspondence created, a freedom of information <b>request</b> <b>was</b> lodged concerning Project A119. It was only then that A Study of Lunar Research Flights– Volume I was made public, over forty years after its inception. A search for the other volumes of documentation revealed that other reports were destroyed in the 1980s by the Illinois Institute of Technology.|$|E
5|$|As part of WS-202A, {{a design}} for a {{high-speed}} (Mach 3+) aerial target for use in testing the F-108's weapons system was proposed. The Wright Air Development Center requested the designation XQ-11 for the target design; the <b>request</b> <b>was</b> denied due to the early stage of development, and the F-108 program was cancelled before further work was undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Colbung {{continued}} {{to press for}} the exhumation, asking that it be performed before the 164th anniversary of Yagan's death on 11 July, so that the anniversary could be the occasion of a celebration. His <b>request</b> <b>was</b> not met, and {{on the anniversary of}} Yagan's death, Colbung conducted a short memorial service at the burial plot in Everton. He returned to Australia empty-handed on 15 July.|$|E
30|$|To {{start an}} relay service, the MS j needs to {{initiate}} an relay service request (“request” for short in {{the remainder of}} the paper) first, indicating the requested transmission duration, denoted by D_j^k, where k is the index of the time slot when the <b>request</b> <b>is</b> made. In addition, we use D_j^k= 0 to indicate that no <b>request</b> <b>is</b> made in the kth time slot. The relay service <b>request</b> <b>is</b> processed by the assigned RS and an admission control decision is made instantaneously. Specifically, whenever both the uncommitted channel resource and energy resource of the RS are sufficient to fulfill the MS’s relay service <b>request,</b> this <b>request</b> <b>is</b> admitted. Otherwise, the <b>request</b> <b>is</b> rejected.|$|R
50|$|The HDLC module on {{the other}} end transmits (UA) frame when the <b>request</b> <b>is</b> accepted. And if the <b>request</b> <b>is</b> {{rejected}} it sends (DM) disconnect mode frame.|$|R
30|$|Analogous proof holds if one <b>request</b> <b>is</b> served. This {{analysis}} is helpful for a PU {{to decide if}} a <b>request</b> <b>is</b> to be admitted or rejected based on the sensitivity of reward to arrival rates of different classes.|$|R
5|$|In 1987, {{after the}} re-inauguration of another work of Agustín Ross, the Ross Park, a <b>request</b> <b>was</b> {{made to the}} National Monuments Council that both the park and the former casino be {{declared}} Monumentos Históricos (National Monuments); they were so designated on 25 February 1988.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 2008, Harper asked Governor General Michaëlle Jean to prorogue {{parliament}} {{to avoid a}} vote of confidence scheduled for the following Monday, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so. The <b>request</b> <b>was</b> granted by Jean, and the prorogation lasted until January 26, 2009. The opposition coalition dissolved shortly after, with the Conservatives winning a Liberal supported confidence vote on January 29, 2009.|$|E
5|$|While {{surveying}} {{damage in}} southwestern Arizona, a <b>request</b> <b>was</b> made to then-Governor Raul Hector Castro for $750,000 in emergency services funds.

50|$|FScan is a disk {{scheduling}} algorithm {{to determine}} {{the motion of the}} disk's arm and head in servicing read and write requests.It uses two subqueues. During the scan, all of the <b>requests</b> <b>are</b> in the first queue and all new <b>requests</b> <b>are</b> put into the second queue. Thus, service of new <b>requests</b> <b>is</b> deferred until all of the old <b>requests</b> have <b>been</b> processed. When the scan ends, the arm is taken to the first queue entries and is started all over again.|$|R
50|$|On her arrival, <b>requests</b> <b>were</b> {{made for}} {{improved}} electrical, heating, and communications gear and {{installation of a}} fathometer, radar, and keel-mounted sonar.

5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains to be transported back to Hong Kong; the <b>request</b> <b>was</b> eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the <b>request</b> <b>was</b> rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E
5|$|Above ground, American and Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had escaped death or capture tried {{to escape from the}} North Vietnamese. From the team house, a group of four Americans and about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was no visible sign of the North Vietnamese. Without much difficulty, the Americans and the CIDG soldiers were able {{to make it through the}} barbed-wire barrier, but North Vietnamese soldiers on the eastern side of the camp had detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two Americans and about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge in a dry creek bed that offered some cover and concealment. At around 03:30am, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his <b>request</b> <b>was</b> turned down. In an attempt to save the defenders at Lang Vei, Company C Headquarters in Da Nang tried to call for reinforcements from the Marines at Khe Sanh, but its <b>request</b> <b>was</b> also turned down. Finally, Company C Headquarters placed another Mobile Strike Force Company and a company-sized unit on standby alert in Da Nang, to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his first overseas tour, {{he returned to}} the United States in February 1943 and was assigned to the First Battalion, 23rd Marines, 4th Marine Division at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. When his unit moved to California he again asked for relief as a field musician; and for permission to perform line duties. Again, due to the shortage of buglers in the Marine Corps, his <b>request</b> <b>was</b> denied. Throughout the course of World War II, until his death on Iwo Jima, Cole participated in several battles and campaigns as a machine-gunner and was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1944.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} with San Diego, Hamilton {{was traded to}} the Toronto Blue Jays on December 12, 1998, for Peter Tucci, Carlos Almanzar, and Woody Williams. Analysts believe that Toronto {{acquired}} Hamilton if Roger Clemens's trade <b>request</b> <b>was</b> successful. Hamilton began the 1999 season with the Syracuse SkyChiefs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Blue Jays. He started three games, recording one loss, no wins, and a 5.11 ERA in 12 innings pitched. The Blue Jays called him up, and Hamilton made 18 starts in 22 games pitched. Pitching in 98 innings, he went 78 with a 6.52 ERA.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His <b>request</b> <b>was</b> accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} {{of a series}} of requests to which compliance is highly likely (high-probability requests) immediately antecedent to low-probability <b>requests</b> has <b>been</b> used to establish behavioral momentum of compliance. We evaluated a fading procedure for maintaining high levels of compliance obtained with high-probability requests. Fading involved a systematic {{reduction in the number of}} high-probability requests and an increase in the latency between the high- and low-probability requests. High levels of compliance for both “do” and “don't” <b>requests</b> <b>were</b> maintained for 16 weeks in a 5 -year-old boy with developmental disabilities after the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence <b>was</b> faded. Similar maintenance was obtained for “do” requests in a 15 -year-old girl with developmental disabilities. For this subject, however, the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence <b>was</b> ineffective with “don't” requests. When “don't” <b>requests</b> <b>were</b> phrased as “do” requests, the high-probability request sequence produced high levels of compliance to the low-probability request. High levels of compliance to these “do” <b>requests</b> <b>were</b> maintained for 16 weeks after the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence <b>was</b> faded...|$|R
30|$|Performance {{criteria}} BP, RU and CT {{were computed}} {{according to the}} traffic load. For each traffic load value, 5 × 105 <b>requests</b> <b>were</b> generated. This number of <b>requests</b> <b>is</b> enough to measure BP, RU and CT with a 95 % confidence interval.|$|R

5|$|After the {{university}} moved to Hamilton in 1930, {{the university}} petitioned Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh for {{a coat of}} arms. The <b>request</b> <b>was</b> granted on behalf of The Crown on 20 October 1930. In 1997 the Board of Governors introduced a simplified shield design, which recognized the tradition of McMaster’s heraldry while {{improving the quality of}} print and electronic reproduction. The university's arms and badge was registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 15 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Amado Boudou, {{who served}} as {{minister}} of economy during Kirchner's first term and vice president during the second, was suspected of corruption in 2012 case. The Ciccone Calcografica printing company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, but this <b>request</b> <b>was</b> cancelled when businessman Alejandro Vandenbroele bought it. The company received tax breaks to pay its debts, and was selected to print banknotes of the Argentine peso. It is suspected that Vandenbroele is actually a frontman for Boudou, and that he employed his clout as minister of economy to benefit a company that actually belonged to him.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Australian {{fears of}} a Japanese counterattack grew and they {{requested}} reinforcements from their higher commander, General Douglas MacArthur. However, the <b>request</b> <b>was</b> denied as MacArthur's intelligence staff believed that there were only 350Japanese in the vicinity. Actually, there were already 5,000Japanese around Sattelberg and Finschhafen while throughout early October this number grew to 12,000 {{as they began to}} prepare for their planned counterattack. The Australians received some reinforcements {{in the shape of the}} 2/43rd Infantry Battalion. The arrival of this unit meant that the 2/17th, deadlocked around Jivevaneng, could be freed for the advance on Finschhafen, thus enabling the entire 20th Brigade to concentrate on that objective.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the static caching {{algorithm}} that keeps the most frequently requested documents in the cache is optimal in case when documents are of the same size and <b>requests</b> <b>are</b> independent and equally distributed.
