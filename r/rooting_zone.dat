Maize plants {{were raised in}} split-root containers and irrigated on both halves of the container (conventional irrigation, CI), on one side only (fixed PRI, FPRI), or alternately on one of two sides (alternate PRI, APRI). Results show that crop water consumption was significantly correlated with Lsr in both the whole and irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zones</b> for all three irrigation methods but not with Lsr in the non-irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of FPRI. The total Lsr in the irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of two PRIs was increased by 49. 0 – 92. 0 % compared with that in a half <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of CI, suggesting that PRI has a significant compensatory effect of root water uptake. For CI, the contribution of Lsr in a half <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> to Lsr in the whole <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> was ∼ 50 %. For FPRI, the Lsr in the irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> was close {{to that of the}} whole <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> As for APRI, the Lsr in the irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> was greater than that of the non-irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> In comparison, the Lsr in the non-irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> of APRI was much higher than that in the dried zone of FPRI. The Lsr in both the whole and irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zones</b> was linearly correlated with soil moisture in the irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> for all three irrigation methods. For the two PRI treatments, total water uptake by plants was largely determined by the soil water in the irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> Nevertheless, the non-irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> under APRI also contributed to part of the total crop water uptake, but the continuously non-irrigated <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> under FPRI gradually ceased to contribute to crop water uptake, suggesting that it is the APRI that can make use of all the root system for water uptake, resulting in higher water use efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater can be {{a source}} of both water and salts in {{semiarid}} areas, and therefore, capillary pressure–induced upward water flow may cause <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> salinization. To identify which conditions result in hazardous salt concentrations in the <b>root</b> <b>zone,</b> we combined the mass balance equations for salt and water, further assuming a Poisson-distributed daily rainfall and brackish groundwater quality. For the water fluxes (leaching, capillary upflow, and evapotranspiration), we account for osmotic effects of the dissolved salt mass using Van‘t Hoff's law. <b>Root</b> <b>zone</b> salinity depends on salt transport via capillary flux and on evapotranspiration, which concentrates salt in the <b>root</b> <b>zone.</b> Both a wet climate and shallow groundwater lead to wetter <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> conditions, which in combination with periodic rainfall enhances salt removal by leaching. For wet climates, <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> salinity (concentrations) increases as groundwater is more shallow (larger groundwater influence). For dry climates, salinity increases as groundwater is deeper because of a drier <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> and less leaching. For intermediate climates, opposing effects can push the salt balance either way. <b>Root</b> <b>zone</b> salinity increases almost linearly with groundwater salinity. With a simple analytical approximation, maximum concentrations can be related to the mean capillary flow rate, leaching rate, water saturation, and groundwater salinity for different soils, climates, and groundwater depths...|$|R

However, satellites can only measure {{water in the}} top few centimeters of the soil. <b>Root</b> <b>zone</b> {{soil moisture}} is more important, particularly in vegetated regions. Therefore estimates of <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> soil moisture must be inferred from near-surface soil moisture retrievals.

This study uses cross correlation analysis to quantify the association between near-surface and <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> soil moisture using in situ data from the United States Great Plains. Our analysis demonstrates that there is generally a strong relationship between near-surface (5 – 10 cm) and <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> (25 – 60 cm) soil moisture. An exponential decay filter is used to estimate <b>root</b> <b>zone</b> soil moisture using near-surface soil moisture derived from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. <b>Root</b> <b>zone</b> soil moisture derived from SMOS surface retrievals is compared to in situ soil moisture observations in the United States Great Plains.

Marshes provide habitats for many kinds of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl and aquatic mammals. Marshes have extremely high levels of biological production, some of the highest in the world, and therefore are important in supporting fisheries. [...] Marshes also improve water quality by acting as a sink to filter pollutants and sediment from the water that flows through them.
