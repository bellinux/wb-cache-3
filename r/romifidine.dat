Study design: Blinded randomized experimental cross-over study. Animals: Ten adult horses. Methods: Degree of sedation {{was assessed by}} head height above ground (HHAG). Effects on PI, A and reaction to visual, tactile and acoustic stimulation were assessed by numerical rating scale (NRS) and by visual analogue scale (VAS). After baseline measurements, horses were sedated by intravenous loading doses of xylazine (1 mg kg− 1) or <b>romifidine</b> (80 μg kg− 1) administered over 3 minutes, immediately followed by a CRI of xylazine (0. 69 mg kg− 1 hour− 1) or <b>romifidine</b> (30 μg kg− 1 hour− 1) which was administered for 120 minutes. Degree of sedation, PI, A and reaction to the different stimuli were measured at different time points before, during and for one hour after discontinuing drug administration. Data were analysed using two-way repeated measures anova, a Generalized Linear Model and a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (p < 0. 05). Results: Significant changes over time were seen for all variables. With xylazine HHAG was significantly lower 10 minutes after the loading dose, and higher at 150 and 180 minutes (i. e. after CRI cessation) compared to <b>romifidine.</b> Reaction to acoustic stimulation was significantly more pronounced with xylazine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} antinociceptive effects of the three alpha- 2 agonists, detomidine, <b>romifidine</b> and xylazine at doses considered equipotent for sedation, using the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) and temporal summation model in standing horses. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, blinded, randomized cross-over study. ANIMALS: Ten healthy adult horses weighing 527 - 645 kg and aged 11 - 21 years old. METHODS: Electrical stimulation {{was applied to the}} digital nerves to evoke NWR and temporal summation in the left thoracic limb and pelvic limb of each horse. Electromyographic reflex activity was recorded from the common digital extensor and the cranial tibial muscles. After baseline measurements a single bolus dose of detomidine, 0. 02 mg kg(- 1), <b>romifidine</b> 0. 08 mg kg(- 1), or xylazine, 1 mg kg(- 1), was administered intravenously (IV). Determinations of NWR and temporal summation thresholds were repeated at 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 90, 100, 120 and 130 minutes after test-drug administration alternating the thoracic limb and the pelvic limb. Depth of sedation was assessed before measurements at each time point. Behavioural reaction was observed and recorded following each stimulation. RESULTS: The administration of detomidine, <b>romifidine</b> and xylazine significantly increased the current intensities necessary to evoke NWR and temporal summation in thoracic limbs and pelvic limbs of all horses compared with baseline. Xylazine increased NWR thresholds over baseline values for 60 minutes, while detomidine and <b>romifidine</b> increased NWR thresholds over baseline for 100 and 120 minutes, respectively.

Blood samples were collected from the pulmonary artery before and after loading doses, during the CRI, and for 1 h after discontinuing drugs. Blood glucose, base excess (BE), pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pv¯CO 2), strong ion difference (SIDest) and bicarbonate concentration ([Formula: see text]) increased significantly during the CRI with both alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists. Chloride concentration ([Cl-]B) and anion-gap (AG) decreased significantly compared to baseline. The decrease in sodium concentration ([Na+]B) was only significant with xylazine. From 1 h after starting the CRI onwards, [Glu]B was significantly higher with <b>romifidine</b> compared to xylazine.

Each dog received, as preanesthetic protocol, atropine (10 microg/kg, IM) and <b>romifidine</b> (40 microg/kg, IM); induction was delivered with propofol or thiopentone and anesthesia was maintained with halothane and N 2 O for 1 h. Some cardiovascular and respiratory variables and recovery times were recorded. Induction doses of propofol or thiopentone and the percentage of halothane necessary for maintaining anesthesia were also registered. Thiopentone as an induction agent is more respiratory depressive but is less hypotensive than propofol. Thiopentone reduces further the percentage of halothane necessary for maintaining the anesthesia. However, the quality of recovery is poorer, as the time to extubation is longer and the dogs occasionally had a violent recovery. The combination of <b>romifidine,</b> atropine, propofol, halothane, and N 2 O appears to be an effective combination for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia in healthy dogs...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} usefulness of constant rate infusion (CRI) protocols of <b>romifidine</b> {{with or without}} butorphanol for sedation of horses. Study design: Prospective ‘blinded’ controlled trial using block randomization. Animals: Forty healthy Freiberger stallions. Methods: The horses received either intravenous (IV) <b>romifidine</b> (loading dose: 80 μg kg− 1; infusion: 30 μg kg− 1 hour− 1) (treatment R, n = 20) or <b>romifidine</b> combined with butorphanol (<b>romifidine</b> loading: 80 μg kg− 1; infusion: 29 μg kg− 1 hour− 1, and butorphanol loading: 18 μg kg− 1; infusion: 25 μg kg− 1 hour− 1) (treatment RB, n = 20). Twenty-one horses underwent dentistry and ophthalmic procedures, while 19 horses underwent only ophthalmologic procedure and buccal examination. During the procedure, physiologic parameters and occurrence of head/muzzle shaking or twitching and forward movement were recorded. Whenever sedation was insufficient, additional <b>romifidine</b> (20 μg kg− 1) was administered IV. Recovery time was evaluated by assessing head height above ground. At {{the end of the}} procedure, overall quality of sedation for the procedure was scored by the dentist and anaesthetist using a visual analogue scale. Statistical analyses used two-way anova or linear mixed models as relevant. Results: Sedation quality scores as assessed by the anaesthetist were R: median 7. 55, range: 4. 9 – 9. 0 cm, RB: 8. 8, 4. 7 – 10. 0 cm, and by the dentist R: 6. 6, 3. 0 – 8. 2 cm, RB: 7. 9, 6. 6 – 8. 8 cm. Horses receiving RB showed clinically more effective sedation as demonstrated by fewer poor scores and a tendency to reduced additional drug requirements. More horses showed forward movement and head shaking in treatment RB than treatment R. Three horses (two RB, one R) had symptoms of colic following sedation. Conclusions and clinical relevance: The described protocols provide effective sedation under clinical conditions but for dentistry procedures, the addition of butorphanol is advantageous...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} a constant rate infusion (CRI) of <b>romifidine</b> on the requirement of isoflurane, cardiovascular performance and recovery in anaesthetized horses undergoing arthroscopic surgery. Study design: Randomized blinded prospective clinical trial. Animals: Thirty horses scheduled for routine arthroscopy. Methods: After premedication (acepromazine 0. 02 mg kg- 1, <b>romifidine</b> 80 mu g kg- 1, methadone 0. 1 mg kg- 1) and induction (midazolam 0. 06 mg kg- 1 ketamine 2. 2 mg kg- 1), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Horses were assigned randomly to receive a CRI of saline (group S) or 40 mu g kg- 1 hour- 1 <b>romifidine</b> (group R). The influences of time and treatment on anaesthetic and cardiovascular parameters were evaluated using an analysis of variance. Body weight (t-test), duration of anaesthesia (t-test) and recovery score (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p < 0. 05. Results: All but one horse were positioned in the dorsal recumbent position and ventilated from the start of anaesthesia. End tidal isoflurane concentrations were similar in both groups at similar time points and over the whole anaesthetic period. Cardiac output was significantly lower in horses of the R group, but {{there were no significant differences}} between groups in cardiac index, body weight or age. All other cardiovascular parameters were similar in both groups. Quality of recovery did not differ significantly between groups, but more horses in group R stood without ataxia at the first attempt. One horse from group S had a problematic recovery. Conclusions and clinical relevance: No inhalation anaesthetic sparing effect or side effects were observed by using a 40 mu g kg- 1 hour- 1 <b>romifidine</b> CRI in isoflurane anaesthetized horses under clinical conditions. Cardiovascular performance remained acceptable. Further studies are needed to identify the effective dose of <b>romifidine</b> that will induce an inhalation anaesthetic sparing effect in anaesthetized horses...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of desflurane after induction of anesthesia with propofol in dogs sedated with <b>romifidine</b> or medetomidine. Each of 8 healthy dogs received intravenously, in random order, 3 preanesthetic protocols: <b>romifidine,</b> 40 μg/kg of body weight (BW) (R 40); <b>romifidine,</b> 80 μg/kg BW (R 80); and medetomidine, 10 μg/kg BW (MED). Cardiovascular and respiratory variables were recorded during the procedure. Time to extubation, time to sternal recumbency, and time to standing were also recorded. Heart rate and respiratory rate decreased significantly during sedation from baseline values, but there were no differences between the means for the 3 preanesthetic protocols. Mean values for heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, respiratory rate, tidal volume, arterial oxygen level, pH, and arterial blood gas values during anesthesia were similar for the 3 protocols. The mean saturation, end-tidal CO 2 end-tidal desflurane concentration was significantly lower with the R 80 protocol than with the R 40 protocol. The mean time to extubation was significantly shorter with the R 40 protocol than with the R 80 and MED protocols...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{the study reported here}} was to determine the onset, duration, and degree of analgesia achieved with a combination of <b>romifidine</b> (50 μg/kg body weight [BW]) and morphine (0. 1 mg/kg BW) administered epidurally. Ten adult Holstein Friesen cows were assigned to either a treatment group receiving the <b>romifidine</b> and morphine combination or a control group receiving 0. 9 % saline in a randomized, blinded, crossover design. Cows were assessed for degree of flank analgesia and systemic sedation at various time intervals over a period of 24 hours. The <b>romifidine</b> and morphine combination, compared with saline, provided significant analgesia for at least 10 minutes (P = 0. 016) and up to 12 hours (P = 0. 004) after epidural administration. Treated cows were sedate between 10 minutes (P = 0. 016) and 6 hours (P = 0. 002) after epidural administration. These results provide evidence for a potential cost-effective intra- and postoperative method of analgesia; however, the sedation seen in this study could be detrimental to patients expected return to the farm shortly after surgery. Further research into withdrawal times, systemic effects, and potential adverse effects are needed before an opiod and α 2 -adrenergic agonist combination can be used safely in a clinical settin...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate dissociative anaesthesia for castration of colts during field conditions. Three dissociative anaesthetic protocols were evaluated during castration of colts in an animal hospital. The protocol considered to be the most suitable was thereafter evaluated during castration of colts under field conditions. Respiratory and haemodynamic parameters and the response to surgery were determined during anaesthesia. All horses breathed air spontaneously during anaesthesia. Under hospital conditions 26 colts were randomised to receive one of three anaesthetic protocols: <b>Romifidine</b> and tiletamine-zolazepam (RZ); acepromazine, <b>romifidine</b> and tiletamine-zolazepam (ARZ); or acepromazine, <b>romifidine,</b> butorphanol and tiletamine-zolazepam (ARBZ). The surgeon was blinded to the anaesthetic protocol used and decided whether supplemental anaesthesia was needed to complete surgery. Under field conditions 31 colts were castrated during anaesthesia with the ARBZ protocol. All inductions, anaesthesia and recoveries were calm and without excitation under both hospital and field conditions. Surgery was performed within 5 – 20 minutes after the horses had assumed lateral recumbency during both hospital and field castrations. Under hospital conditions some horses needed supplemental anaesthesia with all three anaesthetic protocols to complete surgery. Interestingly, none of the horses castrated with protocol ARBZ under field conditions needed additional anaesthesia. Cardiorespiratory changes were within acceptable limits in these clinically healthy colts. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to evaluate <b>romifidine</b> as a premedicant in dogs prior to propofol-halothane-N 2 O anesthesia, and to compare it with the other alpha 2 -agonists (medetomidine and xylazine). For this, ten healthy dogs were anesthetized. Each dog received 3 preanesthetic protocols: atropine (10 microg/kg BW, IM), and as a sedative, <b>romifidine</b> (ROM; 40 microg/kg BW, IM), xylazine (XYL; 1 microg/kg, IM), or medetomidine (MED; 20 microg/kg BW, IM). Induction of anesthesia was delivered with propofol 15 min later and maintained with halothane and N 2 O for one hour in all cases. The following variables were registered before preanesthesia, 10 min after the administration of preanesthesia, and at 5 -minute intervals during maintenance: PR, RR, rectal temperature (RT), MAP, SAP, and DAP. During maintenance, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2), end-tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2) and percentage of halothane necessary for maintaining anesthesia (%HAL) were also recorded. Induction dose of propofol (DOSE), time to extubation (TE), time to sternal recumbency (TSR) and time to standing (TS) were also registered. The statistical analysis was carried out during the anesthetic period. ANOVA for repeat measures revealed no differences between the 3 groups for PR and RR; however, MAP, SAP and DAP were higher in the MED group; SpO 2 was lower in MED and EtCO 2 was lower in ROM; %HAL was higher in XYL. No statistical differences were observed in DOSE, TE, TSR or TS. Percentage of halothane was lower in <b>romifidine</b> and medetomidine than in xylazine premedicated dogs also anesthetized with propofol. All the cardiorespiratory variables measured were within normal limits. The studied combination of <b>romifidine,</b> atropine, propofol, halothane and N 2 O appears to be a safe and effective drug combination for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia in healthy dogs...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} an anesthetic association with and without the use of a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant agent and its effect on intraocular pressure of horses, and also obtain an anesthetic technique free of adverse effects for ophthalmic surgeries in this specie. Sixteen horses were randomly divided in two groups of eight horses each. In group I, horses were pre-medicated with <b>romifidine,</b> anesthesia induced with tiletamine/zolazepam and maintained with halothane and vecuronium. Horses of group II received the same anesthetic association except for vecuronium. Intraocular pressure, arterial pressure and heart rate were evaluated in different moments during the experiment. The anesthetic association composed by <b>romifidine,</b> tiletamine/zolazepam and halothane with and without vecuronium did not promote statistically significant alterations in horses intraocular pressure and its use is practicable in ophthalmologic procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of <b>romifidine</b> alone (50 Âµg/kg) and a combination of <b>romifidine</b> (50 Âµg/kg) and ketamine (2. 5 mg/kg) after intrathecal administration in goats. Ten adult goats of either sex weighing between 15 and 20 kg were randomly placed in 2 groups (groups I and II). The agents were administered at the lumbosacral subarachnoid space. Clinico-physiological parameters such as analgesia, motor incoordination, sedation, salivation, heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial pressure, central venous pressure and rectal temperature were studied. Other haematobiochemical parameters monitored were packed cell volume, haemoglobin, plasma proteins, glucose, urea and creatinine. The onset of analgesia was faster in group II (35. 5 Â± 6. 25 s) compared to that of group I (5. 2 Â± 0. 54 min). Analgesia of the tail, perineum, hind limbs, flank and thorax was mild to moderate in group I, but complete analgesia of tail, perineum and hind limbs was recorded in group II. Motor incoordination was mild in group I and severe in group II. Significant reduction in heart rate (more pronounced in group I) and respiratory rate (more pronounced in group II), and a significant increase in central venous pressure were recorded in both groups. Mean arterial pressure was reduced in both groups, but more markedly in group I. Sedation, electro-cardiogram, rectal temperature and haemato-biochemical parameters did not show significant differences between the 2 groups. The results of this study indicated a possible synergistic analgesic interaction between intrathecally administered <b>romifidine</b> and ketamine, without causing any marked systemic effects in goats...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the effects of different drug combinations for premedication and dissociative anaesthesia, to examine their suitability for field conditions and their ability to maintain cardiorespiratory function and provide sufficient analgesia for common, but challenging procedures such as castration. Haemodynamic parameters, pulmonary ventilation-perfusion relationships, and clinical effects were studied during sedation and dissociative anaesthesia. The effects of additional premedication and prolongation of dissociative anaesthesia and response to surgery were evaluated. The cardiorespiratory effects of <b>romifidine</b> and tiletamine-zolazepam anaesthesia did not differ significantly from those of prolonged <b>romifidine</b> and ketamine anaesthesia. Prolongation of anaesthesia with ketamine alone after romifidine/ketamine resulted in a poor quality of anaesthesia. There was a decrease in arterial oxygenation during sedation with a 2 -agonists, which was mainly attributed to a reduced cardiac output and increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch. During dissociative anaesthesia the cardiac output did normalise, but arterial oxygenation was further impaired as a result of increased intrapulmonary shunt and increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Administration of acepromazine before sedation with <b>romifidine</b> and butorphanol resulted in better maintenance of circulation and partly prevented the anaesthesia-induced ventilation-perfusion disturbances and fall in arterial oxygen tension. Although the arterial oxygenation was further impaired during anaesthesia and recumbency compared to that during sedation, the oxygen delivery did not decrease further. On the contrary, the arterial-mixed venous oxygen content difference and mixed venous oxygen tension remained closer to standing unsedated values during anaesthesia than in the sedated horse. Breathing high oxygen concentrations (> 95 % oxygen) during dissociative anaesthesia improved arterial oxygenation compared to air breathing (21 % oxygen), but concomitantly increased intrapulmonary shunt and introduced hypoventilation. The intrapulmonary shunt created during anaesthesia with high oxygen concentrations persisted when the horses returned to air breathing, possibly indicating that resorption atelectasis produced during high oxygen breathing subsequently persisted during anaesthesia and recumbency. Tiletamine-zolazepam anaesthesia, after premedication with acepromazine, <b>romifidine</b> and butorphanol, produced anaesthesia and analgesia sufficient for castration of colts under field conditions. When the same regimen was used in the animal hospital there was a need for supplementary anaesthesia in some cases to complete surgery. The induction, anaesthesia and recovery were calm and without excitation in all colts both under hospital and field conditions. Cardiorespiratory changes during air breathing were within acceptable limits in these clinically healthy horses...|$|E
40|$|Com o objetivo de verificar a viabilidade do uso da romifidina em muares e avaliar seus efeitos sedativos na espécie, utilizou-se essa droga para contenção farmacológica de burros não domados, submetidos à orquiectomia bilateral. Em uma primeira etapa, visando a verificar sua viabilidade, a romifidina foi aplicada por via intravenosa em oito animais nas doses de 0, 04 e 0, 08 mg/kg. Já na Segunda etapa, compararam-se seus efeitos sedativos após a aplicação, por via {{intramuscular}}, das doses de 0, 04, 0, 08 e 0, 12 mg/kg, em três grupos de sete animais. Os sinais da sedação induzida pela romifidina foram semelhantes aos já descritos para eqüinos, porém, verificou-se menor intensidade, dentro das doses utilizadas. Apesar da via intravenosa ter produzido efeitos mais intensos, a via intramuscular foi a da escolha devido à facilidade e à segurança da aplicação, sendo a dose de 0, 12 mg/kg a que produziu melhores resultados. A romifidina foi considerada como uma opção viável para contenção de muares não domados. With the intetion {{to study}} {{the viability of the}} use and the sedative effects of the <b>romifidine</b> in mules, this drug was used for chemical restraint in untamed burros, that were subjected to bilateral orquiectomy. In a first fase, the viability was investigated in eight animals that were injected intravenously with 0. 04 and 0. 08 mg/kg. In a second fase, the sedative effects were compared in three groups of seven animals that were injected with intramuscular doses of 0. 04, 0. 08 and 0. 12 mg/kg. The sedative signs of <b>romifidine</b> in mules were similar with that had been described for equine, however lower intensity were seen with same doses. Indeed the intravenous route produced effects more intense, the facility and safety made the intramuscular route better. By this route the 0. 12 mg/kg dose was the most efficient.

40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} changes {{associated with}} anesthesia induced and maintained with romifidine/ketamine versus xylazine/ketamine were compared using 6 horses in a cross over design. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with <b>romifidine</b> (100 μg/kg, IV) /ketamine (2. 0 mg/kg, IV) and ketamine (0. 1 mg/kg/min, IV), respectively, in horses {{assigned to the}} romifidine/ketamine group. Horses assigned to the xylazine/ketamine group had anesthesia induced and maintained with xylazine (1. 0 mg/kg, IV) /ketamine (2. 0 mg/kg, IV) and a combination of xylazine (0. 05 mg/kg/min, IV) and ketamine (0. 1 mg/kg/min, IV), respectively. Cardiopulmonary variables were measured at intervals up to 40 min after induction. All horses showed effective sedation following intravenous <b>romifidine</b> or xylazine and achieved recumbency after ketamine administration. There {{were no significant differences}} between groups in heart rate, arterial oxygen partial pressures, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressures, cardiac index, stroke index, oxygen delivery, oxygen utilization, systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular work, or any of the measured systemic arterial blood pressures. Cardiac index and left ventricular work fell significantly from baseline while systemic vascular resistance increased from baseline in both groups. The oxygen utilization ratio was higher in the xylazine group at 5 and 15 min after induction. In conclusion, the combination of romifidine/ketamine results in similar cardiopulmonary alterations as a xylazine/ketamine regime, and is a suitable alternative for clinical anesthesia of the horse from a cardiopulmonary viewpoint...|$|E
