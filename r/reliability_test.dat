40|$|Abstract ⎯ This paper {{presents}} RANDREL, a simulator based trainer for <b>reliability</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Reliability</b> <b>testing</b> {{is modeled}} as a random {{walk through the}} program execution state space into which an initial set of faults has been seeded. When a fault is encountered during the simulation, a failure is reported, the tester fixes the fault and resumes <b>reliability</b> <b>testing.</b> After each failure, the reliability growth model is updated and used {{to determine whether the}} reliability goal has been achieved. RANDREL provides a low-cost environment for learning <b>reliability</b> <b>testing</b> and modeling, and for exploring factors that contribute to the effectiveness of <b>reliability</b> <b>testing.</b> This paper describes the capabilities of RANDREL and the methodology being used to validate the model.

40|$|To {{solve the}} problem about {{software}} <b>reliability</b> <b>testing</b> cases and testing data generation of real-time control systems, this study applies the <b>reliability</b> <b>testing</b> cases generation approach based on the mixture of operation profile and Markov chain which describes software operation profile by the use cases of UML, establishes the use model based on UML model for automatically deriving the testing model from the use model, generates a <b>reliability</b> <b>testing</b> case set based on the testing model and generates testing input data of <b>reliability</b> <b>testing</b> semi-automatically by eliciting input and output variables and abstracting testing input and output classes. The results of <b>reliability</b> <b>testing</b> on the actual airborne software show that {{the framework of the}} test case set generated by the proposed model is fairly stable. Thus, the proposed approach is suitable for generating <b>reliability</b> <b>testing</b> data of the real-time control system software semi-automatically, greatly simplifies the <b>reliability</b> <b>testing</b> process, improves testing efficiency and ensures testing validity...|$|R
