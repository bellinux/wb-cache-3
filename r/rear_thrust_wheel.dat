When traversing loose soil, the wheel sinks into the soil, which necessitates knowledge of the entrance angle needed in order to avoid this problem. If the entrance angle is known, the sinkage can be measured in real time before adverse conditions occur. Because of the importance and usefulness of detecting the entrance angle of the wheel, we herein propose a grouser with an embedded tactile sensor.

40|$|An {{elastic model}} is {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} initiation of normal and thrust faults in thrust wedges. The model assumes frictional sliding along the base and a linear variation of shear and normal tractions with depth along the <b>rear</b> of the <b>thrust</b> wedge. Using this model, the roles of basal friction, pore fluid pressure, and wedge configuration in controlling the mechanics of thrust wedges were evaluated. The model predicts coeval development of normal and thrust faults in the same thrust wedge and a listric shape for both thrust and normal faults. In particular, lower friction favors dominantly horizontal compression in a thrust wedge, whereas higher friction can produce dominantly horizontal extension. Wedges bounded by steep thrusts (> 45 ø) {{are more likely to}} experience extension regardless of their sizes and the boundary conditions applied. For wedges bounded by shallow-dipping thrusts (< 15 ø) and under the same boundary conditions, shorter wedges are more dominated by compression than longer wedges. Using this model, the length of a Hubbert-Rubey titrust toe (deftned as the length of the unfractured, frontal portion of a thrust wedge) is calculated. With the same boundary conditions and mechanical properties, a thinner wedge, in general, favors a longer Hubbert-Rubey toe than a thicker wedge. This simple model is applied to explain the initiation of the short-lived Miocene normal fault system in the Higher Himalaya as a consequence of a rapid release of pore fluid pressure along the Main Central Thrust during the formation of two-mica leucogranites in the hanging wall. It also simulates the occurrence of normal faults associated with the E 1 Asnam thrust-type earthquake...|$|R
40|$|Future {{planetary}} exploration missions {{will require}} mobile robots to perform difficult tasks in highly challenging terrain, with limited human supervision. Current motion planning and control algorithms {{are not well}} suited to rough-terrain mobility, since they generally do not consider the physical characteristics of the rover and its environment. Failure to understand these characteristics could lead to rover entrapment and mission failure. In this thesis, methods are presented for improved rough-terrain mobile robot mobility, which exploit fundamental physical models of the rover and terrain. Wheel-terrain interaction {{has been shown to}} be critical to rough terrain mobility. A wheel-terrain interaction model is presented, and a method for on-line estimation of important model parameters is proposed. The local terrain profile also strongly influences robot mobility. A method for on-line estimation of wheel-terrain contact angles is presented. Simulation and experimental results show that wheel-terrain model parameters and contact angles can be estimated on-line with good accuracy. Two rough-terrain planning algorithms are introduced. First, a motion planning algorithm is presented that is computationally efficient and considers uncertainty in rover sensing and localization. Next, an algorithm for geometrically reconfiguring the rover kinematic structure to optimize tipover stability margin is presented. Both methods utilize models developed earlier in the thesis. (cont.) Simulation and experimental results on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Sample Return Rover show that the algorithms allow highly stable, semi-autonomous mobility in rough terrain. Finally, a rough-terrain control algorithm is presented that exploits the actuator redundancy found in multi-wheeled mobile robots to improve ground traction and reduce power consumption. The algorithm uses models developed earlier in the thesis. Simulation and experimental results show that the algorithm leads to improved <b>wheel</b> <b>thrust</b> and thus increased mobility in rough terrain. by Karl David Iagnemma. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{performance}} of a Quad Tilt Rotor (QTR) in helicopter mode was experimentally studied in ground effect (IGE) and out of ground effect (OGE). A 0. 03 geometrically scaled fuselage/wing model of the QTR was tested in hover and very low speed forward flight. Fixed-pitch propellers were used to model the rotors. In {{order to avoid the}} boundary layer problems associated with wind tunnel testing of rotorcraft IGE, a unique moving setup was developed for testing in forward flight. The effect of ground proximity was tested by varying the height of the model above the ground. Download on the airframe; thrust, torque and rpm of the rotors, and pressures along the centerline of the bottom of the fuselage were measured. The downwash distributions of the rotors were measured and found to compare well with V- 22 rotor measurements. Tuft flow visualization was used to identify the physical processes causing changes in the download and pressure measurements. An uncertainty analysis was performed on the measured quantities to determine the 95 % confidence levels. A strong download (9 % of the rotor thrust) was observed in hover, OGE. The download reduced substantially IGE and become an upload (9 % of the rotor <b>thrust),</b> when the <b>wheels</b> of the QTR were on the ground. The upload IGE was found to be caused by the entrapment of the rotor wakes under the fuselage. The upload was observed to persist in forward flight IGE, but reduced slightly at certain low skew angles. The measured downloads, coupled with power measurements, indicate that for a given power, the available vehicle thrust greatly increases IGE. Therefore, the QTR displays a potential for significant increase in payload carrying capacity by operating IGE...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnalog sandbox {{models have}} been set up to study the impact of syntectonic erosion on thrust wedges with one and two decollement levels. Different {{accretion}} mechanisms are activated depending on interactions between surface processes and wedge mechanics: frontal accretion, backthrusting, underthrusting and underplating due to decollement induced duplex formation at depth. These mechanisms may function simultaneously, being located at different parts across the wedge. For all the experiments, a high friction is imposed at the base of models and the volume of eroded material remains equal to the volume of newly accreted material, maintaining a constant surface slope during the shortening. Erosion limits the forward propagation of thrust wedges and favors the underthrusting of basal layers allowing duplex formation. Erosion promotes development of major backthrusts in the thrust wedges without or with one decollement, but no backthrusts was formed in the wedges with two decollements. Slow erosion allows lower extent of basal underthrusting in comparison with regular-rate erosion. Variations in the erosion taper lead to changes in duplex geometry and exhumation rate in thrust wedges with one or two decollements. The 6 degrees erosion taper promotes formation of antiformal stack at the <b>rear</b> part of <b>thrust</b> wedge, high rate of basal underthrusting and high extent of erosional removal. The cover layers are nearly completely eroded above the antiformal stack and form the synformal klippe in frontal part of thrust wedges. The 8 degrees erosion taper allows development of individual ramp-anticlines and active forward thrusting of cover layers above the decollement and low rate of basal underplating below it, with consequent low extent of erosional removal. The results of our experiments support the observations on structural evolution and erosion in the Alberta Foothills of the Canadian Rockies...|$|R
40|$|Progress {{has been}} made in the {{development}} of a family of robotic land vehicles having modular and minimalist design features chosen to impart a combination of robustness, reliability, and versatility. These vehicles at earlier stages of development were described in two previous NASA Tech Briefs articles: "Reconfigurable Exploratory Robotic Vehicles" (NPO- 20944), Vol. 25, No. 7 (July 2001), page 56; and "More About Reconfigurable Exploratory Robotic Vehicles" (NPO- 30890), Vol. 33, No. 8 (August 2009), page 40. Conceived for use in exploration of the surfaces of Mars and other remote planets, these vehicles could also be adapted to terrestrial applications, including exploration of volcanic craters or other hostile terrain, military reconnaissance, inspection of hazardous sites, and searching for victims of earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, or mining accidents. In addition, simplified versions of these vehicles might be marketable as toys. The most basic module in this family of reconfigurable robots is the Axel rover, which has a cylindrical body with two main wheels and a trailing link. Inside its body are three motors and associated mechanisms for driving the two wheels and for rotating the link 360 around its symmetrical body. The actuated link serves several purposes: It is used as a lever arm to react to the <b>wheels</b> <b>thrust</b> to move Axel in multiple directions. It is used to rotate the Axel housing in order to tilt, to the desired angle, any sensors and instruments mounted on or in the Axel housing. It provides an alternative mobility mode, which is primarily used in its tethered configuration. Turn ing the link into the ground in lieu of driving the wheels causes the Axel housing and wheels to roll as a unit and thereby leads to a tumbling motion along the ground. With a tether mounted around Axel s cylindrical body, the link serves as a winch mechanism to reel and unreel the tether raising and lowering Axel over steep and vertical surfaces (Figure 1). Sensors, computation, and communication modules are also housed inside Axel s body. A pair of stereo vision cameras provides three-dimensional view for autonomous navigation and avoiding obstacles. Inertial sensors determine the tilt of the robot and are used for estimating its motion. In a fully developed version, power would be supplied by rechargeable batteries aboard Axel; at the time of reporting the information for this article, power was supplied from an external source via a cable. In and of itself, the Axel rover is fully capable of traversing and sampling terrains on planetary surfaces. By use of only the two main wheel actuators and the caster link actuator, Axel can be made to follow an arbitrary path, turn in place, and operate upside- down or right-side-up. If operated in a tethered configuration, as shown in Figure 1, it can be made to move down and up a steep crater wall, descend from an overhang to a cave, and ascend from the cave back to the overhang, all by use of the same three actuators. Such tethered operation could be useful in searching for accident victims or missing persons in mines, caves, and rubble piles. Running the tether through the caster link enhances the stability of Axel and provides a restoring force that keeps the link off the ground for the most part during operation on a steep slope. In its extended configuration, two Axel modules can dock to either side of a payload module to form the four wheeled Axel 2 rover (Figure 2). Additional payload and Axel modules can dock to either side of the Axel 2 to form the Axel 3 rover, extending its payload capacity and its mobility capabilities...|$|R
