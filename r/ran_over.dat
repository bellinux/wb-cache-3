5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E

This remained the main coaching route until about 1800, when an alternative route via Winchester (now mostly the A31 and former A33) was formed. During this time, and up to the 19th century, the area was sometimes known as Morestead Down after the nearby village of Morestead.|$|E

When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, jump out of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E

5|$|The optimal {{crossing}} point <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> Norwegian Talc's plant, and would involve placing the western pylon {{in the middle}} of their area. The company offered the authorities free land on the condition that they received a satisfactory intersection with the bridge. A formal agreement was reached in mid-1970. On the eastern side, an area development plan had to be made, which was approved on 19 May 1967. The necessary land not already owned by the municipalities was expropriated.|$|E
5|$|When the two entered Roubaix, Wegmuller <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> {{a plastic}} bag that flew {{out in front of}} him, which became jammed in his derailleur. Wegmuller was unable to change gears which was crucial for a sprint finish. He got {{assistance}} from his team car to remove the bag, but his gears still would not change. Knowing that a bicycle change would be suicidal to his chances, Wegmuller continued on his damaged bike; Demol continued to draft behind him.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few days}} out of the line, the {{battalion}} resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, {{a few days}} later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The advance continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading. Despite expecting the worst, it crossed the Po River with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the Adige River was traversed the next day, again with relative ease. The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over the advance, with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve. Although the war was nearly over, care was still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of Padua and Gorizia, before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.|$|E

5|$|At the FBI, Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) {{discloses}} {{to a room}} {{of agents}} that Dana Scully’s (Gillian Anderson) son William has been abducted. Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> John Doggett (Robert Patrick).

The two eventually find William's car seat along with the cell phone in an abandoned SUV. Meanwhile, the Overcoat Woman reports to Josepho that she has William.|$|E
5|$|Following Watkin's {{retirement}} {{relations between}} the GCR and the MR deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> the MR from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the hostile MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway and a route into London that bypassed the MR. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began {{construction of a new}} line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5km) north of Quainton Road. Although formally an independent company, the new line was operated {{as a part of the}} GCR. A substantial part of GCR traffic to and from London was diverted onto the Alternative Route, reducing the significance of Quainton Road as an interchange and damaging the profitability of the MR.|$|E

Again exposing himself to enemy fire, Valdez moved across approximately fifty yards of open ground to another Marine. While treating the second Marine, he positioned himself between {{the man and the}} hostile fire. It was at this time that Valdez was mortally wounded by enemy small-arms fire.|$|E
