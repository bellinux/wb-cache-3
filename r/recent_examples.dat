5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two <b>recent</b> <b>examples.</b> Paleoartists and illustrators {{in particular have}} kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E
5|$|Partial classifications {{exist for}} many {{individual}} groups of organisms and are revised and replaced as new information becomes available, however comprehensive treatments of {{most or all}} life are rarer; two <b>recent</b> <b>examples</b> are that of Adl et al., 2012, which covers eukaryotes only {{with an emphasis on}} protists, and Ruggiero et al., 2015, covering both eukaryotes and prokaryotes to the rank of Order, although both exclude fossil representatives.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. <b>Recent</b> <b>examples</b> include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} industrial activities. Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. <b>Recent</b> <b>examples</b> of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E

Three of the four systems stalled across eastern Texas, prolonging the rainfall which occurred over Louisiana. If {{it were not for}} the intermittent invasions from tropical cyclones, rainfall during the months of August, September, and October would average about 25% less than it currently does.|$|E
