40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the size and}} the determinants of unexpected changes in EU countries' tax revenues {{and their impact on}} the ability of EU governments to use fiscal policy as a macroeconomic stabilisation device. We make use of information taken from the Stability and Convergence Programmes (SCP) setting countries' medium-term fiscal plans and focus on the period preceding the 2008 / 2009 global financial crisis. Tax revenue surprises are found to have fluctuated widely, alternating periods of sizeable windfalls and periods of substantial shortfalls. When analysing this, we find that GDP growth surprises and, in some cases (i. e. Ireland, Spain the UK and Finland) asset prices fluctuations have exerted the most significant influence. In the sequel we provide evidence on the incidence of these unexpected changes in governments' tax revenues on the ability of governments to conduct counter-cyclical fiscal policies, which are desirable from a macroeconomic perspective. We find that countries that have experienced the largest tax <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> {{in the run-up to the}} 2008 / 2009 crisis have also tended to run more pro-cyclical fiscal policies although these results vary depending on the use of ex-post vs. real-time data and on the method used to calculate the cyclical position of the economy. Put differently, these results tend to indicate that while tax <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> may be good for the public purse during favourable times they may also (paradoxically) dwindle the ability of the countries concerned to run counter-cyclical fiscal policies when cyclical conditions revert. european union eu tax <b>revenues</b> <b>windfalls</b> shortfalls business cycles fiscal policy stabilisation barrios rizza...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{government}} revenues in many EU countries experienced significant and erratic changes, which, a priori, {{could not be}} fully explained by macroeconomic developments or by discretionary fiscal policy measures. We investigate this issue by estimating “unexplained” changes in tax and social contribution revenues, based on proxies for tax revenue bases and elasticities commonly used for forecasting or cyclically adjusting {{government revenues}} and taking into account estimates {{of the impact of}} legislation changes. This is done for a selection of EU countries, including the “big five” euro area countries (Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands) together with Ireland, Latvia and Portugal. We also undertake the same exercise using alternative tax base proxies, either taken from forecasting models or on the basis of our knowledge of the tax system in each country. The results show that, in the aggregate, <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> and shortfalls have exhibited a broadly cyclical pattern, driven mainly by developments in profit-related taxes and, to a somewhat lesser extent, VAT. Other, more structural factors also play a role, such as declining consumption of fuel and tobacco, as well as factors specific to individual countries, such as developments in property markets. The estimated <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> and shortfalls can explain a substantial proportion of changes in the euro area cyclically adjusted budget balance over the period 1999 - 2007. Since these unexplained revenue changes have exhibited a largely cyclical character and might therefore be viewed as partly temporary, this highlights the importance of a careful interpretation of fiscal indicators adjusted for the economic cycle. Except in a small number of cases, the results do not change significantly when alternative tax base proxies are used, suggesting that the potential for improving existing indicators by a better matching of taxes to their bases is likely to be limited.

40|$|The {{speed and}} {{severity}} {{of the decline in}} the Irish fiscal position in recent years raises a number of important issues regarding the assessment of fiscal policy within the EU. From a position of relative strength, with large surpluses and a low debt to GDP ratio, the Irish public finances have rapidly deteriorated, culminating in an Excessive Deficit Procedure being launched in early 2009. In hindsight, it is evident that tax revenues were on an unsustainable path in recent years due, in large part, to structural imbalances within the economy, mainly associated with the housing market. The excess growth in the latter culminated in large and transitory tax <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls,</b> which ultimately proved unsustainable. These windfalls contributed to large general government and cyclically adjusted budget surpluses. This paper seeks to quantify the windfall gains associated with property taxes through modelling housing related tax receipts over the period 2002 to 2009. From this, estimates are derived as to the underlying or property adjusted fiscal position, which is found in various years, to have diverged greatly from actual outturns. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} of a “voracity effect” of <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> reducing growth by fostering rent-seeking and corruption is widely documented by the literature. However, the reverse hypothesis of a “scarcity effect” of revenue downfalls, stimulating corruption by creating resource shortages, has theoretical foundations but little empirical support. This paper fills this gap by providing an empirical analysis of the voracity and scarcity effects of export booms and busts on firm bribery in developing countries. Exploiting 19, 712 bribery reports from firms located in 36 developing countries, multilevel estimations of these effects are conducted. The results support a robust positive effect of both export booms and busts on bribery when democratic and financial institutions are weak. Conversely, a robust negative effect of booms and busts on bribery is evidenced when institutions are better off. Therefore, consistent with the literature, this paper provides additional evidence {{on the importance of}} institutional safeguards against corrupt practices in times of resource abundance. But more importantly, it provides new insights into their importance in times of shortage.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how local governments adjust their spending, savings and taxes {{in response to}} a temporary <b>revenue</b> <b>windfall</b> generated by a housing boom and how they cope with the inevitable shortfall that appears during the bust. We focus on Spanish local governments given the intensity of the last housing boom-bust experienced there and the large share of construction-related revenues they obtain. We find, first, that just a small share of the boom windfall was saved, with revenues being used primarily to increase spending (above all, current spending) and (to a lesser extent) cut taxes. Second, we find that the failure to save during the boom is higher in places with less informed voters and more contested elections. Third, we also examine what happens during the bust, and find that these governments had to cut abruptly their spending (above all, capital), raise taxes, and allow deficits to grow. Finally, in places wit less informed voters and more contested elections local governments had more trouble in adjusting during the bust, and they tend to rely more on spending cuts than on tax increases...|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the implications of}} alternative monetary policy regimes {{to deal with a}} laissez-faire fiscal policy rule, where the government completely spends resource <b>revenue</b> <b>windfall</b> contemporaneously. A three sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, which features key structural characteristics of resource-rich developing economies, such as; the Dutch disease, limited international capital mobility, credit constrained consumers, and limited labour mobility are core ingredients of the model. The model is calibrated to match the Nigerian economy. Three alternative mainstream monetary policy regimes are considered: i) a flexible exchange rate regime; ii) a crawling peg; and iii) a money growth target. The results show that the macroeconomic responses to these monetary policy regimes, depends on other auxiliary polices of the central bank, such as; sterilization policy, foreign reserve accumulation policy and openmarket operations. In particular, we find that a flexible exchange rate regime with full domestic absorption delivers the highest level of aggregate employment, though with higher volatility for other macroeconomic variables. The other policy rules deliver lower macroeconomic volatility but at the cost of crowding-out the private sector, depending on the mix of open-market operations. In welfare terms, policy regime (i) delivers the best outcome to economic agents...|$|E
40|$|A {{windfall}} {{of natural}} resource revenue (or foreign aid) faces government with choices {{of how to}} manage public debt, investment, {{and the distribution of}} funds for consumption, particularly if the windfall is both anticipated and temporary. We show that the permanent income hypothesis prescription of an ever-lasting increase in consumption financed by borrowing ahead of the windfall and then accumulating a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) is not optimal for capital-scarce developing economies. Such countries should accumulate public and private capital to accelerate their development and, only if the windfall is large relative to initial foreign debt, is it optimal to build a SWF. The optimal time profile of consumption is biased towards the near future, as compared to the permanent income hypothesis. Outcomes depend on instruments available to government. We study cases where the government can make lump-sum transfers to consumers; where such transfers are impossible so optimal policy involves cutting distortionary taxation in order to raise investment and wages; and where Ricardian consumers can borrow against future revenues, in which case the policy response to possible over-consumption is a high level of investment in infrastructure. natural resource <b>revenue,</b> <b>windfall</b> public revenues, risk premium on foreign debt, public infrastructure, private investment, credit constraints, optimal fiscal policy, debt management, Sovereign Wealth Fund, asset holding subsidy, developing economies...|$|E

This dissertation uncovers the micro-foundations of political failure by evaluating how government <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> and information asymmetries affect the will or ability of citizens to curb rent-seeking and hold politicians accountable. The first chapter provides {{one of the}} first causal, micro-level tests of the prominent claim that windfalls lower demand for good governance in comparison to taxation. It also sheds light on the relationship between revenue and information by examining whether windfalls and taxes produce differences in how citizens become politically informed.

The final chapter analyzes whether windfalls induce citizen groups to engage in rent-seeking behavior to appropriate wealth in more divided societies. To identify causal effects at the individual level, I employ experimental and quasi-experimental research designs and original survey and behavioral data from two separate, large-scale field projects conducted in Indonesia. Overall, the dissertation deepens understanding of the causes of political failure by examining not only whether windfalls and information asymmetries have adverse effects on citizen political behavior but also when and why...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three {{papers that}} contribute {{to our understanding of}} economic development. In particular, I explore the role of natural resources and political actors on economic development and provide empirical evidence from Latin America. Chapter 1 draws on joint work with Juan Pablo Rud. In this chapter we study the impact of a large Peruvian gold mine on the local population. Using annual household data from 1997 to 2006, we find evidence of a positive effect of the mine's demand of local inputs on real income, household welfare and poverty reduction. The effects are only present in the mine's supply market and surrounding areas. We examine and rule out that the results are driven by the fiscal <b>revenue</b> <b>windfall</b> from mining levies. Using a spatial general equilibrium model, we interpret these results as evidence of welfare gains generated by the mine's backward linkages. Chapter 2 explores empirically the effect of party nomination procedures on political selection and governance. Using a new data set of Latin American parties, I find evidence of a positive relationship between primaries, electoral performance and quality of government. I interpret these results as evidence of primaries improving political selection. To address relevant identification concerns, I use an instrumental variable approach based on determinants suggested by a model of endogenous primaries, which I test on the data. Chapter 3 studies the role of costly taxation as an explanation of the flypaper effect: the observed greater response of public spending to grants than to increments of the tax base. I develop a model of local spending with costly taxation and test the model using data from Peruvian municipalities. I find that differences in tax collection costs explain almost one third of the flypaper effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of whether financial intermediaries and institutional investors in the U. S. and Europe should welcome Argentina back to the global capital markets is certainly relevant [...] especially for those with short memories who may be tempted by the high yields on offer to rush in without {{a full understanding of}} the significant risks involved. At first sight, it would appear that Argentina {{has come a long way}} from its troubled past. However, it would be naïve to rush to the conclusion that Argentina is a creditworthy or relatively safe place in which to invest. To begin with, under both the late Néstor Kirchner and the current President Fernández-Kirchner, the government has spent its enormous <b>revenue</b> <b>windfall,</b> such that in fact there are hardly any extra fiscal resources available to support the existing –- or any new –- public indebtedness. Serious allegations have been made about the accuracy and integrity of official inflation data in Argentina, casting doubt on all kinds of economic indicators that use price indexes as a deflator. If inflation has indeed been running closer to 25 % than to 10 %, then the government's fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate policies are unsound and destabilizing. Moreover, key institutions of relevance to investors have been undermined by government actions, such as the national statistical agency (INDEC), the central bank, and the country's pension funds. The controversy over the true rate of inflation is part of a larger picture of lack of transparency in Argentina. The country is the only member of the G- 20, and one of the very few in the world, that refuses to abide by its treaty obligations to the IMF, which include allowing the Fund to inspect its books and evaluate the country’s economic performance and policies -– especially its exchange-rate policies under the IMF's Article IV Consultation process. Argentina is also the only G- 20 member government that is in default on its loan obligations to its fellow members -– and it has been in default to them for nearly a decade. An eventual restructuring of these debts by the Paris Club will likely force today's investors to have their own bonds restructured as well, given the Club’s principle of "comparable treatment. " The country is the G- 20 member with by far the most U. S. court judgments against it and the most investor claims and arbitral awards against it at ICSID, the world’s premier dispute-resolution center. Argentina is likewise the only G- 20 member that has been put on probation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of policies, both at national and international levels, to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Many allegations of corruption have been made but never investigated, and the FATF highlights the impunity that prevails in Argentina. In sum, despite the allure of high yields, investors and financial intermediaries are well advised to approach Argentine fixed-income and equity investment and trading opportunities with extreme caution, because they embody substantial market and default risks. ...|$|E
40|$|Paper 1 : Social Conflict, Fractionalization, and Polarization We {{develop a}} Conflict model linking Conflict {{intensity}} to {{the distribution of}} the population over an arbitrary number of groups. We extend the pure contest version of the model by Esteban and Ray (1999 : "Conflict and Distribution", Journal of Economic Theory, 87 (2) : 379 - 415) to include a mixed public-private good. We analyze how the level of dissipation changes as the population distribution and the share of publicness of the prize change. In contrast to Esteban and Ray (2011 : "Linking Conflict to Inequality and Polarization", American Economic Review, 101 (4) : 1345 - 74), we do not assume that the probability of winning equals group size. First, we characterize how the global maximum varies with the degree of publicness of the prize. Second, we find that, in case of pure private goods, the Conflict-distribution relationship resembles the fractionalization index. Finally, we find that smaller groups always contribute more and so the fractionalization index underestimates their weight. Indeed, we find that the fractionalization index underestimates the true level of Conflict. Paper 2 : Land Property Rights and International Migration: Evidence from Mexico In this paper we ask whether there is a relationship between land property rights and international migration. In order to identify the impact of property rights, we consider a country-wide land certification program that took place in Mexico in the 1990 s. Our identification strategy exploits the timing of the program and the heterogeneity in farmers’ eligibility for the program. Comparing eligible and ineligible households, we find that the program increased the likelihood of having one or more members abroad by 12 percent. In terms of number of migrants, our coefficient estimates explain 31 percent of the 1994 - 1997 increase in migrants from ejido areas and 16 - 18 percent of the increase from the entire Mexico. We contribute to the current debate on the determinants of Mexican emigration (Hanson 2006, Hanson and McIntosh 2009, Hanson and McIntosh 2010). Consistent with our theoretical model, the impact is strongest for households without a land will. Paper 3 : Local Elections and Corruption during Democratization: Evidence from Indonesia In this paper we ask whether the direct election of the local government increases accountability and decreases corruption. In order to identify the causal effect of direct elections, we exploit the gradual introduction of local elections in Indonesia and a novel dataset of corruption events that covers all districts during the period 1998 - 2008. We find that direct elections increase the number of corruption crimes by about half the pre-election average. We also find that embezzlement practices dominate all other types of corruption activities. Paper 4 : Resource Windfalls and Public Goods: Evidence from a Policy Reform In this paper, we outline an empirical approach for understanding whether natural resource windfalls have a positive or negative impact on local governments’ provision of public goods. The literature on the curse of natural resources suggests that resource windfalls might not necessarily lead to good economic outcomes and that rents might be squandered in corruption and rent seeking. In order to identify the impact of natural resources on local government behavior, we exploit a country-wide fiscal decentralization reform in Indonesia, providing producing provinces a direct share of resource revenues. Our identification strategy is to compare villages along the border of three producing provinces in Sumatra and Kalimantan before and after the legislative change. Detailed descriptive statistics on district government budgets confirm the goodness of the research design. Regression analysis {{on a wide range of}} public goods suggests that the <b>revenue</b> <b>windfall</b> had a positive impact on the prevalence of high schools and various other public goods. We find no evidence of a resource curse. population over an arbitrary number of groups. We extend the pure contest version of the model by Esteban and Ray (1999 : "Conflict and Distribution", Journal of Economic Theory, 87 (2) : 379 - 415) to include a mixed public-private good. We analyze how the level of dissipation changes as the population distribution and the share of publicness of the prize change. In contrast to Esteban and Ray (2011 : "Linking Conflict to Inequality and Polarization", American Economic Review, 101 (4) : 1345 - 74), we do not assume that the probability of winning equals group size. First, we characterize how the global maximum varies with the degree of publicness of the prize. Second, we find that, in case of pure private goods, the Conflict-distribution relationship resembles the fractionalization index. Finally, we find that smaller groups always contribute more and so the fractionalization index underestimates their weight. Indeed, we find that the fractionalization index underestimates the true level of Conflict. Paper 2 : Land Property Rights and International Migration: Evidence from Mexico In this paper we ask whether there is a relationship between land property rights and international migration. In order to identify the impact of property rights, we consider a country-wide land certification program that took place in Mexico in the 1990 s. Our identification strategy exploits the timing of the program and the heterogeneity in farmers’ eligibility for the program. Comparing eligible and ineligible households, we find that the program increased the likelihood of having one or more members abroad by 12 percent. In terms of number of migrants, our coefficient estimates explain 31 percent of the 1994 - 1997 increase in migrants from ejido areas and 16 - 18 percent of the increase from the entire Mexico. We contribute to the current debate on the determinants of Mexican emigration (Hanson 2006, Hanson and McIntosh 2009, Hanson and McIntosh 2010). Consistent with our theoretical model, the impact is strongest for households without a land will. Paper 3 : Local Elections and Corruption during Democratization: Evidence from Indonesia In this paper we ask whether the direct election of the local government increases accountability and decreases corruption. In order to identify the causal effect of direct elections, we exploit the gradual introduction of local elections in Indonesia and a novel dataset of corruption events that covers all districts during the period 1998 - 2008. We find that direct elections increase the number of corruption crimes by about half the pre-election average. We also find that embezzlement practices dominate all other types of corruption activities. Paper 4 : Resource Windfalls and Public Goods: Evidence from a Policy Reform In this paper, we outline an empirical approach for understanding whether natural resource windfalls have a positive or negative impact on local governments’ provision of public goods. The literature on the curse of natural resources suggests that resource windfalls might not necessarily lead to good economic outcomes and that rents might be squandered in corruption and rent seeking. In order to identify the impact of natural resources on local government behavior, we exploit a country-wide fiscal decentralization reform in Indonesia, providing producing provinces a direct share of resource revenues. Our identification strategy is to compare villages along the border of three producing provinces in Sumatra and Kalimantan before and after the legislative change. Detailed descriptive statistics on district government budgets confirm the goodness of the research design.

40|$|AbstractResource {{governance}} norms {{have evolved}} at multiple scales {{to counter the}} potential negative socio-economic, environmental and institutional impacts of the extractive industries. Advocates of these ‘good governance’ initiatives have sought to mainstream transparency throughout the extractive industries value chain and implement pro-poor projects at the site level. However, these types of resource governance interventions often fall short of their promised development benefits. Poorly understood is how the process of resource extraction and the expectation of supposed <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> affect the governance dynamics of host countries and localities. Using a qualitative and inductive approach this paper highlights emerging spaces of governance within a new petro-state, Uganda. The research findings highlight four significant governance gaps: lack of coherence among civil society organisations (CSOs); limited civil society access to communities and the deliberate centralisation of oil governance; industry-driven interaction at the local level; and weak local government capacity. The ad hoc and fragmented modes of resource governance in the oil bearing regions, particularly related to transparency and corporate social responsibility activities, do {{not bode well for}} this new petro-state’s development trajectory. By identifying how spaces of resource governance emerge in new resource contexts, more proactive and timely interventions can be designed and implemented by state and non-state actors...|$|R
40|$|The three {{chapters}} of this dissertation investigate how micro level phenomena affect aggregate outcomes and challenge basic fiscal and monetary principles. In particular, I analyze how these phenomena affect the transmission mechanisms and outcomes of specific fiscal and monetary policies in emerging markets. In Chapter 1, I investigate {{the transmission of}} monetary policy to retail interest rates using a novel transaction-level data set that includes all corporate loans of every commercial bank in Mexico from 2005 to 2010. In particular, I analyze the speed and completeness of the pass-through of the monetary policy rate to bank lending rates, and provide evidence {{on the importance of}} bank competition to explain heterogeneity in the way banks react to monetary policy impulses along the business cycle. For this purpose, I develop a simple model of the banking firm and test its implications using dynamic panel data methods. I find that: (1) interest rate pass-through is sluggish and incomplete; (2) the degree of bank competition is positively correlated with the completeness of the interest rate pass-through; and (3) interest rate pass-through is asymmetric: lending rates adjust less in the case of monetary policy easing than in the case of tightening. Chapter 2 draws from a district-level database to investigate the local impact on socioeconomic outcomes of mining-related <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> in Peru, which have grown almost twentyfold in the last two decades. I find evidence that improvements in average living standards are related to the mining activity but independent from fiscal <b>revenue</b> <b>windfalls</b> at the district level, where inefficiencies in the use of public funds may be accounting for the disconnect between fiscal revenues and socioeconomic outcomes. In Chapter 3, I investigate how the fiscal institutional framework has given rise to deficit and procyclical biases in the case of Mexico, and evaluate how the use of alternative fiscal rules may affect these biases. For the latter, I conduct a series of simulations using an unrestricted VAR model that allows me to evaluate the effect on fiscal outcomes of a constellation of shocks calibrated to match Mexican historical macro-data. I find that Mexico´s fiscal framework allows the conduct of a countercyclical fiscal policy during economic recessions; however, it does not contemplate a mechanism to generate buffers during economic expansions. Thus, fiscal policy is oftentimes procyclical and has a built-in deficit bias. Moreover, I find that a budget balance rule with an expenditure cap is able to mimic the results of a rule based on a cyclically adjusted balance in terms of reducing the procyclical and deficit biases, with the advantage of not having to rely on an autonomous fiscal agency, which is usually absent under weak institutional frameworks...|$|R
