GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|E

Three main factors are examined: total FDI stock in the economy and its structure, the FDI rate of return and the FDI financial life cycle.

We study the opti- mal capital accumulation policy of a financially constrained firm whose revenue is subject to an additive shock. Earnings can be paid as div- idends or reinvested with the goal to maximize shareholder value. In our model, the optimal policy of firms is to <b>reinvest</b> <b>earnings</b> (rather than paying dividends) when small, hold precautionary savings, and grow larger than is socially optimal. Smaller firms also have a higher bankruptcy risk and a more volatile market value than larger firms. We observe the leverage effect and excess returns of value stocks. In the presence of business cycles, investment and initial public offer- ings are pro-cyclical, the default probability is counter-cyclical, and monetary policy increases excess capital holdings but otherwise has a negligible impact.

40|$|This paper investigates {{factors that}} {{influence}} the amount of foreign retained earnings permanently reinvested abroad and the market valuation of these earnings. I {{examine the effects of}} repatriation taxes and the difference between foreign and domestic profitability on the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings that firms reinvest abroad using the permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> designation as a proxy for foreign retained earnings. This extends prior work that examines the effect of repatriation taxes on repatriations by including both foreign and domestic profitability and by allowing the effects to vary by the firm's foreign tax credit position. The results are consistent with the hypotheses and indicate that foreign retained earnings increase with the difference between foreign and domestic after-tax-returns. Foreign retained earnings decrease with the foreign tax rate for firms in binding foreign tax credit positions, but are not related to the foreign tax rate for firms in nonbinding foreign tax credit positions. Next, I examine how earnings management incentives affect the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings designated as permanently reinvested, controlling for the effects of profitability and repatriation taxes. I examine whether firms that are close to debt covenant violation or that fail to meet their target earnings have higher permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings.</b> The permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> designation provides the opportunity to manage earnings because U. S. repatriation taxes need not be recognized in financial statement income if the earnings are designated as permanently reinvested. I find no evidence of earnings management to meet debt covenants; however, I do find evidence of earnings management to meet target earnings. Finally, I examine the market valuation of taxes on permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> and whether this valuation differs for earnings managers and non-earnings managers. I hypothesize that because the tax estimate is undiscounted, the market values taxes on permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> more negatively for earnings managers than for non-earnings managers because it perceives the investment to be of a shorter duration. The results support this hypothesis and suggest that the market recognizes earnings management attempts and values the tax estimate as if the reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings by earnings managers is not permanent...|$|E

40|$|The {{income account}} of the US balance of {{payments}} has so far remained in surplus because {{of a very large}} differential in reported earnings on direct investment – US firms seem to enjoy a much higher rate of return than foreign firms in the US. There is little difference in terms of the rate of dividend payments; the difference is due to what is called ‘reinvested earnings’ (earnings minus dividends). Foreign firms report almost no <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> on their direct investment in the US whereas US firms report substantial <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> from their direct investment abroad, on average over $ 100 billion more p. a. than foreign firms report on their US investment. This anomaly is probably due to the desire of foreign firms to minimise their US taxes, whereas US firms do not face tax liabilities if they report high foreign profits to the US authorities. The procedure used to generate the data for <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> thus has a built-in bias to improve the US current account and – over time – its international investment position. The true picture is likely to be much worse. <b>Reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> appear in the balance of payments because returns from FDI are measured in a different way than returns from portfolio investment. Returns from FDI are calculated from a mix of firm-level accounting data and broad stock market indices to infer an average capital gain. This procedure will be misleading if, because of the different tax treatment they face, foreign controlled firm in the US report earnings on a different base than other US-owned firms. A more accurate method of measuring the returns from foreign direct investment in the US, by using the same procedure as for portfolio investment (i. e. using only stock market prices), leads to the result that the deficit of the US current account increases by over $ 100 billion per annum and the US net international debtor position worsens by over a trillion dollars. The latter amount is the sum that, if one believes the official statistics, foreign investors have been willing to forego compared to the alternative of investing in their home country...|$|E

This article presents an analytical review of the determinants of reinvestment, paying particular attention to the role played by taxation. We consider reinvestment as a form of marginal investment, and discuss six determinants grouped under three headings, namely, factors encouraging reinvestment, factors encouraging the repatriation of earnings and the influence of agency considerations on the financial management of the TNC. We also discuss issues of measurement, and the empirical testability of our conceptual model of reinvestment. We think that a better theoretical and empirical understanding of sequential flows of investment has great relevance for policies aimed at investment attraction, which have tended to focus on greenfield investment and have often failed to deliver the desired results in the past.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the multinational firm's choice of debt or internal funds {{as a method}} of financing depends upon the cost of using internal funds. I extend prior research by differentiating between the cost of using domestic versus foreign internal funds for additional investments for multinational enterprises. I predict that foreign funds are more costly than domestic funds because of potential differential costs, including repatriation tax costs and financial reporting costs. I find that my measure of total funds, the sum of cash and short-term receivables, is negatively related to issuing incremental debt. I also examine whether the proportion of total funds represented by foreign funds affects a firm's decision to use incremental debt financing. My proxy for foreign funds is a rough estimate using available Compustat data (foreign assets divided by total assets multiplied by total funds). I do not find significant results with this general measure of foreign funds. Additionally, I test whether firms' FTC positions affect incremental financing decisions. I do not find results with this measure of foreign funds. I further examine the impact of costly foreign funds on the incremental debt financing decision using alternative measures. I examine the differential costs of a subset of foreign funds with the designation and dollar level of permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings.</b> My results suggest that the change in debt is positively related to the dollar level of permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings.</b> In addition, in a model that includes the interaction between the dollar level of permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> and non-binding FTC status, my results suggest that the magnitude {{of the relationship between the}} level of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings and incremental debt financing is greater for firms with non-binding FTC limitations than for firms with binding FTC limitations. Overall, my findings suggest that the source of internal funds makes a difference in firms' use of debt financing.
