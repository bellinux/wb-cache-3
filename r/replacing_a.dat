5|$|NY86 was {{established}} in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, largely <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> realigned NY3. North of Saranac Lake, NY86 initially followed modern NY186 before being rerouted onto its modern alignment. The portion of NY86 north of Harrietstown was once NY192.|$|E
5|$|The Belle Plaine {{service area}} (mile 26) opened on July 24, 2003, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> {{previous}} structure {{at the site}} that had been destroyed by a grease fire. It contains a 24-hour gas station and convenience store, a fast food restaurant, a weather kiosk, a Kansas Travel Information Center, and a gift shop.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{courthouse}} {{was built}} in 1821, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> previous court in the Shire Hall. It ceased operation in 2011 as part of central government measures to close 93 magistrates' courts across England and Wales.|$|E

50|$|Kowalski {{was signed}} by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent on July 26, after not being {{selected}} in the 2011 NFL Draft. On September 18, he <b>replaced</b> <b>an</b> injured Phil Costa {{in the fourth quarter}} against the San Francisco 49ers, contributing to an overtime win. On October 16, he <b>replaced</b> <b>an</b> injured Bill Nagy against the New England Patriots. On December 11, against the New York Giants, he <b>replaced</b> <b>an</b> injured Phil Costa in the second quarter. On January 1, he <b>replaced</b> <b>an</b> injured Kyle Kosier against the New York Giants.|$|R
5|$|The first M-24 in Michigan was {{replaced}} by M-20 when US10 replaced the original M-20 in 1926. A 1936 bypass of downtown Pontiac resulted {{in the creation of}} M-24A which later became BUSM-24 in 1940. An extension in 1997 moved the northern end of M-24 northward from Caro to Unionville, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> section of M-138 in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{nature of}} this species means that juveniles can only acquire a territory by finding a vacant area or <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> dead adult. In Europe, young birds almost always move to unoccupied habitat, but in the larger territories of Siberia most live within the breeding range of an adult pair.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E

50|$|Designed by Thomas Hopper, Easton Lodge <b>replaced</b> <b>an</b> earlier Elizabethan mansion {{destroyed}} by fire in 1847, {{which in turn}} <b>replaced</b> <b>an</b> earlier hunting lodge. The hunting lodge and grounds were granted to Henry Maynard in 1590 by Queen Elizabeth.|$|R
5000|$|The bridge <b>replaced</b> <b>a</b> {{vehicular}} punt {{that previously}} operated between Lugarno and Illawong. [...] The 2008 bridge <b>replaced</b> <b>a</b> tidal flow {{system that was}} in operation on the singular crossing, providing for greater traffic capacity in the off-peak direction.|$|R
5|$|In 1794 a state road, Genesee Road, {{was built}} from Utica {{west to the}} Genesee River. That year a {{contract}} was awarded to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast to Albany, and in 1798 it was extended. The Seneca Turnpike was key to Utica's development, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> worn footpath with a paved road. The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods and the many people moving through Western New York {{to and from the}} Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 World Cup, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, England's {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a 32–22 loss to New Zealand at the semi-final stage. England responded to their exit from the tournament by <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> number of veterans with younger players for the 2009 Four Nations. Tomkins, who was then playing at stand-off for Wigan, was included in a new-look squad which featured {{a quarter of its}} players aged 21 or below.|$|E
5|$|Local Methodists reputedly {{met in a}} {{house on}} Town Street until a chapel {{was built in the}} 1860s. Middleton Methodist Chapel was built in 1896 <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> chapel built 30 years earlier by the Wesleyans. It was {{designed}} by Howdill and Howdill and built in brick. It has a tower to the north west and large west window. The interior survives largely unaltered and has a barrel-vaulted ceiling. There is a Baptist church on Middleton Park Avenue. St Philip's Roman Catholic Church, a modern building, is situated on St Philip's Avenue.|$|E
50|$|The current rectory {{was built}} in 1957 (to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> {{turn of the century}} rectory) and the current parish house in 1982 (to <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> {{building}} completed in 1906). The St. Francis Garden for cremated remains was added in 1998.|$|R
50|$|In NUTS version 2013, {{which was}} {{introduced}} on 1 January 2015, regions UKI3 and UKI4 <b>replaced</b> <b>a</b> single region UKI1, and regions UKI5, UKI6 and UKI7 <b>replaced</b> <b>a</b> single region UKI2. This {{increased the number}} of NUTS2 regions from 37 to 40.|$|R
50|$|The {{courthouse}} <b>replaced</b> <b>an</b> 1882 Italianate courthouse.|$|R
5|$|NY30 was {{assigned}} in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York {{to most of}} its modern routing south of Wells, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> series of designations that {{had been assigned to}} the highway in the 1920s. The portion of what is now NY30 north of Speculator was initially part of NY10. When that route was truncated to Arietta , NY30 was extended northward over NY10's former alignment by way of an overlap with NY8.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route375 (NY375), locally {{known as}} West Hurley Road for its entire length, {{is a short}} highway in the Catskill Park located entirely within Ulster County, New York, in the United States. It {{primarily}} allows for more direct access from nearby Kingston to Woodstock. It runs northsouth from NY28 at West Hurley to near the business district of Woodstock, where it terminates at another state highway, NY212. The route was designated in the 1930 renumbering in New York, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> piece of legislative Route5 from 1908 and has remained unchanged since.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak {{was laid}} down at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 15 January 1914. She was {{launched}} on 17 November, and after fitting-out, was commissioned on 1 May 1916 at a final cost of £2,468,269. Named after {{the oak tree}} in which CharlesII hid following his defeat at the 1651 Battle of Worcester, she was the eighth vessel to bear the name Royal Oak, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> pre-dreadnought scrapped in 1914. Upon completion Royal Oak {{was assigned to the}} Third Division of the Fourth Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, under the command of Captain Crawford Maclachlan.|$|E

5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> small part of the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|Such {{approval}} {{was increasingly}} granted starting in 1982. In May, Venezuela, {{who had long}} examined the FX project, agreed to buy 18 F-16As and six F-16Bs, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> fleet of Mirage III interceptors and Mirage 5 ground-attack aircraft. Sweden decided {{to develop their own}} design, the JAS 39 Gripen. In September 1983, Turkey announced plans to buy 132 F-16Cs and 28 F-16Ds to replace their Lockheed F-104G/S Starfighter and Northrop F-5A/B. Greece, stung by its long-time rival receiving the F-16, purchased 34 F-16C and six F-16Ds in November 1984, giving a firm pledge of secrecy.|$|E
5|$|Tektronix built {{a campus}} {{in the city}} {{beginning}} in 1973, which was later sold to Xerox. The following year Wilsonville's city hall relocated from Tauchman House at what is now Boones Ferry Park to a trailer {{and the next year}} the first city manager was hired. A standalone post office was built in 1976 at Boones Ferry and Wilsonville roads, with city police protection added in 1979. In 1980, the city reached a population of 2,920, and in 1982 the library was opened. The next year, a new city hall was opened, <b>replacing</b> <b>a</b> trailer that had served as city hall since 1975.|$|E
