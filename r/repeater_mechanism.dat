50|$|Early watch {{repeater}} mechanisms were actuated {{by pushing}} and depressing the pendant (the top) of the watch. Later ones are activated by pushing a slide {{along the side}} of the case. This winds a separate spring to power the repeater. Releasing the slide releases the spring, and its force as it unwinds moves the <b>repeater</b> <b>mechanism</b> through its chiming sequence.|$|E
50|$|The {{rack and}} snail {{striking}} mechanism used in repeaters {{is described in}} detail in the striking clock article. Repeater clocks often had a cord with {{a button on the}} end protruding {{from the side of the}} clock. Pulling the cord actuated the <b>repeater</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This was called a pull repeater. Repeating carriage clocks have a button on the top to activate them.|$|E
5000|$|A {{problem with}} very early {{repeaters}} {{was that the}} slide could be released before it was fully cocked, causing the repeater to only chime part of its sequence. Around 1820 French watchmaker Abraham Breguet invented a reliable 'all-or-nothing' mechanism that prevented this, making watch repeaters considerably more reliable and popular.The first repeaters had a single bell mounted {{in the back of}} the case, on which 2 hammers would strike. This bell was made of [...] "Bell metal", a mixture of copper and tin.Later repeating watches use gongs made of long hardened steel wires that are coiled inside the watch case. Tiny hammers actuated by the <b>repeater</b> <b>mechanism</b> strike them to make the chiming sounds. Some of the complex repeaters, such as the minute repeater, need to produce three different sounds, to distinguish hours, quarter hours, and minutes in the striking sequence. Since it is difficult to fit three bulky wire gongs into a watch movement, virtually all repeaters use two gongs, made from the two ends of a single length of wire supported in the middle, and if a third sound is needed it is made by striking the two gongs rapidly in sequence, first the high tone and then the low: [...] "ding-dong".|$|E

50|$|By {{the same}} year, the Manufacture {{employed}} 500 people and {{was known as}} the “Grande Maison of the Vallée de Joux”, and by 1900, it had created over 350 different calibres, of which 128 were equipped with chronograph functions and 99 with <b>repeater</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> From 1902 and for the next 30 years, LeCoultre & Cie. produced most of the movement blanks for Patek Philippe of Geneva.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>{{repeater}}s</b> have a <b>mechanism</b> {{that allows}} {{the pace of the}} repeater strikes to be changed. The owner of a repeater watch can ask a watchmaker to change the pace, making it faster or slower. According to the book [...] "Etablissage et Repassage des Montres à Répétition" [...] by John Huguenin (page 39 of the original edition), [...] "a minute repeater with an average speed takes about twenty seconds to strike 12 hours, three quarters and fourteen minutes".|$|R
