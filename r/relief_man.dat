5|$|The inaugural award {{winners were}} Bill Campbell (AL) and Rawly Eastwick (NL); Campbell also {{won in the}} {{following}} season. Dan Quisenberry and Mariano Rivera each won the AL award five times, while Rollie Fingers and Bruce Sutter won the award four times each. Lee Smith won the award on three occasions; Campbell, Dennis Eckersley, Dave Righetti, John Franco, Éric Gagné, Randy Myers, Trevor Hoffman, Francisco Rodríguez, Heath Bell, and José Valverde each won the award twice. Sutter (NL 1979), Fingers (AL 1981), Steve Bedrosian (NL 1987), Mark Davis (NL 1989), Eckersley (AL 1992), and Éric Gagné (NL 2003) won the <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> and the Cy Young Award in the same season; Fingers and Eckersley won the AL MVP as well, in 1981 and 1992 respectively. Todd Worrell won both the <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> and the MLB Rookie of the Year Award in the 1986 MLB season. Rivera and Joe Nathan were the only relief pitchers to have tied in points for the award, and both were awarded in 2009. Goose Gossage, Fingers, Eckersley, and Sutter were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Craig Kimbrel (NL) and Jim Johnson (AL) were the final award winners in 2012. Sanofi acquired Rolaids from Johnson & Johnson unit McNeil Consumer Healthcare in 2013, but the award was not continued {{as a part of}} its marketing strategy.|$|E
5|$|Nathan had {{a strong}} season, as he was {{selected}} as an All-Star for the 2009 MLB All Star Game, and he finished the year with 2.10 ERA with 47 saves in 52 opportunities, which was a franchise record. He shared honors for the AL Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> award with Mariano Rivera. However, Nathan did not fare {{as well in the}} postseason; in Game 2 of the American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, with the Twins leading 3–1 {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, Nathan blew the save when he surrendered a game-tying two-run home run to Alex Rodriguez. It was the first home run Nathan had allowed with men on base all year. The Yankees later won the game in the 11th inning and swept the series. On October 11, 2009, after the Twins lost the final game at the Metrodome (a 4–1 playoff loss to the Yankees that eliminated them), Nathan took a pile of dirt from the mound as a keepsake from the Metrodome.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} 12appearances of 2009, Rivera {{surrendered}} four {{home runs and}} had a 3.97ERA, leading to speculation about his cutter's effectiveness and his shoulder's health at age 39. As the season progressed, his numbers improved, and he reached a milestone on June28 by becoming the second pitcher with 500regular season saves. In the same game, while batting against fellow closer Francisco Rodríguez, he collected his first career run batted in by walking with the bases loaded. With 23saves in 24opportunities and a 2.43ERA in the season's first half, Rivera was named an All-Star for the tenth time. At the 2009 MLB All-Star Game, he set a record by saving his fourth career All-Star Game. In the season's second half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40appearances, while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36. He finished the regular season with a 1.76ERA, 44saves in 46opportunities, and a 0.90WHIP. In the postseason, he pitched 16innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games, and he clinched the Yankees' victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies—his fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason. Rivera collected several awards at season's end, including his third Delivery Man Award, his fifth AL Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> Award, and the 2009 Sporting News Pro Athlete of the Year Award. Reflecting on the decade's end, ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2004 season, {{with a year}} {{remaining}} on his contract, Rivera signed a two-year extension worth $21million, with an option for a third year. That season, Rivera surpassed 300career saves and made his sixth All-Star team with 32saves at the midseason break, then an AL record. His final numbers for the year included a 1.94ERA and a career-high 53saves in 57opportunities; it was his third time leading the major leagues in saves. Along with winning a third AL Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> Award, he placed third in the AL Cy Young Award voting. Following the Yankees' victory in the 2004 AL Division Series against the Minnesota Twins, Rivera returned home to Panama to mourn two relatives {{who had died in}} an accident in his swimming pool. Despite his status being in doubt for the 2004 AL Championship Series against the Red Sox, he returned to New York for Game 1 after attending the funeral in Panama earlier in the day. He recorded a save that night, as well as in Game 2. Although the Yankees led three-games-to-none in the series, Rivera blew saves in Games 4 and 5, and the Red Sox won both games in extra innings to avoid elimination. In Game 4, Boston's Dave Roberts pinch ran and stole second base against Rivera, eventually scoring on a single to tie the game. In Game 5, Rivera entered with a one-run lead with runners on base and allowed a sacrifice fly to tie the score. Although he allowed just one earned run in the 2004 postseason, he blew three of five save opportunities in the two series. Boston's comeback victories helped them become the first team in MLB history to win a best-of-seven series in which they trailed three-games-to-none.|$|E

25|$|Heath Justin Bell (born September 29, 1977) is an American former {{professional}} baseball relief pitcher. As a closer with the San Diego Padres from 2009 to 2011, Bell was a three-time All-Star and twice won the Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> Award. He was also awarded the DHL Delivery Man of the Year Award and The Sporting News Reliever of the Year Award.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his 55 saves, Gagné finished the 2003 season with a 1.20 earned run average and had 137 strikeouts and 20 walks in 82⅓ innings pitched. This translated into 1.66 strikeouts per inning pitched. For his performance, he won the Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> of the Year Award {{and became the first}} relief pitcher in 11 years to win the Cy Young Award. He and Ferguson Jenkins are the only two Canadian pitchers to win the most prestigious pitching award in baseball. He is the only pitcher to win the award while having a losing season (his record was 2–3). Despite this, he lost his arbitration case over the winter; he had asked for a 14-fold raise from $550,000 to $8million but had to settle for $5million.|$|E

500|$|The Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> Award was {{an annual}} award given from the 1976 season to the 2012 season {{to the top}} relief {{pitchers}} of the regular season, one each in the American and National Leagues. Relief pitchers enter the game after the starting pitcher is removed. Because the first closers were nicknamed [...] "firemen", a reference to [...] "putting out the fire" [...] of another team's rally, the trophy is a gold-plated firefighter's helmet. The <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> of the Year is based on statistical performance, rather than votes. Each save is worth three points; a win, two points; a loss, negative two points; and a blown save, negative two points. A [...] "tough save", which is worth an additional point, occurs when a relief pitcher enters the game and gets the save with the tying run already on base. The 2012 award winners are Jim Johnson of the Baltimore Orioles in the American League, and Craig Kimbrel of the Atlanta Braves in the National League.|$|E
500|$|Closer Brad Lidge {{was named}} the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year and the DHL Delivery Man of the Year for his perfect 48-for-48 {{performance}} throughout the 2008 regular season and postseason.

500|$|The Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> Award was {{an annual}} Major League Baseball (MLB) award given from 1976 to 2012 {{to the top}} relief {{pitchers}} of the regular season, one in the American League (AL) {{and one in the}} National League (NL). Relief pitchers are the pitchers who enter the game after the starting pitcher is removed. The award was sponsored by Rolaids, whose slogan was [...] "R-O-L-A-I-D-S spells relief." [...] Because the first closers were nicknamed [...] "firemen", a reference to [...] "putting out the fire" [...] of another team's rally, the trophy was a gold-plated firefighter's helmet. Unlike other awards, such as the Cy Young Award or the MLB Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, the <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> was based on statistical performance, rather than votes. Each save was worth three points; each win was worth two points; and each loss was worth negative two points. Beginning with the 1987 MLB season, negative two points were given for blown saves. In the 2000 MLB season, the term [...] "tough save", which was worth an additional point, was introduced by Rolaids. A [...] "tough save" [...] happened when a relief pitcher entered the game already having the potential tying run on base, and got the save. The player with the highest point total won the award.|$|E

500|$|Mariano Rivera (born November 29, 1969) is a Panamanian-American former {{professional}} baseball pitcher who played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, from 1995 to 2013.

500|$|The Most Valuable Player Award, {{commonly}} known as the [...] "MVP", is the oldest individual award, given in its current format since 1931. MVP awards are also presented for performances in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the League Championship Series, and the World Series. Offensive awards include the Silver Slugger Award and the Hank Aaron Award, while the Cy Young Award and Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> Award recognize pitching; the Rawlings Gold Glove Award is given for fielding. The DHL Delivery Man and Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Awards are the newest awards, both established in 2005.

500|$|Rivera rebounded in {{dominating}} {{fashion and}} finished 2005 with his greatest season to that point. He {{was selected to}} the All-Star team, converted 31consecutive save opportunities, and completed the season with 43saves in 47opportunities. He set new career bests in many statistical categories, including ERA (1.38) and walks plus hits per inning pitched, or WHIP (0.87). Rivera limited opposing hitters to a batting average against of [...]177, then the best mark of his closer career. In addition to winning a fourth AL Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> Award, he placed second in voting for the AL Cy Young Award behind starter Bartolo Colón, and ninth for the AL MVP Award—his best finishes in voting for both awards. During the postseason, MLB announced the Latino Legends Team, a fan-voted all-time roster of the greatest Latino players; Rivera was named the team's relief pitcher.|$|E

500|$|With Rivera's {{contract}} set {{to expire}} after 2001, the Yankees signed {{him to a}} four-year, $39.99million deal prior to the season, marking the first long-term contract of his career. In 2001, he was selected for the All-Star team for a third consecutive year. His final numbers included a 2.34ERA, a closer career-high innings pitched, and an MLB-leading 50saves in 57opportunities—his second time leading the league. His saves total that year surpassed Dave Righetti's 46 saves in 1986 for the most by a Yankee pitcher in a single season, and made him just the sixth MLB pitcher to reach 50saves in a single season. Rivera's performance earned him his second AL Rolaids <b>Relief</b> <b>Man</b> Award. Despite having what sportswriters deemed an [...] "aura of invincibility" [...] in the postseason, Rivera failed to close out the decisive Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In {{one of his most}} infamous moments, he blew a save {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, in part due to his own throwing error, and he lost the Series later in the inning by allowing Luis Gonzalez's bloop single with the bases loaded to score the winning run. It was the first and only loss of Rivera's postseason career, and it snapped his record streak of 23consecutive postseason saves converted.|$|E
