50|$|Therefore, {{an index}} reading of 50.0 {{means that the}} {{variable}} is unchanged, a number over 50.0 indicates an improvement, while anything below 50.0 suggests a decline.

The further away from 50.0 the index is, the stronger the change over the month, e.g. a reading of 55.0 points to <b>a</b> more frequently <b>reported</b> increase in <b>a</b> variable than a reading of 52.5. The degree of confidence experienced by respondents <b>reporting</b> <b>an</b> improvement and the degree of concern experienced by respondents <b>reporting</b> <b>a</b> deterioration are not factored into the index.|$|R
