5|$|The first metal cannon was the pot-de-fer. Loaded with an arrow-like bolt {{that was}} {{probably}} wrapped in leather to allow greater thrusting power, it was set off through a touch hole with a heated wire. This weapon, and others similar, were used by both the French and English, during the Hundred Years' War, when cannon saw their first <b>real</b> <b>use</b> on the European battlefield. Even then, cannon were still a relatively rare weapon.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless {{too small to be}} of <b>real</b> <b>use,</b> and she remained in service for only two years. Puglia was the only ship of the class to {{take an active role in}} the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship could open fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had been thoroughly compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister Lombardia in July. That month, Puglia became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. Liguria was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold Puglia in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E

25|$|In the frugal {{years that}} {{followed}} {{the end of the}} war, Allhallows, like Leysdown-on-Sea, began to experience lean times as passenger numbers fell. Allhallows with its single Charringtons pub, concrete road, two small refreshment stands (closed in winter) and block of four small shops (which never saw any <b>real</b> <b>use</b> and were eventually bricked up) was no match for Brighton, the attractions of which could be enjoyed by rail for an extra 1s 9d when compared to the price of an Allhallows ticket (then 5s 9d). In an attempt to stem losses, the new operator, British Railways (Southern Region) (BR), misguidedly tried out an ACV lightweight diesel railcar in late 1953, its noise and general lack of comfort probably serving however to drive away more passengers.|$|E

500|$|In the first, 1930 {{edition of}} his global survey The Film Till Now, British cinema pundit Paul Rotha declared, [...] "A film in which the speech and sound effects are {{perfectly}} synchronised and coincide with their visual image on the screen is absolutely contrary to the aims of cinema. It is a degenerate and misguided attempt to destroy the <b>real</b> <b>use</b> of the film and cannot be accepted as coming within the true boundaries of the cinema." [...] Such opinions were not rare among those who cared about cinema as an art form; Alfred Hitchcock, though he directed the first commercially successful talkie produced in Europe, held that [...] "the silent pictures were the purest form of cinema" [...] and scoffed at many early sound films as delivering little beside [...] "photographs of people talking". In Germany, Max Reinhardt, stage producer and movie director, expressed {{the belief that the}} talkies, [...] "bringing to the screen stage plays... tend to make this independent art a subsidiary of the theater and really make it only a substitute for the theater instead of an art in itself... like reproductions of paintings." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review studies that {{investigated}} tool use disorders in left-brain damaged (LBD) patients {{over the last}} 30 years. Four tasks are classically used {{in the field of}} apraxia: Pantomime of tool use, single tool <b>use,</b> <b>real</b> tool <b>use</b> and mechanical problem solving. Our aim was to address two issues, namely, (1) the role of mechanical knowledge in <b>real</b> tool <b>use</b> and (2) the cognitive mechanisms underlying pantomime of tool use, a task widely employed by clinicians and researchers. To do so, we extracted data from 36 papers and computed the difference between healthy subjects and LBD patients. On the whole, pantomime of tool use is the most difficult task and <b>real</b> tool <b>use</b> is the easiest one. Moreover, associations seem to appear between pantomime of tool <b>use,</b> <b>real</b> tool <b>use</b> and mechanical problem solving. These results suggest that the loss of mechanical knowledge is critical in LBD patients, even if all of those tasks (and particularly pantomime of tool use) might put differential demands on semantic memory and working memory...|$|R

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little <b>real</b> <b>use</b> on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E

[...] To many, women were only ephemeral creatures, working briefly before settling down for marriage, where their only <b>real</b> <b>use</b> was as window dressings or as a company's emotional propagandists. [...] In a predominantly patriarchal society, women largely went unnoticed in the workforce, due to unfair stereotypes of their positions. [...] Ethnographers also noticed this, stating that women have a great well of power, equal or greater to that of Japanese men, in terms of will, bravery, and psychological strength, despite being undervalued {{as members of the}} work force. [...] Several stereotypes are prevalent in media and are often what Japanese working women are associated with.|$|E

[...] Instead he {{paid more attention to}} the industrial regions and the needs of Ontario and Quebec, particularly with respect to the proposed St. Lawrence Seaway project with the United States.

In response to a foreseen need for naval landing parties to defend Belgian ports, these men were organised into the Royal Naval Division, and equipped as infantry. Herbert was drafted into this unit, commissioned in early 1915, and sent to Gallipoli in May. He saw action at Gallipoli, was invalided home, then served with Admiralty intelligence before rejoining the division in France in 1916. It served in the last phases of the Battle of the Somme, and was virtually destroyed fighting in the capture of Beaucourt-sur-l'Ancre – of the 435 officers and men of his battalion who went into the attack, Herbert {{was one of only}} twenty to be fit for service the next day.

2500|$|Between 1889 and 1928, {{the bank}} {{operated}} {{as the state}} bank and bank of issue of Iran, and held a virtual monopoly on banking in the country. Sir William Keswick was the bank's chairman. The bank was principally funded by Glyn, Mills & Co., J. Henry Schröder & Co. and David Sassoon & Co.. Despite holding a monopoly, the bank's management was farcical, according to Geoffrey Jones, and the bank struggled to make a profit. However, Jones also notes that British banks in this period were allowed to disguise their profits by making transfers to or from [...] "inner" [...] or [...] "secret" [...] reserves before reaching their published profits figure. The Imperial bank's real profits were on average {{twice as high as}} the published profits between 1890 and 1952. [...] The bank contributed to the Iranian economy by mobilizing domestic savings, but many were doubtful of the <b>real</b> <b>use</b> of these savings as the Bank was often [...] "discriminated against Persians in giving credit". In 1927, 80% of the loans granted in Bushehr, Shiraz and Esfahan were to finance Iranian export of Opium, whereas most of the loans in the northern cities related to the trade with Russia. The imperial bank did not employ locals as managers; in contrast, the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which was mixed British, French and Turkish ownership employed middle eastern nationals in managerial positions. The bank's first owner, Joseph Rabino, born in London to an Italian Jewish family, was always regarded with great suspicion by his board.|$|E
