500|$|Despite {{starting}} and finishing {{in the village}} of Champéry– the first occasion that the race had started in Switzerland in its history– most of the opening stage of the 2013 Critérium du Dauphiné was just over the Franco-Swiss border in the Haute-Savoie department, where the previous year's race had finished. After a slight descent from the start, the race's first climb commenced after just [...] of racing, with the first-category Côte de Morgins, a -long, 6% climb. After a long and steady descent, another first-category climb of the Col du Corbier– which featured in the 2012 Dauphiné-ending stage– was ascented, a [...] test at an average of 7.5%. On the <b>return</b> <b>loop</b> to Champéry, after passing through the intermediate sprint at La Chapelle-d'Abondance, the Côte de Morgins was climbed from the other side (this time as a second-category climb), before a third-category climb– the Côte de Champéry– just a kilometre from the finish. This [...] parcours, especially the closing kilometres, was expected to see sprinters being dropped from the peloton, resulting in a select group of riders at the finish.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{countries}} have promulgated control measures and design guidelines {{to limit the}} proliferation of Legionella within hot water distribution systems (HWDS). However, there is little {{information on how to}} assess and improve existing HWDS unable to maintain water temperatures ≥ 55  °C throughout the system. A 50 -year old hot water system of a 10 story hospital was investigated in terms of temperature distribution and Legionella pneumophila prevalence. Concentrations of L.  pneumophila were correlated with the maximum temperature reached at the tap, with a significant decrease observed at T ≥  55  °C. Continuous temperature and flow monitoring was performed on the overall HWDS, characterizing the principal and secondary horizontal <b>return</b> <b>loops</b> for all 9 wings, and detailed investigations of the secondary vertical <b>return</b> <b>loops</b> was completed in Wing 3. Results indicated the system inability to systematically maintain desired operating temperatures of 55  °C. The deficient hydraulic distribution was the root cause of the poor temperature maintenance throughout the secondary loops, but defective devices were also identified as playing an important role in sectorial temperature failure. A simple stepwise investigative approach was developed to identify hydraulic deficiencies. The implementation of flow restrictions on identified recirculation loops and increased pumping efficiency was conducted within a short period of 2 months, with no major system upgrade. These corrective measures resulted in a balanced system with increased flow velocities (> 0. 2  m/s). As a result, the proportion of taps achieving 55  °C within 2  min increased from 11 % to 74 % and L.  pneumophila prevalence decreased from 93. 1 % to 46. 1 % after 4 weeks...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the relationship between}} economic activity and intervention, including monetary and fiscal policy, using a universal dynamic framework. Central bank policies are designed for growth without excess inflation. However, unemployment, investment, consumption, and inflation are interlinked. Understanding dynamics is crucial to assessing the effects of policy, especially {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis. Here we lay out a program of research into monetary and economic dynamics and preliminary steps toward its execution. We use principles of response theory to derive implications for policy. We find that the current approach, which considers the overall money supply, is insufficient to regulate economic growth. While it can achieve some degree of control, optimizing growth also requires a fiscal policy balancing monetary injection between two dominant loop flows, the consumption and wages loop, and investment and <b>returns</b> <b>loop.</b> The balance arises from a composite of government tax, entitlement, subsidy policies, corporate policies, as well as monetary policy. We show empirically that a transition occurred in 1980 between two regimes [...] an oversupply to the consumption and wages loop, to an oversupply of the investment and <b>returns</b> <b>loop.</b> The imbalance is manifest in savings and borrowing by consumers and investors, and in inflation. The latter increased until 1980, and decreased subsequently, resulting in a zero rate largely unrelated to the financial crisis. Three recessions and the financial crisis are part of this dynamic. Optimizing growth now requires shifting the balance. Our analysis supports advocates of greater income and / or government support for the poor who use a larger fraction of income for consumption. This promotes investment due to growth in demand. Otherwise, investment opportunities are limited, capital remains uninvested, and does not contribute to growth.

Recent advances such as the Loop Finder algorithm allows designers to detect and identify local, potentially unstable <b>return</b> <b>loops</b> without the need to identify and add breakpoints.

In this research work, we first take an in-depth look at the loop finder algorithm so as to identify certain key enhancements that can be made to overcome these shortcomings. We next propose pole discovery and impedance computation methods that address these shortcomings by exploring only a certain region of interest in the s-plane. The reduced time and memory complexity obtained via the new methodology allows us to extend automatic stability checking to much larger circuits than was previously possible...|$|R

The model is structured on functional basis according to the heat pump vapour compression or primary circuit, a secondary ground loop circuit and a secondary building loop circuit. Heat pump heating and cooling capacities, as well as COP, are considered to be dependent variables and are estimated in the model using performance fitted maps. Independent variables include: compressor speed, circulation pump speeds, ground <b>loop</b> <b>return</b> temperature and building circuit return temperature. The model is validated using data from a full-scale ground source heat pump installation.

In this situation, the datacentre receives water of a certain temperature and all the heat generated by the IT equipment is delivered to another user with this water circuit. This means that the facility does not only reject the heat, but also the water which contains the heat to allow an external party to transport and use the warmed-up liquid. This results in a complete lack of cooling installations and the datacentre effectively acts like a large water heater. Water flows into the datacentre and comes out at high temperatures.|$|R
