Release liners are part of a composite made of a label with its own adhesive on a release liner or carrier with its own <b>release</b> <b>coating.</b> The label comprises either a synthetic face stock such as polypropylene or paper. The adhesive is usually an organic material such as a polyacrylate or polyisoprene based rubber. The release liner can be made from various substrates treated with a suitable product, the <b>release</b> <b>coating.</b> Such release liners allow transporting labels with their adhesives from the point of manufacture to the point of label application (e. g., a filling station of some sort). The <b>release</b> <b>coating</b> allows easy delamination or easy label transfer from their liners onto the object to be labeled. The use of release liners began before World War II but really took off with the development of silicone release coatings in the early 1950 s. There are several chemical types of release materials.

40|$|Conventional {{nondestructive}} testing (NDT) techniques {{used to detect}} defects in composites {{are not able to}} determine intact bond integrity within a composite structure and are costly to use on large and complex shaped surfaces. To overcome current NDT limitations, a new technology was utilized based on quantitative percussion diagnostics (QPD) to better quantify bond quality in fiber reinforced composite materials. Experimental results indicate that this technology is capable of detecting 'kiss' bonds (very low adhesive shear strength), caused by the application of release agents on the bonding surfaces, between flat composite laminates bonded together with epoxy adhesive. Specifically, the local value of the loss coefficient determined from quantitative percussion testing was found to be significantly greater for a <b>release</b> <b>coated</b> panel compared to that for a well bonded sample. Also, the local value of the probe force or force returned to the probe after impact was observed to be lower for the <b>release</b> <b>coated</b> panels. The increase in loss coefficient and decrease in probe force are thought to be due to greater internal friction during the percussion event for poorly bonded specimens. 	NDT standards were also fabricated by varying the cure parameters of an epoxy film adhesive. Results from QPD for the variable cure NDT standards and lap shear strength measurements taken of mechanical test specimens were compared and analyzed. Finally, experimental results have been compared to a finite element analysis to understand the visco-elastic behavior of the laminates during percussion testing. This comparison shows how a lower quality bond leads to a reduction in the percussion force by biasing strain in the percussion tested side of the panel...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Developments in {{industrial}} pharmacy are often {{linked to the}} discovery of pharmaceutical excipients. Although recently introduced as a material for immediate release coatings, Kollicoat IR already has other applications. Areas covered: In this review, the different properties and pharmaceutical applications of Kollicoat IR as an excipient are discussed. In the first part, the chemical structure and the physicochemical characteristics are examined. The second part is a presentation of the available Kollicoat IR products followed by a brief overview of the preclinical studies completed for its use as an instant <b>release</b> <b>coating</b> material. Expert opinion: Although the polymer was intended as an immediate <b>release</b> <b>coating</b> material for tablets, grafting PEG with polyvinyl alcohol to form this polymer provides physicochemical properties that lead to ever-broadening applications. Understanding its properties can lead {{to the development of a}} new use for Kollicoat IR. The addition of Kollicoat IR to an ethylcellulose or polyvinyl acetate tablet coat was successful at modifying the drug release rate. Designing a successful controlled release coat simply requires acknowledgment of the drug release mechanism from the mixture of polymers that includes Kollicoat IR. Moreover, the interaction between Kollicoat IR and poorly soluble drugs produces fast-dissolving solid dispersions prepared using hot stage extrusion, spray drying, or freeze drying...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} analyzes the deformation behaviour under static and dynamic loading conditions of electrostatically sprayed epoxy-polyester powder coatings by local and uniaxial tests, trying {{to account for}} the separate contribution of the raw polymeric material alone and of the adhesion to the underlying metal substrate. First, thermo-rheological properties of the basic material (i. e., the thermosetting powder paints) were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rheometry. Secondly, free-standing films were manufactured by electrostatic spraying of the thermosetting powders onto stainless steel substrates pre-coated with an intermediate layer of silicon-based heat curable <b>release</b> <b>coating.</b> The resulting free standing-films were macroscopically characterized by combined dynamic-mechanical analyses (DMA) and tensile tests. Finally, local mechanical characterization of the coating performance was carried out by micro-scale depth sensing scratch and indentation on coatings 'free-standing' and 'rigidly adhering' onto metal substrate. The experimental findings show the different mechanical behaviour of the polymeric coatings, whose thermal, rheological, dynamical properties were fully characterized, when deposited on untreated or pre-treated substrates as well as on intermediate layers of <b>release</b> <b>coating,</b> thus contributing to better understand how much of the coating properties are ascribable to the material chosen or to the interfacial adhesion between coating and substrate. © 2010 Elsevier B.
