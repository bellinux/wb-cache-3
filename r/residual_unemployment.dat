50|$|In the two {{emerging}} superpowers, Russia and America, post-war productivity rose remarkably by 1948, {{although the}} reasons were very different. In Russia, great stimulus {{was given to}} emerging industries {{as a result of}} frenzied war production, helped in part by advanced industrial plants it took from east Germany after the occupation. America meanwhile, had been under severe depression in 1938, with vast industrial resources lying idle and 20% of the population unemployed. Rearmament, and later war brought these resources to life, which combined with rising investment and an intact infrastructure kept American industry buoyant, although considerable <b>residual</b> <b>unemployment</b> remained. Much the same situation existed in Canada, whose economy was closely tied to America, and who also suffered no fighting within its territory. The war changed the pattern of the international economy, leaving the US in a very strong bargaining position, having managed to free up international trade to its benefit as a consequence of Lend-Lease, and forcing the British to agree to currency convertibility.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{exploits}} the Mexican Encuesta Nacional de Empleo Urbano (ENEU) {{to determine}} {{the existence of the}} wage curve—an empirical phenomena first suggested by Blanchflower and Oswald (1990) —during the period 2000 – 2003. We propose an innovative approach to the wage curve by estimating the elasticity across the wage distribution. This is applied to the Mexican experience during the early 2000 s recession. The evidence indicates that for Mexico during this period there is no wage curve, and that wages are positively affected by local levels of unemployment. This lends credibility to the Harris and Todaro (1970) view which suggests that there is segmentation in the labour market with <b>residual</b> <b>unemployment.</b> We argue that perhaps the power of unions may account for our findings...|$|E
40|$|In 1997 {{the number}} of {{long-term}} absences due to illness began and continued to rise in Sweden. Traditional explanations of {{why this is so}} have been centered on either blaming the individual or blaming the work environment. By focusing on long-term illness of the unemployed, this dissertation suggests that there is a growing <b>residual</b> <b>unemployment</b> within advanced welfare states. The main question this dissertation poses is: “Why are the unemployed in increasing numbers filing for long-term illness benefits and what is preventing them from finding a job and returning to work?” This central question has led to two other questions; “How do street level bureaucrats at the employment agency and the social insurance agency carry out their work to return the unemployed ill back to work?” and; “How do the unemployed ill convey their intention of returning to work?” The main question and the two sub-questions are linked by the simple fact that those that are unemployed and long-term ill stay on sick leave for longer durations than their employed counterparts with similar illnesses. The analytical approach is inspired by phenomenology and ethnomethodology. Focus is on both understanding the street level administrators work and the experienced situation of the unemployed ill. The empirical basis of the dissertation is a combination of observational fieldwork and interviews. Observations were carried out on the day to day working of a coordinated project between the social insurance agency and the employment agency, including observing both administrative meetings between the organizations as well as observing the administrators meetings with the unemployed ill. Interviews were completed with nine unemployed ill individuals. The conclusion is reached through a method of elimination of possible answers to the main question of the dissertation. The author first analyzes and eliminates the meso-level of behavior as the most determining explanation, because the project’s additional resources and methods are still inadequate as administrators are unable to create jobs that are not subsidized through financial support provided by the state. The micro-level of behavior is also eliminated, because it shows that failure to return to work cannot be found in a lack of individual motivation. The conclusion is that the labor market regulates the concept of work ability and that the state adjusts to this definition. State agencies, in their turn, influence the individuals definition of him/her self. The author argues that the primary question of why the proportion of the unemployed who are long-term ill is increasing and what is hindering their return to work, has to be answered at the macro-level of societal change...|$|E
40|$|In French border regions, the {{unemployment}} durations of communes increase with {{distance from the}} border to a threshold of about thirty kilometres, then slightly decrease after this threshold. Depending on the definition of exit from unemployment, differences in unemployment durations between border communes and those located around thirty kilometres from the border are one to eight months, while controlling for the labour force composition. In order to explain this "border effect", we first use a spatial autoregressive model estimated by maximum likelihood. Then we calculate <b>residual</b> durations of <b>unemployment</b> using a linear model estimated by ordinary least squares. The advantage of living near the border is mainly due to certain effects of social composition, especially the proportion of cross-border workers, who {{improve the quality of}} informational and relational networks. This scenario applies to communes close to Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Spain, but it seems less effectual near the borders with Germany and Italy...|$|R
40|$|L'auteur rappelle le débat théorique fort controversé ayant trait à l’explication aggrégative et structurelle des hauts taux de chômage qui ont prévalu récemment aux Etats-Unis et au Canada. Il examine différentes définitions et théories possibles du chômage structurel. This paper reviews a {{theoretical}} controversy concerning the aggregative and structural {{explanations of the}} high rates of unemployment recently experienced in the United States and Canada. The paper examines alternative definitions and theories of structural unemployment. Much of the analysis of structural unemployment has been concerned with : (a) the long recognized differences between unemployment rates by occupation, by region, etc. (structural differentials); (b) whether there have occurred changes in these unemployment rate differentials (See footnote 1 of the text for references to Canadian studies of this type). The contributions of Berman, Lipsey, Reder and Kalachek to the debate are reviewed (see footnote 7, 8, 9 and 10 for references to these papers). Berman and Lipsey have presented very similar policy type definitions of structural unemployment which view it basically as a <b>residual</b> of <b>unemployment</b> which can be removed by labour market adjustment policies, {{some of which are}} profitable in terms of financial costs and benefits while others commend themselves for non pecuniary reasons (see sections Ci and Cii of the paper). The previously mentioned authors (especially Lipsey) have established to the author's satisfaction that as long as we agree that there is some deficient-demand unemployment in the economy we can tell nothing from the structure of the existing unemployed or of the newly unemployed concerning the validity of the structural hypothesis. This is so because structural change makes many of the existing unemployed not reemployable, a fact which can be discovered only by trying demand expansion and not by analysis of the existing stock of the unemployed. In other words, analysis of the existing stock of unemployment cannot help to ascertain whether structural changes have occurred in the composition of unemployment because the structure of the unemployed will change, and differ from the structure of the employed, after demand falls, as well as after a « readjusting layoff » due to technological changes (see section Dii). The study closes with an analysis of reasons why non-selective and selective public policies should be applied simultaneously and continuously in dealing with unemployment, a conclusion not in accordance with that derived from Lipsey's model. In short, the author believes that the use of selective policies will change the trade-off between inflation and unemployment such that when applied with non-selective policies, it will be possible for the economy to attain « non-inflationary » full employment and a more equitable and efficient distribution of employment opportunities...|$|R
40|$|Further income {{redistribution}} is {{an obvious}} way of alleviating child poverty. However, whether this effectively improves life chances of children growing up in poverty is debated, and there might be less expensive ways of doing so. Drawing on competing models explaining intergenerational persistence of poverty, this thesis investigates some of the links between childhood poverty and later economic outcomes in the UK. Aiming to identify policy areas where intervention would be helpful, it examines continuities and changes over time in these links and mechanisms that create them, analysing longitudinal data from people born in 1958, 1970 and the 1980 s. This thesis shows that a negative effect of childhood poverty on adult earnings remains for the 1970 cohort (although not for the 1958 cohort), even after controlling for educational attainment in particular, and for other individual and family characteristics. This {{appears to be a}} reason that intergenerational persistence of poverty is stronger for the younger cohort. Teenage occupational aspirations do not seem to explain this <b>residual</b> effect, but <b>unemployment</b> in early working life contributes to it. An original contribution is the investigation of different effects of childhood poverty on later onset of and exit from unemployment, and the relative strength of the effects of parental worklessness and income poverty on these outcomes. A main finding is that income poverty more strongly affects the rapid onset of unemployment following employment, although parental worklessness appears {{to be associated with the}} slow exit from unemployment. The results suggest that policy interventions in education or (potentially cheaper) interventions affecting youth aspirations would not completely remove the disadvantage experienced by children growing up in poverty. There is therefore evidence that further income redistribution would be beneficial in improving their future life chances, while the findings suggest that the design of income redistribution also matters...|$|R
