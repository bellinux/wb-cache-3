However, the VAS soundings exhibited a substantial cold bias {{in the middle and}} upper troposphere. The error makes promising the use of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) to obtain an independent estimate of tropopause pressure for use in the retrieval program.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of a Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheric Sciences global objective analysis cycle to {{the addition of}} FGGE level II-b data is assessed. The GOAS system comprises a predictive continuity provided by a model first-guess forecast integrated from a previous forecast and updated by data gathered in the interim. FGGE data originated in the Jan. -Mar. 1979 period and were acquired by <b>rawinsondes,</b> pilot balloons, surface stations, satellites, ships, and drifting buoys deployed during SOP- 1. Focussing on 2 - 5 and 8 -day forecasts, comparisons were made of the 6 hr forecast error at the 300 mb height in three experiments using all, no-satellite (NOSAT), and without <b>rawinsondes</b> or pilot balloons modes. Larger errors occurred {{in the case of}} NOSAT, while significant corrections to the GOAS predictions were noted using all the FGGE data. It was concluded that all forecasts were improved by inclusion of full FGGE data sets, including forecasting beyond one week...|$|R
40|$|Weather {{conditions}} are documented {{prior to and}} during the STS- 48 attempted landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC on 18 Sep. 1991. Trends in meteorological data during 17 and 18 Sep. are examined along with {{their relationship to the}} overall weather pattern observed over the KSC region. The primary weather problems during the landing were the formation of showers within 10 nautical miles of the SLF and any ceiling less than 10, 000 ft. The controlling factor of the weather was a high pressure ridge that was gradually weakening and moving off the northeast. As this occurred, the low level flow was switching from a easterly to a southeasterly direction. This change in wind direction was reflected by shower movement on the McGill radar and by trends in <b>rawinsondes</b> launched from the Cape. These <b>rawinsondes</b> also indicated that the boundary layers was becoming slightly more unstable several hours prior to the attempted landing which may have aided in the development of clouds and small isolated showers. Also, analyses of Doppler wind profiler and <b>rawinsondes</b> indicated a possible midlevel disturbance in the easterly flow pattern near 700 mb. This weak disturbance may have made the atmosphere a little more unstable early on 18 Sep. Finally, embedded within the southeasterly flow were several bands of low clouds. These clouds were rather difficult to see in unenhanced IR satellite imagery available to forecasters in real time. However, post analyses using several different enhancement curves, adapted from NESDIS, clearly reveals the presence of these clouds...|$|R

5000|$|CIN is {{calculated}} by measurements recorded electronically by a <b>Rawinsonde</b> (weather balloon) which carries devices which measure weather parameters, such as air temperature and pressure. A single value for CIN {{is calculated}} from one balloon ascent {{by use of}} the equation below.

In many cases, the z-bottom value is {{the ground and the}} z-top value is the LFC. CIN is an energy per unit mass and the units of measurement are joules per kilogram (J/kg). CIN is expressed as a negative energy value. CIN values greater than 200 J/kg are sufficient to prevent convection in the atmosphere.|$|E

It is likely that satellite data over the United States would substantially impact mesoscale dynamical predictions if the effort were made to develop a composite moisture analysis system.

40|$|An {{initial value}} of {{pressure}} is required to derive the density and pressure profiles of the rocketborne rocketsonde sensor. This tie-on pressure value is obtained from the nearest <b>rawinsonde</b> launch at an altitude where overlapping <b>rawinsonde</b> and rocketsonde measurements occur. An error analysis was performed of the error sources in these sensors {{that contribute to the}} error in the tie-on pressure. It was determined that significant tie-on pressure errors result from radiation errors in the <b>rawinsonde</b> rod thermistor, and temperature calibration bias errors. To minimize the effect of these errors radiation corrections should be made to the <b>rawinsonde</b> temperature and the tie-on altitude should be chosen at the lowest altitude of overlapping data. Under these conditions the tie-on error, and consequently the resulting error in the Datasonde pressure and density profiles is less tha 1 %.

30|$|Vertical {{wavenumber}} spectra {{are analyzed}} by using temperature, zonal wind and meridional wind data obtained with MU radar and radiosondes at the MU observatory in Shigaraki and with operational <b>rawinsondes</b> at five stations over Japan. The temperature and meridional wind spectral power densities {{of the dominant}} gravity wave increase with a decrease of latitude, whereas the zonal wind spectral power {{seems to have a}} maximum near the tropopausal jet stream axis. An analysis technique to estimate a characteristic value of intrinsic frequency from the wind and temperature vertical-wavenumber spectra is proposed. The different meridional distributions of spectral power densities for temperature, zonal wind and meridional wind possibly can be explained by a latitudinal distribution of the characteristic intrinsic frequency.|$|R

However, satellite moisture data are highly questionable. The smallest discrepancy between satellite and weighted mean <b>rawinsonde</b> temperature and parameters derived from temperature was found over water and the largest discrepancy was found over mountains. Cumulative frequency distributions show that discrepancies between satellite and <b>rawinsonde</b> data can be represented by a normal distribution except for dew point temperature...|$|E

The morphological and turbulent structure of the quasi-steady storm is described. Data obtained during the South Park Area Cumulus Experiment from surface meteorological stations, <b>rawinsondes</b> and tethered balloons, conventional and Doppler radars, powered aircraft, and satellites, indicate that on July 19, 1977, a north-south oriented line of intense convective cells formed and remained within South Park. Elevated surface heating created a region of low-level convergence, importing Pacific moisture from west of the Rockies.
