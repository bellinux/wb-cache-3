50|$|When {{temperature}} {{differences between}} the poles and the tropics increase, a cycle of heavy wind, hurricanes, storms and tornadoes occurs. More evaporated moisture is carried to higher latitudes where it is deposited in ice and snow, the eventual result being glaciation and another ice age.

50|$|Hamaker {{believed}} <b>remineralizing</b> the world’s {{soil with}} rock dust, a quarrying by-product, could revitalise barren soil and reverse climate change.

When mixed with compost, the dust created rich, deep soils which could produce high growth vegetation free from pests and predators, at an accelerated rate. The idea was later confirmed by agricultural scientists such as Arden Andersen, who showed how high sugar and mineral levels in soil gave immunity to soil bacteria, stopping insect and fungal attacks. For Hamaker and Andersen, minerals were the primal food for micro-organisms which provided life and health for the soil.|$|E

However, this effect reaches a plateau {{after a period of}} time. This study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of additional acid etching on remineralization. Forty 1 mm × 2 mm human enamel blocks with chemically induced artificial incipient lesions were used. Ten specimens were randomly selected at the end of demineralization for transverse microradiography (TMR) analysis. The remaining specimens were then divided into three groups (n = 10). Group A was <b>remineralized</b> by a pH cycling system with 1100 ppm sodium fluoride for 20 days. In group B, the specimens were etched with 35 -percent phosphoric acid for 30 s and then <b>remineralized.</b> Group C was <b>remineralized</b> by same procedure as group B plus and given an additional acid etch after 10 days of remineralization. Mineral density was measured by x-ray microtomography (µ-CT). The volumetric mineral content [VM (µm 3 × 105) ] was determined between 91 and 0 -wt%. The µ-CT % mineral recovery (%) was calculated using the formula 100 ×(remineralize VM - demineralization VM) / (sound VM - demineralization VM). One-hundred-μm sections of demineralized and <b>remineralized</b> specimens were used to assess the mineral loss (IML: vol%×µm) and lesion depth (µm) using TMR. The three groups showed no significant difference in mineral change or mineral content for µ-CT or TMR lesion depth. The TMR IML showed {{a significant difference between the}} demineralized specimens and the three <b>remineralized</b> groups. The correlation between TMR IML and TMR lesion depth was 0. 66 (p < 0. 0001). The µ-CT percent mineral recovery from demineralization was correlated with neither TMR IML nor TMR lesion depth. When evaluated with µ-CT, the twice-acid-etched group presented lower mineral gain values than the group etched only once with acid. Also, the twice-etched group presented lower mineral gain and greater TMR IML compared with the non-acid etch group. TMR images revealed reduction of surface layer in the acid-etched groups, especially in the twice-etched group, in which significant reduction or loss of surface layer occurred. Based on these results, we conclude that additional acid etching with 35 -percent phosphoric acid does not enhance remineralization compared with a single application of acid etching. We believe that the viable existence of the surface layer is essential for remineralization of the lesion. Further investigations into the accuracy of µ-CT to detect minute mineral changes in incipient caries lesions are probably needed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Benefits of <b>remineralizing</b> {{agents in}} a wide variety of {{formulations}} have been proved beneficial in caries management. Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP–ACP) nanocomplex has been recommended and used as <b>remineralizing</b> agent. Nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HAp) is one of the most biocompatible and bioactive material having wide range of application in dentistry, but does it excel better compared to CPP-ACP. Aims: To evaluate and compare the <b>remineralizing</b> efficiency of the paste containing hydroxyapatite and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate. Settings and Design: The study was an in vitro single blinded study with lottery method of randomization approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Materials and methods: 30 non carious premolar teeth. The teeth were demineralized and divided into 2 groups and subjected to remineralization. The samples were analysed for surface hardness and mineral content. Statistical Analysis: Student t’ test and repeated measures of ANOVA was applied. Results: Average hardness in Nano-hydroxyapatite group increased to 340 [*]±[*] 31. 70 SD and 426 [*]±[*] 50. 62 SD for 15 and 30 days respectively and that of (CPP–ACP), 355. 83 [*]±[*] 38. 55 SD and 372. 67 [*]±[*] 53. 63 SD. The change in the hardness values was not statistically significant with P value of 0. 39 (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). Calcium and Phosphorous levels increased in both the groups but was not significant. Conclusion: Both the agents used are effective in causing remineralization of enamel. Nano-hydroxyapatite is more effective as compared to Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate, in increasing the Calcium and Phosphorus content of enamel, and this effect is more evident over a longer treatment period. Key Message: <b>Remineralizing</b> agents are a boon for caries management. With the advent of many formulations it is difficult to clinically select the agent.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Remineralization is an {{indispensable}} phenomenon during the natural healing process of enamel decay. The incorporation of zinc (Zn) into enamel crystal could accelerate this remineralization. The {{present study was}} designed to investigate the concentration and distribution of Zn in <b>remineralized</b> enamel after gum chewing. METHODS: The experiment was performed at the Photon Factory. Synchrotron radiation was monochromatized and X-rays were focused into a small beam spot. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) from the sample was detected with a silicon (Si) (lithium (Li)) detector. X-ray beam energy was tuned to detect Zn. The examined samples were small enamel fragments <b>remineralized</b> after chewing calcium phosphate-containing gum in situ. The incorporation of Zn atom into hydroxyapatite (OHAP), the main component of enamel, was measured using Zn K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) with fluorescence mode at the SPring- 8. RESULTS: A high concentration of Zn was detected in a superficial area 10 -mum deep of the sectioned enamel after gum chewing. This concentration increased over that in the intact enamel. The atomic distance between Zn and O in the enamel was calculated using the EXAFS data. The analyzed atomic distances between Zn and O in two sections were 0. 237 and 0. 240 nm. CONCLUSION: The present experiments suggest that Zn is effectively incorporated into <b>remineralized</b> enamel through the physiological processes of mineral deposition in the oral cavity through gum-chewing and that Zn substitution probably occurred at the calcium position in enamel hydroxyapatite...|$|R
