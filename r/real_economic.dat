5|$|Modern {{macroeconomics}} {{can be said}} to {{have begun}} with Keynes and the publication of his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Keynes expanded on the concept of liquidity preferences and built a general theory of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability.|$|E
5|$|Modern Japan's {{economic}} growth {{began in the}} Edo period. Some of the surviving elements of the Edo period are roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with the embrace of the market economy. Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia. The period of overall <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> growth from the 1960s to the 1980s {{has been called the}} Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to <b>real</b> time <b>economic</b> and emission dispatch by using orthogonal least-squares (OLS) and modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithms to construct the radial basis function (RBF) network. The objectives considered are fuel cost and NOx/CO 2 emissions. The RBF network is composed of input, hidden, and output layers. The OLS algorithm provides a simple and efficient means for fitting radial basis function networks. The MPSO algorithm is implemented to tune the parameters in the network, including the dilation and translation of RBF centers and the weights between the hidden and output layer. The proposed approach has been tested on the IEEE 30 -bus six-generator system. Testing results indicate that the proposed approach can make a quick response and yield accurate <b>Real</b> time <b>economic</b> and emission solutions.

25|$|Investment {{during the}} 1970s {{included}} industry and tourism development. The five-year plan for 1973–77 envisaged a <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> growth of 7.5% annually.

In 1975, King Hassan II announced a 50% increase in investment targets {{to allow for the}} effects of inflation. The 1978–80 plan was one of stabilization and retrenchment, designed to improve Morocco's balance-of payments position.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues of the 2006 elections is the economy. The high external debt and internal debt have inhibited growth. Around 75% of the population lives on less than US$2 a day, unemployment and underemployment are close to 50%, and income inequality is very pronounced. However, there have been some recent improvements. <b>Real</b> <b>economic</b> growth declined from 7.4% in 1999 to 1% in 2002, then turned around to grow back to 2.3% in 2003, and about 4% in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Kaohsiung's <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> and {{strategic}} importance began under Japanese rule (1895–1945). The Japanese needed a good port in southern Taiwan to serve those designated {{areas that were}} to become {{a major source of}} raw materials and food for Japan, and Kaohsiung was chosen. It became the southern terminus of the main north-south railway line, and from 1904 to 1907 extensive harbor works were undertaken. In 1920 the port was given the name Takao and the area became a municipality in 1920.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the effects}} of the crisis it was {{expected}} that several banks had to be bailed out by EU funds in 2013, however needed capital was able to be covered by the country's own funds. Fiscal actions and legislations aiming on the reduction of spendings as well as several privatisations supported an economic recovery as from 2014. The <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> growth rate was at 2.5% in 2016 and is expected to reach 3.5% in 2017. The construction sector has seen a recent increase, and the tourism industry is expected to have continuous rising numbers.|$|E
25|$|The post-2008 Irish {{economic}} downturn, {{coincided with}} a series of banking scandals, followed the 1990s and 2000s Celtic Tiger period of rapid <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> growth fuelled by foreign direct investment, a subsequent property bubble which rendered the real economy uncompetitive, and an expansion in bank lending in the early 2000s. An initial slowdown in economic growth amid the international financial crisis of 2007–08 greatly intensified in late 2008 and the country fell into recession {{for the first time since}} the 1980s. Emigration, as did unemployment (particularly in the construction sector), escalated to levels not seen since that decade.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the U.S. dollar was {{therefore}} no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the {{value of the}} U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> growth were linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign. Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value.|$|E

After 2000, the country enjoyed steady <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> growth averaging about sevenpercent annually. A new Constitution of Ukraine was adopted under second President Leonid Kuchma in 1996, which turned Ukraine into a semi-presidential republic and established a stable political system. Kuchma was, however, criticised by opponents for corruption, electoral fraud, discouraging free speech and concentrating too much power in his office. Ukraine also pursued full nuclear disarmament, giving up the third largest nuclear weapons stockpile in the world and dismantling or removing all strategic bombers on its territory in exchange for various assurances (main article: Nuclear weapons and Ukraine).|$|E
25|$|From roughly 1931 to 1937, the Netherlands {{suffered}} {{a deep and}} exceptionally long depression. This depression was partly caused by the after-effects of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 in the U.S., and partly by internal factors in the Netherlands. Government policy, especially the very late dropping of the Gold Standard, {{played a role in}} prolonging the depression. The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to some political instability and riots, and can be linked to the rise of the Dutch national-socialist party NSB. The depression in the Netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of 1936, when the government finally dropped the Gold Standard, but <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> stability did not return until after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in Costa Rica are {{approved}} by the regulatory agency ARESEP and instituted by AyA, the water and sewer agency for Costa Rica. Revenues from user fees do not cover {{operation and maintenance costs}} and the financial situation of the sector is weak. Furthermore, tariff levels do not allow for full cost recovery. In the case of AyA, there are cross-subsidies from San José to the other urban and rural areas of the country. The tariff is set based on short term cash flow needs rather than on <b>real</b> <b>economic</b> costs of service provision. AyA requests tariff increases when its financial situation is precarious and not a result of long-term investment planning. The regulator, ARESEP tends to approve a partial percentage of these requests.|$|E
