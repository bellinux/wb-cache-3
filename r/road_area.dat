5|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of music groups and rock bands, traditional folk music remains widely popular. The works of the national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and national anthem writer Rabindranath Tagore have a widespread following across Dhaka. The Baily <b>Road</b> <b>area</b> is known as Natak Para (Theatre Neighbourhood) which is the center of Dhaka's thriving theatre movement. Indian and Western music and films are popular with large segments of Dhaka's population.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many places}} in London, the Old Kent <b>Road</b> <b>area</b> {{did not suffer}} {{significant}} bomb damage during World War II. In 1968, a flyover opened at the northern end allowing access to New Kent Road which catered for the main flow of traffic. During the 1970s, run-down Victorian properties on and around Old Kent Road were demolished {{to make way for}} new housing estates. Burgess Park was created as part of the County of London Plan in 1943, which recommended new parkland in the area. Several tower blocks were built along the road, although some earlier 19th-century buildings, such as Nos.360–386, survived.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, opium dens {{used to be}} common in the Sungei <b>Road</b> <b>area.</b> The drugs were popular with workers looking for a cheap way to ease the {{hardship}} of the day's toil. The opium addicts were mainly poor, elderly people from working-class groups. In early 1991, a spate of fires destroyed more than 20 shophouses along Sungei Road. Most of the century-old shophouses, crumbling with age, had become potential fire hazards for its residents. The first fire incident left two people injured and 61 homeless. As a result, many of its buildings were torn down for safety reason and its inhabitants relocated in later years.|$|E

5|$|Manningham Rugby Football Club, {{formed in}} 1876, {{originally}} played games at Cardigan Fields, in the Carlisle <b>Road</b> <b>area</b> of Bradford. When their ground {{was sold to}} facilitate the construction of Drummond School, the club required a new home. Consequently, they bought one-third of the Valley Parade site in Manningham, taking a short-term lease out {{on the rest of}} the land in time to play there for the 1886–87 season. The new ground and the road it was built upon both adopted the name of the local area, Valley Parade, a name deriving from the steep hillside below Manningham. The land was previously a quarry, and formed part of a greater site owned by Midland Railway Company.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{was born}} in Wordsley in the West Midlands. He grew up, and still lives, in the {{affluent}} Manor <b>Road</b> <b>area</b> of Chigwell, Essex. He attended Wanstead High School. His parents Ronald John O'Sullivan and Maria O'Sullivan (née Catalano) ran a string of sex shops in Soho. O'Sullivan's father was jailed in 1992 for murder and released 18 years later. In 1991 dad-of-two Bruce Bryan was stabbed to death inside a club on Chelsea’s King’s Road. O’Sullivan, then 37, {{had been on a}} drinking binge with a friend when he went “looking for trouble” at the club. Bruce was murdered with a 3.75 inch lock knife wielded by O'Sullivan.|$|E

5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter <b>Road</b> <b>area</b> in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February, MNS workers {{attacked}} {{vendors and}} shopkeepers from North India {{in various parts}} of Maharashtra and destroyed government property to vent their anger against the reported move to arrest Raj. Sporadic violence was reported in Beed and Aurangabad. State-run buses in these areas were stone-pelted, resulting in the arrest of several MNS workers. In Nashik, MNS workers vandalised several shops belonging to North Indians, forcing other shops and business establishments to close down. One shopkeeper was severely beaten and was admitted to Nashik General Hospital. Banks and schools promptly closed after these incidents. Stone pelting by angry mobs was also reported from the city's Shalimar and Bytco squares, and the Satpur and Ambad industrial areas remained closed. Nashik police detained 26MNS workers after the violence. Six municipal cooperators were also put under preventive arrest. Additional police pickets were deployed {{in various parts of}} the city, including Shalimar and Ambad Chowk, Satpur, Nashik Road, the MNS head office at Mumbai Naka and some of the city suburbs. In Pune, MNS workers pelted stones on state-run buses and attacked a few shop owners in Pune's Laxmi <b>Road</b> <b>area,</b> prompting shops to shut down to avoid similar attacks.|$|E
5|$|Prior to enclosure, Low Fell was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} {{a small number of}} tinkers and hawkers but after enclosure the character of the suburb changed rapidly as people moved to be close to the new turnpike road. Although neighbouring Sheriff Hill thrived through an influx of heavy industry, built upon a colliery and pottery particularly, by 1827 new allotment owners on Low Fell had spent heavily to improve land so that sod cottages were a rarity and the last remaining pit heaps had been removed. The result was that numerous wealthy individuals were drawn to the area and it was this influx which helped shape and grow the early settlement, as opposed to the more usual means of growth allied to work and industry. The 1880s were a decade of considerable building in the village, fueled by the completion of a tramway with nearby Gateshead in 1883 and this brought some light industry to the area; in the same year Mawson & Swan built their dry plate works in Kells Lane and this proved to be the first of several light industries to locate in that area. These smaller industries, allied to several farms in the Dryden <b>Road</b> <b>area</b> of the village (Dryden Farm, Orchard Cottage Dairy Farm and Derwent Crook Farm all survived in this area until the Second World War), generated a small economy in an area where inhabitants had built and settled predominantly to escape the dirt and grime of industrial Tyneside.|$|E
