40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{examined}} whether self-rated health {{is an independent}} and significant predictor of mortality in people with diabetes, using data collected in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy. METHODS. Participants were asked to <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> health in comparison with others their age. A proportional hazards model was used to regress survival time on self-rated health {{and a number of}} covariates measuring physical health. RESULTS. People with younger onset diabetes (n = 891) who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> health relative to their peers as "worse" or "don't know" were no more likely to die than those <b>rating</b> <b>their</b> health as "the same" or "better" when physical health status was controlled. In contrast, those with older onset diabetes (n = 987) who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> health as "worse" or "don't know" were almost twice as likely to die as those <b>rating</b> <b>their</b> health as "the same" or "better" when physical health status was controlled. CONCLUSIONS. Self-rated health is a significant predictor of mortality in people with older onset diabetes but not in those with younger onset diabetes when physical health status is controlled...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{research}} {{across cultures}} often demonstrates that subjective well-being (SWB) {{is influenced by}} a person’s culture.

The following paper provides an overview of the many studies that show how the role of culture affects SWB.

Studies that support the individualistic side and studies that support the collectivistic side will be observed to determine if different cultural values impact how people <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> SWB.

40|$|This {{research}} design {{was based on}} the knowledge calibration work by Cunningham, Perry, Stanovich, and Stanovich (2004). One hundred and forty-one full time teachers participated in a four day professional development workshop on research-based reading instruction. Participants were administered a three-part survey comprised of 1) demographic information 2) knowledge calibration items measuring perceived understanding of phonics, phonological awareness, and syllabication and 3) phonics pretest published in Self-Paced Phonics: A Text for Educators (2005). There were statistically significant differences between participants who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> knowledge as high and those who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> knowledge as low on the phonological and phonics items. However, teachers in this study overestimated their knowledge of phonological awareness and phonics. There {{were no significant differences between}} those who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> knowledge as high as compared to those who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> knowledge as low on the subtest knowledge of syllabication. In addition, no significant differences were found between new teachers and experienced teachers in their knowledge in the three domains. The results and discussion address the importance of knowledge calibration to develop professional educational experiences for new and experienced teachers...|$|R

To date, {{the question of whether}} gender plays a role in how teachers self-assess their TPACK knowledge has not figured greatly in this research. This paper seeks to explore this possible role by using an adapted form of the Schmidt et al (2009 b) instrument to survey two cohorts of beginning teachers (64 in the first cohort and 142 in the second) from Victoria, Australia.

Hierarchical linear models were employed in depicting variations in selfrated health across White, Black, and Hispanic Americans. Results: Subjective health worsened over time albeit moderately. Relative to younger persons, older individuals <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> health poorer with a greater rate of deteriorating health. With reference to ethnic variations in the intercept and slope of perceived health, White Americans <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> health most positively, followed by Black Americans, with Hispanics <b>rating</b> <b>their</b> health least positively.

40|$|Background: General {{practice}} registrars report {{satisfaction with}} their placements in Australian training practices. However, {{more needs to be}} known about which criteria comprise this global satisfaction. Method: A questionnaire was sent to 61 general practice registrars in Western Australia who had recently completed a 6 month advanced term in a training practice, seeking feedback on the practice. They were asked to mark the training practice {{on a scale of one}} (lowest) to 10 (highest) according to how well the training practice met a range of criteria. Results: General practice registrars who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> training practice highly believed the required amount of effective teaching and supervision had been provided to them during the placement, and adequate time made available for consultations, case reviews, discussion, and tuition. Discussion: General practice registrars <b>rating</b> <b>their</b> training practice highly were more likely to have been allowed time to undertake outside education activities. Registrars not <b>rating</b> <b>their</b> training practices highly may be compromised by clinical service commitments. Registrars who believed members of the practice staff (medical and nonmedical) other than the general practice trainer had contributed to their learning were more likely to <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> training practice highly...|$|R
