5|$|In fact, process {{theology}} {{is difficult to}} define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests. John B. Cobb, Jr. is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist. Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory. In Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age, futurologists Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of the participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{entrance to}} the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged. The left panel depicts Yogishvara (Shiva as the Lord of Yoga) and the right shows Nataraja (Shiva as the Lord of Dance). The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara. The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states Stella Kramrisch, feature the vyaktavyakta concept of Samkhya, where the state of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures leap {{out of the cave}} walls towards the spectator as if trying to greet the narrative. Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of the rocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{front cover}} {{depicted}} an advanced civilization {{with a vast}} landscape of skyscrapers and red, sunburst-like flames <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of the cityscape as representations of Agharta's power. Yokoo used a combination of collage, airbrushing, and painting techniques as he had with his previous work, along with postcards collected from his trips to Tahiti and New York City; the cityscape on the front cover was taken {{from one of his}} postcards. The back cover showed the city submerged in water, embedded in coral reefs, and hovered over by a diver, fish, and a squid ascending from the city. According to graphic designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell, Yokoo depicted groups of jellyfish, coral reefs, and brightly colored fish to suggest an association between Agharta and Atlantis. The foreground of the back cover's illustration featured a reptilian creature. Cultural studies researcher Dagmar Buchwald interpreted this image as an allusion to similar ideas about Lemuria; this mythological continent supposedly existed during Earth's prehistory and was inhabited by an advanced civilization, later forced under the Earth's surface after its homeland was destroyed by a great flood.|$|E

25|$|At 440metres (1,444ft), Great Crag is {{not high}} by Lake District standards, and its small {{topographic}} prominence {{means that it}} is essentially a minor summit on the broad north-western slopes of Ullscarf. However, its rocky summit stands out amid the relatively featureless moorland and {{is the culmination of}} a steep slope <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of Borrowdale; this ensures that it is considered a fell in its own right, and it is given this status in Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells.|$|E

25|$|The visible geology in Bradgate Park {{ranges from}} some of the oldest (Precambrian) rocks in England to the {{youngest}} (Quaternary). The rock outcrops were created in conditions varying from volcanos <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of the ocean, to magma flowing deep underground and from tropical deserts to Ice sheets. Within the park the outcrops are widely distributed as hillside crags and outcrops, both along the valley sides of the River Lin and on the hilltop of Old John. They include rocks with some of the oldest known developed forms of fossil animal life in Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{extraordinary}} size of Olympus Mons {{is likely}} because Mars lacks mobile tectonic plates. Unlike on Earth, the crust of Mars remains fixed over a stationary hotspot, and a volcano {{can continue to}} discharge lava until it reaches an enormous height. Like the basalt volcanoes on Earth, Martian basaltic volcanoes are capable of erupting enormous quantities of ash. The basalt found on Earth and Mars are very similar in composition. Due to the gravity on Mars, there are less buoyant forces on the magma <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of the crust. Also, the magma chambers {{are thought to be}} much larger and deeper than the ones found on Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{neighbourhood}} of Copacabana beach hosts {{one of the}} world's {{most spectacular}} New Year's Eve parties ("Reveillon"), as {{more than two million}} revelers crowd onto the sands to watch the fireworks display. From 2001, the fireworks have been launched from boats, to improve the safety of the event. To the north of Leme, and at the entrance to Guanabara Bay, is the district of Urca and the Sugarloaf Mountain ('Pão de Açúcar'), whose name describes the famous mountain <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of the sea. The summit can be reached via a two-stage cable car trip from Praia Vermelha, with the intermediate stop on Morro da Urca. It offers views of the city second only to Corcovado mountain.|$|E

25|$|Then the swimmer shrugs their {{shoulders}} and throws their arms and shoulders forward, lunging cat-like {{back into the water}} (though the emphasis is to go forward, not down). As the swimmer sinks, they arch their back, and kicks. Timing is very important in order for the kick to transfer all of its force via the arched back, but the optimum time is when the arms are 3/4 extended. Then the swimmer kicks and presses on their chest, undulating a little underwater, and squeezing the gluteus maximus to prevent the legs and feet from <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of the water. The swimmer has now returned to the streamlined position, and the cycle starts again.|$|E
25|$|The Opening Ceremony {{culminated in}} the end of the torch relay, a {{tradition}} begun when Berlin hosted the games in 1936. Before the torch came into the stadium, a three rings arose {{from the center of the}} stadium that simulated a globe. This segment preceding the torch's arrival honored the first global torch relay that was begun by Athens 2004. Actors, suspended on cables, started <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of the crowd and ran towards the globe, carrying glowing sticks meant to simulate the Olympic torch. On the globe, the names of the cities which the torch visited were projected, and this segment ended with all the torchbearers floating mid-air coming together at the globe. After this segment ended, the lights were dimmed, and the sound of the heartbeat accompanied by thunderous cheers and applause met the torch's final arrival to the Olympic Stadium.|$|E

500|$|Michael Westmore {{designed}} the make-up in the episode, drawing inspiration from an alligator {{he saw in}} National Geographic magazine to create Tosk's appearance. The Hunters were initially intended to appear more alien-like, with steam <b>rising</b> <b>out</b> of their masks as they opened to reveal a demonic [...] face with huge eyes and scaly skin. However, due to budgetary restraints, the original costume and make-up plans were scrapped and the description was revised to become [...] "a rather mundane humanoid face, not far off human." [...] The transporter effect used by the Hunters {{was inspired by the}} science fiction film Metropolis (1927), specifically by the scene in which the robot Maria undergoes a transformation.|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} 60 story condo tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower has a massive [...] thick pile-raft {{foundation}} embedded deep into serpentine rock. Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, {{such as the}} Golden Gate Bridge, that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine. <b>Rising</b> <b>out</b> of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers. The core {{is attached to the}} outrigger columns by diagonal, steel buckling-restrained braces which are designed to dissipate energy during an earthquake through controlled hysteretic behavior. This type of advanced seismic system performs {{in a manner similar to}} that of shock absorbers. The braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss. Also of note is the controlled-rocking system which features vertical post-tensioning which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced-concrete shear-wall core. Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower have never before been applied in the United States.|$|E
