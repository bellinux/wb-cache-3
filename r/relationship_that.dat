5|$|Carson rose {{within the}} Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 {{becoming}} chief editor of publications.

By 1948, Carson {{was working on}} material for a second book, and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E

5|$|Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790 as Boletus piperatus, {{it is only}} distantly {{related to}} {{other members of the}} genus Boletus and was {{reclassified}} as Chalciporus piperatus by Frédéric Bataille in 1908. The genus Chalciporus was an early branching lineage in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with parasitic properties. Previously thought to be ectomycorrhizal (a symbiotic <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), C.piperatus is now suspected of being parasitic on Amanita muscaria. The flesh of C.piperatus has a very peppery taste, and {{can be used as a}} condiment or flavouring.|$|E

At least three Tang imperial princesses {{are known to have}} married khagans between 758 and 821. These unions temporarily stopped in 788, which is believed in part to be because stability within the Chinese empire meant that they were politically unnecessary; however, threats from Tibet in the west, and a renewed need for Uyghur support, precipitated the marriage of Princess Taihe to Bilge Khagan.|$|E

5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes {{instead of the}} usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and the waterfall swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> would indicate paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he gained}} a {{reputation}} as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow, he married in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage broke up in 1981, and in 1983 he formed another <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> lasted the rest of his life. After retiring from football he became manager of a pub, and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly that he needed two transplants at the age of 55, after which he swore off alcohol. Baxter was also addicted to gambling, and is estimated to have lost between £250,000 and £500,000. After he died of pancreatic cancer in 2001, his funeral was held in Glasgow Cathedral and his ashes were buried at Rangers' Ibrox Stadium. In 2003, a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown, Hill of Beath.|$|E
