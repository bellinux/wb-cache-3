Yet, it does not suffice to discuss these three systems separately. The main difficulty when speaking about fundamental rights in Europe is to reveal and analyse the mutual interactions and links between these systems.

The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the mediating effect of psychosocial problems in toddlers in the relationship between parental risk factors and teacher-reported <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> child maltreatment. It was expected for this relationships to indeed be partly mediated by psychosocial problems. Method Several questionnaires were filled out by 123 preschool teacher and 236 parents of 236 toddlers and subsequently analyzed using several regression analyses. Results Results indicate that there is no direct relationship between parental risk factors and child maltreatment risk as indicated by preschool teachers. There is, however, a significant relationship between all forms of psychosocial problems and reported <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> but no relationship with other forms of child maltreatment. Finally, an indirect relationship between parental risk factors, conduct problems and <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> was found.

To learn more about public employees in this respect, the paper will compare them with their counterparts in the private sector and explore multiple waves of data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study that covers a time period of sixteen years. We find that prosocial attitudes are mostly stable, there are no socialization effects in either sector, and differences among employees matter a great deal.

40|$|Ignoring or mismanaging risks is {{a common}} {{practice}} for decision-makers whose jobs should consist of doing exactly the opposite. At the root of this problem is the inability of policymakers to advert engaging in unfavorable risk-risk trade-offs, especially amid considerable complexities, ambiguities and scientific uncertainties (IRGC, 2005; IRGC, 2008 d). The U. S. biofuel policy is a cogent example of the latter, replete with risk governance deficits such as allowing policy to get too far ahead of science and technology; myopically-focusing on the quest toward energy security at the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> other essential objectives (e. g. food security and the environment); and prioritizing the political needs of interest groups (e. g. the corn farming industry) over those of the entire population (IRGC, 2008 b). As a result, this thesis concludes that the aforementioned risk governance deficits have shaped the U. S. biofuel policy as a wicked problem. In this light, if the U. S. is to succeed at improving its biofuel policy, it must continue to support the development of promising second- and third-generation biofuels. By contrast, continuing to prioritiz...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an interdisciplinary perspective on mine reclamation in forested areas of Ghana, a country characterised by conflicts between mining and forest conservation. A comparison was made between above ground biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon (SOC) content from two reclaimed mine sites and adjacent undisturbed forest. Findings suggest that on decadal timescales, reclaimed mine sites contain approximately 40 % {{of the total}} carbon and 10 % the AGB carbon of undisturbed forest. This raises questions regarding the potential for decommissioning mine sites to provide forestry-based legacies. Such a move could deliver a host of benefits, including improving the longevity and success of reclamation, mitigating climate change and delivering corollary enumeration for local communities under carbon trading schemes. A discussion of the antecedents and challenges associated with establishing forest-legacies highlights the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> the participation and heterogeneity of legitimate local representatives, which threatens the equity of potential benefits and sustainability of projects.

30|$|While single group studies {{such as this}} {{allow for}} a more {{in-depth}} analysis of migrant experiences, they run the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> experiences which are common to migrants outside of the group (Archdeacon, 1985; Vecoli, 1972). In terms of how far the PRS {{can be seen as}} ‘representative’ of stateless refugee more generally, the role of UNRWA and some Palestinians' rather unique position under international law may be called into question. Here however, it should be remembered that the statelessness of Palestinians, which is claimed to be a highly politicised and unique situation, is a result of imposed labels and framing by the international community (Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, 2016). Thus, if we put international organisations’ law and discourse aside and consider the cause, perpetuation and consequences of their statelessness, the Palestinians can be seen as being in a very similar situation to many other stateless refugees globally. All stateless situations are political and have their own specificities. This should not be seen as a reason to reject the value of this single group study, but rather a justification for further studies on different stateless refugee populations. In this sense, the findings should be considered as adding to the overall “mosaic” of our understanding (Segal, 1992, p. 93).|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the technology affording eye movement recordings carry the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> past achievements. Without the assistance of this modern armoury, great strides were made in describing the ways the eyes move. For Aristotle the fundamental features of eye movements were binocular, and he described the combined functions of the eyes. This was later given support using simple procedures like placing a finger over the eyelid of the closed eye and culminated in Hering's law of equal innervation. However, the overriding concern in the 19 th century was with eye position rather than eye movements. Appreciating discontinuities of eye movements arose from studies of vertigo. The characteristics of nystagmus were recorded before those of saccades and fixations. Eye movements during reading were described by Hering and by Lamare in 1879; both used similar techniques of listening to sounds made during contractions of the extraocular muscles. Photographic records of eye movements during reading were made by Dodge early in the 20 th century, and this stimulated research using a wider array of patterns. In the mid- 20 th century attention shifted to {{the stability of the}} eyes during fixation, with the emphasis on involuntary movements.

This study utilized a non-experimental, cross-sectional design to survey 250 first-time expectant mothers and their partners, attending Lamaze Classes at a public hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. Participants completed a 97 -item questionnaire comprised of eleven different measures identifying individual personal (Attachment Theory) and situational characteristics (Ecological Theory). Results indicated that this particular population was predominately White Caucasian first-time expectant mothers and partners, the partners were at greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> child <b>neglect</b> than first-time mothers. First-time mothers were at low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> child <b>neglect</b> but at higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> being unable to recognize situations indicative <b>of</b> child <b>neglect.</b> Preoccupied first-time mothers {{were more likely to}} recognize child neglect than fearful mothers.

40|$|Background: Successful {{parenting}} requires maternal {{behaviors that}} promote infant survival such as protection from predators. In animal studies, oxytocin (OT) {{has been linked}} to maternal aggression to protect offspring. No human study has explored this topic. Mothers with a diagnosis of postnatal depression (PND) are at higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> their infants. We hypothesized that intranasal OT administration would increase the protective behaviors of mothers with PND, toward their infants. Methods: Sixteen mothers with a diagnosis of PND participated in a double-blind, randomized-controlled, within-subject pilot study. Participants received intranasal OT during one visit and placebo spray on the alternate visit. Maternal protective behavior toward their infant was measured, {{in the presence of a}} socially intrusive stranger. Results: The enthusiastic stranger paradigm stimulated participants' protective responses in the presence of an intrusive stranger. Furthermore, this protective response of mothers with a diagnosis of PND was increased in the OT condition. Conclusions: The study introduces a new paradigm, the enthusiastic stranger paradigm, which may be used to examine a neglected type of parental behavior, that is, protection of offspring. The protective response of mothers with PND increased, in line with the ‘tend and defend’ effects of OT in animal models. In future work it should be tested whether this protection effect can also be found in nonclinical samples, or whether it is specific for clinically depressed mothers...|$|E
40|$|Co-{{management}}, or {{the joint}} {{management of the}} commons, is often formulated in terms of some arrangement of power sharing between the State and a community of resource users. In reality, there often are multiple local interests and multiple government agencies at play, and co-management can hardly be understood as the interaction of a unitary State and a homogeneous community. An approach focusing on the legal aspects of co-management, and emphasizing the formal structure of arrangements (how governance is configured) runs the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> the functional side of co-management. An alternative approach is to start from the assumption that co-management is a continuous problem-solving process, rather than a fixed state, involving extensive deliberation, negotiation and joint learning within problem-solving networks. This presumption implies that co-management research should preferably focus on how different management tasks are organized and distributed concentrating on the function, rather than the structure, of the system. Such an approach {{has the effect of}} highlighting that power sharing is the result, and not the starting point, of the process. This kind of research approach might employ the steps of (1) defining the social-ecological system under focus; (2) mapping the essential management tasks and problems to be solved; (3) clarifying the participants in the problem-solving processes; (4) analyzing linkages in the system, in particular across levels of organization and across geographical space; (5) evaluating capacity-building needs for enhancing the skills and capabilities of people and institutions at various levels; and (6) prescribing ways to improve policy making and problem-solving...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, German laws {{pertaining}} to construction have been simplified {{with the goals}} of reducing administrative procedures and government expenditures. On the one hand, the new regulations are intended to simplify construction activities by the elimination of obstacles toward approval and by the simplification of governmental supervision procedures. On the other hand, a simplified approval process shifts the responsibility for compliance with building codes to the owners, consultants (architects, civil engineers, experts, etc.) and construction project managers. First experiences of damage to buildings show that streamlined construction approvals run the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> basic geomorphologic and geologic fundamentals. Omissions are evident, which have led to failures at embankments and on building sites, causing considerable losses. The responsible administrations have reacted in different ways to the changed conditions, as far as they already are aware of the possible implications. In southern Lower Saxony State, the planning agencies have reacted to the growing responsibilities by attempting to determine at an early stage hazards in areas that are being developed. The practice aims to ensure that neither the planned construction activities nor the buildings themselves pose a threat for the residents. However, in the context of weighing these land-use decisions, it becomes apparent that in the future, administrative employees will have to be trained to foresee potential problems caused by the new regulations, while those affected by the decisions must receive advice on how to proceed.

Analytically the project addresses the Communication plan written by the EU Commission in cooperation with thirteen ngo’s and two biographies concerning FGC in the light of discourse analysis.

In addition, the aim is to examine the background behind the cultural tradition and assess the possibility of a patronizing eurocentric view on the issue and societies that practice it, performed largely by the organizations and commissions designed to support them. Conclusively the project shows a variety of positions according to FGC, placed in two main perspectives: a widely anthropological view and a widely feminist view, although both views present themselves within the field of Gender Studies. The first is concerned for the risk of Western meddling in African societies and proclaims the other to be enforcing unwanted cultural imperialism, the other for the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> a responsibility towards those in need, proclaiming the other to condone a cultural relativism that will allow male oppression to prevail.

However, recent rapid changes in university culture have resulted in less time for supervision, stricter completion deadlines, and a greater focus on efficiency and productivity. This has {{had an impact on}} this transition process, and this impact has not been widely studied. The aim {{of this article is to}} understand the consequences of the current trends for PhD students and the education of PhD students in general. The article is based on interviews with 14 international students from two different research programs at the Faculty of Engineering and Science at Aalborg University in Denmark.

Overall, the study concludes that the transition process of doctoral students is affected by the way different supervisors deal with current university trends and how PhD students fit or do not fit into their knowledge production practices.
