40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to measure the plowing set´s {{consumption}} of fuel using unilateral and <b>reversible</b> <b>plow</b> under equal conditions of an agricultural enterprise in the Czech Republic, and to evaluate the obtained results. Another aim of the thesis is to respond to scientific hypotheses as to which of the observed technologies {{has an impact on}} cost savings and whether this technology has an impact {{on the quality of the}} crop. The content of the thesis is a description of soil and its characteristics, it further deals with soil processing, tillage especially and its parameters, and tools needed for these operations. It then describes plow construction especially. Last but not least, the thesis contains factors which may influence work economy. The measuring has clarified the consumption of unilateral and reversible plows´ set under equal conditions. Based on this consumption it was found out which technology is more economical, optionally giving the growth of percentage...|$|E
40|$|Smooth plowing {{with the}} help of <b>reversible</b> <b>plows</b> has {{replaced}} an enclosure method of soil treatment. The method may cause a formation of back ridges or open furrows. Due to this fact turnings of a tractor unit with a minimum radius required in order to ensure shuttle movements each time in the furrow of the preceding operating stroke have become a dominant type of turnings. Non-productive shift time is directly dependent on them and it is on the average 10 – 12 %, and it is up to 40 % in small contour areas with short run. Large non-productive time is connected with the desire to reduce headland width at field edges, and then a turning is made in several stages while using a complicated maneuvering. Therefore, an increase in efficiency of a plowing unit by means of minimization on its turning radius and execution of turning at one stage in the shortest possible time are considered as relevant objectives. In such a case it is necessary {{to take into account the}} fact that potential capabilities of universal tractors having established time-proved designs in respect of reduction of turning radius are practically at the end. So it is expedient to solve the matter at the expense of additional removable devices that ensure transformation of tractor wheel formula at the run end in order to reorient its position. Finally high quality plowing ensured by future-oriented <b>reversible</b> <b>plows</b> will be accompanied not only by output increase per shift, but also by decrease in headland width, their compaction and abrasion due to suspension systems and increase in productivity. The developed design having a novelty which proved by an invention patent and representing an additional supporting and maneuvering device significantly minimizes all the above-mentioned disadvantages and does not require any changes in tractor production design. Investigations have been carried on the following topic: “Minimization of turning radius for universal tractors by transformation of wheel formula”. The paper presents a mathematical model, which reflects all the parameters having an effect on a tractor unit with a supporting and maneuvering device and it also considers a longitudinal and transverse stability. </p...|$|R
40|$|Disk plows {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tillage tools. Two way (<b>reversible)</b> disk <b>plows</b> can perform continues plowing. So they can save time and costs and hence improve overall efficiency. In this study, a “two-way” disk plow was designed based on a λ-formed straight-line, four-bar linkage (Daniel mechanism). This design contains disk and rear wheel reversing mechanism, stabilization mechanism of the plow, a disk angle adjustment tool and transport condition for safe operation of the mechanism. Disk reversing mechanism was designed based on a geometrical analysis considering working condition of the disk plow. The suitable displacement of the plow’s frame was achieved by dimensional analysis of Daniel mechanism and a derived mathematical equation. The rear wheel mechanism was made by means of adding a slotted link to the previous four-bar linkage. The synthesized five-bar linkage was then analyzed for its kinematical and force conditions. For each analysis, related diagrams were plotted and discussed. This innovation has the advantages of low production cost and maintenance as well as easy operation, because of its design simplicity with minimum mechanical auxiliaries. The modeling and analysis was done by the aid of CATIA software...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the best tillage method for making planting beds forvegetables cultivation using a two-wheel type tractor. Five tillage methods using a two-wheel type tractorwith its equipments were tested and evaluated in this study. The methods which were tested were: 1) <b>plowing</b> using a <b>reversible</b> type <b>plow,</b> followed by ridging using a ridger and finished by harrowing using arotary tiller (B-F-G 1 method); 2) plowing, followed by harrowing and finished by ridging (B-G-F method); 3) plowing, followed by harrowing followed by ridging and finished by 2 nd harrowing (B-G-F-G method); 4) plowing, followed by 40 cm width of harrowing and finished by ridging (B-G-F 2 method); and 5) plowing,followed by 40 cm width of harrowing and finished by ridging with 40 cm tractor wheel-base (B-G-F 3 method). The experiments were conducted on several plots of dry land. The results of the experimentsshowed that the B-G-F 3 method produced the best planting bed form, an appropriate bed size and abetter soil condition for vegetables cultivation. The field capacity of this method was 74 m 2 /hour and wasthe highest capacity among the five methods...|$|R
