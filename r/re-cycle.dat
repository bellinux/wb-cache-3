40|$|Taking {{to account}} high {{specific}} {{surface area of}} the powder, its surface state becomes {{one of the most}} important aspects of usability of the powder in PM process and particularly in additive manufacturing. Powder surface characterization of the two HX Ni-based superalloy powders sampled during selective laser melting – namely virgin and <b>re-cycled</b> powders was performed by means of XPS and high-resolution SEM combined with EDX. Results showed slight difference in surface chemical composition between the powders. The most sensitive to oxidation alloying elements in the powder – Al and Cr – segregate to the surface to form more stable oxides in case of <b>re-cycled</b> powder. Loss of silicon due to sublimation was also detected on the surface of <b>re-cycled</b> powder. Ni, as a base element, was presented in the form of hydroxide on the as-received surface of both investigated powders...|$|R
