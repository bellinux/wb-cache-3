40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} feasibility of employing software agent technology to support large-scale assessment. The research included the design, development, and evaluation of the Assessment Agent System for assessing comprehensive understanding based on concept maps. The system was designed by following an agent-oriented software design method. The Assessment Agent System is composed of five types of software agents: instructor agent, student agent, management agent, assessment agent, and <b>reporting</b> <b>agent.</b> Each of these agents was designed to possess different capabilities. Software agents in the system, through communication and cooperation, collectively provide the functionalities of user-system interaction, user management, task authoring and management, assessment delivery, task presentation, response collection, automatic assessing with feedback, and reporting. Through the process of design, development, and evaluation of the Assessment Agent System, this study demonstrates an approach that employs an agent-oriented software design method to produce sophisticated educational software applications...|$|E
40|$|Belief {{revision}} is {{the process}} in which an agent incorporates {{a new piece of}} information together with a pre-existing set of beliefs. When the new information {{comes in the form of}} a report from another agent, then it is clear that we must first determine whether or not that agent should be trusted. In this paper, we provide a formal approach to modeling trust as a pre-processing step before belief revision. We emphasize that trust is not simply a relation between agents; the trust that one agent has in another is often restricted to a particular domain of expertise. We demonstrate that this form of trust can be captured by associating a state-partition with each agent, then relativizing all reports to this state partition before performing belief revision. In this manner, we incorporate only the part of a report that falls under the perceived domain of expertise of the <b>reporting</b> <b>agent.</b> Unfortunately, state partitions based on expertise do not allow us to compare the relative strength of trust held with respect to different agents. To address this problem, we introduce pseudometrics over states to represent differing degrees of trust. This allows us to incorporate simultaneous reports from multiple agents in a way that ensures the most trusted reports will be believed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to organise and simplify the concept of brand response. It is a {{development}} of the authors’ semiotic approach to the concept of brand, which uses a triadic model based on the Peircean levels of analysis of the sign. The original model distinguishes three levels: identity, object and response. This article briefly describes the first two levels and goes into more depth with regard to brand response. From the theoretical point of view, the authors’ approach inverts the survey method used to ascertain positioning, image and value of the brand. Firstly, brand response is associations occurring in the minds of the <b>reporting</b> <b>agent.</b> Associations create awareness, and not the other way round, which is the concept underlying the current theory of brand equity. From the point of view of practice, it is the authors’ belief that the main contribution made by the triadic semiotic model applied to brand response is that of the importance of ‘‘firstness’’, i. e. the most immediate response possible. It is with a concern for ease of application that this article hopes to contribute by making brand analysis and assessment more intelligible. This article should be seen as an exploration into the possibility of simplifying the analysis of brand response. Its originality lies in the effort to return to the very reason for the existence of branding. The authors are convinced that by choosing differentiation as the guiding principle of their approach they have valorised what is essential, which is sometimes lost in more complex modelling...|$|E

40|$|Conventional renal {{cortical}} imaging agent, 203 Hg chlormerodrin, {{has become}} replaced by 99 mTc tagged agents, {{because of its}} high radiation hazard to attain high quality imaging especially by scintillation camera. Among these <b>reported</b> <b>agents</b> with 9 gmTc labeling, a new radiopharmaceutical, 90 mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), was evaluated for its validity of renal cortical visualization. Primaily, ten subjects with normal renal function were selected for kinetic studies. The initial distribution was mainly seen in the plasma compartment with negligible quantities of the label on red blood cells. Plasma clearance as well as urine accumulation data indicated that more than 50 % of the administered dose was retained in the kidney, at least, during the present observation until 24 hours. These characteristics with higher affinity for renal cortex than these of other <b>reported</b> <b>agents</b> appear to be well suited for renal cortical imaging. By reviewing clinical studies of more than hundred cases, excellent cortical imaging was proved to be useful for the regional characterization of renal cortex and, further, to facilitate the definite delineation of cortical abnormalities even in an equivocal case who underwent the pyelography and/or selective renal angiography...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a research work which {{is carried out}} to implement a multi agent system for voltage and outage monitoring system for Sri Lankan electricity distribution network. In Sri Lankan distribution network {{most of the new}} technological features {{can be seen in the}} different part such as automated meter reading, remote breaker operations. But distribution system fault identifications, voltage monitoring and network reconfiguration are carried out using basic technologies. Automated Meter Reading (AMR) system is introduced to read analogue energy meters remotely. Research on agent based AMR system is established with four major projects. Those are Agent based meter reading system, network resource planning of the agent based system, agent network reconfiguration and restoration project and Agent based voltage and outage monitoring system This particular research is on a development of Agent based voltage and outage monitoring system formulated for power distribution network using Multi Agent System. Establishment of agent based monitoring system is developed with the defined model in a part of the area network. The model is established to represent the distribution network and to collect voltage and interruption data to the server. Five major agents namely, Database Agent, Meter Agent, Breaker Agent, Area network Agent and <b>Reporting</b> <b>Agent</b> are defined. Voltage data collected from GPRS meter reading technique in Maharagama area is selected for the case study. Six different data sets are considered under the case study. There are four different types of voltage failures are identified as High voltage, low voltage, Branch failures and individual meter faults. These four scenarios are compared with conventional method and agent based system. Agent based monitoring system is continuously updated through GUI and it would visualise the voltage level of the network. It would enhance the functions of the control room operator. Transformer setting changes can be changed while monitoring high voltage and low voltage areas. Distribution network augmentation can be done with monitoring system by increasing transformer capacity or introducing new transformer in identified areas. Different types of GUIs are established to maintain easy monitoring system and reporting system. The reporting system is included the agent based report generation for power quality measurement indexes. Individual index vales of each consumers and the whole area network index can be monitored through this system. Scalability and the flexibility of the monitoring system increased with defined Multi Agents...|$|E
