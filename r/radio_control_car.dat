The designed leg {{is a simple}} mechanism driven by a rotation axle and does not make vertical oscillation of the body. Therefore, this mechanism is excellent in terms of energy efficiency compared with other leg mechanisms that generate vertical oscillation of the body. Experimental models with the developed leg mechanisms are constructed by using a <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> <b>car.</b> Utility of the developed leg mechanism is manifested by evaluation of traverse ability and energy efficiency using the experimental models and the numerical simulations...|$|E
