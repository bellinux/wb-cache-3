25|$|For example, a {{hedge fund}} {{believes}} that Risky Corp will soon default on its debt. Therefore, it buys $10million worth of CDS protection for two years from AAA-Bank, with Risky Corp as the <b>reference</b> <b>entity,</b> at a spread of 500 basis points (=5%) per annum.|$|E
25|$|A CDS {{contract}} is typically documented under a confirmation referencing the credit derivatives definitions as {{published by the}} International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The confirmation typically specifies a <b>reference</b> <b>entity,</b> a corporation or sovereign that generally, although not always, has debt outstanding, and a reference obligation, usually an unsubordinated corporate bond or government bond. The period over which default protection extends {{is defined by the}} contract effective date and scheduled termination date.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a non-parametric approach to calibration of credit derivative pricing models, where {{the payoff is}} contingent on defaults by multiple <b>reference</b> <b>entities.</b> The applied methodology {{is to find the}} joint probability distribution of times to default by the <b>reference</b> <b>entities</b> closest (in the sense of relative entropy) to the distribution being calibrated among all equivalent distributions that satisfy imposed calibration conditions. The research focuses on calibration to forward default probabilities and forward default correlations, as well as to conditional probabilities of the next default given the number of <b>reference</b> <b>entities</b> that have already defaulted. However, the results hold for a variety of alternative calibration conditions, such as market prices of other derivatives with payoffs dependent on default of some of the <b>reference</b> <b>entities</b> of the priced financial derivative. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} perform calibration to any consistent term structure of forward default probabilities, forward default correlations and forward conditional probabilities of the next default. The impact of the term structure of the default probabilities and correlations on the calibrated distribution is studied. Considering the calibration technique as a pricing methodology, for a wide range of credit derivatives it is shown that the price after calibration is infinitely differentiable as a function of the calibration conditions; the explicit expressions for partial derivatives are found. The developed approach can by applied to calibration of both structural and reduced-form models. ...|$|R

2500|$|A CDS {{is linked}} to a [...] "reference entity" [...] or [...] "reference obligor", usually a {{corporation}} or government. The <b>reference</b> <b>entity</b> is not {{a party to the}} contract. The buyer makes regular premium payments to the seller, the premium amounts constituting the [...] "spread" [...] charged by the seller to insure against a credit event. If the <b>reference</b> <b>entity</b> defaults, the protection seller pays the buyer the par value of the bond in exchange for physical delivery of the bond, although settlement may also be by cash or auction.|$|E
2500|$|Another common {{arbitrage}} strategy aims {{to exploit}} {{the fact that the}} swap-adjusted spread of a CDS should trade closely with that of the underlying cash bond issued by the <b>reference</b> <b>entity.</b> [...] Misalignments in spreads may occur due to technical reasons such as: ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{investor}} or speculator may “buy protection” {{to hedge}} {{the risk of}} default on a bond or other debt instrument, regardless of whether such investor or speculator holds an interest in or bears any risk of loss relating to such bond or debt instrument. In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, although CDS {{are not subject to}} regulations governing traditional insurance. Also, investors can buy and sell protection without owning debt of the <b>reference</b> <b>entity.</b> These [...] "naked credit default swaps" [...] allow traders to speculate on the creditworthiness of reference entities. CDSs can be used to create synthetic long and short positions in the <b>reference</b> <b>entity.</b> [...] Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDS. [...] In addition, CDSs can also be used in capital structure arbitrage.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} to analyse the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) {{market as a}} network of risk transfers among counterparties. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the notion of flow-of-risk and provide sufficient conditions for a bow-tie network architecture to endogenously emerge {{as a result of}} intermediation. This architecture shows three distinct sets of counterparties: i) Ultimate Risk Sellers (URS), ii) Dealers (indirectly connected to each other), iii) Ultimate Risk Buyers (URB). We show that the probability of widespread distress due to counterparty risk is higher in a bow-tie architecture than in more fragmented network structures. Empirically, we analyse a unique global dataset of bilateral CDS exposures on major sovereign and financial <b>reference</b> <b>entities</b> in 2011 [...] 2014. We find the presence of a bow-tie network architecture consistently across both <b>reference</b> <b>entities</b> and time, and that the flow-of-risk originates from a large number of URSs (e. g. hedge funds) and ends up in a few leading URBs, most of which are non-banks (in particular asset managers). Finally, the analysis of the CDS portfolio composition of the URBs shows a high level of concentration: in particular, the top URBs often show large exposures to potentially correlated <b>reference</b> <b>entities...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} the prohibition against naked CDS buying implemented by the European Union in November 2012. Three aspects of market quality are analyzed: liquidity, volatility, and price informativeness. Overall, our results suggest that the ban produced negative effects on liquidity and price informativeness. First, we find that in territories within the scope of the EU regulation, the bid–ask spreads on sovereign CDS contracts rose after the ban, but fell for countries outside its bounds. Open interest declined for both groups of CDS <b>reference</b> <b>entities</b> in our sample, but significantly more in the constraint group. Price delay increased more prominently for countries affected by the ban, whereas price precision decreased for these countries while increasing for CDSs written on other sovereign <b>reference</b> <b>entities.</b> Most notably, our findings indicate that hese negative effects were more pronounced amid <b>reference</b> <b>entities</b> exhibiting lower credit risk. With respect to volatility, the evidence suggests that the ban was successful in stabilizing the CDS market in that volatility decreased, particularly for contracts written on riskier CDS entities.

2500|$|The buyer {{takes the}} risk that the seller may default. [...] If AAA-Bank and Risky Corp. default {{simultaneously}} ("double default"), the buyer loses its protection against default by the <b>reference</b> <b>entity.</b> [...] If AAA-Bank defaults but Risky Corp. does not, the buyer might need to replace the defaulted CDS at a higher cost.|$|E
2500|$|As an example, {{imagine that}} an {{investor}} buys a CDS from AAA-Bank, where the <b>reference</b> <b>entity</b> is Risky Corp. [...] The investor—the buyer of protection—will make regular payments to AAA-Bank—the seller of protection. If Risky Corp defaults on its debt, the investor receives a one-time payment from AAA-Bank, and the CDS contract is terminated.|$|E
2500|$|Another kind of {{risk for}} the seller of credit default swaps is jump risk or jump-to-default risk. A seller of a CDS could be {{collecting}} monthly premiums with little expectation that the <b>reference</b> <b>entity</b> may default. [...] A default creates a sudden obligation on the protection sellers to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars to protection buyers. This risk is not present in other over-the-counter derivatives.|$|E
50|$|The {{product has}} many variations, {{including}} {{where there is}} a basket or portfolio of <b>reference</b> <b>entities,</b> although fundamentally, the principles remain the same.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the CDS-Bond basis on S&P 100 <b>reference</b> <b>entities</b> {{in the period}} 2009 - 14. Specifically, this paper seeks to explain the cross-sectional variation in basis levels displayed by these entities. With few exceptions, prior work focuses on the aggregated basis level and what might cause this to deviate from the theoretical zero level. I choose to extend the literature by focusing on disaggregated data, on the individual basis levels of specific <b>reference</b> <b>entities,</b> and investigate why there is such significant disparity around the mean basis level. This paper finds that a vast proportion of cross-sectional variation in basis levels {{can be attributed to}} differentials in bond specific liquidity measures and disparity in funding related limits to arbitrage...|$|R

The probability of no default occurring over a time period from [...] to [...] decays exponentially with a time-constant determined by the credit spread, or mathematically [...] where [...] is the credit spread zero curve at time [...] The riskier the <b>reference</b> <b>entity</b> the greater the spread and the more rapidly the survival probability decays with time.|$|E
2500|$|Most CDSs are {{documented}} using standard forms {{drafted by the}} International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), {{although there are many}} variants. [...] In addition to the basic, single-name swaps, there are basket default swaps (BDSs), index CDSs, funded CDSs (also called credit-linked notes), as well as loan-only credit default swaps (LCDS). In addition to corporations and governments, the <b>reference</b> <b>entity</b> can include a special purpose vehicle issuing asset-backed securities.|$|E
2500|$|CDS confirmations also {{specify the}} credit events {{that will give}} rise to payment {{obligations}} by the protection seller and delivery obligations by the protection buyer. [...] Typical credit events include bankruptcy {{with respect to the}} <b>reference</b> <b>entity</b> and failure to pay with respect to its direct or guaranteed bond or loan debt. [...] CDS written on North American investment grade corporate reference entities, European corporate reference entities and sovereigns generally also include restructuring as a credit event, whereas trades referencing North American high-yield corporate reference entities typically do not.|$|E

2500|$|Physical settlement: [...] The {{protection}} seller pays the buyer par value, {{and in return}} takes delivery of a debt obligation of the <b>reference</b> <b>entity.</b> [...] For example, a hedge fund has bought $5million worth of protection from a bank on the senior debt of a company. [...] In {{the event of a}} default, the bank pays the hedge fund $5million cash, and the hedge fund must deliver $5million face value of senior debt of the company (typically bonds or loans, which are typically worth very little given that the company is in default).|$|E
2500|$|Cash settlement: [...] The {{protection}} seller pays the buyer {{the difference between}} par value and the market price of a debt obligation of the <b>reference</b> <b>entity.</b> [...] For example, a hedge fund has bought $5million worth of protection from a bank on the senior debt of a company. [...] This company has now defaulted, and its senior bonds are now trading at 25 (i.e., 25 cents on the dollar) since the market believes that senior bondholders will receive 25% of the money they are owed once the company is wound up. [...] Therefore, the bank must pay the hedge fund $5million×(100%−25%) =$3.75million.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new type}} of default swap is the [...] "loan only" [...] credit default swap (LCDS). This is conceptually very similar to a {{standard}} CDS, but unlike [...] "vanilla" [...] CDS, the underlying protection is sold on syndicated secured loans of the <b>Reference</b> <b>Entity</b> rather than the broader category of [...] "Bond or Loan". Also, as of May 22, 2007, for the most widely traded LCDS form, which governs North American single name and index trades, the default settlement method for LCDS shifted to auction settlement rather than physical settlement. [...] The auction method {{is essentially the same}} that has been used in the various ISDA cash settlement auction protocols, but does not require parties to take any additional steps following a credit event (i.e., adherence to a protocol) to elect cash settlement. [...] On October 23, 2007, the first ever LCDS auction was held for Movie Gallery.|$|E

2500|$|The {{definition}} of restructuring is quite technical but is essentially intended {{to respond to}} circumstances where a <b>reference</b> <b>entity,</b> {{as a result of}} the deterioration of its credit, negotiates changes in the terms in its debt with its creditors as an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings (i.e. the debt is restructured). [...] During the 2012 Greek sovereign debt crisis, one important issue was whether the restructuring would trigger Credit default swap (CDS) payments. [...] European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund negotiators avoided these triggers as they could have jeopardized the stability of major European banks who had been protection writers. [...] An alternative could have been to create new CDS which clearly would pay in the event of debt restructuring. The market would have paid the spread between these and old (potentially more ambiguous) CDS. This practice is far more typical in jurisdictions that do not provide protective status to insolvent debtors similar to that provided by Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. [...] In particular, concerns arising out of Conseco's restructuring in 2000 led to the credit event's removal from North American high yield trades.|$|E
