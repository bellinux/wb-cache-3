40|$|When {{assessing}} risks on a finite-time horizon, {{the problem}} {{can often be}} reduced {{to the study of}} a random sequence C(N) = (C 1,.

Our aim is to build a regular variation framework for such random sequences of <b>random</b> <b>length,</b> to study their spectral properties and, subsequently, to develop risk measures. In several applications, many risk indicators can be expressed from the asymptotic behavior of ||C(N) ||, for some norm ·. We propose a generalization of Breiman Lemma that gives way to an asymptotic equivalent to C(N) and provides risk indicators such as the ruin probability and the tail index for Shot Noise Processes on a finite-time horizon. Lastly, we apply our final result to a model used in dietary risk assessment and in non-life insurance mathematics to illustrate the applicability of our method...|$|R

40|$|Cash forward {{contracting}} is a common, {{and often}} preferred, means of managing price risk for agribusinesses. Despite this, {{little is known}} about the performance of cash forward markets, in particular the role they play in price discovery. The lumber market provides a unique case for examining this issue. The Bloch Lumber Company maintains an active cash forward market for many lumber products, and publishes benchmark forward prices on their website and disseminates these prices to data vendors. Focusing on 2 x 4 <b>random</b> <b>lengths</b> lumber and 7 / 16 oriented strand board, this research examines the lead-lag relationships between the three-month forward prices published by Bloch Lumber and representative spot prices. Results suggest that at least for 2 x 4 <b>random</b> <b>lengths</b> lumber, the forward prices published by Bloch Lumber lead the spot price. However, spot prices do not lead the forward prices for 2 x 4 <b>random</b> <b>lengths</b> lumber, but do for oriented strand board. While these results suggest that the Bloch Lumber forward cash prices are contributing to price discovery, the dominant market for price discovery may be an existing spot or futures market.

We define a class of flow rules on marked Galton-Watson trees for which we are able, under some algebraic assumptions, to build explicit invariant measures. We apply this result, together with the ergodic theory on Galton-Watson trees developed by Lyons, Pemantle and Peres, to the computation of Hausdorff dimensions of harmonic measures in two cases. The first one is the harmonic measure of the (transient) λ-biased random walk on Galton-Watson trees, for which the invariant measure and the Hausdorff dimension were not explicitly known.

40|$|We {{have applied}} the {{relation}} for {{the mean of}} the expected values of the maximum excursion in a bounded random walk to estimate the <b>random</b> walk <b>length</b> from time series of eight independent global mean quantities (temperature maximum, summer lag, temperature minimum and winter lag in land and over the ocean) derived from the NOAA-CIRES twentieth century reanalysis (V 2) for 1871 - 2008 and the ECHAM 5 IPCC AR 4 twentieth century run for 1860 - 2100, and also the Millenium 3100 yr control run mil 01, which was segmented into records of specified period. The results for NOAA-CIRES, ECHAM 5, and mil 01 (mean of thirty 100 yr segments) are very similar and indicate a <b>random</b> walk <b>length</b> on land of 24 yr and over the ocean of 20 yr. Using three 1000 yr segments from mil 01, the <b>random</b> walk <b>lengths</b> increased to 37 yr on land and 33 yr over the ocean. This result indicates that the shorter records may not totally capture the random variability of climate relevant on the time scale of civilizations, for which the <b>random</b> walk <b>length</b> is likely to be about 30 years. For this <b>random</b> walk <b>length,</b> the observed standard deviations of maximum temperature and minimum temperature yield respective expected maximum excursions on land of 1. 4 and 2. 3 degrees C and over the ocean of 0. 5 and 0. 7 degrees C, which are substantial fractions of the global warming signal.
