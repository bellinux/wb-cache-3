50|$|The Constitution {{provides}} for a three-fold distribution of legislative subjects between the Union andthe states, viz., List-I (the Union List), List-II (the State List) and List-III (the Concurrent List) in theSeventh Schedule:(i) The Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws with respect {{to any of the}} mattersenumerated in the Union List. This list has at present 100 subjects (originally 97 subjects)like defence, banking, foreign affairs, currency, atomic energy, insurance, communication,inter-state trade and commerce, census, audit and so on.(ii) The state legislature has “in normal circumstances” exclusive powers to make laws withrespect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List. This has at present 61 subjects(originally 66 subjects) like public order, police, public health and sanitation, agriculture,prisons, local government, fisheries, markets, theaters, gambling and so on.(iii) Both, the Parliament and state legislature can make laws with respect to any of the mattersenumerated in the Concurrent List. This list has at present 52 subjects (originally 47 subjects)like criminal law and procedure, civil procedure, marriage and divorce, population controland family planning, electricity, labour wel-fare, economic and social planning, drugs,newspapers, books and printing press, and others. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976transferred five subjects to Concurrent List from State List, that is, (a) education, (b) forests,(c) weights and measures, (d) protection of wild animals and birds, and (e) administration ofjustice; constitu-tion and organisation of all courts except the Supreme Court and the highcourts.The power to make laws with respect to residuary subjects (i.e., the matters which are notenumerated in any of the three lists) is vested in the Parliament. This residuary power of legisla-tionincludes the power to levy residuary taxes.From the above scheme, {{it is clear that the}} matters of national importance and the matters whichrequires uniformity of legislation nationwide are included in the Union List. The matters of regionaland local importance and the matters which permits diversity of interest are specified in the StateList. The matters on which uniformity of legislation throughout the country is desirable but notessential are enumerated in the concurrent list. Thus, it permits diversity along with uniformity.In US, only the powers of the Federal Government are enumerated in the Constitution and theresiduary powers are left to the states. The Australian Constitution followed the American pattern ofsingle enumeration of powers. In Canada, on the other hand, there is a double enumeration—Federaland Provincial, and the residuary powers are vested in the Centre.The Government of India (GoI) Act of 1935 provided for a three-fold emumenration, viz., federal,provincial and concurrent. The present Constitution follows the scheme of this act but with onedifference, that is, under this act, the residuary powers were given neither to the federal legislaturenor to the provincial legislature but to the governor-general of India. In this respect, India follows theCanadian precedent.The Constitution expressly secure the predominance of the Union List over the State List and theConcurrent List and that of the Concurrent List over the State List. Thus, in case of overlappingbetween the Union List and the State List, the former should prevail. In case of overlapping betweenthe Union List and the Concurrent List, it is again the former which should prevail. Where there is aconflict between the Concurrent List and the State List, it is the former that should prevail.In case of a conflict between the Central law and the state law on a subject enumerated in theConcurrent List, the Central law prevails over the state law. But, there is an exception. If the state lawhas been reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then the state lawprevails in that state. But, it would still be competent for the Parliament to override such a law bysubsequently making a law on the same matter.''''3. Parliamentary Legislation in the State Field''''''The above scheme of distribution of legislative powers between the Centre and the states is to bemaintained in normal times. But, in abnormal times, the scheme of distribution is either modified orsuspended. In other words, the Constitution empowers the Parliament to make laws on any matterenumerated in the State List under the following five extraordinary circumstances:When Rajya Sabha Passes a Resolution If the Rajya Sabha declares that it is necessary in thenational interest that Parliament should make laws on a matter in the State List, then the Parliamentbecomes competent to make laws on that matter. Such a resolution must be supported by two-thirds ofthe members present and voting. The resolution remains in force for one year; it can be renewed anynumber of times but not exceeding one year at a time. The laws cease to have effect on the expirationof six months after the resolution has ceased to be in force.This provision does not restrict the power of a state legislature to make laws on the same matter. But,in case of inconsistency between a state law and a parliamentary law, the latter is to prevail.During a National Emergency The Parliament acquires the power to legislate with respect tomatters in the State List, while a proclamation of national emergency is in operation. The lawsbecome inoperative on the expiration of six months after the emergency has ceased to operate.Here also, the power of a state legislature to make laws on the same matter is not restricted. But, incase of repugnancy between a state law and a parliamentary law, the latter is to prevail.When States Make a Request When the legislatures of two or more states pass resolutionsrequesting the Parliament to enact laws on a matter in the State List, then the Parliament can makelaws for regulating that matter. A law so enacted applies only to those states which have passed theresolutions. However, any other state may adopt it afterwards by passing a resolution to that effect inits legislature. Such a law can be amended or repealed only by the Parliament and not by thelegislatures of the concerned states.The effect of passing a resolution under the above provision is that the Parliament becomes entitled tolegislate with respect to a matter for which it has no power to make a law. On the other hand, the statelegislature ceases to have the power to make a law with respect to that matter. The resolutionoperates as abdication or surrender of the power of the state legislature with respect to that matterand it is placed entirely in the hands of Parliament which alone can then legislate with respect to it.Some examples of laws passed under the above provision are Prize Competition Act, 1955; WildLife (Protection) Act, 1972; Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; Urban Land(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976; and Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994.To Implement International Agreements The Parliament can make laws on any matter in the StateList for implementing the international treaties, agreements or conventions. This provision enables theCentral government to fulfil its international obligations and commitments.Some examples of laws enacted under the above provision are United Nations (Privileges andImmunities) Act, 1947; Geneva Convention Act, 1960; Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982 and legislationsrelating to environment and TRIPS.During President’s Rule When the President’s rule is imposed in a state, the Parliament becomesempowered to make laws with respect to any matter in the State List in relation to that state. A lawmade so by the Parliament continues to be operative even after the president’s rule. This means thatthe period for which such a law remains in force is not co-terminus with the duration of thePresident’s rule. But, such a law can be repealed or altered or re-enacted by the state legislature.4. Centre’s Control Over State LegislationBesides the Parliament’s power to legislate directly on the state subjects under the exceptionalsituations, the Constitution empowers the Centre to exercise control over the state’s legislativematters in the following ways:(i) The governor can reserve certain types of bills passed by the state legislature for theconsideration of the President. The president enjoys absolute veto over them.(ii) Bills on certain matters enumerated in the State List can be introduced in the state legislatureonly with the previous sanction of the president. (For example, the bills imposing restrictionson the freedom of trade and commerce).(iii) The President can direct the states to <b>reserve</b> <b>money</b> bills and other financial bills passed bythe state legislature for his consideration during a financial emergency.From the above, it is clear that the Constitution has assigned a position of superiority to the Centre inthe legislative sphere. In this context, the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations (1983-87)observed: “The rule of federal supremacy is a technique to avoid absurdity, resolve conflict andensure harmony between the Union and state laws. If this principle of union supremacy is excluded, itis not difficult to imagine its deleterious results. There will be every possibility of our two-tierpolitical system being stultified by interference, strife, legal chaos and confusion caused by a host ofconflicting laws, much to the bewilderment of the common citizen. Integrated legislative policy anduniformity on basic issues of common Union-state concern will be stymied. The federal principle ofunity in diversity will be very much a casualty. This rule of federal supremacy, therefore, isindispensable for the successful functioning of the federal system”.|$|E

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that Federal <b>Reserve’s</b> <b>money</b> supply can be characterized by a simple rule, whereby {{the growth rate of}} nonborrowed reserves depends on expected in‡ation. The Volcker-Greenspan era is found to be associated with a negative in‡ation elasticity, whereas our estimates indicate that the Federal Reserve in the pre- 1980 era supplied money in an accommodating way. While these results appear to be consistent with empirical evidence on interest rate rules, our theoretical analysis gives rise to novel insights. Applying a New Keynesian model, money supply rules are shown to ensure saddle path stabil-ity, indicating that they do not allow for self-fulling expectations. Further, optimal monetary policy canbeimplementedby a money supplyrule witha negative in‡ation elasticity, implying that the pre- 1980 regime was less e¢cient in dampening macroeconomic ‡uctuations. On the transmission of money sup-ply shocks, we show that a negative in‡ation elasticity raises the likelihood of a liquidity e¤ect and lowers the persistence of the output response. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} China has faced an {{increasing}} trilemma [...] how {{to pursue an}} independent domestic monetary policy and limit exchange rate flexibility, {{while at the same}} time facing large and growing international capital flows. This paper analyzes the impact of the trilemma on China's monetary policy as the country liberalizes its good and financial markets and integrates with the world economy. It shows how China has sought to insulate its <b>reserve</b> <b>money</b> from the effects of balance of payments inflows by sterilizing through the issuance of central bank liabilities. However, we report empirical results indicating that sterilization dropped precipitously in 2006 in the face of the ongoing massive buildup of international reserves, leading to a surge in <b>reserve</b> <b>money</b> growth. We also estimate a vector error correction model linking the surge in China's <b>reserve</b> <b>money</b> to broad money, real GDP, and the price level. We use this model to explore the inflationary implications of different policy scenarios. Under a scenario of continued rapid <b>reserve</b> <b>money</b> growth (consistent with limited sterilization of foreign exchange reserve accumulation) and strong economic growth, the model predicts a rapid increase in inflation. A model simulation using an extension of the framework that incorporates recent increases in bank reserve requirements also implies a rapid rise in inflation. By contrast, model simulations incorporating a sharp slowdown in economic growth such as that seen in late 2008 and 2009 lead to less inflation pressure even with a substantial buildup in international reserves.
