25|$|SSRIs prevent 5-HT from binding to SERT which {{prevents}} absorption of 5-HT {{back into the}} presynapse terminal, where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase or stored in secretory vesicles. As a result, the 5-HT concentration increases at the somatodendritic area of the 5-HT neuron {{but not so much}} at the axon terminal area (demonstrated in figure 2). This increase in 5-HT concentration causes desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. When these 5-HT1A autoreceptors have been downregulated, they will no longer restrict the impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. The impulse flow is turned on and as a result 5-HT is released at the axon terminal. However, this increase of 5-HT does not happen quickly compared to the increase of 5-HT at the somatodendretic area of the 5-HT neuron. This delay is caused by the time it takes 5-HT to downregulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors and turn on the neuro impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. This delay can explain the reason why antidepressants do not have effect on depression immediately. This can also be the reason why the antidepressant mechanisms can be connected to the increasing neuro impulse flow from 5-HT neurons, where as the concentration of 5-HT increases at the axon terminal before SSRIs start to work properly. When SSRIs have (1) inhibited the re-uptake pump, (2) increased somatodendritic 5-HT, (3) desensitized somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, (4) turned on the impulse flow and (5) increased the release of 5-HT from axon terminal, the last step might be desensitization of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. This desensitization could be the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> of adverse effects of SSRIs as tolerance develops.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{there was}} a {{significant}} reduction in maxillary intermolar width, maxillary intercanine width and mandibular intercanine width in group 1 when compared to group 2. However, there was no change in mandibular intermolar width (Table  6). The authors in [9] stated that ankyloglossia limits the upward movement of the tongue, thus preventing the formation of lip seal during swallowing, leading to tongue thrusting, which in turn can cause open bite. Also, the upward movement of the tongue is necessary for the creation of normal width of the hard palate. Inability of the tongue to lift upward results in unrestricted buccinator muscle activity, resulting in constriction of maxillary arch, which could be the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> in maxillary intermolar width and intercanine width in group 1. Reduction of mandibular intercanine width can be due to pull of the short lingual frenum resulting in constriction of mandibular anterior region.

However, MMF-related side effects often necessitate dose reduction, which may expose patients to {{a higher risk of}} acute rejection and graft loss. This study's aim was to examine the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> MMF dose <b>reduction</b> during the first post-transplant year and its impact on acute rejection, overall and death-censored graft loss. Methods: Single-center retrospective analysis of 749 renal transplant recipients treated with MMF in their initial maintenance immunosuppressive protocol.

40|$|Abstract. We study Hydrogen sulfide gas {{detection}} properties of pure and 1 % copper oxide added WO 3 thin films. The spin coated deposits on alumina substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 1 hour {{in order to}} improve the crystallinity of the films. The sensitivity of pure tungsten oxide is poor even at temperatures of about 100 °C but the doped samples exhibit good response to H 2 S gas. Our data show sensitivity of about 1500 in 10 ppm diluted gas in air at 100 °C. The films are sensitive to the gas even at 250 ppb (sensitivity about 2) H 2 S concentration at 100 °C but with rather long recovery time. Crystal structure, morphology and chemical composition of samples were studied by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. We suggest that Cu 2 O dopants dissociate H 2 S molecules and spillover of the hydrogen atoms onto the cracked WO 3 surface.

30|$|The {{accumulation}} of metals in the earthworm tissues {{might be the}} <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> of leachable concentration of metals during vermicomposting of S. natans. Similar results were also reported by Jain et al. (2004) and Singh and Kalamdhad (2013). The evidence of cutaneous absorption of metals by earthworms was reported by Suthar (2009). The leachability of metals might have also reduced due to increase in pH and complexity of metal humic substances. An increase in the pH of vermicompost resulted in an increase of surface negative charge, which increased cationic adsorption, formation of metal hydroxyl species that have a greater affinity for adsorption sites than the metal cations, and precipitation of metal as metal hydroxides (Maity et al. 2008). Another reason for the reduction of leachable metal concentration during vermicomposting was the affinity of the metals with the functional groups –OH or –COO– of humic substances of the vermicompost (Kang et al. 2011). The threshold limits for heavy metal contamination are 20  mg/kg for Cd, 100  mg/kg for Cr and 100  mg/kg for Pb (US EPA method 1311, 1992). Therefore, {{the results of the}} TCLP test confirmed that the heavy metals’ concentrations in all trials were under the threshold limits for compost use for agriculture purposes.|$|E
30|$|In the {{proposed}} method, replacement by immediate neighborhood is avoided by substitution of noisy pixels potential candidates based on linear prediction. Since linear prediction is employed prior to any processing, {{repetition of the}} same pixel is avoided as window is moved from one position to the next position. This eliminates streaking. In the standard switching median filtering except DBA, estimation of noise-free pixels takes considerable time on account of mathematical criteria employed. This time increases significantly in adaptive based estimation techniques. In {{the proposed}} filter, the estimation {{is not based on}} explicit computation of estimation criteria; instead a median filtering replaces estimation. This is the main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> in computational complexity. Extra computation necessitated by low-order linear prediction is significantly smaller than techniques employing rigorous estimation schemes. The DBA {{which is one of the}} fastest algorithms (which also avoids estimation) involves three median sorting, namely, right sorting, left, and diagonal sorting. In the proposed filter there is only two sortings. Therefore introduction of first-order linear prediction only slightly increases the computation time compared with DBA but much lower than other filters. The proposed algorithm can be a good compromise in preference to the adaptive algorithm, DBA, and robust statistics-based algorithm.|$|E

30|$|The {{structural}} framework as {{generated from}} the 3 D seismic volume indicates a four (4)-way dip closure and two (2) fault-assisted anticlines as the dominant trapping mechanism that confined hydrocarbon fluids to the different reservoir units. The faulting systems {{as determined by the}} structural mapping divided each reservoir horizons into three (3) different blocks which were indicated by well test data to be isolated and non-communicating (Bailey et al. 2002; Sweet and Sumpter 2007). The production and management of these series of heterogeneous and compartmentalized reservoirs units may be slightly challenging. Oftentimes, the goal of the production team is usually to maximize production through fewer numbers of wells. However, managing this type of field requires adequate information, such that would be generated through integrated studies aimed at characterizing the field (Smalley and Muggeridge 2010). The main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> in oil production and increase in water output challenges confronting Eni field despite un-depleted reserves could result when trying to manage such a challenging field with limited/inadequate information. A clear case of increase in water production could result when trying to sweep oil into production wells using water injection technique across isolated and non-communicating reservoir units. Eni field and indeed such with similar isolated reservoir compartments has to be managed carefully and individually. The placement of the wells, production and injection wells alike, has to be carefully planned and guided by information resulting from multidimensional and multi-approach study of the field as can be derived by integrating well log, seismic volume, core data, well test and production history data for the purpose of characterizing the field.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA generic {{aircraft}} usually {{loses its}} {{static directional stability}} at moderate angle of attack (typically 20 – 30 °). In this research, wind tunnel studies were performed using an aircraft model with moderate swept wing and a conventional vertical tail. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate flow mechanisms responsible for static directional stability. Measurements of force, surface pressure and spatial flow field were carried out for angles of attack from 0 ° to 46 ° and sideslip angles from − 8 ° to 8 °. Results of the wind tunnel experiments show that the vertical tail is the main contributor to static directional stability, while the fuselage is the main contributor to static directional instability of the model. In the sideslip attitude for moderate angles of attack, the fuselage vortex and the wing vortex merged together and changed asymmetrically as angle of attack increased on the windward side and leeward side of the vertical tail. The separated asymmetrical vortex flow around the vertical tail is the main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> in the static directional stability. Compared with the wing vortices, the fuselage vortices are more concentrated and closer to the vertical tail, so the yawing moment of vertical tail is more unstable than that when the wings are absent. On the other hand, the attached asymmetrical flow over the fuselage in sideslip leads to the static directional instability of the fuselage being exacerbated. It is mainly due to the predominant model contour blockage effect on the windward side flow over the model in sideslip, which is strongly affected by angle of attack...|$|E
40|$|Sidestream darkfield imaging (SDF) {{is a form}} of in-vivo {{microscopy}} and can be used {{to observe}} the microcirculatory perfusion. In sepsis but also during haemodialysis (HD) there is a reduction in perfusion without signs in blood pressure and pulserate. One of the possibilities for this reduction is the ultrafiltration (UF). To date new methods of UF have been introduced. One of them is the BVM (blood volume monitoring). This way of UF is based on automatic feedback resulting in reduction of intra and post-haemodialysis hypotension. The {{purpose of this study is}} a comparison between the different methods of UF. During the study patients were treated with three different UF-methods: HD (+GUF), HD with linear UF and HD with BVM-controlled UF. At each hour of the treatment the perfusion of the microcirculation was observed by SDF-imaging. From these images microvascular flow index (MFI) and total vessel density (TVD) were derived. During HD without UF no significant reduction of MFI was observed. In the GUF period the reduction of the MFI was significant, 2. 5 [2. 2 - 2. 8] vs 2. 8 [2. 8 - 3. 9] (p= 0. 03). During linear UF significant reduction of the MFI was not observed. During BVM-controlled UF an downward trend of the MFI was observed in the 3 th hour, 2. 5 [1. 8 - 2. 7] versus 2. 8 [2. 5 - 3. 0] (p= 0. 05). However there where no significant differences between the two UF-modalities. The TVD, blood pressure and pulse did not change significantly during treatment. The fluid extraction during HD is perhaps the main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> in MFI during HD.

Here, {{we show that}} SATB 1 also has an oncogenic activity to transform certain non-malignant breast epithelial cell lines. We studied the non-malignant MCF 10 A cell line, which is used widely in the literature. We obtained aliquots from two different sources (here we {{refer to them as}} MCF 10 A- 1 and MCF 10 A- 2), but found them to be surprisingly dissimilar in their responses to oncogenic activity of SATB 1. Ectopic expression of SATB 1 in MCF 10 A- 1 induced tumor-like morphology in three-dimensional cultures, led to tumor formation in immunocompromised mice, and when injected into tail veins, led to lung metastasis. The number of metastases correlated positively with the level of SATB 1 expression. In contrast, SATB 1 expression in MCF 10 A- 2 did not lead to any of these outcomes. Yet DNA copy-number analysis revealed that MCF 10 A- 1 is indistinguishable genetically from MCF 10 A- 2. However, gene expression profiling analysis revealed that these cell lines have significantly divergent signatures for the expression of genes involved in oncogenesis, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. Above all, the early DNA damage-response kinase, ATM, was greatly reduced in MCF 10 A- 1 cells compared to MCF 10 A- 2 cells. We found the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> to be phenotypic drift due to long-term cultivation of MCF 10 A. ATM knockdown in MCF 10 A- 2 and two other non-malignant breast epithelial cell lines, 184 A 1 and 184 B 4, enabled SATB 1 to induce malignant phenotypes similar to that observed for MCF 10 A- 1.

Therefore, the amount of production of all crops except irrigated chickpea will be increased during oncoming 15 years. On the basis of results, the rate of irrigated wheat, dryland wheat, irrigated barley, dryland barley, dryland chickpea, potato, and alfalfa production will be 270, 1000, 20, 20, 30, 530, and 270 thousand tones, respectively, and the amount of irrigated chickpea production will be zero at 2021.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The General Household Survey (GHS) is a continuous national survey {{of people living in}} private households conducted on an annual basis, by the Social Survey Division of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The main aim of the survey is to collect data on a range of core topics, covering household, family and individual information. This information is used by government departments and other organisations for planning, policy and monitoring purposes, and to present a picture of households, family and people in Great Britain. From 2008, the General Household Survey became a module of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS). In recognition, the survey was renamed the General Lifestyle Survey (GLF/GLS). Secure Access GLF/GLS/GHS The Secure Access version includes additional, detailed variables not included in either the standard 'End User Licence' (EUL) versions (see under GN 33090) or the Special Licence (SL) access versions (see under GN 33403). Extra variables that typically {{can be found in the}} Secure Access version but not in the EUL or SL versions relate to: geography: postcodes (anonymised prior to 2009) employment details, including economic status, self-employment, number of employees employment and training schemes <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> in income looking for work benefits borrowing money and bill arrears nationality migration, including when arrived in UK and previous country of residence ethnicity religious identity Prospective users of the Secure Access version of the GLF/GLS/GHS will need to fulfil additional requirements, commencing with the completion of an extra application form to demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the extra, more detailed variables, in order to obtain permission to use that version. Secure Access users must also complete face-to-face training and agree to Secure Access' User Agreement and Breaches Penalties Policy (see 'Access' section below). Therefore, users are encouraged to download and inspect the EUL version of the data prior to ordering the Secure Access (or SL) version. Further details and links for all GLF/GLS/GHS studies available from the UK Data Archive can be found via the GLF/GLS/GHS major studies web page. Geographical references: postcodes The postcodes available in the Secure Access version of the data prior to 2009 are pseudo-anonymised postcodes. The real postcodes were not available due to the potential risk of identification of the observations. However, these replacement postcodes retain the inherent nested characteristics of real postcodes, and will allow researchers to aggregate observations to other geographic units, e. g. wards, super output areas, etc. In the dataset, the variable of the replacement postcode is 'new_PC'. Special Licence Access GLF/GLS/GHS data SL access versions of the GLF/GLS/GHS data are available from 1998 - 1999 onwards. The SL versions contain extra variables not found in the standard EUL versions, and therefore are subject to more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the EUL (but less stringent than Secure Access versions). The SL versions include all variables held in the standard EUL version, plus extra variables covering cigarette codes and descriptions, and some birthdate information for respondents and household members. History The GHS started in 1971 and has been carried out continuously since then, except for breaks in 1997 - 1998 when the survey was reviewed, and in 1999 - 2000 when the survey was redeveloped. Following the 1997 review, the survey was relaunched from April 2000 with a different design. The relevant development work and the changes made are fully described in the Living in Britain report for the 2000 - 2001 survey. Following its review, the GHS was changed to comprise two elements: the continuous survey and extra modules, or 'trailers'. The continuous survey remained unchanged from 2000 to 2004, apart from essential adjustments to take account of, for example, changes in benefits and pensions. The GHS retained its modular structure and this allowed a number of different trailers to be included for each of those years, to a plan agreed by sponsoring government departments. Further changes to the GHS methodology from 2005 From April 1994 to 2005, the GHS was conducted on a financial year basis, with fieldwork spread evenly from April of one year to March the following year. However, in 2005 the survey period reverted to a calendar year and the whole of the annual sample was surveyed in the nine months from April to December 2005. Future surveys will run from January to December each year, hence the title date change to single year from 2005 onwards. Since the 2005 GHS (EUL version held under SN 5640) does not cover the January-March quarter, this affects annual estimates for topics which are subject to seasonal variation. To rectify this, where the questions were the same in 2005 as in 2004 - 2005, the final quarter of the latter survey was added (weighted in the correct proportion) to the nine months of the 2005 survey. Furthermore, in 2005, the European Union (EU) made a legal obligation (EU-SILC) for member states to collect additional statistics on income and living conditions. In addition to this the EU-SILC data cover poverty and social exclusion. These statistics are used to help plan and monitor European social policy by comparing poverty indicators and changes over time across the EU. The EU-SILC requirement has been integrated into the GHS, leading to large-scale changes in the 2005 survey questionnaire. The trailers on 'Views of your Local Area' and 'Dental Health' were removed. Other changes were made to many of the standard questionnaire sections, details of which may be found in the GHS 2005 documentation. Further changes to the GLF/GLS/GHS methodology from 2008 As noted above, the General Household Survey (GHS) was renamed the General Lifestyle Survey (GLF/GLS) in 2008. The sample design of the GLF/GLS is the same as the GHS before, and the questionnaire remains largely the same. The main change is that the GLF/GLS now includes the IHS core questions, which are common to all of the separate modules that together comprise the IHS. Some of these core questions are simply questions that were previously asked in the same or a similar format on all of the IHS component surveys (including the GLF/GLS). The core questions cover employment, smoking prevalence, general health, ethnicity, citizenship and national identity. These questions are asked by proxy if an interview is not possible with the selected respondent (that is a member of the household can answer on behalf of other respondents in the household). This is a departure from the GHS which did not ask smoking prevalence and general health questions by proxy, whereas the GLF/GLS does from 2008. For details on other changes to the GLF/GLS questionnaire, please see the GLF/GLS 2008 documentation. Changes to the drinking section There have been a number of revisions to the methodology that is used to produce the alcohol consumption estimates. In 2006, the average number of units assigned to the different drink types and the assumption around the average size of a wine glass was updated, resulting in significantly increased consumption estimates. In addition to the revised method, a new question about wine glass size was included in the survey in 2008. Respondents were asked whether they have consumed small (125 ml), standard (175 ml) or large (250 ml) glasses of wine. The data from this question are used when calculating the number of units of alcohol consumed by the respondent. It is assumed that a small glass contains 1. 5 units, a standard glass contains 2 units and a large glass contains 3 units. (In 2006 and 2007 it was assumed that all respondents drank from a standard 175 ml glass containing 2 units.) The datasets contain the original set of variables based on the original methodology, as well as those based on the revised and (for 2008 onwards) updated methodologies. Further details on these changes are provided in the GHS 2006 and GLF/GLS 2008 documentation. Further information may be found on the ONS GLF/GLS webpages. Correction of erroneous variables in individual 2008 data file The 'source of income' variables (SrcInc 01 - 14 and SrcIncT 1 -T 5) in the individual file for 2008 have been revised in October 2011 to correct erroneous values in the previous version. Change in household serial number variable The household serial number variable 'Hserial' has been replaced by the variable 'HholdId' in the 2008 individual and household files. The second edition (September 2013) includes data for 2009 - 2010. Main Topics : The main GLF/GLS/GHS consists of a household questionnaire, completed by the Household Reference Person, and an individual questionnaire, completed by all adults aged 16 and over resident in the household. A number of different trailers each year covering extra topics were included in later (post-review) surveys in the series from 2000. The household questionnaire covers the following topics: household information, accommodation type, housing tenure/costs, and consumer durables including vehicle ownership. The individual questionnaire includes data from the household dataset, and additional sections on migration/citizenship/national identity/ethnicity, employment, pensions, education, health, child care, smoking, drinking, family information, financial situation, and income. The 2000 - 2001 survey included questions asking about periods of cohabitation not leading to marriage, which were first asked in 1998. The trailers for that year covered social capital and informal carers. The 2001 - 2002 survey included scetions on elderly people (aged 65 years and over), mobility aids, and usual alcohol consumption in the last 12 months. The 2002 - 2003 survey included a section on sport and leisure. In 2005, a section on social mobility was added to the individual questionnaire. In 2006, a section on social and cultural participation was added to the individual questionnaire. In 2007, a section on household inadequacies and basic services was added to the household questionnaire. The 2008 survey included a trailer module on household debt and indebtedness, as well as an additional section on length of residency. <br/...|$|E

The Air Force was essentially operating a national-level special operations program for an agency outside the Department of Defense—the CIA—with dollars needed for higher priority strategic forces. With the rapid buildup of the Strategic Air Command to counter Soviet Cold War aggression and the resulting funding requirements, the lesser priority PSYWAR mission was curtailed.|$|R
30|$|The {{diffusion}} and permeation of chlorides decrease with time. The main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> of chloride ingress can {{be summarized}} reduction of porosity which can block the chloride ion intrusion (Kwon et al. 2009; Thomas and Bamforth 1999), reduction of diffusion which makes the ion transport slow into the concrete (Yoon et al. 2017; Park et al. 2009), enhanced hydration which can make more absorption of chloride ions (Ishida et al. 2009; Leng et al. 2000), and decreasing gap of chloride ion concentration between {{the inner and outer}} boundary conditions which reduces the concentration gradient (Welty et al. 1989). The time-dependent diffusion has been studied for a long time with considering changing properties of concrete but they are focused only on crack-free concrete (Thomas and Bamforth 1999; Lingjie et al. 2017). Crack width also changes with time due to the steady reaction of cement hydration and auto-healing enhanced by relative humidity (Japan Society of Civil Engineering 2002).|$|R

The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> in ionic conductivity of LiPON thin films from 2. 8 x 10 (- 6) Scm(- 1) to 9. 9 x 10 (- 10) Scm(- 1) when exposed to air are analyzed {{with the aid of}} AC impedance measurements, SEM, XPS and stylus profilometry. Initially, particulate-free film surfaces obtained soon after rf sputter deposition in N- 2 ambient conditions becomes covered with microstructures, forming pores in the film when exposed to air. LiPON films are deposited on Ti coated silicon in addition to bare silicon, ruling out the possibility of stress-related rupturing from the LiPON/Si interface. The reduction of nitrogen, phosphorus, and increased presence of lithium, oxygen and carbon over the film surface lowers the ionic conductivity of LiPON films when exposed to air.
