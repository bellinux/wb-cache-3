5|$|The Semantic Web {{uses the}} HTTP URI scheme to {{identify}} both documents and concepts {{in the real}} world, a distinction which has caused confusion {{as to how to}} distinguish the two. The TAG published an e-mail in 2005 on how to solve the problem, which became known as the httpRange-14 resolution. The W3C subsequently published an Interest Group Note titled Cool URIs for the Semantic Web, which explained the use of content negotiation and the HTTP 303 <b>response</b> <b>code</b> for redirections in more detail.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{authentication}} method using sclera {{embedded in}} Quick <b>Response</b> <b>codes</b> is proposed. Quick <b>response</b> <b>codes</b> are two dimensional barcodes which can hold more data {{and can be}} fastly readable by Personal computers and Handheld devices like mobile phones, smart phones and tablet PCs. Biometrics though noted for their accuracy suffer from the innate disadvantage of time consumption during enrolment and verification process. Together Biometrics and QR codes will provide a fast authentication system. This approach will be suitable for mobile ticketing applications. Cancelable sclera templates have been embedded in Quick <b>Response</b> <b>codes</b> and used for two factor authentication. The proposed Cancelable sclera template embedded in Quick <b>response</b> <b>codes</b> approach was evaluated using publicly available UBIRIS and IUPUI multi wavelength database. The experimental results show that this technique is efficient and provides accurate identity verification than other biometric traits...|$|R

40|$|Reaction {{time task}} rule {{congruency}} effects (RT-TRCEs) reflect faster responses to stimuli {{for which the}} competing task rules indicate the same correct response than to stimuli indicating conflicting responses. The authors tested the hypothesis that RT-TRCE reflects activated overlearned <b>response</b> category <b>codes</b> in long-term memory (such as up or left). The results support the hypothesis by showing that (a) RT-TRCE was absent for tasks for which there were no <b>response</b> <b>codes</b> ready beforehand, (b) RT-TRCE was present after these tasks were practiced, and (c) these practice effects were found only if the tasks permitted forming abstract <b>response</b> category <b>codes.</b> The increase in the RT-TRCE with response slowness, found only for familiar tasks, suggests that the abstract <b>response</b> category <b>codes</b> may be verbal or linguistic in these cases. The results are discussed in relation to task-switching theories and prefrontal functions...|$|R
40|$|The joint Simon effect (JSE) {{shows that}} the {{presence}} of another agent can change one’s representation of one’s task and/or action. According to the spatial <b>response</b> <b>coding</b> approach, this is because another person in one’s peri-personal space automatically induces the spatial coding of one’s own action, which in turn invites spatial stimulus-response priming. According to the referential coding approach, the presence of another person or event creates response conflict, which the actor is assumed to solve by emphasizing response features that discriminate between one’s own response and that of the other. The 2 approaches often make the same predictions, but the spatial <b>response</b> <b>coding</b> approach considers spatial location as the only dimension that can drive <b>response</b> <b>coding,</b> whereas the referential coding approach allows for other dimensions as well. To compare these approaches, the authors ran 2 experiments to see whether a nonspatial JSE can be demonstrated. Participants responded to the geometrical shape of a central colored stimulus by pressing a left or right button, while wearing gloves of the same or different color as the stimuli. Participants performed the task individually, either by responding to either stimulus shapes (Experiment 1) or by responding to only 1 of the 2 shapes (Experiment 2), and {{in the presence of a}} coactor. Congruence between stimulus and glove color affected performance in the 2 -choice and the joint tasks but not in the individual go/no-go task. This demonstration of a nonspatial JSE is inconsistent with the spatial <b>response</b> <b>coding</b> approach but supports the referential coding approach...|$|R
40|$|OFDM is a {{successful}} technique in wireless communication system. Frequency offset in OFDM systems leads to loss of orthogonality among subcarriers, which resulted in intercarrier interference (10) to occur. Another main problem of OFDM is the occurrence of high PAPR. To mitigate ICI problem, ICI self-cancellation scheme and frequency domain partial <b>response</b> <b>coding</b> has been proposed. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of ICI self-cancellation schemes and the integer-coefficients partial <b>response</b> <b>coding</b> (PRC). ICI self-cancellation data allocation of (XkXk+ 1 =-X k) has the best PAPR performance while the data allocation of (X kXk+ 1 =-Xk) has the most CIR enhancement The integer coefficients PRC outperform the ICI self-cancellation schemes in terms of bandwidth efficiency and in the BER performance especially at high E/N o...|$|R

50|$|In {{the basic}} SIP specification, only {{requests}} and final responses (i.e. 2XX response codes) are transmitted reliably, this is, they are retransmitted by the sender until the acknowledge message arrives (i.e. the corresponding <b>response</b> <b>code</b> to a request, or the ACK request corresponding to a 2XX <b>response</b> <b>code).</b> This mechanism is necessary since SIP can run not only over reliable transport protocols (TCP) that {{assure that the}} message is delivered, but also over unreliable ones (UDP) that offer no delivery guarantees, and it is even possible that both kinds of protocols are present {{in different parts of}} the transport network.|$|E

30|$|In week 2, a few LAs {{came into}} the {{pedagogy}} class with some constructivist or student ideas language already; about 4 % of LA responses demonstrated some ideas about constructing knowledge, while 6 % of LA responses indicated that students have pre-existing ideas. We did not see any indications of LAs using or understanding formative assessment in week 2 responses. For all three concepts, we saw positive growth on average throughout the semester. Our data indicates that the LAs showed the most growth around student ideas, with an 11 % {{increase in the number}} of <b>responses</b> <b>coded</b> as student ideas between weeks 2 and 15.

2500|$|Identifying the {{location}} of the subject's response is another element scored in the Rorschach system. Location refers to how much of the inkblot was used to answer the question. Administrators score the response [...] "W" [...] if the whole inkblot was used to answer the question, [...] "D" [...] if a commonly described part of the blot was used, [...] "Dd" [...] if an uncommonly described or unusual detail was used, or [...] "S" [...] if the white space in the background was used. A score of W is typically associated with the subject's motivation to interact with his or her surrounding environment. D is interpreted as one having efficient or adequate functioning. A high frequency of <b>responses</b> <b>coded</b> Dd indicate some maladjustment within the individual. <b>Responses</b> <b>coded</b> S indicate an oppositional or uncooperative test subject.|$|R

40|$|Time {{and space}} are deeply related in the {{physical}} word. Growing experimental evidence suggests that temporal events are represented on a mental time line (MTL), spatially oriented from left to right. According to task characteristics, the spatial representation of time {{can be linked to}} different types of dimensions including manual <b>response</b> <b>codes</b> (i. e the Spatial-Temporal Association of <b>Response</b> <b>Codes</b> - STEARC) and physical space codes (i. e. the position of a stimulus {{in the physical}} space). It is unclear whether this spatial-temporal association is mainly related to a perceptual, to a motor or to an interaction of these two components. The aim of the present a study was to analyze whether manual response and physical space codes are independent from each other or they interacted when both types of information are involved in a temporal estimation task. Through four experiments, participants were requested to perform the task with two lateralized response buttons, in order to detect the STEARC effect. In addition, in order to consider the perceptual component, reference and target stimuli were presented in different spaces through the experiments. In the first experiment, the target stimuli were presented on the left, center or right side of the space, while the reference stimuli were always presented centrally. The reverse situation was presented in the second experiment. In the third experiment, both stimuli were presented in opposite spatial positions (e. g., left-right), while in the last experiment, both stimuli were presented in the same spatial position (e. g., left-left). In Experiments 1 - 1, the performance was better when both manual response and physical space codes were congruent with the durations to be judged than when only manual <b>response</b> <b>codes</b> were congruent (and physical space codes were either incongruent or absent) with the durations. In Experiment 4, this interactive effect between both codes disappeared. The results indicate that the physical spatial codes interact with the manual <b>response</b> <b>codes</b> when the task characteristics involved spatial information of both perceptual and motor components, suggesting that they are not completely independent from each other...|$|R

40|$|Numbers are {{represented}} spatially. Evidence for {{this comes from}} the SNARC effect (Spatial-Numerical Association of <b>Response</b> <b>Codes).</b> Small numerals are accessed faster {{on the left and}} large ones on the right. The effect assumes a mental number line. However, in A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM), both numerical (discrete) and non-numerical (continuous) quantities share a common processing mechanism. Thus, the SNARC effect may be an instance of a general SQUARC effect (Spatial-Quantity Association of <b>Response</b> <b>Codes).</b> We devised two experiments to test this hypothesis. First, 85 Japanese students bisected a quantity of water. They showed bisection bias by overestimating the right cup and underestimating the left one. In the second experiment, small continuous magnitudes shifted covert visual attention leftward, with larger ones shifting it rightward. Our data suggest that SNARC may be part of SQUARC, and the mental number line may be in fact a mental quantity line. </p...|$|R
