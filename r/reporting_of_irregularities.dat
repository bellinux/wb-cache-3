50|$|There {{were a few}} <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Some polling {{stations}} ran out of ballot boxes, causing long delays in voting. To fit more ballots into the ballot boxes, some election workers forcefully stuffed ballots into the box using objects such as barbecue forks and metal rulers. Some stations also used random cardboard boxes without official seals. Some ballot boxes were opened before the close of polling.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the fall}} of 1987, Rep. Pat Schroeder briefly entered the race, which brought the number of {{candidates}} to eight and led to them being lampooned as [...] "Snow White and the seven dwarfs". [...] In December 1987, Hart surprised many political pundits by resuming his presidential campaign. He again led in the polls for the Democratic nomination, both nationally and in Iowa, However, the allegations <b>of</b> adultery and <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in his campaign financing, had delivered a fatal blow to his candidacy, and he did poorly in the primaries before dropping out again.|$|R
2500|$|The CPP claimed {{victory in}} the election. The E.U. and U.S. {{expressed}} concern for the concern about possible irregularities, with the latter's State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki saying that [...] "we call for a transparent and full investigation <b>of</b> all credible <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities.</b> We urge all parties and their supporters to continue to act in an orderly and peaceful manner in the post-election period."

Fox News' Doug Schoen told Michael Barone at U.S. News and World Report, [...] "Our internal sourcing tells us that there was fraud in the Venezuelan central commission. There are widespread <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> and evidence <b>of</b> fraud, many of them ably recorded by Mary Anastasia O'Grady in The Wall Street Journal last week. Carter is untroubled by any of this, and declares that Chavez won 'fair and square.'"

5000|$|Following news <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> {{concerning}} his conduct in office, May was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1946 to the Eightieth Congress. The bribery scandal was intensified by testimony of excessive profit-taking in the Garsson munition business, {{and that the}} Garsson factory produced 4.2-inch mortar shells with defective fuzes, resulting in premature detonation and the deaths of 38 American soldiers. [...] After {{less than two hours}} of deliberation, May was convicted by a federal jury on July 3, 1947, on charges of accepting bribes to use his position as Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee to secure munitions contracts during the Second World War. Murray and Henry Garsson also received prison terms. [...] After protracted efforts to avoid incarceration, May subsequently served nine months in federal prison.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2004-05, Manitoba's labour-managed Crocus Investment Fund stopped {{trading and}} was forced into {{receivership}} after reports that it had misled shareholders and overstated the values of its assets. Doer's government was accused of improper oversight of the fund due to its ties to labour interests, and the resulting scandal initially threatened to damage the NDP's credibility. [...] Instead, it grew to encompass the Progressive Conservatives as well. Murray acknowledged that the Progressive Conservatives had received <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> at Crocus as early as 2002, but refrained from criticism after assurances from party advisers that the fund was in proper order. [...] These admissions may have prevented Murray from exploiting the scandal to his party's advantage; the NDP's popularity increased over the PCs increased {{in the summer of}} 2005.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{group of}} intellectuals who {{identified}} themselves as [...] "members of the artistic and cultural community" [...] issued a different letter on the same day. They said the numerous <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> [...] "fan, to different degrees, the suspicion that the voting could have suffered decisive alterations." [...] Citing the polarizing campaign, the number <b>of</b> alleged <b>irregularities,</b> and {{the closeness of the}} race, they called on the authorities to order a full recount to [...] "erase any possible doubt" [...] about the outcome of the election. They called on the electoral authorities to act in accordance with both the law and the [...] "exceptional circumstances" [...] the country was going through, while rejecting what they called [...] "arguments based on legal technicalities" [...] (referring {{to the fact that the}} legislation does not contemplate a full recount). Among the signers of the second missive were Carlos Monsiváis, Juan Villoro, Sergio Pitol, Elena Poniatowska, and Luis Mandoki.|$|R
25|$|In November 2004, in a rematch, Hill lost to Sodrel by a razor-thin {{margin of}} about 1,500 votes (about {{a half of}} a {{percentage}} point).

Hill gained only about two dozen votes in the recount, however, and conceded the election in early December 2004.|$|R
2500|$|The {{referendum}} {{took place}} on 1 October 2017, despite being suspended by the Constitutional Court, and despite the action of Spanish police to prevent voting in some centres. According to the Catalan authorities, 90% of voters supported independence, but turnout was only 43%, and there were <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities.</b> On 10 October 2017, {{in the aftermath of}} the referendum, the President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, declared the independence of Catalonia but left it suspended. Puigdemont said during his appearance in the Catalan parliament that he assumes, in presenting the results of the referendum, [...] "the people's mandate for Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic", but proposed that in the following weeks the parliament [...] "suspends the effect of the declaration of independence to engage in a dialogue to reach an agreed solution" [...] with the Spanish Government.|$|R
5000|$|UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, United Nations {{independent}} experts {{and the world}} body’s human rights office voiced their dismay over the execution of Nafeek. Rupert Colville, {{a spokesperson for the}} Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in Geneva, [...] "We are deeply troubled by <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in her detention and trial, including that no lawyer was present to assist her in key stages of her interrogation and trial, that language interpretation was poor, and Ms. Nafeek’s contention that she was physically assaulted and forced to sign a confession under duress". The Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan Méndez, noted that during the appeal of the case, the defence submitted that Nafeek was beaten and made to sign a confession under duress. [...] "Her execution is clearly contrary to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture," [...] he said.|$|R
50|$|According to {{observers}} {{from the}} Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), there were <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> numerous <b>irregularities,</b> observers being obstructed, and ballot stuffing; it {{also said that}} popular awareness of {{what was at stake}} in the referendum was low and called into question the claimed high turnout rate. The United States embassy also had concerns and said that the vote fell short of international standards.|$|R
50|$|Although {{popular in}} Germany, Bolonka are not {{recognized}} as a separate breed by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The white version, the Bolonka Franzuska, was recognised by the VDH (German national kennel club) as {{a variation of the}} Bolognese. The fact that Russian Bolonka are not recognized stems from the lack of a national kennel club in Russia, after the fall of communism. Without an active national club, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale will not recognize the Russian dogs; in addition, there have been <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in record keeping since in present-day Russia. In January 2013, the Nordic Kennel Union officially accepted the Russkaya Twvetnaya Bolonka and not the Bolonka Zwetna, and since then it has been allowed to participate in dog shows in the NKU member countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. The American Kennel Club added the Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka to the Foundation Stock Service Program in 2015 and assigned the breed to the Toy Group. Bolonkas are considered the rarest of the Bichon family.|$|R
50|$|As tax assessor, Looper {{used his}} office's {{equipment}} to send numerous press releases to Tennessee news media, making positive claims about himself and alleging various shortcomings {{on the part}} of other local officials. At the same time he seldom showed up for work and there were many <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in property tax assessments. In March 1998, following an investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Looper was indicted on 14 counts of official misconduct, theft of services and official oppression for theft, misuse of county property and misuse of county employees. He claimed the charges were politically motivated due to Democratic control of Putnam County politics and the Tennessee General Assembly. The Cookeville Herald-Citizen newspaper regularly reported the Republican Tax Assessor's bizarre antics and public verbal assaults of Putnam County elected officials. The Tennessee Republican Party soon claimed no connection with Looper, though campaign contributions and lists of paid political consultants proved otherwise.|$|R
50|$|With only twelve votes {{separating}} Thibodaux from {{a spot in}} the runoff, many urged Thibodaux {{to challenge}} the election results amid widespread <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> and election fraud across the state. In Louisiana's election for U.S. Senate that year, Republican Woody Jenkins contested the results of his narrow loss to Democrat Mary Landrieu claiming election fraud, including ballot tampering, voter fraud, and illegal busing in precincts statewide, including those in the 7th District. Jenkins brought his challenge to the U.S. Senate, arguing for a new election in front of the Senate Rules Committee. After a 10-month investigation revealed that fraud had occurred, the committee voted 8-7 along party lines to uphold the election results. Thibodaux chose not to pursue his own challenge {{of the results of the}} House race. Chris John went on to defeat Hunter Lundy in the general election and held the seat until he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, when he was defeated by the Republican David Vitter.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> {{financial}} <b>irregularities</b> at Nortel's Health and Welfare Trust. Diane Urquhart, a financial analyst, testified before a parliamentary committee that $100 million {{is missing from}} the HWT and that a $37 million loan to the corporation has not been paid back. The HWT was an unregistered trust maintained by Nortel to provide medical, dental, life insurance, long-term disability and survivor income and pension transition benefits.|$|R
50|$|A {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 19 March 2011. On 28 November 2011, Egypt held its first parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power.

On 2 August 2012, Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the Muslim Brotherhood.|$|R
5000|$|Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon {{said that}} his country was [...] "deeply concerned" [...] by <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> {{election}} <b>irregularities.</b> On 15 June, Cannon told Parliament: [...] "We {{have called for a}} full and transparent investigation into electoral fraud and discrepancies. The security force's brutal treatment of peaceful demonstrators is unacceptable." [...] Canada also summoned Iran's top diplomat to explain the reported beating and detention of a freelance Canadian journalist in Tehran.|$|R
2500|$|The {{day after}} the July 2, 2006 elections, the left-leaning {{newspaper}} La Jornada published <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> supposed electoral <b>irregularities</b> and López Obrador's claims that the ruling party had won the election through a supposed [...] "fraud" [...] escalated.|$|R
2500|$|Santorum stated on January 6 {{that the}} <b>report</b> <b>of</b> the <b>irregularities</b> [...] "doesn't really matter to me," [...] citing the {{virtually}} tied results.

While there are no recount provisions for caucus results in Iowa Republican party rules, there was a certification process, which was described as [...] "nearly the same thing." ...|$|R
500|$|According to the White House, the {{incoming}} Clinton administration had heard <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in the Travel Office and possible kickbacks {{to an office}} employee from a charter air company. [...] They looked at a review by KPMG Peat Marwick which discovered that Dale kept an off-book ledger, had $18,000 of unaccounted-for checks, and kept chaotic office records. [...] White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty and the White House counsels thus decided to fire the Travel Office staff and reorganize it. [...] The actual terminations were done on May 19, 1993, by White House director of administration David Watkins. [...] There was also a feeling among the White House and its supporters that the Travel Office had never been investigated by the media due to its close relationship with press corps members and the plush accommodations it afforded them and favors it did for them. (Congress would later discover that in October 1988, a whistleblower within the Travel Office had alleged financial improprieties; the Reagan White House counsel looked into the claim but took no action.) ...|$|R
50|$|After the NEC {{had been}} briefed {{by the party}} {{solicitor}} on 4 July, on 5 July Ed Miliband announced that the party was to refer the NEC internal <b>report</b> into allegations <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> {{in the selection of}} a PPC in Falkirk to Police Scotland, after confirming that the NEC internal inquiry had shown irregularities in the Falkirk Labour Party's candidate selection process.|$|R
50|$|As an {{outsider}} in Afghanistan's power structure, Jalal stressed her {{independence from the}} warlords and past oppressive regimes. Although many of the candidates for the Afghan presidency withdrew from the race {{and called for a}} boycott of the election following <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> voting <b>irregularities</b> at some polling places, Jalal {{was one of the few}} candidates who did not join the protest. An exit poll taken during the October 2004 election showed Jalal taking about seven percent of the vote among Afghan women.|$|R
500|$|Attention {{initially}} {{focused on}} the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), since on May 12, 1993, a week before the firings, associate White House counsel William Kennedy had requested that the FBI look into possible improprieties in the Travel Office operation. FBI agents went there and, although initially reluctant, authorized a preliminary investigation. [...] Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster became worried about the firings about to take place and ordered the KPMG Peat Marwick review, asking the FBI to hold off in the meantime. [...] The accounting review started on May 14 and the report was given to the White House on May 17. KPMG was unable to do an actual audit, because there were so few records in the Travel Office that could be audited and because the office did not use the double-entry bookkeeping system that audits are based upon. One KPMG representative later described the office as [...] "an ungodly mess in terms of records" [...] with ten years of material piled up in a closet. [...] When the review came back with its <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>irregularities,</b> Watkins went ahead with the terminations on May 19.|$|R
5|$|Until the {{legalisation}} {{of opposition}} parties in 1992, Déby's MPS {{was the sole}} legal party in Chad. Since then, 78 registered political parties have become active. In 2005, opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the constitutional referendum that allowed Déby to stand for re-election for a third term amid <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> widespread <b>irregularities</b> in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign. Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality, as the opposition deemed the polls a farce and boycotted them.|$|R
