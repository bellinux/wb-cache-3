40|$|The NF-kappa B subunits, p 50 and p 65, have {{extensive}} sequence homology with the c-rel proto-oncogene and the Drosophila morphogen dorsal. It {{has recently been}} shown that in vitro translated c-Rel can bind to DNA and form a complex with p 50. However, the conditions for DNA binding of c-Rel in vivo and its DNA sequence specificity have not been established. Here we report the identification a novel heterodimeric complex that binds to a kappa B-like, phorbol ester (TPA) <b>responsive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence,</b> 5 '-GGGAAAGTAC- 3 ', in the 5 ' flanking region of the human urokinase (uPA) gene. This sequence was shown to bind two protein complexes, LC and UC. LC was indistinguishable from NF-kappa B as it reacted with antibodies recognizing the p 50 subunit of NF-kappa B, and was shown by UV crosslinking to contain the p 50 and p 65 subunits of NF-kappa B. UC, on the other hand, strongly reacted with anti-v-Rel, {{but not with the}} anti-p 50 antibodies, and was shown by crosslinking to contain 75 kDa and 85 kDa protein-DNA adducts. The 75 kDa and the 85 kDa adducts could be immunoprecipitated only by anti-p 65 and anti-c-Rel antibodies, respectively, showing that c-Rel formed a heterodimer with p 65. Both protein complexes were present in inactive forms in HeLa cell cytosol, and their nuclear translocation was induced by TPA. DNA binding of UC and LC could, furthermore, be inhibited by I kappa B-alpha. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of specific inhibitors that can block nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation is an approach {{for the treatment}} of cancer, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases. Several diterpenoids, oridonin, ponicidin, xindongnin A, and xindongnin B were isolated from the herb Isodon rubescens. These compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of NF-κB transcription activity and the expression of its downstream targets, cyclooxygenase- 2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase. The mechanisms of action of the diterpenoids against NF-κB are similar, but significant differences were also identified. All of the diterpenoids directly interfere with the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB to its response <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence.</b> Oridonin and ponicidin have an additional impact on the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to nuclei without affecting IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation. The effect of these compounds on the interaction of NF-κB with consensus <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> is unique. Different inhibitory effects were observed when NF-κB bound to various <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences.</b> Both p 65 /p 65 and p 50 /p 50 homodimers, as well as p 65 /p 50 heterodimer association with their <b>responsive</b> <b>DNA,</b> were inhibited. Kinetic studies on NF-κB-DNA interaction indicate that the diterpenoids decrease the Bmax app but have no effect on Kd app. This suggests that this class of compounds interacts with both p 65 and p 50 subunits at a site other than the DNA binding site and subsequently modulates the binding affinity of the transcription factor toward DNA with different NF-κB binding sequences. The diterpenoid structure could therefore serve as a scaffold for the {{development of}} more potent and selective NF-κB inhibitors that target regulated gene transcription.

Recent <b>DNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> technologies however observe an encoded form of the sequence, rather than each DNA base individually. The encoded <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> may contain technical errors, and therefore encoded sequencing errors must be incorporated when comparing an encoded <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> to a reference <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence.</b> Results Although two-base encoding is currently used in practice, many other encoding schemes are possible, whereby two ore more bases are encoded at a time. A generalized k -base encoding scheme is presented, whereby feasible higher order encodings {{are better able to}} differentiate errors in the encoded <b>sequence</b> from true <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> variants. A generalized version of the previous two-base encoding <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> comparison algorithm is used to compare a k -base encoded <b>sequence</b> to a <b>DNA</b> reference <b>sequence.</b> Finally, simulations are performed to evaluate the power, the false positive and false negative SNP discovery rates, and the performance time of k -base encoding compared to previous methods {{as well as to the}} standard <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> comparison algorithm.
