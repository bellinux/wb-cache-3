5|$|The {{official}} <b>re-opening</b> {{took place}} on Wednesday, 8 September 2010, just ten {{and a half months}} after the original campaign was launched, with the building work being completed on schedule. The ceremonial <b>re-opening</b> was performed on-stage by actors Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, who were starring in the Theatre Royal's own production of The Rivals, Richard Brinsley Sheridan's classic Restoration comedy, set in and around 18th-century Bath. In 2011, the theatre won a British Construction Industry Award Conservation Award.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Baird remained a backbench MP for several weeks. On February 19, 2015, he represented {{the government at}} the <b>re-opening</b> of Canada House, {{the home of the}} Canadian High Commission to the United Kingdom. Baird's resignation from parliament took effect on March 16, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Several local {{politicians}} have proposed <b>re-opening</b> {{the line and}} either making it part of the Jæren Commuter Rail {{or part of the}} planned light rail in Greater Stavanger. Additionally, the Norwegian National Rail Administration has supported a future <b>re-opening</b> of the line. Estimates show that the line has a traffic potential for 600,000 passengers per year. In a proposal from the National Rail Administration, the Ålgård Line is seen as a possible branch of the commuter rail, with stations at Vagle, Figgjo, Kongeparken and Ålgård. Without making any investments to the Sørlandet Line, {{it would be possible to}} extend the two hourly services that terminate at Sandnes to Ålgård. Ålgård is also a good location for a park and ride for European Route E39. However, the Ålgård Line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. This would give a travel time from Ganddal to Ålgård of 10 to 12 minutes. The estimated cost of <b>re-opening</b> the line is NOK500 million. The Center Party has proposed converting the line to a bus lane. The borough council of Figgjo has voted to convert the line to a bicycle path, but this has been rejected by the National Rail Administration.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} plans {{to extend the}} railway in four {{different}} directions which include <b>re-openings</b> to both Leek and Stoke-on-Trent, plus potentially to Alton Towers.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{currently}} mothballed, {{save for}} certain brief <b>re-openings</b> for holiday traffic, several plans {{are in the}} works by preservation minded organizations to reopen the Arcade and its adjacent upper levels. The building was in use until 1991 and remains empty today.|$|R
5|$|The devastated Point Pleasant Park {{remained}} {{closed for}} cleanup {{after the storm}} before <b>re-opening</b> in June 2004, nine months after the storm hit, with a damaged shoreline and almost 85% of its trees removed. A revitalization and reforestation program began in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{struggled}} financially after <b>re-opening,</b> requiring {{financial aid}} from the District government. In 2011, the theatre was threatened with closure after the city cut funding. The D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities then took over management, and began searching for a new operator.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{a scheme}} was {{proposed}} by the design firm Gensler to convert disused London Underground tunnels into subterranean rail trails, enabling the disused branches of the Piccadilly line and Jubilee line {{to be used as}} cycle paths.

5|$|Peter Law, {{the former}} Assembly Member (AM) for Blaenau Gwent, had {{been calling for}} {{passenger}} services between Ebbw Vale and Newport to resume on the line since the 1980s, {{while he was still}} a councillor. An initial feasibility study of the proposal was carried out for Blaenau Gwent council by infrastructure project management company Capita Symonds in 1998. Stations at Ebbw Vale, Cwm, Aberbeeg, Abercarn, Risca and Maesglas were suggested, and the plans included running some trains to Cardiff Central via a new station at Celtic Lakes on the South Wales Main Line. Law made fighting for the line's <b>re-opening</b> one of his major election promises during the National Assembly for Wales election campaign in 1999. A plaque at Ebbw Vale Parkway commemorates Law, who died in 2006, and his work to re-open the line. It was unveiled by Jocelyn Davies AM on 10 December 2007, four days before the Ebbw Valley Railway's planned official <b>re-opening.</b>|$|E

In 1990 the organ was dismantled and shipped to England for a major restoration by Mander Organs. Thomas Trotter gave the <b>re-opening</b> recital on the restored organ in 1992.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} years of the twenty-first century, a number of <b>re-openings</b> to {{passenger}} traffic took place in the Strathclyde area. Larkhall was selected as having the potential for such a scheme, and on 12 December 2005 the line was reopened to Larkhall from Haughhead Junction, enabling a through passenger service from Larkhall to Glasgow via Hamilton. Intermediate stations are at Merryton and Chatelherault, and the line is electrified.|$|R
50|$|After closure the Sheffield to Huddersfield service {{continued}} {{to pass through}} Victoria by reversing at Woodburn Junction. This service was diverted via Barnsley in 1983 by an initiative of the SYPTE who agreed to subsidise the diversion (see Penistone line). The operation was a success and the diverted service was kept, resulting in subsequent station <b>re-openings</b> at Silkstone and Dodworth, which had both closed in 1959. Victoria station was demolished in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{exhibitions}} {{were not}} popular {{enough to keep}} the business afloat, and after several closures and <b>re-openings</b> it was decided to try and make it a dedicated music venue. It was first used as a concert hall in 1893, and meant that Bournemouth was the first municipal town to regularly provide music. Visiting conductors included Edward Elgar, Hubert Parry, Jean Sibelius and Gustav Holst. The building was home to the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra between 1895 and 1929, after which time concerts were transferred to Bournemouth Pavilion.|$|R
5|$|To {{coincide}} with their <b>re-opening</b> in 2012, the theatre launched an award called the Patron’s Prize, which was later renamed the Peter O’Toole prize following the actors death. The award is a six-month contract at the Bristol Old Vic offered to two graduating actors from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. The inaugural winners were Emily May Smith and Isaac Stanmore.|$|E
5|$|Ajax, {{named after}} the mythological hero, Ajax, was the fifth ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy. Ordered under the 1910–1911 Naval Estimates, the ship was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering at their {{shipyard}} in Greenock on 27 February 1911 and launched on 21 March 1912. She was completed a year later at a cost of £1,889,387, but was not commissioned until 31 October 1913, joining her sister ships in the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS). All four sisters represented the Royal Navy during the celebrations of the <b>re-opening</b> of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, held in conjunction with Kiel Week, in Kiel, Germany, in June 1914.|$|E
5|$|During the Olympics, {{transport}} {{was in part}} {{provided by}} Vikingskipet Station on the Røros Line, which passes {{right next to the}} venue. The station is a cul-de-sac station which is electrified and allowed trains during the Olympics and the Track Cycling World Championships to reach the venue within a short walk from the train. The station was officially opened on 16 August 1993. The station has not been used since the Olympics. In 2006, the Norwegian National Rail Administration proposed <b>re-opening</b> the station in conjunction with larger events.|$|E
5000|$|Particularly in the Banat region, {{there were}} no {{alternative}} bus routes. Many villages and even substantial towns, therefore, had no practical public transport option. Services restarted on certain routes on the 1st April 2015, the company apparently having obtained the safety certificates following a fast track procedure ( [...] "in regim de urgenta"). Further <b>re-openings</b> were effected in mid/late April 2015 (for example Ineu - Cermei), several routes, however, remain closed, following changes in the subsidy allocations and calculation' regulations, that occurred in March 2015.|$|R
40|$|Sodium ions {{have been}} {{reported}} to alter the permeation properties of L- and N-type Ca 2 + channels. Here in frog atrial cardiomyocytes under whole-cell patch-clamp conditions, we have examined the effects of lowering the external Na+ concentration on the amplitude of T-type Ca 2 + current, I-CaT, and on the relief of its steady-state inactivation by large depolarizing prepulses, I-CaT facilitation. A partial reduction in Na+ ion concentration did not significantly alter I-CaT amplitude elicited at - 50 mV. However, after a large depolarization, low-Na+ solutions enhanced the relief of inactivation and induced I-CaT facilitation. This facilitation occurred independently of the divalent charge carrier, high intracellular Ca 2 + buffering or the intracellular Na+ content. Its effects were additional to the beta -adrenergic effects mediated by a decrease of G(i/o) -protein inhibitory tone. In Ca 2 +-free solution the very large T-type current, then carried by Na+ ions, showed only a weak relief of inactivation. In conclusion, I-CaT facilitation - which, as previously reported, is modulated by the transient voltage-dependent relief of G(i) -protein inhibitory tone - is further enhanced in a low-Na+ solution. In Ca 2 +-free solution, relief of inactivation due to <b>re-openings</b> dependent on the divalent charge carrier is improbable. It thus appears that for a short while after a large depolarization, external Na+ compete with Ca 2 + ions on permeation-controlling sites, so as to modulate channel <b>re-openings</b> and thus the amplitude of voltage-facilitated I-CaT independently of the control exerted by the inhibitory G-protein. status: publishe...|$|R

Leading the penetration of 1st Baltic Front into German lines, 51st Army reached the Bay of Riga on 31 July 1944, cutting off German Army Group North to the northeast of Riga. Under tremendous pressure, the Germans organized an armored counter-attack (Doppelkopf) from 16 to 27 August 1944 that succeeded in <b>re-opening</b> a 40-kilometer wide corridor through which Army Group North retreated westward into the Courland region of Latvia.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century Lake Worth Lagoon was a fresh water lake with no {{connection}} to the ocean. After the Lake Worth Inlet was cut near {{the north end of}} the lagoon in 1866 (with intermittent closures and <b>re-openings</b> until 1886), the lagoon became increasingly brackish. Development around the lagoon polluted it, as well. By 1913 residents of the area were discussing opening another inlet from the south end of the lagoon to help flush polluted waters into the ocean. The State of Florida created a taxing district for the South Lake Worth Inlet in 1915 (the taxing district was abolished in 1996, and Palm Beach County assumed responsibility for maintaining the inlet). Construction of the inlet began in 1925. The new inlet was completed in 1927 at a cost of $225,000, and was 130 ft wide and 8 ft deep (below mean low water).|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} events is often held {{in the wake of}} natural {{disasters}} in rural communities, as a tool to assist in recovery. While this phenomenon is increasingly ubiquitous, there have been few studies which acknowledge this, and none to date that examine the types of events that assist disaster recovery, the roles they play and their importance in this process. This exploratory study aims to fill this gap using a case study of 87 events held after the Black Saturday fires in Victoria, Australia, in 2009. Findings suggest that there are eight main types of events held after a natural disaster – fundraising events, grieving events, community information sessions, community rebuilding events, <b>re-openings,</b> VIP visits, commemorations and thanksgiving events – and that these events perform different roles in disaster recovery. A portfolio of events might be usefully employed to combat disaster fatigue, through scheduling different types of events at different times...|$|R
