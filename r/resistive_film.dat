50|$|This type is superficially {{very similar}} to a {{resonance}} absorption isolator, but the magnetic biassing differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a <b>resistive</b> <b>film</b> or card on one face of the ferrite block rather than within the ferrite itself. The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give the ferrite zero permeability for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the forward signal, while the backward signal sees the ferrite as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the forward signal tends to be excluded from the ferrite while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it. This results in a null of the electric field of the forward signal {{on the surface of}} the ferrite where the <b>resistive</b> <b>film</b> is placed. Conversely for the backward signal, the electric field is strong over this surface and so its energy is dissipated in driving current through the film. In rectangular waveguide the ferrite block will typically occupy the full height from one broad-wall to the other, with the <b>resistive</b> <b>film</b> on the side facing the centre-line of the guide.|$|E
