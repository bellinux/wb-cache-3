500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When we got the series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Home" [...] {{was first}} {{submitted}} to the censors featuring audio of the baby screaming while being buried alive. Ten Thirteen Productions was asked by Fox executives to alter the audio so that the baby would sound sick; they noted that the audio change was needed to show the child was diseased and that the Peacocks were not simply killing an innocent child. Manners called the shot, shown from the child's perspective, of the baby's burial as [...] "the most awful shot of my career". He said that he approached filming as seriously as he could because he felt the script was a classic. [...] When production was finished, {{he said that he}} loved the episode and called it one of his favorites. Duchovny agreed with Manners, saying, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> one. Although it didn't scare me." [...] He explained that it [...] "touched" [...] him with its themes concerning the desire to [...] "live and to propagate." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck. It's a pain in the ass, but I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> sound. I don't think I would ever go to a 7-string." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2013, the band's twelfth studio album, Between Dog and Wolf, mixed by Joe Barresi, was {{released}} {{and became the}} band's most successful since The Love of Hopeless Causes 20 years earlier. [...] The album showed a marked shift away from the band's traditional sounds, including rhythms that were described as [...] "tribal", though Sullivan claimed they were merely different ways of using drums – [...] "We really like complex tom-tom rhythms, we <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> pounding (beat)". [...] A year later, Between Wine and Blood {{was released}}, including six previously unreleased studio tracks from the Between Dog and Wolf sessions, along with eleven live tracks from that album. [...] In October 2014, a documentary feature film about the band's career, Between Dog and Wolf: The New Model Army Story by director Matt Reid premiered at the Raindance Film Festival in London and the Festival du nouveau cinéma in Montreal. [...] The band's 14th studio album, Winter, was released on 26 August 2016. Winter was named the #1 album of 2016 by The Big Takeover.|$|E
500|$|While Ray Davies {{had been}} {{instructed}} {{at the time}} to write [...] "Beatle-type" [...] material for commercial reasons, [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] was written as a more R composition. The song is centred on a guitar riff by Dave Davies, which has since been referred to as [...] "instantly identifiable." [...] American musicologist Robert Walser described [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] as [...] "the first hit song built around power chords." [...] The song has since been labeled as an early influence of the heavy metal genre, with critic Denise Sullivan of AllMusic writing, You Really Got Me' remains a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal." [...] However, Dave Davies has since rejected the idea that the song is heavy metal, saying [...] "I've never <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> term, heavy metal. I think, in all humility, it was the first heavy guitar riff rock record. Just because of the sound—if you played it on a ukulele, it might not have been so powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> <b>that</b> we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit , and then when we started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E

There's a {{circulating}} library at the Glen store--but I don't think the committee who pick the books for Mr. Parker know what books are of Joseph's race--or perhaps they don't care. It was so seldom I got one I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> I gave up getting any." ...|$|R
5000|$|Each episode {{opens with}} Rosie talking with her {{therapist}} (Rosenzweig), whose face was never seen on camera. Rosie {{had been at}} the receiving end of an unwanted divorce, after her attorney husband had an affair. The advertisement for the series which appeared in TV Guide the night the series debuted told the story as follows: [...] "I'm 43 and divorced. He got our law practice, the Mercedes, and the dog. It's only fair that I should be angry. I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> dog." ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 20, Gadot {{served for}} two years as an enlisted soldier in the Israel Defense Forces, serving as a combat trainer. She says of her time in the army: [...] "You give two or three years, and it's not about you. You learn {{discipline}} and respect." [...] Gadot says that her background helped her to win the role of Gisele in Fast & Furious: [...] "I think the main reason was that the director Justin Lin <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> I was in the military, {{and he wanted to}} use my knowledge of weapons." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} I can remember, an extreme-sports game {{actually}} has a real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E
500|$|While Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto {{worked on}} Super Mario World, {{he thought to}} make Yoshi the series' [...] "next hero" [...] since the game {{designer}} {{did not like the}} other Yoshi games, including Yoshi's Safari and Yoshi's Cookie, and thought he could make something more authentic. When he first brought the game to Nintendo marketing, they declined the game for having Mario-style graphics rather than the vogue, computer pre-rendered graphics of Donkey Kong Country. In comparison, they felt that his game lacked the power to impress. Incensed and opposed to the style, Miyamoto instead further escalated his cartoonish visuals into a hand-drawn, crayon style. Nintendo's marketing department accepted this revision. Miyamoto later recalled feeling that the marketing department wanted [...] "better hardware and more beautiful graphics instead of ... art". Around the time of his rejection, Miyamoto allegedly said that [...] "Donkey Kong Country proves that players will put up with mediocre gameplay as long as the art is good". However, he later clarified his remarks, stating that [...] "recently some rumour got out that I didn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> game? I just want to clarify that that's not the case, because I was very involved in that. And even emailing almost daily with Tim Stamper right up until the end." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All things," [...] I remarked sententiously, [...] "are real. And {{all of them}} {{a little}} unreal. South Africa has been wonderful. And now it is all over one doubts if it <b>really</b> happened. <b>Like</b> <b>that</b> incredulous mood after a storm of passion." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} Oxford in 1984, Reed sought {{to work for}} an entrepreneur. He wrote a {{speculative}} job application to Gordon and Anita Roddick of the Body Shop plc. The couple subsequently employed him as assistant to then-chairman Gordon. Reed has described his time at the Body Shop as his transition from University {{to the world of}} work. He has cited Anita Roddick as an influence, saying: [...] "If a bottle of jojoba hand lotion wasn't displayed properly on the shelf, she'd pull you up on it. And I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> — that combination of real drive and enthusiasm, and getting the details right." ...|$|R
2500|$|The title Survival was {{arrived at}} almost by default. In his book The World of Survival (Andre Deutsch, 1978), Willock {{revealed}} {{it was nearly}} called Tooth and Claw. [...] "Both Aubrey and I objected to it {{on the grounds that}} nature was not <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> In the end we came up with Survival. It was adopted for the reason that most titles are eventually adopted. No one could think of anything better." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 April 2015, Rhodes' {{second wife}} Melanie {{gave birth to}} a {{daughter}} named India Rhodes, in Mumbai. The couple named her after the country, stating they admired the rich culture and geographical diversity of the country."“It is a very spiritual country, very forward-thinking nation.

2500|$|Explaining the {{decision}} to start the series with the teenagers as juniors, Schwahn said, [...] "Lucas and Nathan were important players on the [...] team, the most important, and I just couldn't see that happening to freshmen." [...] He also {{wanted to keep the}} characters in high school longer, saying, [...] "I know a lot of the shows that we started with, the kids are out of high school now and into college and what have you, and I always thought that there was a loss of energy when that happened. It's hard to have everyone go to the same college and everyone stay together for whatever reason, or you lose some of your principles." [...] Schwahn wanted to reinvigorate the show. [...] "The show in many ways has been refaced and reinvigorated. It's very much a twenty-something show now with some relevant adult characters, and I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> energy for the show," [...] he said, and elaborated: ...|$|E
500|$|Computer-generated imagery {{was used}} in much of [...] "Days Gone Bye", {{particularly}} when Rick encounters a legless walker. [...] "The woman was wearing basically blue stockings and then everything was cleaned out. There is an alarming amount of CGI in the pilot episode and in the whole show, and you would never know it," [...] articulated Robert Kirkman. Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|R

If she doesn't wear her sunglasses she sees flashes and that causes headaches. She also likes Raphael and she thinks he also likes her. But Raphael is in love with Sterre. She sees Raphael and herself as a dream couple. At the end of episode 50 her sense is stolen by the Dark Druids and now she can see without sunglasses.

5000|$|The albums genre, electropop, differs {{slightly}} from Valances previous album Footprints (2002), She stated, [...] "Its kind of different cos {{at the time}} I was listening to rock, I was listening to dance and lots of electro and I loved them all equally.

It was dreadful to see poor Uncle William and Uncle Henry and Cousin Willie and Cousin Ferdinand of Bulgaria, {{coming up}} the gang-plank into the steerage, with their boxes on their backs. They looked so different in their rough clothes. Uncle William is wearing an old blue shirt and a red handkerchief round his neck, and his hair looks thin and unkempt, and his moustache draggled and his face unshaved. His eyes seem watery and wandering, and his little withered arm so pathetic. Is it possible he was always <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Pendennis, whose {{likeness}} to his Grace {{has been}} remarked, began to imitate him unconsciously, {{after they had}} parted, speaking with curt sentences, after {{the manner of the}} great man. We have all of us, no doubt, met with more than one military officer who has so imitated the manner of a certain great Captain of the Age; and has, perhaps, changed his own natural character and disposition, because Fate had endowed him with an aquiline nose. In like manner have we not seen many another man pride himself on having a tall forehead and a supposed likeness to Mr. Canning? many another go through life swelling with self-gratification on account of an imagined resemblance (we say [...] "imagined," [...] because that anybody should be <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> most beautiful and perfect of men is impossible) to the great and revered George IV.: many third parties, who wore low necks to their dresses because they fancied that Lord Byron and themselves were similar in appearance: and has not the grave closed but lately upon poor Tom Bickerstaff, who having no more imagination than Mr. Joseph Hume, looked in the glass and fancied himself like Shakspeare? shaved his forehead so as farther to resemble the immortal bard, wrote tragedies incessantly, and died perfectly crazy--actually perished of his forehead? These or similar freaks of vanity most people who have frequented the world must have seen in their experience. Pen laughed in his roguish sleeve at the manner in which his uncle began to imitate the great man from whom they had just parted but Mr. Pen was as vain in his own way, perhaps, as the elder gentleman, and strutted, with a very consequential air of his own, by the Major's side.|$|E

Well they were there {{to see some of the}} old Memphis guys as well. And that comradre with everybody, and hearing him singing our music, which was born and raised and produced and recorded in Memphis Tennessee. It was just something I, it's hard to explain the excitement coming from being on stage and that excitement coming out of the audience. It just filled our hearts. Because they <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> us, and they <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> good old Memphis music, and here's one of the biggest Idols singing that music. It's just pretty much an overwhelming experience that we will probably never ever get over. I hope some way we can do it again." ...|$|R
