5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
25|$|At work, Mal faces {{a number}} of {{problems}} involving customers and staff and handles them aggressively. He also tries to fend off calls on his mobile from a woman he has been having an affair with on lunch breaks. Meanwhile, at home, Jill confides with Chrissie, her daughter, that she knows of Mal's affair. Chrissie talks of her marriage in a far less positive light than her husband gave earlier, wondering if she has gone frigid after giving birth. Jill notices that Chrissie keeps <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> arm, and finds out that Dean sometimes hits her. After school, Sam's news that he got the part he wanted (in spite of no signed form) is little cheer to Jill. Mal and Dean return home having been out drinking, and Dean insists on driving Chrissie and the baby home in spite of Chrissie's pleas not to.|$|E
25|$|Sidewinders mature at two {{to three}} years of age, are capable of {{reproducing}} annually, and give birth to live young. Some females skip reproductive opportunities. Some might even skip two years if the food supply is scarce. Sidewinders mate in April through May and sometimes in fall. When the male and female mate, the male snake crawls along the female's back, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> with his chin to stimulate or arouse her. The male then will wrap his tail around her tail, and then will try to bring their cloacae together. The cloaca is the posterior body opening through which snakes both excrete waste and reproduce. If the female wants to mate, she will lift her tail and allow him to mate with her. The snakes can mate for several hours, and if one of the snakes decides to move, the other is dragged along. Females might mate with several males in a season. Females give birth to five to 18 young in late summer to early fall. The young are born six to eight inches long. The birth takes only {{two to three}} hours altogether. Within a few minutes of being born, the baby sidewinder escapes from a thin, transparent membrane. The young stay at their natal burrow for seven to ten days until they shed, and then they disappear and have no future contact with their mother or their litter mates. While the density of sidewinders can be up to one individual per hectare, they rarely encounter each other except during mating season.|$|E

500|$|To {{physicians}} of the time, {{the appropriate}} treatment for [...] "apparent death" [...] was warmth and stimulation. [...] Anne Greene, a woman {{sentenced to death}} and hanged in 1650 for the supposed murder of her stillborn child, was found by anatomists to be still alive. [...] They revived her by pouring hot cordial down her throat, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> limbs and extremities, bleeding her, applying heating plasters and a [...] "heating odoriferous Clyster to be cast up in her body, to give heat and warmth to her bowels." [...] After placing her in a warm bed with another woman, to keep her warm, she recovered fully and was pardoned.|$|E

He also warns Powers [...] "whatever you do don't fall in love. We've already lost 007 and 008". As the video continues, Powers finds Madonna at a club performing in front of a crowd, which includes Verne Troyer in character as Mini-Me. As he watches her perform Powers finds himself fantasizing about the two of them dancing in front of a white background with psychedelic fluorescent whirls. He also visualizes them riding a car together, where Madonna dances suggestively and licks Powers' face while <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> crotch and bottom on his cheeks.|$|E

500|$|On July 1, Beyoncé {{appeared}} on Good Morning America {{as part of}} its [...] "Summer Concert Series" [...] in New York City.

She then traveled to Scotland to perform at the T in the Park Festival on July 10, 2011. The next day, she performed at the Oxegen Festival in Ireland. On July 28, 2011, Beyoncé performed [...] "1+1" [...] and [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] on The View; the latter was also performed on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon the same day.

500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
500|$|Dragon Warrior was {{released}} in North America by Nintendo of America {{under the direction of}} Satoru Iwata with help from Horii in August1989 – months before the Japanese release of [...] Because the game {{was released}} in North America nearly three years after the original release in Japan, the graphics were improved. Instead of lengthy passwords with kana characters, the North American version features a battery-backed RAM savegame. Akira Toriyama's artwork in the instruction booklets was also changed to reflect more of a traditional tone as found in popular American based RPGs such as the Ultima series. The game's character sprites were changed so that they face their direction of travel; in the Japanese versions, the sprites are smaller and face only forwards, requiring players to choose a direction for actions from a menu. Spells were given self-explanatory one-word titles instead of the made-up words of the Japanese version. Locations were renamed, and dialogue was rewritten from its whimiscal style comparable to Dragon Ball to a style inspired by Elizabethan English, with sentences such as [...] "Thy hit points have decreased by 1." [...] Nintendo also removed salacious humor and religious connotations from the English-language version. For example, in the Japanese version, in the town where the hero first buys keys, a woman offers to sell puff-puff – a Japanese onomatopoeia for a girl <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> breasts in someone's face, or juggling her own breasts. In the North American version, the same woman sells tomatoes. The term has been included in the game's sequels as well as in Toriyama's Dragon Ball series.|$|E

According to the royal annals, Hoang was on a sightseeing trip and holiday to see the seas and mountains of the local area when he passed by the hill which is now the site of the Thien Mu Pagoda. He heard of a local legend, in which an old lady, known as Thiên Mụ (literally [...] "fairy woman"), wearing a red shirt and blue trousers, sat at the site, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. She said that a lord would come to the hill and erect a pagoda to pray for the country' prosperity. According to the local legend, the lady vanished after making her prophecy.
