40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the working and development of wireless <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> system. In this research previously developed models have been studied. After analysis of those models, a better approach has been presented in this research. The objective {{of this research is}} to design and develop a tele-operated <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> system. The <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> is intended for providing solutions to industrial problems like robot reprogramming, industrial automation and replacement for the workers working in hostile environments. The <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> system works in the master slave configuration where Bluetooth is being used as the communication channel for the tele-operation. The master is a glove, embedded with sensors to detect the movement of every joint present in the hand, which a human operator can wear. This joint movement is transferred to the slave <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> which will mimic the movement of human operator. The <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> is a multi fingered dexterous and anthropomorphic hand. The hand is designed by using commercially available version of SolidWorkBOIO. The <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> comprises of five fingers (four fingers and one thumb), each having four degrees of fieedom @OF). All the fingers are capable of performing flexion, extension, abduction, adduction and hence circumduction. A new combination of pneumatic muscles and springs has been used for the actuation purpose. This combination reduces the size of the <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> by decreasing the number of pneumatic muscles used. The pneumatic muscles are controlled by the opening and closing of solenoid valves. A novel technique has been used in the <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> for tendon routing, which gives the ability of independence to all finger joints. Each of the finger joints can bend independently. The heart of all the control mechanism is rnbed microcontroller. The sensors used in the glove for sensing the joint angles are BendSensors. The controller processes the angles provided by these sensors and hen transmit to the <b>robotic</b> <b>hand.</b> The <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> also has mbed microcontrolIer to acquire the angles from master and control the opening and closing of solenoid valves according to the required angle...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method to}} {{calculate}} the bended fingerâ€™s angle has presented here {{which could be used}} to control the electro-mechanical <b>robotic</b> <b>hand.</b> It is assumed that the <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> has the human hand like joints and same number of degree of freedom as human hand. In many applications an equipment like human hand is needed, to do the same kind of operation like human do. These days it is easy to make the electro-mechanical <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> which has five fingers and same joint but it is not easily controllable as the human hand for accurate work. In our method the hand gesture will be interpreted for controlling the <b>robotic</b> <b>hand.</b> The angles for all the fingers will be calculated and that could be further passed to the <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> for controlling its finger. User would perform gesture according to the action as he wants to be done by <b>robotic</b> <b>hand.</b> Here finger positions are detected using geometric modeling of hand in the extracted image Region of interest cropping from the image made the algorithm faster. </p...|$|R

40|$|Teleoperating a <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> {{with the}} aid of a sensorized glove {{presents}} some particular problems.

This paper proposes two new mappings within two existing mapping types, as well as a new hybrid mapping that combines the best features of these existing mapping types. This hybrid mapping allows intuitive free space movements (where the gesture is more important than the precise positions of the fingers) and grasp movements (where the precise positions of the fingers is more important than the gesture), despite kinematic differences between the human <b>hand</b> and the <b>robotic</b> <b>hand.</b> The approach has been implemented, and some illustrative examples are presented in this paper.

The study showed that the pinch force level of most current mechanical hands is too low for practical use. The best tested hand was a prosthetic hand developed around 1945.

5000|$|The {{history of}} {{automatic}} sign language translation {{started with the}} development of hardware such as finger-spelling <b>robotic</b> <b>hands.</b> In 1977, a finger-spelling hand project, Ralph created a robotic hand that can translate alphabets into finger-spellings.

The wearable hardware made it possible to capture the signersâ€™ hand shapes and movements {{with the help of the}} computer software. However, the cameras {{with the development of}} computer vision replaced those wearable devices due to the efficiency and less physical restrictions on signers. To process the data collected through the devices, researchers implemented neural networks such as the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator for the pattern recognition in their projects such as the CyberGlove. Researchers also use many other approaches for sign recognition. For example, Hidden Markov Models is used to analyze the data statistically,and the GRASP and other machine learning programs use the training sets to improve the accuracy of sign recognition.|$|E
