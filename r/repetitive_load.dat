Its qualities are explored using a database of 1, 575 workers in various occupations who completed the questionnaire. The DMQ-questions can be categorized into 7 indices (force, dynamic and static load, <b>repetitive</b> <b>load,</b> climatic factors, vibration and ergonomic environmental factors). Together with 4 separate questions on standing, sitting, walking and uncomfortable postures, the indices constitute a brief overview of the findings on musculoskeletal workload and related working conditions. Homogeneity of the indices is satisfactory.

40|$|Geosystems often {{experience}} numerous loading cycles. Plastic strain accumulation during repetitive mechanical loads {{can lead}} to shear shakedown or continued shear ratcheting; in all cases, volumetric strains diminish as the specimen evolves towards terminal density. Previously suggested models and new functions are identified to fit plastic strain accumulation data. All accumulation models are formulated to capture terminal density (volumetric strain) and either shakedown or ratcheting (shear strain). Repetitive vertical loading tests under zero lateral strain conditions are conducted using three different sands packed at initially low and high densities. Test results show that plastic strain accumulation for all sands and density conditions can be captured in the same dimensionless plot {{defined in terms of}} the initial relative density, terminal density, and ratio between the amplitude of the <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> and the initial static load. This observation allows us to advance a simple but robust procedure to estimate the maximum one-dimensional settlement that a foundation could experience if subjected to repetitive loads. © 2016, Canadian Science Publishing.

40|$|Tendinopathy is {{a common}} {{clinical}} problem with athletes and in many occupational settings. Tendinopathy can occur in any tendon, often near its insertion or enthesis where there {{is an area of}} stress concentration, and {{is directly related to the}} volume of <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> to which the tendon is exposed. Recent studies indicate tendinopathy is more likely to occur in situations that increase the “dose” of load to the tendon enthesis – including increased activity, weight, advancing age, and genetic factors. The cells in tendinopathic tendon are rounder, more numerous, and show evidence of oxidative damage and more apoptosis. These cells also produce a matrix that is thicker and weaker with more water, more immature and cartilage-like matrix proteins, and less organization. There is now evidence of a population of regenerating stem cells within tendon. These studies suggest prevention of tendinopathy should be directed at reducing the volume of repetitive loads to below that which induces oxidative-induced apoptosis and cartilage-like genes. The management strategies might involve agents or cells that induce tendon stem cell proliferation, repair and restoration of matrix integrity...|$|E

It is a fraction in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) {{optimization technique}}s under the artificial intelligence hierarchy. Optimization {{is an important issue}} in power system operation and planning particularly in the area of voltage stability studies. This paper presents transmission loss minimisation using optimal reactive power planning techniques (RPP). The problem involved optimization process; utilizing the ideas of EP to identify the optimal solution for RPP. In this study, EP engine was initially developed to implement the optimisation process considering two RPP procedures, namely optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) and optimal transformer tap changer setting (OTTCS). Comparative studies performed in this study aimed to identify the most suitable RPP technique for minimising transmission loss in power system, while maintaining the voltage profiles at reasonable voltage levels and avoiding overcompensating to the system. <b>Repetitive</b> <b>load</b> flow program was implemented for the fitness computation of the EP.

40|$|Introduction: The {{human spine}} {{is exposed to}} many {{different}} loads during daily activities and especially during sporting activities. The spine has different biomechanical properties during the lifetime and thereby responds differently to <b>repetitive</b> and sudden <b>loads.</b> The correlation of differ-ent motions and load exposures to spine and back problems {{have not yet been}} fully clarified. Aim: To investigate the effect of <b>repetitive</b> <b>loading</b> of different magnitude and motion on the spine with both clinical and experimental studies. To investigate the prevalence of LBP and the amount and type of spinal abnormalities on MRI in the spine that young elite athletes in mogul skiing and long distance running are subjected to due to the <b>repetitive</b> <b>loading</b> in their sports compared to non-athletic controls. To investigate the failure and fatigue responses in young porcine Functional Spinal Units (FSU) due to <b>repetitive</b> <b>loading.</b> Methods and results: The prevalence of LBP and spinal abnormalities were investigated in two cross sectional studies, with young long distance runners and mogul skiers compared to matched control groups with questionnaires and MRI assessment. The results displayed significantly high-er lifetime LBP in runners (45 %) than the corresponding controls (12 %) while no significance was seen between the skiers (50 %) and their control group (42 %). The mogul skiers had signifi-cantly more MRI abnormalities in mean than the control group (7. 3 vs 3. 8, p< 0. 023) and no sig-nificant difference was seen between the runners and controls (5. 6 vs 9. 2). The fatigue and failure response of young porcine FSUs were investigated in two experimental motion settings. The results displayed that the FSUs were resilient towards the induced fatigue loading in both axial and flexion-extension motions. The endplate and the growth zone displayed corresponding histological and MRI changes and fractures as fatigue and failure responses. Conclusion: LBP is common among young athletes and the frequency of spinal abnormalities seem to increase with greater spinal <b>load</b> magnitude. <b>Repetitive</b> <b>loading</b> of the young porcine spine cause fatigue and failure responses mainly localized in the growth zone and the endplate...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} voltage {{instability}} is gaining {{more and more}} importance because of the unusual growth of power systems and insufficient or inefficient reactive power management. The voltage stability problem of a power system {{is associated with a}} rapid voltage drop due to heavy system load. Voltage reduction has a cumulative effect unless ample reactive power sources are available to regulate the voltage and maintain the reactive power balance. In this paper, simple and direct method of determining the steady state voltage stability limit of a power system at a particular load bus is implemented. The maximum permissible loading of a particular load bus is determined through a simplified Two-Bus equivalent model, called “Thevenin's Equivalent” of the original system. This method uses the base-case system information to find special Two-Bus equivalents of the system for analyzing the voltage stability problem. The effectiveness of this method is tested on a simple Two-Bus system and on the IEEE 14 Bus and IEEE 30 Bus systems and the results are compared with Newton- Raphson method. System performance is analyzed with and without a Static Var Compensator (SVC). The effects of load power factor and SVC rating on voltage stability limit are also studied.

40|$|Asphalt {{pavement}} {{in actual}} circumstances {{is subjected to}} the repetitive and changing transport load. As {{a result of the}} <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> impact, both elastic and plastic deformations occur to the pavement. Accumulation of plastic deformations in one or several layers leads to appearance of permanent deformations or rutting. This type of deformations reduces safety and convenience of traffic. Aim of the research is investigation of the rutting dynamics on the dense graded asphalt concrete (AC) and stone mastic asphalt (SMA) mixtures. The research has been made by using the standard performance test method – wheel tracking test (WTT). Five compositions of the dense graded AC mixture and two compositions of the SMA with the conventional aggregate and one reference mixture AC 11 with the Martin steel slag aggregate have been used in the experiment. The B 70 / 100 unmodified bitumen and SBS modified ModBit 80 B has been used for the investigated mixtures. The results have shown poor strain stability of the conventional mixtures with unmodified bitumen under the heavy transport load, in comparison with the reference mixture AC 11 and SMA with modified bitumen.

40|$|Abstract- Recent {{development}} has witnessed blackout incidents {{in many parts}} of the world. This can be due to voltage instability phenomena resulted from the stressed situation of the system where large amounts of real and reactive power are transported over long transmission lines. Besides, electric power systems are also exposed to various contingencies which contribute to over-loading of network branches, unsatisfactory voltages, leading to voltage collapse problems. Appropriate precaution can be made if the areas prone to voltage instability are clustered making a continuous monitoring is possible. This paper presents the weak area clustering technique based on sensitive lines and critical line outages in power system network. A new algorithm to automatically perform the line outage contingency analysis and ranking was developed. This technique results in critical line outages in the system. Subsequently, voltage stability analysis which confines the <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> flow and voltage stability indices computation revealed the sensitive lines in the system. Outcomes from both techniques will eventually cluster the weak area in the system, representing the resultant cluster deduced from each one. Implementation on the IEEE RTS revealed the effectiveness of the proposed technique, making it feasible to be implemented in a practical system which in turn helping in proper monitoring process to the specified cluster.

The {{development of a}} modern control and management system for greenhouses used recent advances in software design, and development tools, to provide an open system for rapid program development. To effectively integrate expert system applications in a control and management system, an environment was built that supports all required interfaces between Al applications and the greenhouse management system (GMS). This environment incorporates a native fuzzy knowledge based system (KBS) {{and a number of}} procedural control functions, in the GMS, that can effectively interact. The programmable logic controller (PLC) houses all well-known control function blocks, in library form, callable to implement various control loop designs. Functions that have not been foreseen in the PLC control library can be instantly implemented using the open KBS system. The innovative addition of integral initial conditions on a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, for <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> switching applications, is an example, demonstrated in this paper. The usefulness of other control blocks such as a self-adjusting Smith predictor is also tested for a real application of a mixing process with long dead time. Synergism of fuzzy decisions and fuzzy controllers, at the supervisory level, with low level process regulators provide adaptive systems, which can optimize both long-term objectives and the short time dynamic responses.

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} connects diarthrodial joints, lubricates surface between bones, transfers and withstands <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> {{over the}} lifetime, which {{is prone to}} degeneration by various diseases, trauma and injuries. Once degeneration takes place, the avascular structure of human cartilage makes the self-healing extremely challenging. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study is}} to fabricate a biomimetic nanostructured cartilage scaffold by electrospinning and cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) techniques. Particularly, CAP is an ionized gas with various electrons, positive/negative ions, and excited molecules. It was utilized to create a more biomimetic and biocompatible surface of the electrospun nanocomposite cartilage scaffold. For this purpose, a polycaprolactone scaffold with randomly distributed microfibers was electrospun. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) was employed to fabricate bovine serum albumin (BSA) loaded nanospheres using a water/oil/water double emulsion solvent extraction method and deposited into electrospun fiber mat. The nanocomposite scaffolds were further modified using CAP for 0, 1, 3, and 5 min. Scanning electron microscopy results illustrated the electrospun fibers had uniform diameter distribution and nanospheres were homogenously embedded inside the scaffold. The human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) experiments showed that the cartilage scaffold with BSA loaded PLGA nanospheres can sustainably improve MSC growth after 7 days. Furthermore, CAP modified nanocomposite scaffolds had enhanced cell proliferation after 5 days culture. It is ascribed to both the improvement of hydrophilicity and adhesion-mediating proteins adsorption (vitronectin) on CAP modified scaffolds. The enhanced stem cell response rendered by CAP treatment and nanospheres makes our scaffold promising for improved cartilage regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{and human}} {{studies have shown}} that after {{allogeneic}} hematopoietic cell transplantation, epithelial cells containing donor-derived genome emerge. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still unclear. We hypothesized that horizontal transfer of the hematopoietic donor-DNA to the host epithelium confers a possible operating mechanism. In an in vitro model mimicking the lymphocyte–epithelial interaction, we cocultivated keratinocyte HaCaT cells (Y-chromosome negative) with nonapoptotic or apoptotic, CMFDA, or BrdU-labeled hematopoietic Jurkat cells (Y+) and looked for the emergence of HaCaT cells bearing Jurkat genome. We found that DNA can be horizontally transferred from hematopoietic to epithelial cell lines through phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies. The ingested genomic material was also found within the nuclear compartment and in isolated chromosomes obtained from HaCaT metaphases. Both lysosomal inhibition in HaCaT cells and <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> of HaCaT cells with apoptotic bodies increased the intercellular and intranuclear DNA delivery. Although recipient cells remained viable and showed to express the foreign DNA, this expression was transient. Taking into consideration these findings of horizontal DNA transfer between hematopoietic and epithelial cells, we evaluated by quantitative microsatellite analysis the amount of donor DNA in 176 buccal swabs obtained from 71 patients after allogeneic transplantation. We found a high amount of donor-DNA (mean 26. 6 %) in the majority (89. 7 %) of them, although no donor hematopoietic cells were evident in the samples by immunofluorescence. We propose that the incessant charge of the transplant recipient with donor-DNA and its “inappropriate” intranuclear delivery in host epithelium may explain the emergence of epithelial cells with donor-derived genome...|$|E

Several studies have shown that drug loaded therapeutic soft contact lenses (SCLs) constitute a promising approach, with several potential advantages as compared with collyria. The main objective of this work is to study the effect of <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> and friction cycles caused by the eye blinking, on the drug release from hydrogels used in SCLs which, as far as we know, was never investigated before. Two poly- 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate based hydrogels, pHEMA-T and pHEMA-UV, were used as model materials. Levofloxaxin was chosen as model drug. The hydrogels were fully characterized in what concerns structural and physicochemical properties. PHEMA-UV revealed some superficial porosity and a lower short range order than PHEMA-T. We observe that the load and friction cycles enhanced the drug release from pHEMAUV hydrogels. The application of a simple mathematical model, which takes into account the drug dilution caused by the tear flow, showed that the enhancement of the drug release caused by blinking on this hydrogel may be relevant in in vivo conditions. Conversely, the more sustained drug release from pHEMA-T is not affected by load and friction cycles. The conclusion is that, depending on the physicochemical and microstructural characteristics of the hydrogels, blinking is a factor that may affect the amount of drug delivered to the eye by SCLs and should thus be considered. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{introduced}} {{at first the}} background of numerous highway widening projects {{that have been developed}} in recent years in China. Using a large ground settlement simulator and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain sensor network system, a large-scale model test, with a similarity ratio of 1 : 2, was performed to analyze the influence of differential settlement between new and old subgrades on pavement structure under loading condition. The result shows that excessive differential settlement can cause considerable tensile strain in the pavement structure of a widened road, for which a maximum value (S) of 6 cm is recommended. Under the <b>repetitive</b> <b>load,</b> the top layers of pavement structure are subjected to the alternate action of tensile and compressive strains, which would eventually lead to a fatigue failure of the pavement. However, application of geogrid to the splice between the new and the old roads can reduce differential settlement to a limited extent. The new subgrade of a widened road is vulnerable to the influence of dynamic load transferred from the above pavement structures. While for the old subgrade, due to its comparatively high stiffness, it can well spread the load on the pavement statically or dynamically. The test also shows that application of geogrid can effectively prevent or defer the failure of pavement structure. With geogrid, the modulus of resilience of the subgrade is increased and inhomogeneous deformation can be reduced; therefore, the stress/strain distribution in pavement structure under loading condition becomes uniform. The results obtained in this context are expected to provide a helpful reference for structural design and maintenance strategy for future highway widening projects...|$|E

Two different base courses consisting of 75 % RD sand and a granular base material have been tested. The 75 % RD sand base course is also prepared by pluviation technique, while the granular base course is prepared in 5 layers, each of 50 mm thick, by static compaction.

40|$|AbstractObjective To assess matrix {{changes and}} {{chondrocyte}} viability during static and continuous repetitive mechanical loading in mature bovine articular cartilage explants. MethodsCartilage explants were continuously loaded either statically or cyclically (0. 5 Hz) for 1 – 72 h (max. stress 1 megapascal). Cell death {{was assessed using}} fluorescent probes and detection of DNA strand breakage characteristic of apoptosis. Cell morphology and matrix integrity were evaluated using histology and transmission electron microscopy. Results Repetitive loading of articular cartilage at physiological levels of stress (1 megapascal) {{was found to be}} harmful to only the chondrocytes in the superficial tangential zone (STZ) and depended on the characteristics (static vs cyclic) and duration (1 – 72 h) of the applied load. The chondrocytes in the middle and deep zone remained viable at all times. Static loads caused cell death at an early time (3 h) as compared with cyclic loads (sinusoidal, 0. 5 cycles per s for 6 h). The amount and extent of cell death peaked at 6 h of cyclic loading, and did not change in subsequent experiments run {{for longer periods of time}} (up to 72 h). There was no indication of fragmented nuclear DNA but there was evidence of injurious cell death (necrosis) by electron microscopy. Morphological analysis of cartilage repetitively loaded for 24 h showed matrix damage only in the uppermost superficial layer at the articular surface, reminiscent of the early stages of osteoarthritis. Conclusions Cell death in mature cartilage explants occurred after 6 hours of continuous <b>repetitive</b> <b>load</b> or 3 h of static load. Cell death was directly related to the mechanical load, as control (free-swelling) explants remained viable at all times. The excessive, repetitive loading conditions imposed are not physiological, and demonstrate the deleterious effects of mechanical overload resulting in morphological and cellular damage similar to that seen in degenerative joint disease...|$|E

An assessment of the reliability of R/C columns {{as an integral part of}} hammerhead bridge piers, subjected to axial load and biaxial bending, is carried out in this study. ^ To determine if there is a dierence in safety level (and eventually how big it is) after including fatigue in the analysis, two major cases are considered. First one covers analysis of the strength of the bridge piers based on the statistical parameters available at the time of the last code preparation. Some of the available statistical data at that time was very limited, i. e. live load. In the second part analogous analysis is carried out using newer statistical parameters. Additionally in this part, influence of cyclic load caused by truck traffic passing the bridge is considered in a form of weakening of concrete internal structure expressed in statistical parameters obtained in a separate analysis. The newest available statistical parameters of all variables are used to estimate safety level (expressed in reliability index, β) of the considered element, including the fatigue influence. ^ Combinations of different span lengths, concrete grades, reinforcement ratios, dimensions proportions, and normalized eccentricities in two orthogonal directions were considered in order to perform the sensitivity analysis. Resistance parameters are determined on the basis of statistical data for materials (material factors) and other factors (fabrication and professional factors). The statistical parameters of resistance are obtained using Monte Carlo techniques. For this purpose complex software program is developed in MATLAB. ^ Based on these analyses, recommendations for modifying the design resistance factors are proposed for the safer design of the bridge piers subjected to <b>repetitive</b> <b>load.</b> ^ Moreover, review of analytical fatigue models for concrete is performed.

40|$|Stress {{fracture}} is {{a common}} overuse injury experienced by participants of activities involving <b>repetitive</b> <b>loading</b> such as running and loaded walking. One population especially susceptible {{to this type of}} injury is US ARMY recruits. The incidence of stress fracture during basic training is about 6 % in recruits [1] with the most common site of fracture being the tibia; these tibial stress fractures account for more than 40 % of total stress fractures in the military [2, 3]...|$|R
40|$|Using a model {{organism}} (rabbits) {{that resembles}} a number of mammalian herbivores in key aspects of its chewing behaviors, we examined how variation in dietary mechanical properties a ects food breakdown during mastication. Such data have implications for understanding phenotypic variation in the mammalian feeding apparatus, {{particularly with respect to}} linking jaw form to diet-induced <b>repetitive</b> <b>loading.</b> Results indicate that chewing frequency (chews/s) is independent of food properties, whereas chewing investment (chews/g) and chewing duration(s), which are proportional to <b>repetitive</b> <b>loading</b> of the jaws, are positively related to food sti ness and toughness. In comparisons of displacement-limited and stress-limited fragmentation indices, which respectively characterize the intraoral breakdown of tough and sti foods, increases in chewing investment and duration are linked solely to sti ness. This suggests that sti er foods engender higher peak loads and increased cyclical loading. Our ndings challenge conventional wisdom by demonstrating that toughness does not, by itself, underlie increases in cyclical loading and loading duration. Instead, tough foods may be associated with such jaw-loading patterns because they must be processed in greater volumes owing to their lower nutritive quality and {{for longer periods of time}} to increase oral exposure to salivary chemicals...|$|R
