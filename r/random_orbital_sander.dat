40|$|Near the {{corotation}} {{resonance of}} a transient spiral arm, stellar orbital angular momenta may be changed without inducing significant kinematic heating, resulting {{in what has}} come to be known as radial migration. When radial migration is very efficient, a large fraction of disk stars experiences significant, permanent changes to their individual orbital angular momenta over the lifetime of the disk, having strong implications for the evolution of disk galaxies. The first step for a star in a spiral disk to migrate radially is to be captured in a "trapped" orbit, associated with the corotation resonance of the spiral pattern. An analytic criterion for determining whether or not a star is in a trapped orbit has previously been derived only for stars with zero <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> energy in the presence of a spiral with fixed properties. In this first paper in a series, we derive an analytic criterion appropriate for a star that is on an orbit of finite <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> energy. Our new criterion demonstrates that whether or not a star is in a "trapped" orbit primarily depends on the star's orbital angular momentum. This criterion could be a powerful tool in the interpretation of the results of N-body simulations. In future papers of this series, we apply our criterion to explore the physical parameters important to determining the efficiency of radial migration and its potential importance to disk evolution.

Assuming that these bodies were created by pairwise accretion from 1 to 10 km building blocks, we find that three conditions were required, namely: (i) at least 10 M Φ and more likely 35 M Φ of solids in the primordial 30 to 50 AU zone, (ii) mean <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> eccentricities of order 0. 002 or smaller, and (iii) mechanically strong building blocks. Furthermore, we find that the accretion of 100 [...] 200 km radius bodies in the 30 to 50 AU region from collisions among a starting population of 1 to 10 km building blocks required 10 8 [...] 10 9 years, with the lower range only being reached for 30 to 50 AU zone masses approaching 100 M Φ of solids or mean <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> eccentricities ! 0. 005 (which we do not believe is realistic after gas dissipation). Therefore, unless accretion had already produced many building blocks significantly larger than 10 km in diameter at the time the nebular gas was removed, our results also indicate that Neptune did not form on a timescale much shorter than 70 Myr, and could well have required many hundreds of Myr to approach its final mass. We also explore the growth of Pluto-scale (i. e., radius 1000 [...] 1200 km) objects in the 30 to 50 AU region under a variety of assumptions.

40|$|The {{traditional}} way of estimating the gravitational field from observed motions of test objects {{is based on the}} virial relation between their kinetic and potential energy.

The proposed estimator, which we call "orbital roulette", checks the randomness of the phases. The method has the following advantages: (1) It estimates accurately Keplerian (point-mass) potentials as well as non-Keplerian potentials where the unknown gravitating mass is distributed in space. (2) It is a complete statistical estimator: it checks a trial potential and accepts it or rules it out with a certain significance level; the best-fit measurement is thus supplemented with error bars at any confidence level. (3) It needs no a priori assumptions about the distribution of orbital parameters of the test bodies. We test our estimator with Monte-Carlo-generated motions and demonstrate its efficiency.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the orbital evolution of planetesimals in a self-gravitating circumstellar disc {{in the size}} regime (∼ 1 − 5000 km) where the planetesimals behave approximately as test particles in the disc’s non-axisymmetric potential. We find that the particles respond to the stochastic, regenerative spiral features in the disc by executing large random excursions (up to a factor of two in radius in∼ 1000 years), although typical <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> velocities are of order one tenth of the Keplerian speed. The limited time frame and small number of planetesimals modeled does not permit us to discern any net direction of planetesimal migration. Our chief conclusion is that the high eccentricities (∼ 0. 1) induced by interaction with spiral features in the disc {{is likely to be}} highly unfavourable to the collisional growth of planetesimals in this size range while the disc is in the self-gravitating regime. Thus if, as recently argued by Rice et al 2004, 2006, the production of planetesimals gets under way when the disc is in the self-gravitating regime (either at smaller planetesimal size scales, where gas drag is important, or via gravitational fragmentation of the solid component), then the planetesimals thus produced {{would not be able to}} grow collisionally until the disc ceased to be self-gravitating.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} facing large transit surveys is the elimination of false-positives from the vast number of transit candidates. We investigate to what extent information from the lightcurves can identify blend scenarios and eliminate them as planet candidates, to significantly decrease the amount of follow-up observing time required to identify the true exoplanet systems. If a lightcurve has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio, a distinction can be made between the lightcurve of a stellar binary blended with a third star and the lightcurve of a transiting exoplanet system. We perform simulations to determine what signal-to-noise level is required to make the distinction between blended and non-blended systems as function of transit depth and impact parameter. Subsequently we test our method on real data from the first IRa 01 field observed by the CoRoT satellite, concentrating on the 51 candidates already identified by the CoRoT team.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb {{in a group of}} female workers performing either mechanical or hand sanding in the furniture industry (n= 100) and in a control group of female office workers (n= 100). A further aim was to study the possible adverse effects of exposure to a combination of vibration and ergonomic risk factors in female workers. Methods: All female workers underwent a medical interview and a complete physical investigation. The clinical diagnoses of Raynaud’s phenomenon and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were made according to international consensus criteria. Hand-transmitted vibration from <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders</b> was measured according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recommendations. Daily vibration exposure was assessed in terms of 8 -h energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration [A(8) ] according to the European Directive on physical agents. Ergonomic load on the upper limbs was estimated by means of strain index methodology. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon between the furniture workers (4 %) and the controls (8 %). The prevalence of CTS, peripheral sensorineural disturbances (after exclusion of CTS cases) and upper-limb musculoskeletal complaints was significantly greater in the furniture workers than in the controls. CTS was clinically diagnosed in 19 % of the furniture workers and 8 % of the controls. A log-binomial regression analysis showed that the occurrence of soft-tissue disorders of the upper limb increased significantly with the increase of both daily vibration exposure and the strain index score. It was estimated that the risk for CTS increased by a factor of 1. 30 (95 % CI 1. 11 – 1. 53) for each unit of increase in A(8) (ms 2), and by 1. 09 (95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 15) for each unit of increase in the strain index score. Conclusions: Even though the cross-sectional design of this epidemiological study does not allow aetiological considerations, our findings suggest a significant association between occupational use of vibratory tools and soft-tissue disorders in the upper limbs of female workers. Quantitative estimation of vibration exposure and ergonomic stress showed that these physical risk factors seem to contribute in a multiplicative way to the occurrence of chronic nerve and musculoskeletal disorders in female workers operating hand-held vibrating tools in the furniture industry...|$|R
40|$|PTFO 8 - 8695 b {{represents}} the first transiting exoplanet candidate orbiting a pre-main-sequence star (van Eyken et al. 2012). We {{find that the}} unusual lightcurve shapes of PTFO 8 - 8695 {{can be explained by}} transits of a planet across an oblate, gravity-darkened stellar disk. We develop a theoretical framework for understanding precession of a planetary orbit’s ascending node for the case when the stellar rotational angular momentum and the planetary orbital angular momentum are comparable in magnitude. We then implement those ideas to simultaneously and self-consistently fit two separate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two self-consistent fits yield Mp = 3. 0 MJup and Mp = 3. 6 MJup for assumed stellar masses of M ∗ = 0. 34 M and M ∗ = 0. 44 M respectively. The two fits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass determinations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength of the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8 - 8695 b as just the second Hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree of spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8 - 8695 system: 69 ◦ ± 2 ◦ or 73. 1 ◦ ± 0. 5 ◦, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the hypothesis that planets become Hot Jupiters with <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> plane alignments early in a system’s lifetime.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{support the}} idea that nuclear black holes grew by gas accretion while shining as luminous quasars at high redshift, and they establish a relation of the black hole mass with the host galaxy’s spheroidal stellar system. We develop an analytic model to calculate the expected impact of mergers on the masses of black holes in massive clusters of galaxies. We use the extended Press-Schechter formalism to generate Monte Carlo merger histories of halos with a mass 10 15 h − 1 M⊙. We assume that the black hole mass function at z = 2 is similar to that inferred from observations at z = 0 (since quasar activity declines markedly at z < 2), and we assign black holes to the progenitor halos assuming a monotonic relation between halo mass and black hole mass. We follow the dynamical evolution of subhalos within larger halos, allowing for tidal stripping, the loss of orbital energy by dynamical friction, and <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> perturbations in gravitational encounters with subhalos, and we assume that most black holes will efficiently merge after their host galaxies (represented as the nuclei of subhalos in our model) merge. Our analytic model reproduces numerical estimates of the subhalo mass function. We find that mergers can increase the mass of the most massive black holes in massive clusters typically by a factor ∼ 2, after gas accretion has stopped. In our ten realizations of 10 15 h − 1 M ⊙ clusters, the highest initial (z = 2) black hole masses are 5 − 7 × 10 9 M⊙, but four of the clusters contain black holes in the range 1 − 1. 5 × 10 10 M ⊙ at z = 0. Satellite galaxies may host black holes whose mass is comparable to, or even greater than, that of the central galaxy.

40|$|We {{explore the}} effects of collisional {{evolution}} on putative Vulcanoid ensembles in the region between 0. 06 and 0. 21 AU from the Sun, in order to constrain the probable population density and population structure of this region today. Dynamical {{studies have shown that}} the Vulcanoid Zone (VZ) could be populated. However, we find that the frequency and energetics of collisional evolution this close to the Sun, coupled with the efficient radiation transport of small debris out of this region, together conspire to create an active and highly intensive collisional environment which depletes any very significant population of rocky bodies placed in it, unless the bodies exhibit orbits that are circular to ~ 10 ^- 3 or less, or highly lossy mechanical properties that correspond to a fraction of impact energy significantly less than 10 % being imparted to ejecta. The most favorable locale for residual bodies to survive in this region is in highly circular orbits near the outer edge of the dynamically stable Vulcanoid Zone (i. e., near 0. 2 AU), where collisional evolution and radiation transport of small bodies and debris proceed most slowly. If the mean <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> eccentricity in this region exceeds ~ 10 ^- 3, then our work suggests it is unlikely that more than a few hundred objects with radii larger than 1 km will be found in the entire VZ; assuming the largest objects have a radius of 30 km, then the total mass of bodies in the VZ down to 0. 1 km radii is likely to be no more than ~ 10 ^- 6 Mearth, < 10 ^- 3 the mass of the asteroid belt.

40|$|There are {{an enigmatic}} {{population}} of massive stars around the Galactic Center (GC) that were formed some Ma ago. A fraction of these stars {{has been found}} to orbit the supermassive black hole, SgrA*, in a projected clockwise disk, which suggests that they were formed in a formerly existing dense disk around SgrA*. We focus on the extended, near-infrared (NIR) sources IRS 1 W, IRS 5, IRS 10 W, and IRS 21 that have been suggested to be young, massive stars that form bow-shocks through their interaction with the ISM. Their nature has impeded accurate determination of their orbital parameters. We aim at establishing their nature and kinematics to test whether they form part of the clockwise disk. We performed NIR multi-wavelength imaging using adaptive optics (AO) and sparse aperture masking (SAM). We introduce a new method for self-calibration of the SAM PSF in dense stellar fields. The emission mechanism, morphology and kinematics of the targets were examined via 3 D bow-shock models. We confirm previous findings that IRS 21, IRS 1 W, and IRS 5 are bow-shocks created by the interaction between mass-losing stars and the interstellar gas. The nature of IRS 10 W remains unclear. Our modeling shows that the bow-shock-emission is caused by thermal emission while the scattering of stellar light does not play any significant role. IRS 1 W appears to be a bow-shock produced by an anisotropic stellar wind or by locally inhomogeneous ISM density. Our best-fit models provide an estimate of the local proper motion of the ISM in the NA in agreement with the published models. Assuming that all of the sources are tied to SgrA*, their orbital planes were obtained via a Monte-Carlo simulation. Our orbital analysis suggests that they are not part of any of the clockwise disk. We thus add more evidence to recent findings that {{a large part of the}} massive stars show apparently <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> orientations.

40|$|The DEEP 2 {{project will}} obtain redshifts for ~ 60, 000 galaxies between z~ 0. 7 - 1. 5 in a comoving volume of 7 10 ^ 6 Mpc/h^ 3 for an LCDM universe. The survey will map four {{separate}} 2 by 0. 5 degree strips of the sky. To study the expected clustering, we have constructed mock galaxy catalogs from the GIF Virgo Consortium simulations. We present two- and three-point correlation analyses of these mock galaxy catalogs to test {{how well we}} will measure these statistics {{in the presence of}} selection biases which will limit the surface density of galaxies which we can select for spectroscopy. We find that neither the two-point nor three-point correlation functions are significantly compromised. We {{will be able to make}} simple corrections to account for the small amount of bias introduced. We quantify the expected redshift distortions due to <b>random</b> <b>orbital</b> velocities of galaxies within groups and clusters on small scales of ~ 1 Mpc/h using the pairwise velocity dispersion sigma_ 12 and galaxy-weighted velocity dispersion sigma_ 1, which we are able to measure within ~ 10 %. We also estimate the expected large-scale coherent infall of galaxies due to supercluster formation (``Kaiser effect''). From this measure we will be able to constrain beta to within ~ 0. 1 at z= 1. For the DEEP 2 survey we will combine the correlation statistics with galaxy observables such as spectral type, morphology, absolute luminosity, and linewidth to measure the relative biases in different galaxy types. Here we use a counts-in-cells analysis to measure sigma_ 8 as a function of redshift and determine the relative bias between galaxy samples based on absolute luminosity. We expect to measure sigma_ 8 to within 10 % and detect the evolution of relative bias with redshift at the 4 - 5 sigma level. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures, to be published in PAS...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 While {{anti-vibration}} gloves are widespread {{as a form}} of reducing employee exposure to hand-arm vibration (HAV) there is concern about how effective they actually are in a real manufacturing environment with specific tools. Currently ISO 10819 is used to certify gloves as "anti-vibration"; however, the standard only tests a static position and force which may not accurately represent a gloves ability to reduce vibration exposure during specific tasks. The aims of this study are to examine 4 different types of gloves and see how effective they are at reducing vibration exposure in employees performing a specific workplace task. The first hypothesis tested {{is whether or not the}} gloves are different from the bare hand measurements. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in vibration exposure when a glove is used. The second hypothesis evaluated is whether a difference can be observed between the gloves themselves. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the gloves. To determine the validity these two hypotheses, vibration exposure during a sanding task will be examined. The third hypothesis tested is whether the subjects' perception of vibration reduction with the gloves matches the actual measured results. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between subject perception and the measured results. This was done with a questionnaire given to the subjects asking them to rate the perceived vibration and rank the gloves in order of most effective to least. A jitterbug-style <b>orbital</b> <b>sander</b> was mounted with a tri-axial accelerometer while the subject had another tri-axial accelerometer attached to the back of their hand and both were connected to the same data logger so that simultaneous measurements of both accelerometers could be taken. In a randomly assigned order the subject used each of the four gloves to take one minute samples from sanding both a vertical and a horizontal surface. The same was done for a barehanded measurement where the subject used no glove, also randomly assigned in the order. A ratio from the tool and hand samples was found for each glove to find the transmissibility factor. The gloved transmissibility factors were then compared to that subject's bare hand sample to find the corrected transmissibility of the glove. The results differed depending on which surface was used. On the horizontal surface there was not a significant difference between the gloves and the bare hand, but if the sample size would have been larger then there likely would have been. There was a significant difference between gloves; one of the gloves was found to amplify vibration exposure. On the vertical surface there was no difference between the gloves and the bare hand or between the gloves themselves. The subject rankings of the gloves did not closely resemble the actual results. According to this study, ISO 10819 may not accurately depict a glove's ability to mitigate vibration for specific tasks. The use of {{anti-vibration gloves}} may also be an ineffective way to try to reduce employee exposure to high levels of vibration...|$|R
40|$|For single-lined spectroscopic {{binary stars}} (sbi), the mass ratio q = Msec=Mprim is {{calculated}} from the mass function f(m), which is determined from observations. For statistical investigations of the mass-ratio distribution, the term sin^ 3 i, that remains in the cubic equation from which q is solved, has to be dealt with. This paper compares the common practise of taking an average value for sin^ 3 i to a deconvolution scheme {{that takes into account}} the precise (expected) behaviour of P(sin^ 3 i) d sin^ 3 i. The behaviour of P(sin^ 3 i) d sin^ 3 i depends on how orbital planes of binary stars are oriented in space. For a <b>random</b> orientation of <b>orbital</b> planes, Pi(i) di = sini di. For the average value method, it is generally assumed that Pi(i) di = (4 /pi) sin^ 2 i di. For verication purposes, the deconvolution scheme is applied to an observed sample of double-lined spectroscopic binary systems (sbii), and to a synthetic sample of sbi systems, produced by a numerical model. In both cases, the scheme produces better results with the assumption that Pi(i) di = (4 /pi) sin^ 2 i di, rather than a purely <b>random</b> orientation of <b>orbital</b> planes. In the case of the synthetic sample of sbi systems, the deconvolution scheme does not produce better results than the method that assumes an average value for sin^ 3 i. Application of the deconvolution method to the double-lined spectroscopic binary systems in the Eighth Catalogue of the Orbital Elements of Spectroscopic Binary Stars, provides results which are compatible with the assumption that the orbital planes of these systems are oriented randomly in space...|$|R
40|$|Migration of protoplanets {{in their}} gaseous host disks may be largely {{responsible}} for the observed orbital distribution of extrasolar planets. Recent simulations have shown that the magnetorotational turbulence thought to drive accretion in protoplanetary disks can affect migration by turning it into an <b>orbital</b> <b>random</b> walk. However, these simulations neglected the disk’s ionization structure. Low ionization fraction near the midplane of the disk can decouple the magnetic field from the gas, forming a dead zone with reduced or no turbulence. Here, to understand the effect of dead zones on protoplanetary migration, we perform numerical simulations of a small region of a stratified disk with magnetorotational turbulence confined to thin active layers above and below the midplane. Turbulence in the active layers exerts decreased, but still measurable, gravitational torques on a protoplanet located at the disk midplane. We find a decrease of two orders of magnitude in the diffusion coefficient for dead zones with dead-to-active surface density ratios approaching realistic values in protoplanetary disks. This torqu...|$|R

To a limiting magnitude of K~ 16, 9 of 10 stars in the central 0. 4 arcsec, and 13 of 17 stars out to 0. 7 arcsec from the central black hole have spectral properties of B 0 -B 9, main sequence stars. [ [...] . ] all brighter early type stars have normal rotation velocities, similar to solar neighborhood stars. We [ [...] . ] derive improved 3 d stellar orbits for six of these S-stars in the central 0. 5 arcsec. Their orientations in space appear <b>random.</b> Their <b>orbital</b> planes are not co-aligned {{with those of the}} two disks of massive young stars 1 - 10 arcsec from SgrA*. We can thus exclude [ [...] . ] that the S-stars as a group inhabit the inner regions of these disks. They also cannot have been located/formed in these disks [ [...] . ]. [ [...] . ] we conclude that the S-stars were most likely brought into the central light month by strong individual scattering events. The updated estimate of distance to the Galactic center from the S 2 orbit fit is Ro = 7. 62 +/- 0. 32 kpc, resulting in a central mass value of 3. 61 +/- 0. 32 x 10 ^ 6 Msun. We happened to catch two smaller flaring events from SgrA* [ [...] . ]. The 1. 7 - 2. 45 mum spectral energy distributions of these flares are fit by a featureless, red power law [ [...] . ].
