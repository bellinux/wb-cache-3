5|$|Taiko {{performance}} is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, {{such as in}} the 1512 encyclopedia called the Taigensho, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist WilliamP. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{styles of}} play have {{recently}} emerged, pushing {{the bounds of}} what the gandingan was traditionally used for. One type of play called kulndet requires players to perform highly dense, complicated <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> upon the gandingan. This type of play unlike the olden (kamamatuan) style of gandingan playing requires assistants to hold the gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound. Because of the strenuous type of play, male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity, considered a sign of masculinity, on the gandingan. During a gandingan contest, two expert gandingan players (pagagandings) would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other. This type of play {{is said to have}} evolved from the spread of virtousic style on the agung.|$|E
40|$|Prosodic {{constraints}} play {{a fundamental}} role during both spoken sentence comprehension and silent reading. In Chinese, the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> of the verb-object (V-O) combination {{has been found}} to rapidly affect the semantic access/integration process during sentence reading (Luo and Zhou, 2010). <b>Rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> refers to the combination of words with different syllabic lengths, with certain combinations disallowed (e. g., [2 + 1]; numbers standing for the number of syllables of the verb and the noun respectively) and certain combinations preferred (e. g., [1 + 1] or [2 + 2]). This constraint extends to the situation in which the combination is used to modify other words. A V-O phrase could modify a noun by simply preceding it, forming a V-O-N compound; when the verb is disyllabic, however, the word order has to be O-V-N and the object is preferred to be disyllabic. In this study, we investigated how the reader processes the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> and word order information by recording the reader’s eye-movements. We created four types of sentences by crossing <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> and word order in compounding. The compound, embedding a disyllabic verb, could be in the correct O-V-N or the incorrect V-O-N order; the object could be disyllabic or monosyllabic. We found that the reader spent more time and made more regressions on and after the compounds when either type of anomaly was detected during the first pass reading. However, during re-reading (after all the words in the sentence have been viewed), less regressive eye movements were found for the anomalous <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern,</b> relative to the correct pattern; moreover, only the abnormal <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern,</b> not the violated word order, influenced the regressive eye movements. These results suggest that while the processing of <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> and word order information occurs rapidly during the initial reading of the sentence, the process of recovering from the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> anomaly may ease the reanalysis processing at the later stage of sentence integration. Thus, <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> in Chinese can dynamically affect both local phrase analysis and global sentence integration during silent reading...|$|R

5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a part of each grade level to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns.</b> They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school in the sixth grade, students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music. In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music {{in other areas of the}} curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes.|$|E

25|$|The Harana and Kundiman {{are popular}} lyrical songs {{dating back to}} the Spanish period, and are customarily used in {{courtship}} rituals. The Harana is rooted in the Mexican-Spanish tradition and based on the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> of the habanera. The Kundiman, meanwhile, has pre-colonial origins from the Tagalophone parts of the country, uses a triple meter rhythm, and is characterised by beginning in a minor key and shifting to a major one in the second half.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the 20th century brought a {{development}} in the handling of tonality, harmony, rhythm and meter towards more freedom. Until that time, rigid harmonic schemes had forced <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> to stay fairly uncomplicated. Around {{the turn of the}} century, however, harmonic and metric devices became either more rigid, or much more unpredictable, and each approach had a liberating effect on rhythm, which also affected ballet. Diaghilev was a pioneer in adapting these new musical styles to modern ballet. When Ravel used a 5/4 time in the final part of his ballet Daphnis and Chloe (1912), dancers of the Ballets Russes sang Ser-ge-dia-ghi-lev during rehearsals to keep the correct rhythm.|$|E

25|$|Although neural {{oscillations}} {{in human}} brain activity are mostly investigated using EEG recordings, {{they are also}} observed using more invasive recording techniques such as single-unit recordings. Neurons can generate <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> of action potentials or spikes. Some types of neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies, so-called resonators. Bursting is another form of rhythmic spiking. Spiking patterns are considered fundamental for information coding in the brain. Oscillatory activity can also be observed {{in the form of}} subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (i.e. in the absence of action potentials). If numerous neurons spike in synchrony, they can give rise to oscillations in local field potentials. Quantitative models can estimate the strength of neural oscillations in recorded data.|$|E
25|$|In 1930–32, the spectacularly {{innovative}} and hard-to-use Rhythmicon {{was developed by}} Léon Theremin {{at the request of}} Henry Cowell, who wanted an instrument which could play compositions with multiple <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns,</b> based on the overtone series, that were far too hard to perform on existing keyboard instruments. The invention could produce sixteen different rhythms, each associated with a particular pitch, either individually or in any combination, including en masse, if desired. Received with considerable interest when it was publicly introduced in 1932, the Rhythmicon was soon set aside by Cowell and was virtually forgotten for decades. The next generation of rhythm machines played only pre-programmed rhythms such as mambo, tango, or bossa nova.|$|E
25|$|Cowell's {{interest}} in harmonic rhythm, {{as discussed in}} New Musical Resources, led him in 1930 to commission Léon Theremin to invent the Rhythmicon, or Polyrhythmophone, a transposable keyboard instrument capable of playing notes in periodic rhythms proportional to the overtone series of a chosen fundamental pitch. The world's first electronic rhythm machine, with a photoreceptor-based sound production system proposed by Cowell (not a theremin-like system, as some sources incorrectly state), it could produce up to sixteen different <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> simultaneously, complete with optional syncopation. Cowell wrote several original compositions for the instrument, including an orchestrated concerto, and Theremin built two more models. Soon, however, the Rhythmicon would be virtually forgotten, remaining so until the 1960s, when progressive pop music producer Joe Meek experimented with its rhythmic concept.|$|E

25|$|Although {{children}} perceive <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> {{in their}} native language at 7–8 months, they {{are not able to}} reliably distinguish compound words and phrases that differ only in stress placement, such as ‘HOT dog’ vs. ‘hot DOG’ until around 12 years of age. Children in a study by Vogel and Raimy (2002) were asked to show which of two pictures (i.e., a dog or a sausage) was being named. Children younger than 12 years generally preferred the compound reading (i.e., the sausage) to the phrasal reading (the dog). The authors concluded from this that children start out with a lexical bias, i.e., they prefer to interpret phrases like these as single words, and the ability to override this bias develops until late in childhood.|$|E
25|$|It was in Mexico that Nancarrow did {{the work}} {{for which he is}} best known today. He had already written some music in the United States, but the extreme {{technical}} demands of his compositions required great proficiency in the performer, which resulted in there being only rare satisfactory performances. That situation did not improve in Mexico's musical environment. There being few musicians available who could perform his works, his need to find an alternative way of having his pieces performed became pressing. Taking a suggestion from Henry Cowell's book New Musical Resources, which he bought in New York in 1939, Nancarrow found the answer in the player piano, with its ability to produce extremely complex <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> at a speed far beyond the abilities of humans.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Wurlitzer {{released}} an electro-mechanical drum machine called the Side Man, {{which was the}} first-ever commercially produced drum machine. The Side Man {{was intended as a}} percussive accompaniment for the Wurlitzer organ range. The Side Man offered a choice of 12 electronically generated, predefined rhythm patterns with variable tempos. The sound source was a series of vacuum tubes which created 10 preset electronic drum sounds. The drum sounds were 'sequenced' by a rotating wiper arm with contact brushes on it that swept around a phenolic panel with corresponding contacts arranged in a pattern of concentric circles across its face; these were spaced in certain patterns to generate parts of a particular rhythm. Combinations of these different sets of rhythms and drum sounds created popular <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> of the day, e.g. waltzes, fox trots etc. These combinations were selected by a rotary knob {{on the top of the}} Side Man box. The tempo of the patterns was controlled by a slider that increased the speed of rotation of the wiper arm. The Side Man had a panel of 10 buttons for manually triggering drum sounds, and a remote player to control the machine while playing from an organ keyboard. The Side Man was housed in a mahogany cabinet that contained the sound-generating circuitry, amplifier and speaker.|$|E

40|$|Serotonin:acetyl {{coenzyme}} A N-acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 5) Activity in pineal gland was assayed in rats {{which were}} born and raised under diurnal lighting conditions, in continuous darkness, or in constant light. N-Acetyltransferase activity in the pups raised under diurnal lighting showed a <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern,</b> with high enzyme activity during dark period. The pups raised in continuous darkness also showed a <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern,</b> the phase of which was delayed by 8 hr in 7 -week-old pups; the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase began in the evening in 12 -day-old pups and was regularly delayed by 1 hr every week. The pups raised in constant illumination also showed a rhythmic pattern; the rhythmic phase was delayed by 3 hr every week. When the mother rats were coupled in darkness and maintained in darkness during pregnancy and after the pups were born, their pups again showed a <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern.</b> These observations indicate that the biological clock for N-acetyltransferase is generated independently of environmental lighting.
