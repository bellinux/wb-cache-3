40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{specific}} test of Boucher, Carter et al. (2008) framework on risk <b>rationing.</b> The data were collected through a survey of 730 farm households in Shaanxi province conducted in November 2010. We compare factor associated with risk <b>rationed,</b> quantity <b>rationed</b> and price <b>rationed</b> farmers. Seemingly unrelated regressions are performed using risk <b>rationing,</b> quantity <b>rationing</b> and price <b>rationing</b> measure as the dependent variable and measures of demography, wealth, income, year of farming and risk aversion as independent variables. We apply seemingly unrelated regression, cluster analysis and cross tabulation in the study. According to a seemingly unrelated regression, we find existing risk <b>rationing</b> is due to risk-based behavior by borrowers. A cross tabulation results support the proposition by Boucher, Carter et al showing the financial wealthy is risk <b>rationed</b> and relatively land-poor is risk <b>rationed.</b> This paper is believed to be among the first empirical validation of the risk <b>rationing</b> theory.

In the war the government banned ice cream and <b>rationed</b> sweets, such as chocolates and confections; sweets were <b>rationed</b> until 1954.

Businesses, including Western Union, have been reported paying employees with these coupons, and even auctions have been transacted in this currency. As with much Zimbabwe currency, printing standards are crude and counterfeiting is rampant; the RBZ has been dissuading this widespread use.|$|E

Approximately 5000 years ago, workers in the city of Uruk (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers in beer. During the building of the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt, each worker got a daily <b>ration</b> of four to five litres of beer, which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.|$|E
40|$|This note {{investigates the}} {{standard}} Bertrand-Edgeworth duopolistic competition {{in which two}} firms sell a homogenous good and have an identical capacity constraint. We examine three firstcome, first-served <b>rationing</b> rules: a) high-to-low <b>rationing</b> where customers arrive in decreasing order of willingness to pay, b) proportional <b>rationing</b> where customer arrivals are independent of willingness to pay, and c) low-to-high <b>rationing</b> where customers arrive in increasing order of willingness to pay. The third <b>rationing</b> rule is new and analyzed here the first-time. Unlike the high-to-low and the proportional <b>rationing</b> rules, the low-to-high <b>rationing</b> rule has no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. There exists however a symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium. Since the low-to-high <b>rationing</b> rule leads to less competitive outcomes, firms can reduce the degree of price competition by influencing the order of customer arrivals.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple spatial equilibrium {{model for a}} linear monocentric city to investigate the effects of <b>rationing</b> and pricing on morning commuters' travel cost and modal choice behavior in each location. Under <b>rationing</b> and pricing, {{every day in the}} morning peak hour, each commuter is classified as either "free" or "rationed". "Free" commuters are allowed to use the highway without paying the toll, whereas "rationed" commuters can avoid the toll only if they travel by transit. Each day, a fraction of commuters are <b>rationed</b> in their free use of the highway, and the <b>rationing</b> fractions are determined systematically so that everyone is equally <b>rationed</b> in a given period. It is found that Pareto-improving <b>rationing</b> and pricing scheme might be obtained as a combination of the <b>rationing</b> degree and the toll associated with <b>rationing.</b> Extension to the <b>rationing</b> and pricing scheme with cordon and park-and-ride service has been made. Cordon and park-and-ride might help in improving the efficiency of <b>rationing</b> and pricing strategy although remains its Pareto-improving property.

In this chapter, I explain why credit <b>rationing,</b> more specifically <b>rationing</b> of loan applicants, does exist in a competitive market with imperfect information, and occurs only for low-risk loan applicants. In cases of indivisible investment technologies, low-risk applicants are <b>rationed.</b> In cases of divisible investment technologies, <b>rationing</b> of loan size is restricted to <b>rationing</b> of loan applicants. In the event that the difference in the marginal return between the investment technologies is sufficiently small relative to the difference in their riskiness, <b>rationing</b> of loan size alone yields high opportunity costs; in addition, low-risk loan applicants are <b>rationed</b> in this case...|$|R

50|$|Healthcare <b>rationing</b> can {{be defined}} {{in one of two}} ways. Economically defined, {{healthcare}} <b>rationing</b> is simply limiting health care goods and services to only those who can afford to pay. In the United States this type of <b>rationing</b> affects about 15% of the population, who are either too poor to afford care or unwilling to buy care or simply uninsured. Defined by regulatory means, healthcare <b>rationing</b> involves restricting health care goods and services from even those who can afford to pay. This form of <b>rationing</b> would affect 85% of the American population. This second type of healthcare <b>rationing</b> is unfamiliar to most Americans.|$|R
50|$|Wartime <b>rationing</b> continued, and was for {{the first}} time {{extended}} to bread in order to feed the German civilians in the British sector of occupied Germany. During the war, the government had banned ice cream and <b>rationed</b> sweets, such as chocolates and confections; all sweets were <b>rationed</b> until 1954. Most people grumbled, but for the poorest, <b>rationing</b> was beneficial, because their <b>rationed</b> diet was of greater nutritional value than their pre-war diet.

30|$|Credit <b>rationing</b> may be {{investigated}} at two stages: {{the first stage}} is loan quantity <b>rationing</b> and the second stage is loan size <b>rationing.</b> In the first stage, credit is granted to a group or an individual who is selected as creditworthy borrower while others are rejected as unworthy borrowers. In the second stage, borrowers get a smaller amount of loan than they desire (Baydas et al. 1994). Boucher et al. (2009) found five categories of borrowers in credit market: a) unconstrained borrowers or price <b>rationed</b> borrowers, b) unconstrained non-borrowers or price <b>rationed</b> non-borrowers, c) quantity <b>rationed</b> borrowers, d) risk <b>rationed</b> borrowers, and e) transaction cost <b>rationed</b> borrowers Table  1. In nature, unconstrained borrowers are not affected with credit limit by FIs. On the other hand, unconstrained non-borrowers {{are not interested in}} FIs loan although they are not affected by the credit limit. Again, the following three types of <b>rationed</b> borrower: quantity, risk, and transactional cost are non-price <b>rationed</b> borrowers (Boucher et al. 2009). The borrowers who apply to FIs for a loan but obtain either lower amount of loan than they desire or rejected are quantity <b>rationed</b> borrowers. Finally, the borrowers who voluntarily withdraw themselves from the credit market due to the risk associated with collateral and high transaction cost of the loan are risk and transaction cost <b>rationed</b> borrowers. If an SME faces any of these three aforesaid forms of non-price <b>rationed</b> is considered as credit constrained borrower. Mostly, If SMEs are able to provide collateral; FIs allow credit even if uncertainty involves the firms in the credit arrangement.|$|R

50|$|<b>Rationing</b> {{was applied}} only to people {{employed}} in the state-owned industries and to their family members. Such social categories as people without political rights known as lishentsy were deprived of <b>rations.</b> The <b>rationing</b> system was divided into four rates that differed {{in the size of}} <b>rations,</b> with lower rates unable to get such basic products as meat and fish.
