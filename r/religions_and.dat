5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism.

To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world <b>religions</b> <b>and</b> give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{studies have}} {{identified}} significant links between <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> spirituality and health. The reasons for these associations, however, are unclear.

The authors highlight recent advances in the delineation of <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> spirituality concepts and measures theoretically and functionally connected to health. They also point to areas for growth in <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> spirituality conceptualization and measurement. Through measures of <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> spirituality more conceptually related to {{physical and mental health}} (e. g., closeness to God, religious orientation and motivation, religious support, religious struggle), psychologists are discovering more about the distinctive contributions of religiousness and spirituality to health and well-being.
