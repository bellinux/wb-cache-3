40|$|Although {{the screw}} conveyor, {{operating}} on a free surface, {{has been used for}} years as <b>reclaim</b> and storage equipment in mammoth silos, there is no documented knowledge about its spill characteristics. Research at Delft University of Technology together with ESI Eurosilo B. V. on the inclined use of the <b>reclaim</b> screw to achieve homogenization in mammoth silos made this lack of knowledge apparent. This paper presents the results of experiments to gain insight into the spill during <b>reclaiming.</b> Experiments were conducted <b>reclaiming</b> a horizontal surface and up- and downwards along an inclined surface, using a free-flowing bulk material. A relationship was found between the theoretical and effective fill ratio. This relationship shows a certain maximum effective fill ratio and a dependence on the reclaim-depth. As expected, the effective fill ratio drops quickly when <b>reclaiming</b> upwards, mostly due to flow- and throwback: the fill is spilled behind the screw blades and over the axis. Unexpectedly, the effective fill ratio also decreases when <b>reclaiming</b> downwards due to a shift of material towards the non-reclaiming side where it is left behind forming ridges on the surface. It is expected that all three mechanisms will cause less spill when <b>reclaiming</b> a cohesive material. The experiments provide the desired insight into spill mechanisms during <b>reclaiming.</b> Indeed, the inclined use of the <b>reclaim</b> screw to achieve homogenization is thought feasible when <b>reclaiming</b> downwards...|$|R
40|$|Semiconductor circuit {{manufacturers}} require two {{qualities of}} crystalline silicon wafers: prime and <b>reclaim.</b> <b>Reclaim</b> wafer may {{consist of a}} silicon substrate with semiconductor components implanted and/or diffused into one wafer surface. <b>Reclaiming</b> then involves removing the layers and portions of the underlying wafer.

The process has serious disadvantages such as environmental hazards and chemical exposure to the population. It is unsuitable for removing surface layers from large diameter wafers (6 inches and more). A mixture of nitric acid (NHO 3) and hydrofluoric acid (HF) is one of the etching compositions used for the reclamation of silicon wafers.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to demonstrate that <b>reclaim</b> water can meet drinking water standards and can be used as an additional source of water and help California meet its demand. But first we must show there is no significant difference between the quality of <b>reclaim</b> water and drinkable water right after <b>reclaim</b> water has been processed in addition to no significant difference between the quality of <b>reclaim</b> water and drinkable water after both waters have been stored for three months. To make this determination I must first select the sampling areas, where they process the <b>reclaim</b> water, obtain permission to test the water at the treatment plant and at the points of use, locate a laboratory that can process the samples and have the ability to analyze the data. While analyzing the data it was determined that <b>reclaim</b> water does meet drinking standards when tested at the treatment plants. However results also indicated regrowth of bacteria at the point of use. This would ultimately cause the <b>reclaim</b> water to fail and not allow <b>reclaim</b> water to be used as drinking water.

Although {{designed to provide a}} more cost effective and flexible means of meeting emissions targets than command and control methods, critics of <b>RECLAIM</b> assert that {{emissions trading}} programs create uneven distributions of harmful toxic emissions due to the overall increase in emissions at facilities that are accumulating emission credits.
