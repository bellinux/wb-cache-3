40|$|Diagnosing {{pregnancy}} in {{dairy cattle}} {{is an essential}} part of good management. The objective of this procedure is not to identify pregnant cows, but to identify the nonpregnant cows, those that become the breeding challenge. Economics dictate that verifying the pregnancy or "open" status of the cow is essential. Estimated losses of $ 1 to $ 3 per cow per day when conception is delayed beyond 85 days postpartum emphasize the importance of inseminating cows early to allow for 12 to 13 -month calving intervals. A number of diagnostic tools are available and increasing scientific knowledge and technology will provide for improved pregnancy diagnosis in the future through use of cowside tests. These available procedures include: 1) continuous detection of estrus to identify inseminated cows that <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> 18 to 24 days post breeding (repeat heats); 2) palpation of the uterus and its contents per rectum (sometime after day 35 of suspected pregnancy depending on the expertise of the clinician); 3) radioimmunoassays (RIA) of progesterone in milk, blood serum, and plasma; and 4) enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) for progesterone in milk, blood serum, and plasma.

40|$|A serologic {{survey was}} {{conducted}} among 76 sows randomly selected from a single farrow-to-finish swine herd, located on the Ibiúna municipality, state of São Paulo, Brazil, to investigate associations between Leptospira spp. seropositivity and reproductive performance. For detection of anti-leptospires antibodies, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was carried out using live cultures of 22 pathogenic and two saprophytic Leptospira spp. serovars. Questionnaires with open and closed questions were administered to {{the manager of the}} herd for collection of information about the sows included in the study and the reproductive performance of the subsequent offspring. The following variables were evaluated: age of sows, total number of piglets born, number of piglets born alive, number of weak piglets, number of weaned piglets, number of mummified fetuses, number of stillbirths, mass of piglets at birth, mass of piglets at weaning, weaning to service interval (WSI), and occurrence of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat,</b> mummified fetuses and stillbirths. The frequency of seropositivity for at least one Leptospira spp. serovar was 18. 4 %.

40|$|In practice, the {{etiologic}} {{treatment of}} the repeat-breeder cow is nearly infeasible. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a combined treatment would benefit the conception rate of repeat-breeder cows. The components of this regimen target ovulation defects, late progesterone (P 4) rise, and premature luteolysis. In a 5 -year period, 402 repeat-breeder cows were divided in five groups, and treatment regimens consisted of the following: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; Group 1, n = 115, 0. 012 mg buserelin im 4 to 6 h before artificial insemination); P 4 (Group 2, n = 5 1, 100 mg P 4 intravaginally, on Days 5 to 7); meloxicam (Group 3, n = 31, 0. 5 mg kg(- 1), 24 h(- 1) meloxicam sc, on Days 16 to 18); GnRH + P 4 + meloxicam (Group 4, n = 98); and no treatment (Group 5, control, n = 107). Artificial insemination was conducted only after overt estrus; thereafter, {{the duration of the}} estrous cycle was assessed in all cows that were detected to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat.</b> The conception and pregnancy rate was compared among groups. The proportion of cows that returned to estrus after artificial insemination did not differ among groups; the duration of estrous cycle was the shortest in Group I and the longest in Group 4. In Group 4, pregnancy rate was higher (P < 0. 05) than that of Groups I and 5 (35. 71 % vs. 20. 00 % and 17. 76 % for Groups 4, 1, and 5, respectively), but though numerically higher, it did not differ statistically from that of Groups 2 (27. 45 %) and 3 (22. 58 %).

40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} to develop a treatment protocol that will shorten the length of estrous cycle in mated goats those fail to conceive, without reduction in conception rate. In experiment 1, ninety goats (single parity, 1 &# 189; to 2 years age) were divided into nine groups of ten goats each. On <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat,</b> all groups were mated barring groups 1, 3 and 4. On days 3 - 5 of estrous, progesterone was treated at the dose rate of 10 mg i. m (groups 3, 5 and 7) or 30 mg i. m. (groups 4, 6 and 8). Groups 7, 8 and 9 received estradiol (500 &# 956;g i. m.; day 8) + oxytocin (10 IU i. m.; day 9) treatment. Following treatments, the goats were observed for heat and appearance of embryonic vescicles (EV) by transabdominal ultrasonography. In experiment 2, group 2 (n= 50) was equal to group 8 of experiment 1 and group 1 (n= 50) served as control. The litter size and weight was recorded at birth. Early progesterone treatment significantly (P< 0. 05) shortened the cycle length in groups 3 (day 15) and 4 (day 17) respectively compared to control (group 1; 21 days), whereas mated group 5 and 6 {{did not have any}} difference in conception rate compared to control (group 2). In does of group 5 & 6, EVs were observed much earlier than group 2. Estradiol + oxytocin treatment had no effect on conception rate of group 8, while does of group 7 and 9 returned to heat on day 12. In experiment 2, significant difference in conception rate and percentage of single, double, triplet and quadruplet born was observed between control and treated groups while the mean litter weight born was non-significant. Thus early pregnancy diagnosis can be done at by progesterone + estrogen treatment that not only shortens the length of estrous cycle, if the animals fail to conceive, but also improves the conception rate.

Forty ewes and 40 rams ranging in weight and age between 16 ¿ 20 kg and 14 ¿ 15 months respectively were fed a teff straw basal diet and supplemented with two levels of Sesbania (0, and 95 % of supplementary protein provided by Sesbania and the rest being provided by concentrates) for 7 months. In experiment 1 (mating period), 4 paired female¿male groups (diet of the male with or without Sesbania, and diet of the female with or without Sesbania) consisting of 20 animals each were formed and assigned for mating. Ewes that were mated and did not <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> in subsequent cycles during the 70 days mating period continued in experiment 2 receiving similar supplementary diets (concentrate alone or Sesbania) for the study of pregnancy and lambing.

Except semen concentration, the other seminal characteristics were not significant (P < 0. 05) between treatments. The average oestrus cycle length was 19 ± 4. 6 days. Mean progesterone profile for cycling ewes on the day of oestrus was 0. 4 ± 0. 04 and ranged between undetectable levels to 0. 75 ng/ml followed by a rise starting on day 4 (1. 7 ± 0. 16 ng/ml) through day 7 (2. 5 ± 0. 29 ng/ml) and day 10 (3. 6 ± 0. 47 ng/ml) to a peak of 3. 9 ± 0. 45 ng/ml (plateau phase) on day 14. Supplementation with Sesbania improved the proportion of ewes conceived by 17 % over supplementation with concentrates. The average birth weight of lambs, and post partum dam weight of ewes was 1. 97 kg and 18. 6 kg respectively and differed significantly (P < 0. 05) between treatments.

40|$|Summary. The {{influence}} of vascular connections between uterine horn and adjacent ovary on {{the function of}} the CL was investigated in twenty-four Welsh Mountain ewes. Normal luteal regression occurred in ten out of ten ewes in which all connections between the uterus and ovarian pedicle were severed except the middle uterine vein. The CL was maintained in four out of ten ewes in which the middle uterine vein alone was ligated and divided. In those ewes which <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat,</b> a tubal arcade of veins anastomosing between the uterine and ovarian veins was noted. Division of these anastomotic veins in addition to the middle uterine vein inhibited luteal regression in six out of seven ewes.
