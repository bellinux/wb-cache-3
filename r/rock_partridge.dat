Although chamois is registered as least concern in IUCN's red list, the subspecies balcanica numbers some thousands of individuals and its populations {{are believed to be}} declining. According to the Hellenic Ornithological Society mount Tymfi along with the neighbouring mountain Smolikas are important regions for breeding birds of prey, alpine and forest dwelling bird species. The Egyptian vulture, short-toed snake eagle, rufous-tailed rock-thrush breed in the region, whereas species such as the golden eagle, red-billed chough, <b>rock</b> <b>partridge,</b> alpine chough, wallcreeper, white-winged snowfinch and the alpine accentor are sedentary. Alpine reptilian and amphibian species are also present. Vipera ursinii lives in the mountain's subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus Alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the mountain, mostly in and around Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area.|$|E

2500|$|Birds: The {{reserve is}} home to 200 species of birds, of which 19 are {{considered}} rare at the national level. More than 22 species have been confirmed to be resident, the rest are migratory or rare visitors, {{and at least two}} or three species have been introduced. The reserve holds a combination of birds found in Europe, Africa, and Asia which include: chukar (Alectoris chukar), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), blackbird (Turdus merula), common raven (Corvus corax), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), shore lark (Eremophila alpestris), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), common chaffinch, (Fringilla coelebs), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis). [...] Two species at least have been introduced to the shouf area for hunting and expanded their range into the reserve, the two species are: <b>rock</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris graeca), and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). The reserve is also home to many species of birds of prey such as: griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).|$|E
2500|$|In {{generally}} warmer {{areas of}} the Eurasian continent, the diverse pheasant family replaces the grouse as the significant group of birds in the golden eagle's diet. Across the range, pheasants make up 5.7% of the diet of this species. Unlike grouse, pheasants are not known to comprise {{more than half of}} the nest remains in any study, but they can be important nonetheless. This is especially true in Spain, where most studies show that the pheasants at 22.8-28.7% of the diet, mainly the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), are the second most prominent prey species after the European rabbit, with the red-legged partridge and the rabbit collectively making up to more than 90% of the prey remains in several nests there. The red-legged species, along with the <b>rock</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris graeca) and grey partridge (Perdix perdix), are the leading prey group in the French Pyrenees at 15.8% of a sampling of 114 from 10 nests. In Hungary, the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) appears to be the favored prey species, making up 26.6% of the prey of a sampling of 49 from 4 nests there. In Japan, the copper pheasant (Syrmaticus soemmerringii) is the second most common single prey species, making up 17.8% of the remains (sample size of 967 from 5 nests). In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, the most common bird species (and third most common overall prey species) is the chukar (Alectoris chukar), representing 19.5% of a sampling of 468 from 36 nests. Chukar and Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) are reportedly the primary avian prey species in Armenia. In the Himalayan region, two very large pheasants, the Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) and the Himalayan snowcock (Tetraogallus himalayensis), are reportedly among the most significant prey for eagles. Moorland francolin (Scleroptila psilolaemus) were reportedly the most common bird prey species in Ethiopia's Bale Mountains, comprising 10% among a sample size of 49 at 4 nests. North America has fewer native pheasants species but introduced species such as grey partridge, ring-necked pheasant and, especially, chukar are readily hunted (native quail seem to be largely or entirely ignored as prey by golden eagle, perhaps because of their small size or dense thicket-dwelling habits). The chukar is the most significant bird species in the diet in Nevada (at 5.4%) and the second most significant bird species in Washington state (at 11.8%). One native North American “pheasant” known to be occasionally hunted is the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), the largest species of galliform. The golden eagle is the only major avian predator of adult turkeys. The hunting techniques used on pheasants are probably similar to those used for grouse. Pheasants hunted by golden eagles are also similar in size in grouse. Alectoris sp. weigh around [...] and medium-sized species weighing around [...] Snowcock will often weigh , whereas the female and male adult turkey weigh around [...] and , respectively. On a wildlife monitoring camera in Tennessee, a golden eagle was filmed assaulting an adult turkey, appearing to use a “contour flight with short glide attack” but the quarry in this case appears to successfully avoid the strikes by running and then ultimately flying away. Breeding pairs of eagles have been known to hunt turkeys cooperatively.|$|E
2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl may hunt {{at least}} 300 species of bird. In Europe, {{the most common}} avian prey species are the {{normally}} feral or domestic [...] rock pigeons (Columba livia), although the [...] common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) can be locally even more significant. In the Netherlands, the common wood pigeon {{is the most important}} prey species, making up 37.3% by number and 38.3% by biomass. Yet another, smaller study of the Netherlands found the rock pigeon to be the primary prey species. In a dietary study from Luxembourg, the common wood pigeon was the most frequent prey species, making 19% of the remains by number. A study from Romania listed the rock pigeon was the second most frequently recorded prey behind only the Romanian hamster and the largest contributed of biomass. Unusually, in the Netherlands, birds were the primary food in both number (77.6%) and biomass (72%). Also, in Luxembourg, eagle-owls hunted birds in general were more regularly than mammals, as nearly 70% of prey remains there were avian. At least six other species of pigeon and dove have also been recorded as prey. However, perhaps the most significant contributor of prey at the family level is the corvids. The [...] carrion crow (Corvus corone) is the second most widely recorded avian prey species in Europe and, locally, good numbers are also taken of [...] hooded crow (Corvus cornix), [...] western jackdaws (Corvus monedula), [...] Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), [...] common ravens (Corvus corax), [...] rooks (Corvus corone), two species each of magpie and chough and the [...] spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), in rough descending order of reportage in the eagle-owl’s diet. In Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the carrion crow was the most frequently recorded bird among an exceptionally diverse recorded prey base including than 65 bird species there (although birds only comprised 27% of the prey numbers overall). Unlike smaller passerines, corvids roost in numbers in relatively open spots, which make them fairly vulnerable to a predator as stealthy and powerful as the eagle-owl. [...] More than 17 species of gamebirds have been recorded in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet but they are normally taken in small numbers. There are, however, exceptions. In one study conducted in lower Austria, the most frequently identified prey species was the [...] grey partridge (Perdix perdix), which is the most widely reported gamebird prey for eagle-owls in Europe. One study of a “primeval” forested region of Finland found various grouse species to be the most significant contributor of biomass, namely in descending order the [...] western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the [...] black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the [...] hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). In inland areas of Norway, the large forest grouse were also significant biomass contributors. The same forest grouse species were also found to be significant to diet along the Pechora River in Russia. Other gamebirds can be important secondary prey species in different parts of Europe: the [...] red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) in western Europe, the [...] <b>rock</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris graeca) and the [...] rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) in alpine highlands, the [...] ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) in eastern Europe and the [...] willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in the sub-Arctic zone. In Turkey, the most significant prey by number was the [...] chukar (Alectoris chukar), comprising 20.5% of remains. A Korean study in two habitat types (forest and field) found that ring-necked pheasants were the main prey species, making up an average of 19.33% by number and 34.81% by biomass. Other birds of prey are perhaps second only to pigeons and corvids amongst avian contributors to the diet (their ecological relationships with eagle-owls are explored in more detail below).|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} made in order to {{determine}} the growth and life strength characteristics of <b>rock</b> <b>partridges</b> (A. Graeca) in intensive breeding conditions. The study was initiated with 354 chicks, which hatched recently and proceeded with 317 chicks after 4 th week when chicks were separated into groups within the cage and on the ground 182 chicks were placed in the ground system (1098 cm 2 /partridge) while 135 chicks were placed in the cage system (1060 cm 2 /partridge) {{in order to determine}} the effects of intensive breeding methods on growth and life strength characteristics. Chick growing feed was used until 16 th week to feed the partridges and then egg-laying chicken feed was used in order to feed the female partridges. Feeding was made ad libitum during the study. While no significant difference could be observed between the average animal weights in ground and cage groups until 11. week, the differences in 11., 12., 14., 15. weeks (P< 0. 05) and 13. week (P< 0. 01) were considered to be significant. In the 16 th week of breeding, the weights were measured as 435. 76 g and 445. 61 g respectively, which show a significant difference between ground and cage groups (P< 0. 05). In weeks 20, 23, 27 and 32, the average weights of the female <b>rock</b> <b>partridges</b> in ground groups were significantly more than the weights of the female <b>rock</b> <b>partridges</b> in the cage groups (P< 0. 01).
