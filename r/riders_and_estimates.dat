40|$|Cooperation between <b>rider</b> <b>and</b> {{horse is}} of major {{importance}} in equitation. A bal-anced team of horse <b>and</b> <b>rider</b> improves (sport) performances and welfare aspects by decreasing stress, frustration, risks of injuries, and accidents. Important features affecting the cooperation are the physical skills, knowledge, and {{personality of the}} rider {{on one hand and}} the temperament, experience, and physical abilities of the horse on the other. A study with 16 <b>riders</b> <b>and</b> 16 warm-blood riding horses tested the effect of personality of <b>riders</b> <b>and</b> temperament of horses on cooperation between <b>riders</b> <b>and</b> horses. More emotionally reactive horses showed more evasive behavior during riding. Riders preferred to ride those horses who were assessed by the riders as being attentive to the rider’s aid. The frequency of evasive behaviors during riding—as assessed by riders, in contrast to the assessments made by an external judge—influenced the cooperation between <b>rider</b> <b>and</b> horse. On average, a rider’s personality did not affect the cooperation between <b>rider</b> <b>and</b> horse; however, it is suggested that a rider’s personality does affect the cooperation with more emotionally reactive horses.
