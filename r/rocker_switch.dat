25|$|Nearly all mice {{now have}} an {{integrated}} input primarily intended for scrolling on top, usually a single-axis digital wheel or <b>rocker</b> <b>switch</b> which can also be depressed {{to act as a}} third button. Though less common, many mice instead have two-axis inputs such as a tiltable wheel, trackball, or touchpad.|$|E
25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} trim to connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection {{on each side of}} the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a <b>rocker</b> <b>switch.</b> The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks utilized flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light.|$|E
2500|$|A {{landmark}} {{year for}} Jim Marshall was 1987. It marked 25 {{years in the}} amplifier business and 50 years in music. This was celebrated {{with the release of}} the Silver Jubilee series of amps. The Silver Jubilee series consisted of the 2555 (100 watt head), 2550 (50 watt head) along with other 255x model numbers denominating various combos and even a [...] "short head". The Jubilee amps were heavily based on the JCM800s of the time, featuring a very similar output section along with a new preamp. Their most publicised feature was the half-power switching, which is activated by a third <b>rocker</b> <b>switch</b> next to the standard [...] "power" [...] and [...] "standby" [...] switches. On the 50-watt model this was reflected in the numbering – 2550 is switchable from 25 to 50 watts – and also reflected Marshall amps' 25th anniversary and Jim Marshall's 50 years in music. The amps were trimmed in silver covering, and had a bright silver-coloured faceplate, along with a commemorative plaque.|$|E

50|$|Panels are {{typically}} standard sized (Australian or European standard size) wall switch plates, {{but instead of}} normal <b>rocker</b> <b>switches,</b> they have buttons of various designs, usually with an indicator LED inside.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of running}} mains voltage to the switches, a low voltage—typically 24 V AC—is {{connected}} to remote momentary toggle or <b>rocker</b> <b>switches.</b> The momentary switches usually have SPDT contacts in an (ON)-OFF-(ON) configuration. Pushing the switch actuator {{in one direction}} causes the relay contacts to close; pushing it {{in the opposite direction}} causes the relay contacts to open. Any number of additional <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> can be wired in parallel, as needed in multiple locations. An optional master control can be added that turns all lights in the facility on or off simultaneously under the control of a timer or computer.|$|R

5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{design to}} the toggle switch is the <b>rocker</b> <b>switch.</b> Large switches of this design are {{commonly known as}} [...] "decorator style" [...] in the United States. Switches of this design sit almost flush with the wall plate, and are activated by [...] "rocking" [...] a flat, broad lever, rather than pushing a short protruding actuator up or down.|$|E
5000|$|The Fidget Cube {{is a small}} {{handheld}} device (known as a fidget toy) designed by Antsy Labs. It has sensory tools on all sides: a <b>rocker</b> <b>switch,</b> gears, a rolling ball, a small joystick, a spinning disc, a [...] "rubbing stone", and 5 buttons. The cube is intended to provide {{an easy way to}} occupy one's hands and other senses, particularly for self-soothing.|$|E
50|$|For a short time, Australian <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> were {{exported}} to the United States in the 1980s. Although the switches had adequate ratings for usage on 120 V circuits and had advantages of compactness and distinctive appearance, {{they failed to}} establish themselves in the American market.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Ford {{offered the}} Highway Pilot Speed Control Option, with {{steering}} wheel pad mounted <b>rocker</b> <b>switches,</b> on its Thunderbird. Uniquely, the Thunderbird also lightly applied {{the brakes and}} illuminated the stop lamps when the Retard was continuously depressed with the cruise control on, but not engaged.|$|R
50|$|New {{seats were}} fitted which allowed the fitment of head restraints, as {{required}} by U.S. law beginning in 1969. The interior and dashboard were also redesigned; <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> that met US health and safety regulations were substituted for toggle switches. The dashboard switches also lost their symmetrical layout.|$|R
50|$|The {{keyboard}} power-on key {{will not}} start up a Quadra 605 {{as there is}} no soft power-on. Only the <b>rocker</b> <b>switch</b> at the back will turn a Quadra 605 on or off. Pressing the power-on key while booted is the same as selecting the Shut Down command in the Finder, and once a Quadra 605 has completed its shutdown process it will prompt the operator to manually turn it off.|$|E
50|$|The {{protein is}} thought {{to act like a}} <b>rocker</b> <b>switch.</b> It opens toward the {{extracellular}} space so that leucine and sodium ions can enter and bind to it. After that, LeuT undergoes a conformational change that releases both particles into the inside of the cell. Two sets of alpha helices are thought to perform the rocking action by directly changing its shape after the binding of the amino acid to the structure.|$|E
5000|$|The lens {{has both}} manual and power zoom (via a <b>rocker</b> <b>switch),</b> useful for smooth zoom motion during videography. Focusing is quiet. The lens has Panasonic's [...] "nano surface coating" [...] for {{increased}} contrast and reduced flare. The {{front of the}} lens neither extends nor rotates, beneficial for polarized filters. The 46mm thread diameter allows sharing of filters with the Panasonic 14mm, 20mm, 25mm, 45mm, and Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2 lenses.|$|E
50|$|Thirty-seven {{tracks were}} {{sustained}} or repeatedly percussive {{notes in the}} timbre of a particular instrument and were played through a standard three-octave piano-style keyboard with the right hand; twenty-one were of a live band or soloist playing chords in different keys arranged per the circle of fifths, specifically B-flat, F, C, G, D, A and E major, minor, and diminished and were played with the left hand in much {{the style of a}} chord organ or accordion. The remaining five were assigned to <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> above the chord buttons and featured (depending on the disc in question) percussion, sound effects, introductions, vamps, and endings synchronized with the chord buttons. Pushing upward on the <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> locked them in place for use with percussion; pushing downward allowed momentary use for vamps, introductions and endings.|$|R
50|$|RailDriver {{includes}} the basic throttle, reverser, and brake levers as separate control handles that mimic generic operation of real locomotive controls. Frequently used switches for lights, sand, bell, and whistle are also included, with programmable switches for other frequently used functions. For operations such as camera movement the RailDriver has a four-way pan pad with zoom <b>rocker</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Austin America {{was sold}} in the US, Canada and Switzerland between 1968 and 1972. This two-door version of the car {{featured}} a [...] 1275 cc engine. Various modifications were made to suit the US market including an [...] "anti-pollution air injection system", a split circuit braking system, <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> in place {{of some of the}} dashboard mounted knobs, a [...] "hazard warning system" [...] and flush door locks.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to new controls for D-Mode and cruise control, several controls are different. There's a new rocker {{on the left}} hand grip that controls the heated grips and which page is displayed on the information panel; which function the rocker provides is controlled by a trigger switch near the left forefinger. The stop/run rocker is now stop/run/start with the last position being momentary; the hazard flasher button is where the starter button was previously located. A similar <b>rocker</b> <b>switch</b> for headlight control provides high/low/flash controls.|$|E
50|$|A {{multi-function}} sleep/wake button {{is located}} {{on the top of the}} device. It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls phone calls. When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail. Situated on the left spine are the volume adjustment controls. The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a <b>rocker</b> <b>switch,</b> which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons.|$|E
5000|$|The dimensions, {{mechanical}} designs, {{and even}} the general appearance of light switches changes slowly with time. They frequently remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when {{a portion of a}} house is rewired. It is not unusual to see century-old light switches still in functional use. Manufacturers introduce various new forms and styles, {{but for the most part}} decoration and fashion concerns are limited to the face-plates or wall-plates. Even the [...] "modern" [...] dimmer switch with knob is at least four decades old, and in even the newest construction the familiar toggle and <b>rocker</b> <b>switch</b> appearances predominate.|$|E
5000|$|Band Box - This {{predecessor}} to {{the modern}} drum machine recreated rhythms from a simple foxtrot to a bossa nova, with individual percussion instruments added by the organist via <b>rocker</b> <b>switches.</b> These individual instruments had the aforementioned Repeat Percussion feature allowing {{the sound of a}} drum roll or maracas. They also had their own individual triggers, allowing the organist to recreate rimshots, cymbal crashes and even the pop and fizz of a champagne bottle either via buttons on the control panel, at the lower manual or at the pedal board ...|$|R
5000|$|The P400S Miura, {{also known}} as the Miura S, made its {{introduction}} at the Turin Motorshow in November 1968, where the original chassis had been introduced three years earlier. It was slightly revised from the P400, with the addition of power windows, bright chrome trim around external windows and headlights, new overhead inline console with new <b>rocker</b> <b>switches,</b> engine intake manifolds made 2 mm larger, different camshaft profiles, and notched trunk end panels (allowing for slightly more luggage space). Engine changes were reportedly good for an additional [...]|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Lincoln {{added two}} <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> on the {{steering}} wheel to activate various cruise control functions on the Continental and Continental Mark IV. In 1988, Pontiac offered a steering wheel with 12 buttons controlling various audio functions on the Trans-Am, 6000 STE and Bonneville. In the 1990s, a proliferation of new buttons began to appear on automobile steering wheels. Remote or alternate adjustments could include vehicle audio, telephone, and voice control navigation. Often scroll wheels or buttons are used to set volume levels or page through menus, change radio stations or audio tracks. These controls can use universal interfaces, wired or wirelessly.|$|R
