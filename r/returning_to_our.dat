They also announced {{that they would be}} working with Chris Goss, who performed with Masters of Reality as a supporting act the same evening. On 11 May 2011, it was announced that the Cult were signed to Cooking Vinyl Records, who will release the new album in early 2012. Commented guitarist Billy Duffy: [...] "We are very much looking forward to <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> U.K. roots in many ways working with Cooking Vinyl." [...] Vocalist Ian Astbury added, [...] "We look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Cooking Vinyl." [...] By May 2011, the band had been writing and recording new demos at its Witch Mountain studio hideaway in the Hollywood Hills, and began recording their new album at Hollywood Recording Studios. In October 2011, bassist Chris Wyse stated the album was almost finished and expected to be released in April 2012. Chris also described it as a [...] "Zep/Stooges mix of energy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hart and Honore, {{in their}} famous work Causation in the Law, also tackle {{the problem of}} 'too many causes'. [...] For them, there are degrees of causal contribution. [...] A member of the NESS set is a [...] "causally {{relevant}} condition". [...] This is elevated into a [...] "cause" [...] where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. [...] So, <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> hunter example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a [...] "cause". [...] On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated {{to the status of}} [...] "cause". [...] An intermediate position can be occupied by those who [...] "occasion" [...] harm, such as accomplices. [...] Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal {{to the scene of the}} crime. [...] Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a [...] "cause" [...] (on the but for or NESS test). [...] So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. [...] However the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). [...] Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. [...] They consider that once something is a [...] "but for" [...] (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a question of policy.|$|E
