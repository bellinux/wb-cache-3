5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony.

5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. Primarily for this reason, it was picked by the Air Force as {{the winner of the}} ATF in April 1991. Following the selection, the first YF-22 was retired to a museum, while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it to the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> antenna test vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{was cast}} in the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alien who preys on men in Scotland in Jonathan Glazer's science fiction movie Under the Skin (2013).

It was released to generally positive reviews, with particular praise for Johansson.

It earned Johansson a BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film nomination.|$|E
5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> apex predator in the Haţeg Island ecosystem. The robust anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the jabiru) are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up to the size of a human), including hatchling or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, has similarly been suggested to be raptorial.|$|E
