5000|$|The {{females of}} many breeds of {{domestic}} ducks are unreliable at sitting their eggs and raising their young. Exceptions include the <b>Rouen</b> <b>duck</b> {{and especially the}} Muscovy duck. It has been a custom on farms for centuries to put duck eggs under broody hens for hatching; nowadays this role is often played by an [...] However, young ducklings rely on their mothers for a supply of preen oil to make them waterproof; a chicken hen does not make as much preen oil as a female duck, and an incubator makes none. Once the duckling grows its own feathers, it produces preen oil from the sebaceous gland near the base of its tail.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Carcass {{and meat}} quality traits of three breeds of duck which include Rouen, Pekins and Muscovy were investigated. A total of thirty-six matured ducks with twelve ducks from each breed {{were used for}} the study in a 3 × 2 (breed×sex) {{factorial}} arrangement in a completely randomized design. The ducks were slaughtered in batches of six, properly bled, defeathered and dressed. The ducks were chilled at 2 °C for 24 h immediately after dressing, prior to cutting up into primal cuts. Samples for cooking loss, shear force and taste panel evaluations were taken from the breast portion. The dressing percentage was highest in the Muscovy duck with values of 71. 18 and 69. 75 % for male and female respectively while the least value of 65. 28 % was obtained from the female <b>Rouen</b> <b>duck.</b> The male Muscovy ducks gave the highest absolute values (p 0. 05) sex effect in the Rouen breed. The moisture content of duck meat evaluated ranged from 72. 69 (female Muscovy) to 76. 72 % for female Rouen ducks. Apart from the male Pekin duck that gave the highest (p 0. 05). Shear force values of 2. 15 and 2. 30 kg/cm were obtained from the male and female Rouen ducks 3 respectively while higher values of 2. 64 and 3. 41 kg/cm were given by both male and female Pekin ducks. 3 The highest shear force value (3. 91 kg/cm) was obtained from the female Muscovy duck.

50|$|According to The Backyard Duck Book, the {{pedigree}} {{and status of}} the breed are controversial, and animals of the breed are sometimes {{not allowed to be}} shown. The duck could, though, be a domesticated hybrid of the <b>Rouen</b> Clair <b>duck</b> and Mallard duck.|$|R
5000|$|The breed {{was first}} raised in France, {{but it was}} not until it reached England in the 19th century that it was refined into the breed {{recognized}} as the Rouen today. The French version resembled a larger than average Mallard, but by selective breeding the British developed the exhibition-type Rouen. The final product was a bird with a deep, long keel, boat-shaped profile, enormous appearance and refined markings, especially the penciling on the female. It was used chiefly as a roasting bird; though it produced 35 to 125 eggs a year, there were other breeds which were more reliable egg-layers with higher production. The eggs are typically white, but can have blue and green tints. Exhibition-typed <b>Rouen</b> <b>ducks</b> have been known to crush their eggs if allowed to set due to their massive frames. In 1861, Mrs Beeton said of it: ...|$|R
50|$|The most {{profound}} {{impact of the}} Indian Runners was {{on the development of}} the modern 'light duck' breeds. Before 1900, most ducks were bred for the table. Aylesbury and <b>Rouen</b> <b>ducks</b> were famous throughout the nineteenth century, and these were supplemented or replaced, after 1873-74, by importation from China of the Pekin duck. As soon as the Indian Runners became fashionable, a demand for egg-layers and general purpose breeds developed. Using Runners crossed to Rouens, Aylesburys and Cayugas (the large black American breed), William Cook produced his famous Orpington Ducks. Mrs Campbell crossed her fawn-and-white Runner <b>duck</b> to a <b>Rouen</b> drake to create the Campbell ducks introduced in 1898. Later, she introduced wild mallard blood and managed to create the most prolific egg-layer, the Khaki Campbell (announced in 1901). Other breeds followed, some of which emerged as direct mutations of the Khaki Campbell, along with crosses back to Indian Runners, the most famous being the Abacot Ranger (known in Germany as the Streicher) and the Welsh Harlequin. Currently there are eight varieties of Indian Runner recognized with the American Poultry Association. They are, in order of recognition, Fawn & White, White Penciled, Black, Buff, Chocolate, Cumberland Blue and Gray.|$|R

50|$|The plumage {{coloring}} of {{both the}} Rouen drake and the Rouen hen are nearly identical {{to that of the}} Mallard drake and Mallard hen. The Mallard color pattern is referred to as gray. Males have green heads, white collars, black tail coverts and dark, ashy brown tail feathers, a gray body, and a deep claret breast. The female Rouen hens are a consistent shade of mahogany brown, with a brown crown and tan eye-stripes extending from bill {{to the back of the}} eyes. Another feature of the female color pattern is the distinct, detailed penciling found on feathers of the head, neck, body, body, most of the wing and tail. Rouen hens can be much darker brown than Mallard hens. Both sexes also have blue speculum feathers. However, Rouen speculum feathers are brighter in color and larger in size than that of the Mallard. Adult <b>Rouen</b> <b>ducks</b> are typically significantly larger than Mallard <b>ducks.</b> The <b>Rouen</b> duckling is identical to the Mallard duckling in terms of plumage coloring. In North America, two distinct types are bred: the common, or production-bred, variety that is larger than a Mallard but has a typical duck conformation, and the much larger and squarer standard-bred variety. The production variety normally weighs 6 - 8 lbs (2.7 - 3.6 kg) while the standard-bred weighs 9 - 12 lb (4.1 - 5.4 kg).|$|R
50|$|Adult Campbell ducks weigh {{approximately}} 3-5 pounds. Campbells {{can come}} in three color varieties: khaki, dark and white. They are a cross between Mallard, <b>Rouen</b> and Runner <b>ducks.</b> The Khaki Campbell drake is mostly khaki colored with a darker head usually olive green lacking the white ring of its Mallard ancestors. The Khaki Campbell duck has a more modest plumage of Khaki covering {{the entirety of the}} body. Despite popular misconceptions of skittish or flightly behavior Campbells are a very gentle, passive and friendly breed when raised by hand until maturity. They are a good breed for young families and children to raise.|$|R
60|$|From these {{considerations}} there {{can hardly be}} a doubt that the wild duck is the parent of the common domestic kind; nor need we look to other species for the parentage of the more distinct breeds, namely, Penguin, Call, Hook- billed, Tufted, and Labrador ducks. I will not repeat the arguments used in the previous chapters on the improbability of man having in ancient times domesticated several species since become unknown or extinct, though ducks are not readily exterminated in the wild state;--on some of the supposed parent-species having had abnormal characters in comparison {{with all the other}} species of the genus, as with Hook-billed and Penguin ducks;--on all the breeds, as far as is known being fertile together (8/10. I have met with several statements on the fertility of the several breeds when crossed. Mr. Yarrell assured me that Call and common ducks are perfectly fertile together. I crossed Hook-billed and common ducks, and a Penguin and Labrador, and the crossed Ducks were quite fertile, though they were not bred inter se, so that the experiment was not fully tried. Some half-bred Penguins and Labradors were again crossed with Penguins, and subsequently bred by me inter se, and they were extremely fertile.);--on all the breeds having the same general disposition, instinct, etc. But one fact bearing on this question may be noticed: in the great duck family, one species alone, namely, the male of A. boschas, has its four middle tail-feathers curled upwardly; now in every one of the above-named domestic breeds these curled feathers exist, and on the supposition that they are descended from distinct species, we must assume that man formerly hit upon species all of which had this now unique character. Moreover, sub-varieties of each breed are coloured almost exactly like the wild duck, as I have seen with the largest and smallest breeds, namely <b>Rouens</b> and Call <b>ducks,</b> and, as Mr. Brent states (8/11. 'Poultry Chronicle' 1855 volume 3 page 512.), is the case with Hook-billed ducks. This gentleman, as he informs me, crossed a white Aylesbury drake and a black Labrador duck, and some of the ducklings as they grew up assumed the plumage of the wild duck.|$|R
