5|$|Swann takes Bond to L'Am√©ricain, a {{hotel in}} Tangier, and they {{discover}} that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's operations base at a massive crater in the Sahara. Taking a train to a <b>remote</b> <b>station,</b> Bond and Swann have an encounter with Hinx that sees the assassin killed, and are eventually escorted to Oberhauser's base. There, Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has been funding the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counter-act investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father Hannes became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father and staged his own death, adopting the name Ernst Stavro Blofeldgoing on to form Spectre and targeting Bond. Bond and Swann overpower him and escape, destroying the base in an explosion and leaving Blofeld to die.|$|E
500|$|Darling's deeds as a cricketer had {{reconciled}} {{his father}} to his sporting endeavours, but not to his sports store operation. In 1900, his father purchased [...] "Stonehenge", a sheep station covering [...] in central Tasmania and ordered Darling to run the property on pain of exclusion from his will. Darling complied with his father's wishes and moved his family to the <b>remote</b> <b>station,</b> [...] along a dirt track from the nearest town, tiny Oatlands.

2500|$|On 23 January 2007, the KC-767 {{flight test}} {{aircraft}} set a program milestone by making its first hookup with a receiver aircraft, a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The [...] "dry contact" [...] transferred no fuel, but {{was intended to}} test the tanker's fifth-generation fly-by-wire telescoping boom. Unlike the KC-135 boom operator, who is prone, the KC-767 operator uses a <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> with a video display. The testing was being done at Edwards Air Force Base, and the test aircraft was destined for Italy once testing was complete.|$|E

60|$|One of these, {{a gentleman}} of good birth and repute, {{actually}} went on smoking and gurgling his hookah when the Bishop was beginning family prayers, apparently {{with no more}} perception that it was anything that concerned him than if {{he had seen a}} Mahometan turning to Mecca, or a Parsee saluting the rising sun. Indeed many of these Company's servants had been sent out when fourteen or fifteen years old; and, if in a <b>remote</b> <b>station,</b> had been left without anything external whatever to remind them of Christianity.|$|E
60|$|Within {{the same}} {{sentiment}} is the germ of intellectual growth, which obeys the same law. Those who {{are capable of}} humility, of justice, of love, of aspiration, stand already on a platform that commands the sciences and arts, speech and poetry, action and grace. For whoso dwells in this moral beatitude already anticipates those special powers which men prize so highly. The lover has no talent, no skill, which passes for quite nothing with his enamoured maiden, however little she may possess of related faculty; and the heart which abandons itself to the Supreme Mind finds itself related to all its works, and will travel a royal road to particular knowledges and powers. In ascending to this primary and aboriginal sentiment we have come from our <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> on the circumference instantaneously to the centre of the world, where, as in the closet of God, we see causes, and anticipate the universe, which is but a slow effect.|$|E
6000|$|The parcel had a longish {{excursion}} on its {{own account}} after that. The carriage in which it lay {{happened to be a}} [...] "through one," [...] and belonged to another company, to whose line it was accordingly forwarded on the following Monday. It reached a <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> in the west of England that night and there the parcel was discovered. It lay all night there, and next day was forwarded to the lost-luggage office of that line. Here it was examined; the various pieces of paper were unrolled one by one and the doubled-up slipper was discovered; this was examined, and the little parcel found; the name of Durby having been noted and commented on, the covering of note-paper was removed, and the match-box revealed, from the inside of which was produced the pill-box, which, when opened, disclosed to the astonished gaze of the officials an antique gold ring set with diamonds! As the name [...] "Mrs Durby" [...] written in pencil did not furnish a clue to the owner, the ring was given into the charge of the custodier of the lost-luggage office, and a description of it with a note of all particulars regarding it, was forwarded to the Clearing-House in London.|$|E

5000|$|Important Note: This [...] "double hop" [...] (one {{wireless}} hop {{from the}} main station to the <b>remote</b> <b>station,</b> and a second hop from the <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> to the wireless client console) is not necessarily twice as slow. End to end latency introduced here is in the [...] "store and forward" [...] delay associated with the <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> forwarding packets. In order to accurately identify the true latency contribution of relaying through a wireless <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> vs. simply increasing the broadcast power of the main station, more comprehensive tests specific to the environment would be required.|$|E
50|$|One example: The tiny unincorporated {{village of}} Beebe Plain, {{divided by the}} Quebec-Vermont border, is served by +1-819-876 Rock Island, Quebec, Canada (a <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> {{controlled}} from Magog) and +1-802-873 Derby Line, Vermont, USA (a <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> controlled from St. Johnsbury). Magog and St. Johnsbury are both a long-distance call from anywhere in Beebe Plain, even though Canadian subscribers can place local calls to Sherbrooke, US subscribers can locally call Newport and an international call within the village is local. An LIR assignment which follows network topology places the Canadian <b>remote</b> <b>station</b> in Magog's LIR, not Sherbrooke's LIR.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 16, 1986 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Nevada Test Site Seismic Network, {{designed}} {{and operated by}} EG&G Energy Measurement, Inc. for Sandia National Laboratories, consists of five <b>remote</b> <b>stations</b> and one control point station. The system converts analog signals from five seismometers at each station to digital signals and multiplexes the data with status information for transmission over voice-grade telephone circuits to the control point at the Nevada Test Site. Intelligent modems provide automatic line equalization, transmission link diagnostics, and loopback testing. A microprocessor at the <b>remote</b> <b>stations</b> periodically refreshes the seismometer system gain settings to ensure data accuracy. The <b>remote</b> <b>stations</b> operate unattended and receive commands for setup and status check from the control point. The control point station utilizes a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) LSI- 11 / 23 to perform event detection on the five data streams and automatically records up to ninety minutes of event data per station. Planned upgrades include replacing the LSI- 11 / 23 with a DEC MicroVAX-II and implementing dialup capability to verify station status...|$|R
