It was hypothesized that <b>role</b> ambiguity would predict both <b>role</b> acceptance and <b>role</b> satisfaction, and <b>role</b> acceptance and <b>role</b> satisfaction would predict both team cohesion and athlete satisfaction. Participants included 180 female soccer players from Division I, II, and III schools. Measures included the <b>Role</b> Perception Scale, a <b>Role</b> Acceptance and <b>Role</b> Satisfaction measure, the Group Environment Questionnaire, and the Athlete Satisfaction Questionnaire. Stepwise MR analysis showed that <b>role</b> ambiguity regarding <b>role</b> evaluation was predictive of <b>role</b> satisfaction, and <b>role</b> ambiguity regarding scope of responsibilities was predictive of <b>role</b> acceptance. Stepwise MR also showed <b>role</b> satisfaction to be the only predictor of athlete satisfaction with regard to leadership as well as the only predictor of team cohesion with regard to individual attractions to the group-task...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Stress {{is often}} {{described}} as the result of demands exceeding resources. This is particularly evident in professional careers where women managers balance work, family, and significant travel in addition to their existing repertoire. Women Executives today have to deal with various types of <b>Role</b> Stress which in turn has a negative impact on their <b>Role</b> Efficacy. This paper has explored the types of <b>role</b> stress faced by women executives, and also their coping ability with respect to <b>role</b> efficacy. It also examines how the different kinds of stress faced by the executives affect their <b>role</b> efficacy and the impact of <b>role</b> efficacy on <b>role</b> stress. It appears that women executives use <b>Role</b> Stress to increase their <b>Role</b> Efficacy and <b>Role</b> Efficacy leads to optimization of <b>Role</b> Stress. Nowa-days executives seem to be inundated with <b>Role</b> Stress which in turn has a negative impact on their <b>Role</b> Efficacy. If Executives become aware of means to enhance the various facets of <b>Role</b> Efficacy, {{they will be able to}} cope with <b>Role</b> Stress and use <b>Role</b> Stress as Eustress...|$|R

This study also attempts {{to determine whether there}} is any difference between <b>role</b> conflict and <b>role</b> ambiguity based on demographic factors such as age, gender, management group and duration of service in the army. Variables such as task satisfaction and <b>role</b> overload were also examined to determine their correlation with <b>role</b> conflict and <b>role</b> ambiguity. A total of 83 IT personnel including army officers and other ranks from selected army organisations within Kuala Lumpur were sampled. This study, which was conducted in 2005 employed survey method with questionnaires as instrument to collect the data. The data analysis supports the hypothesis regarding {{the existence of}} <b>role</b> conflict and <b>role</b> overload among IT personnel in the army service. However, the overall level of <b>role</b> conflict and <b>role</b> overload is low. There is significant difference of <b>role</b> conflict between age and gender.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} background for this exploratory study {{is drawn from}} two areas: (1) the social psychology of <b>role</b> distance and <b>role</b> distance behavior, and (2) the sociology of classroom behavior. An attempt is made to demonstrate that what has been theorized about <b>role</b> distance and <b>role</b> distance behavior does, in fact, take place in everyday life. The study concentrates on: (1) the circumstances in the classroom teaching situation under which both major and minor <b>role</b> distance occur, (2) the situational expressions of both true and false <b>role</b> distance behavior, (3) the dimensions along which <b>role</b> distance behavior develops among junior high school students, and (4) the distinctiveness of both varieties of <b>role</b> distance behavior among the patterns of activities {{of students in the}} classroom. [...] Two classrooms of a junior high school are selected for this investigation. A field design for the study of <b>role</b> distance and <b>role</b> distance behavior in the classroom is presented. It includes the operationalization of the concepts of <b>role</b> distance and <b>role</b> distance behavior, the procedures followed in gathering the data, and the methods used in analyzing it. [...] The findings clearly demonstrate the empirical viability of <b>role</b> distance and <b>role</b> distance behavior theory; hidden dimensions were discovered and new conceptual distinctions made. Minor <b>role</b> distance was found to be more prominent than major <b>role</b> distance, and true <b>role</b> distance behavior was enacted more often than false <b>role</b> distance behavior. Both types were enacted during general and specific class activities. The categories of momentary expression, recurrent expression, and extended expression are generated from the data collected regarding situational expressions of <b>role</b> distance behavior. [...] Several, though not all, of the preconditions of <b>role</b> distance behavior are found in behavior other than <b>role</b> distance behavior.
