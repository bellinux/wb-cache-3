5000|$|... 905 officially became {{exhausted}} in November 2005. All new {{central office}} prefixes are assigned in NPA 289, {{as there are}} no longer any available prefixes in 905. Part of the problem stemmed from the creation of [...] "megacities" [...] across Ontario {{at the turn of}} the millennium. Many of these enlarged cities are split between multiple <b>rate</b> <b>centres</b> which have never been amalgamated. The largest city in the NPA, Mississauga--the sixth-largest city in all of Canada--is split between five <b>rate</b> <b>centres,</b> even though it has been a single municipality since 1974. Another example is Hamilton; it is split between nine <b>rate</b> <b>centres.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Within most North American <b>rate</b> <b>centres,</b> local {{wireline}} {{calls are}} free, while calls {{to all but}} a few nearby <b>rate</b> <b>centres</b> are considered long distance and incur a per-minute toll.

5000|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, both 613 and 819 were close to {{exhaustion}} due to Canada's inefficient number allocation system. Every competitive local exchange carrier received blocks of 10,000 numbers in every <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> in which it planned to offer local service, no matter how small. A tiny unincorporated village (like Odessa, Ontario, with no telephone central office but still listed as a <b>rate</b> <b>centre)</b> usually received multiple 10,000 number blocks. Larger municipalities have multiple rate centres and multiple competing carriers in each. Ottawa, now one municipality, has 11 rate centres (plus portions of other rate centres primarily located beyond the city limits) - most with very similar local calling areas - which were never amalgamated. The [...] "Ottawa-Hull" [...] exchange only covers the area that was the city of Ottawa prior to the 2001 amalgamation, plus the former suburbs of Nepean (central part) and Vanier and small sections of other urban communities. Once a number is assigned to a <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> and CLEC, it is unavailable for use elsewhere, even in cases when a <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> has more numbers than it needs.|$|E
50|$|The 1998 split was {{intended}} as a long-term solution to a shortage of available numbers in Canada's second-largest toll-free calling zone. However within less than a decade 514 was close to exhaustion once again due to Montreal's rapid growth and Canada's inefficient system of number allocation. Unlike the United States, Canada does not use number pooling as a relief measure. Every competing carrier is given access to blocks of 10,000 numbers—corresponding to a single prefix—in every <b>rate</b> <b>centre,</b> no matter how small. This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers, a problem exacerbated by the proliferation of cell phones. While smaller rate centres normally don't need that many numbers, a number can't be allocated elsewhere once assigned to a CLEC and <b>rate</b> <b>centre.</b> Many larger cities have multiple rate centres which have never been amalgamated. Montreal is an exception; it is Canada's second-largest <b>rate</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Number pooling is not {{practiced in}} Canada. Every {{competing}} carrier is issued blocks of 10,000 numbers for every <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> where it offers service. Individual rate centres exist {{even in the}} smallest villages. Even tiny unincorporated villages receive multiple blocks of 10,000 numbers. Larger cities, particularly [...] "megacities" [...] created through amalgamations in the 1990s and early 2000s, have multiple rate centres which were not combined for years, if at all. For example, Mississauga, Canada's sixth-largest city, is split between five rate centres {{even though it has}} been a single municipality since 1974. Hamilton, the nation's ninth-largest city, is split between nine rate centres, while Ottawa is split between 11. Overlays became the preferred relief solution in Canada in part because {{it is not possible to}} reassign a number from a smaller <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> to a larger one, even when the smaller <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> has enough numbers to serve it. As mentioned above, by 2013 seven-digit dialling had been eliminated in all eight of Canada's original numbering plan areas.|$|E

50|$|Due to Canada's number {{allocation}} system, when a CLEC reserves one prefix {{for each}} of the island's six <b>rate</b> <b>centres</b> (including Montreal), it has the effect of reserving 60,000 numbers before enrolling its first subscriber.|$|R

5000|$|By October 1991, {{area code}} 905 had been {{assigned}} to relieve exchanges in the Greater Toronto Area—which, then as now, was Canada's largest toll-free calling zone. While the Golden Horseshoe's explosive growth would have made another area code necessary in any event, the timetable was significantly increased due to Canada's inefficient system of number allocation. Canada does not use number pooling as a relief measure. Each CLEC is assigned blocks of 10,000 numbers for every <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> where it plans to offer service, no matter how small. While most rate centres don't need nearly that many numbers, a number is unavailable for reassignment elsewhere once assigned to a CLEC and <b>rate</b> <b>centre.</b> This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers.|$|E
5000|$|... 514 {{had served}} the entire Montreal area for {{over half a}} century. However, by the mid-1990s {{it was on the}} verge of {{exhaustion}} due to Montreal's rapid growth and Canada's inefficient system of number allocation. All Canadian competitive local exchange carriers are allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers for every <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> where they plan to offer service, even in the smallest hamlets. Even though most rate centres don't need nearly that many numbers, a number can't be reallocated elsewhere once assigned to a carrier and <b>rate</b> <b>centre.</b> This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers. By the latter years of the 20th century, this made a second area code necessary in Canada's second-largest toll-free calling zone.|$|E

5000|$|The city of Mississauga is a {{sprawling}} half-million person suburb directly west of Toronto.

5000|$|Ten-digit {{dialling}} in 613 and 819 became mandatory on October 21, 2006. Intraprovincial {{calls from}} <b>rate</b> <b>centres</b> with no local calling beyond a small fragment {{of their own}} area code were returning intercept messages if dialled as seven digits. Exchange protection in the National Capital Region was ended, except for the [...] "dual dialability" [...] scheme for government numbers {{on both sides of}} the river.|$|R
50|$|Note: All {{central office}} codes reside within the <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> of Toronto.

50|$|While the 1997 split was {{intended}} as a long-term solution, 604 was close to exhaustion within three years due to Canada's inefficient number allocation system. Every competitive local exchange carrier in the country is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers for every <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> where it offers service, even for the smallest hamlets. Once a number is assigned to a carrier and <b>rate</b> <b>centre,</b> it cannot be moved elsewhere, even when it is in an area that does not need nearly as many numbers as a larger one. This has resulted in many wasted numbers. The problem was exacerbated in the Lower Mainland (and particularly the Vancouver area) because it is home to most of the province's landlines, as well as most of its cell phones.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, {{area code}} 639 was {{overlaid}} onto 306 as a workaround for Canada's inefficient system of number allocation. All competitive local exchange carriers in Canada are allocated exclusive access {{to at least}} one three-digit prefix - comprising 10,000 numbers each - for every <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> where they plan to offer service, even for the smallest hamlets. While each competing carrier does not necessarily need that many numbers in a particular market, unused numbers are unavailable for use elsewhere once assigned to a particular carrier and <b>rate</b> <b>centre.</b> Since number pooling is not used as a relief measure in Canada, this resulted in thousands of wasted numbers. The number shortage was exacerbated by the proliferation of cell phones and other mobile devices requiring unique telephone numbers, particularly in Regina and Saskatoon.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 the Canadian Numbering Administrator {{forecast}} {{that area}} code 204 would be exhausted {{within a few}} years, {{even though there are}} only 1.2 million people in the entire province. While an area code provides a maximum of 7.8 million numbers, Canada uses an allocation scheme which allots all 10,000 numbers of an entire central office prefix to competitive local exchange carriers even for the smallest hamlets, rather than implementing methods of number pooling. Once a number is allocated to a <b>rate</b> <b>centre,</b> {{it is not possible to}} reassign it elsewhere, even when a <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> has more than enough numbers to service it.

50|$|Toronto is {{the centre}} of the largest local calling area in Canada, and {{one of the largest in}} North America. As of 2013, the {{following}} points in area code 905 were a local call to +1-416 Toronto: Ajax-Pickering, Aurora, Beeton, Bethesda, Bolton, Brampton, Caledon East, Campbellville, Castlemore, Claremont, Georgetown, Gormley, King City, Kleinburg, Maple, Markham, Milton, Mississauga (<b>rate</b> <b>centres</b> Clarkson, Cooksville, Malton, Nobleton, Port Credit and Streetsville) Oak Ridges, Oakville, Palgrave, Richmond Hill, Schomberg, Snelgrove, South Pickering, Stouffville, Thornhill, Tottenham, Unionville, Uxbridge, Victoria and Woodbridge.

50|$|Overlays gained {{popularity}} among Canadian telephone {{companies in the}} early 2000s, primarily as a workaround for the country's inefficient number allocation system. Every competing carrier is issued blocks of 10,000 numbers, the maximum for each corresponding three-digit prefix, in each <b>rate</b> <b>centre</b> in which it offers new service and each local interconnection region in which it ports existing numbers. While most rate centres in Canada do not need nearly that many numbers to adequately service customers, a number cannot be reassigned elsewhere once assigned to a carrier and <b>rate</b> <b>centre.</b> This resulted in {{a large amount of}} unallocated numbers and the proliferation of cell phones, fax machines, pagers and dial-up Internet connections, particularly in larger markets, exacerbated this. Partly due to these factors, the numbering plan areas corresponding to four of the five largest Canadian markets (416 in Toronto, 514 in Montreal, 604 in Vancouver, and 403 in Calgary) were split in the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe spatial tuning {{function}} of the 8 Hz reversal Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) is frequently bimodal. This amplitude ‘notch’ largely disappears with 16 Hz pattern onset–offset (on–off) stimulation. To investigate the effect of temporal frequency on this phenomenon, we tested seven subjects using a range of <b>rates</b> <b>centred</b> on 8 Hz (reversal) and 16 Hz (on–off). With reversal, a deep notch was present at all temporal frequencies. A much shallower notch was evident with on–off. The on–off and reversal functions differed only in their low spatial frequency branches (below 4. 5 c deg− 1) where, as temporal frequency decreased, the reversal response was reduced by 50 %, whilst the on–off responses doubled in amplitude. Thus, although they behave differently with on–off and reversal, multiple spatial frequency mechanisms are evident with both forms of stimulation...|$|R
