Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's <b>retirement</b> <b>system</b> solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E

40|$|In multiple-pillar <b>retirement</b> <b>systems,</b> the {{government}} provision of old-age income support plays {{a very different}} role from vehicles for encouraging private retirement savings - and for {{the government}} regulation and insurance of private savings. Despite the diversity {{of public and private}} <b>retirement</b> <b>systems,</b> and despite their wealth and their potential impact on labor and capital markets, they are often overlooked in structural analyses of country problems and prospects. The author examines important institutional features of <b>retirement</b> <b>systems</b> in industrial and developing countries and outlines what is known about their economic effects. She also identifies ways in which public and private <b>retirement</b> <b>systems</b> affect economic adjustment, paying special attention to {{the costs and benefits of}} encouraging early retirement. She finds that a coherent plan for retirement reform must identify how much old-age income security is affordable, how the government and private sector can address failures in the private market to provide this security, and how these objectives can be attained given available financing mechanisms. The author finds evidence that many <b>retirement</b> <b>systems</b> will be forced to change a great deal in the next few decades. In some cases: retirement benefits will have to be reduced (perhaps by imposing a means test); the age for early retirement will have to be raised; multiple-pillar plans will have to be integrated and streamlined to rationalize work incentives; and incentives and opportunities for private saving will be increased. In any case, using high-cost long-term <b>retirement</b> <b>systems</b> to mitigate short- and medium-term unemployment problems will probably prove costly and inefficient as a solution to problems faced by economies in transition.
