40|$|Shaping of {{the surface}} {{roughness}} in <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> is much more complex compared to plunge grinding. What significantly influences the roughness of the machined surfaces in <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> is the dressing of the grinding wheel, grinding parameters, and {{the form of the}} grinding wheel wear in this proc-ess. The occurrence of wear steps on the active grinding wheel surface (AGWS) causes that the set-up depth of cut is split into the wheel’s different steps, which in turn is a reason of a varying roughness shaped by those steps. The surface-roughness model presented, which includes parameters of the grinding wheel dressing with the single point diamond dresser and grinding parameters, allows us to estimate the size of surface roughness in the process of <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} temperatures {{generated in the}} workpiece during profile and cylindrical <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> in the High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) regime. The HEDG regime takes large depths of cut at high wheel and workpiece speeds to create a highly efficient material removal process. This aggressive processing generates high temperatures in the contact zone between the wheel and workpiece. However, the beneficial contact angle and the rapid removal of the heated wheel – workpiece contact zone results in low temperatures in the finished surface. Temperatures in the ground surface can be predicted {{with knowledge of the}} specific grinding energy and the grinding parameters used. Specific grinding energies recorded at high specific material removal rates demonstrated a constant value of specific grinding energy dependent on cutting and contact conditions, improving accuracy of the predictive model. This was combined with a new approach to burn threshold modelling, which demonstrated an improved division of damaged and undamaged surfaces. Cutting and contact conditions in the grinding profile vary dependent on their position. This thesis shows how temperatures vary with location and estimates the partitioning of the heat flux to the regions of the grinding profile. This suggested a constant partitioning of energy to each of the three surfaces considered independently of specific material removal rates. Further a potential link was shown between the surface and the sidewall of the grinding profile, which allows temperatures in a secondary surface to be predicted given knowledge of that in the primary. Finally, the work has demonstrated the feasibility of the Superabrasive Turning process. Using small values of feed per turn and high workpiece feedrates promoted high values of removal rate with low depths of thermal penetration in the as ground surface.

40|$|We present recent {{advances}} in the modelling and simulation of Internal <b>Traverse</b> <b>Grinding,</b> a high performance grinding process incorporating {{a high rate of}} material removal combined with a high surface quality. Due to a special grinding wheel geometry, the latter two goals are achieved in just one pass of the tool through the axisymmetric workpiece. The simulation framework we present generally consists of three components. The first one is a parametric plane strain, h-adaptive finite element model capturing the material penetration of a single cBN grain on a meso-scale during the machining process. Secondly, a topography analysis procedure as well as a kinematic simulation have been developed to measure and analyse the surface topography of an actual grinding wheel. We then use this information to model the grinding wheel surface in the latter kinematic simulation. This enables us to perform an exact calculation of the transient penetration history of every grain intersecting with the workpiece bulk. The superposition of these results is then used in the third component of the simulation framework, namely a process scale workpiece model currently under development which captures the effects of thermo-mechanical loads on the workpiece undergoing material removal and thus, in the near future, shall enable us to predict potential unwanted phase transformations of the bulk surface as well as size and shape errors of the finished part.

40|$|Nowadays {{machining}} {{in manufacturing}} industry {{has become more}} competitive and demanding than ever before. Grinding {{as one of the}} last stages in the manufacturing process {{has been the focus of}} the research studies in the field of manufacturing for quite some time. Grinding process compared to the other machining operations involves in low rates of material removal. The thermal, metallurgical, and mechanical phenomena coupled with the grinding process, make the contact dynamics unpredictable and complicated; hence the grinding wheel life and cycle times cannot be determined from any available standard tables and charts. This is due to the fact that, a large number of parameters are influencing each other in a grinding process. During a grinding process there are undesirable experiences that can be included as thermal effects, chatter vibration, rapid grinding wheel wear, etc. In order to overcome these problems associated with the grinding process a correct understanding of the involving factors in the process is of great significance. This thesis work is focused on design and implementation of a bench scale plain type cylindrical grinding machine for grinding of the rolls in plunge and traverse cut in the laboratory environment. The servo controlled feed-drives and slide-way motions, which allow an efficient operation, are presented for each axis of the machine. Nonlinear friction effect as one of the major disturbances affecting the motion control systems is identified for the in-feed axis of the machine tool based on LuGre model.

In this paper we introduce a two-stage roadmap approach to motion planning for reconfigurable robots which utilizes the system's actuators to <b>traverse</b> <b>rough</b> terrain and obstacles.
