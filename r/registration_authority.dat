The flower heads have light lemon-yellow bracts and orange discs and average [...] in diameter. They are held on long stems around [...] above the foliage. Like all forms, it prefers full sun. Although a perennial, it loses vigour after a few years, at which time it is best replaced.

Registered by the Australian Cultivar <b>Registration</b> <b>Authority</b> in 1988, it {{occurred}} naturally near the Royal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne in Victoria, but its habitat {{has since been}} cleared. A double-flowered form of Epacris impressa was collected {{as early as the}} 1860s in Victoria when Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller sent a specimen to Kew Gardens. This was examined by botanist William Hemsley in 1865. The specimen, labelled as Epacris impressa var. pleniflora, originated from Stawell in western Victoria. Another specimen given the same name by Mueller was collected at Nunawading, today a suburb of Melbourne. Charles French, co-founder of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, collected a white double-flowered form from Cheltenham south of Melbourne in 1859 and a pink double-flowered form from Dromana on the Mornington Peninsula in about 1862. These were later sent as rooted cuttings to Veitch Nurseries in England. Double-flowered forms of various colours have since been found throughout Victoria, but only single plants have been observed in any location, and they are still regarded as a rarity. A naturally occurring form of the variety grandiflora with rosebud-like double flowers is also grown.|$|E
