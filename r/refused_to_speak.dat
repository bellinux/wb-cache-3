5|$|As an {{official}} {{history of the}} Japanese Navy, Sakamoto's work {{was considered to be}} official admission of the attacking submarine's identity. Subsequently, most sources assumed as fact Nakagawa's and I-177s role in the loss of Centaur. Nakagawa <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{on the subject of the}} attack on Centaur following the war crimes investigation at the end of World War II, even to defend himself or deny the claims made by Rohwer's and Sakamoto's works, and died in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Çakır was scrutinised by the British {{media in}} 2013 {{when he sent}} off Manchester United's Nani in a Champions League quarter-final and the English team went on to lose to Real Madrid.

UEFA confirmed that no action would be taken against the referee, concluding that he made the correct judgement.|$|E

5|$|Throughout their marriage, George I and Olga were {{a close-knit}} couple, and {{contrary}} to the prevailing custom spent much time with their children, {{who grew up in}} a warm family atmosphere. With age, however, George I argued with his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically. In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> anything but Greek to his parents.|$|E
5|$|He {{secretly}} left Louisville {{at night}} and returned to Indianapolis by train. Eitel defended Riley to the press {{in an effort to}} gain sympathy for Riley, explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made. Riley however <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to reporters and hid himself for weeks. Much to Riley's surprise, the news reports made him more popular than ever. Many people thought the stories were exaggerated, and Riley's carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic. Riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath, but they soon began corresponding with him requesting that he resume writing. This encouraged Riley, and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career.|$|E
5|$|Once Edward's {{force had}} {{gathered}} sufficient strength, {{he dropped the}} ruse and headed south towards London. Fighting off Exeter's and Oxford's attacks, he besieged Warwick at Coventry, hoping to engage the earl in battle. Although Warwick's force had more men than Edward's army, the earl refused the challenge. He {{was waiting for the}} arrival of Clarence, who wanted to use their combined strength to overwhelm the Yorkists. When he learned of this, Edward sent Gloucester to entreat Clarence to return to the House of York, an offer that Clarence readily accepted. Reconciled, the royal brothers moved towards Coventry, and Clarence urged Warwick's surrender. Infuriated with his son-in-law's treachery, Warwick <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to Clarence. Unable to fight the earl at this time, Edward turned again towards London.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days later}} Herb Caen, a {{columnist}} at The San Francisco Chronicle, exposed Sipple as gay {{and a friend}} of Milk's. The announcement was picked up by national newspapers, and Milk's name was included in many of the stories. Time magazine named Milk as a leader in San Francisco's gay community. Sipple, however, was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch Baptist in Detroit, now <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, even participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the Chronicle for invasion of privacy. President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk said that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.|$|E
5|$|Then-Bruins {{head coach}} Don Cherry {{suggested}} that the reason Orr never re-signed with the Bruins was Orr's complete trust in Eagleson at the time (Orr said that he described Eagleson as a brother). Cherry recalled Orr had <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with the Bruins team president directly, allowing Eagleson to mislead or withhold enough details from Boston's offer. Orr's departure from the Bruins was acrimonious {{and he has not}} held an official role with the Bruins since. Years later, it emerged that Eagleson had very good relations with Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz and NHL president John Ziegler that colluded to hold back salaries of certain players. Orr disassociated himself from Eagleson in 1980.|$|E
5|$|There were {{issues with}} casting the film. Paramount Studios' deal with William Shatner had ended {{and so the}} first draft of the film did not feature Captain Kirk. He was later added as a new {{contract}} was signed. However, Leonard Nimoy dropped out of the film because he was concerned over potential merchandising after his likeness as Spock was used in a Heineken advertisement without either his permission or an arrangement for royalties. He had <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> publicly about the issue, but Shatner explained it in an interview. The situation was eventually resolved and Nimoy signed on to appear in Planet of the Titans.|$|E
50|$|The film tells a {{story of}} the last man to leave the {{abandoned}} island of Spinalonga, which had been used as a leper colony. The man <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> leave, and so was forcibly removed. He now lives in Crete, where he plays the lyre at nights in a bar, and <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> The film's narrative style is very unconventional, with most characters speaking their lines several times repeatedly in long takes. The man from the island has the most spoken lines of any character, as he repeatedly explains that he <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> even a single word.|$|R

5|$|Alice Nutter {{was unusual}} among the accused in being {{comparatively}} wealthy, {{the widow of}} a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her {{plea of not guilty}} to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Soegija asked {{to join the}} Catholic-education classes, citing a desire to fully use the facilities at Xaverius. His teacher, Father Mertens, told Soegija that he required permission from his parents first; although they refused, Soegija was nevertheless allowed to study Catholicism. He was intrigued by the Trinity, and asked several of the priests for clarification. Van Lith cited the works of Thomas Aquinas, while Mertens discussed the Trinity as explained by Augustine of Hippo; the latter told him that humans were not meant to understand God with their limited knowledge. Soegija, who wanted to learn more, asked to be baptised, quoting the Finding in the Temple to show why he should not need his parents' permission. The priests agreed, and Soegija was baptised on 24December 1910, taking the baptismal name Albertus, for Albertus Magnus. During Christmas holidays, he told his family that he had converted. Although his immediate family eventually accepted this, and may have eventually supported him, Soegija's other relatives <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to him afterwards.|$|E
5|$|During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried {{some notable}} and {{interesting}} passengers. On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to the others involved {{for the duration of}} the voyage.|$|E

5|$|For {{eight months}} over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain {{on a tour}} of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and {{intended}} to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife {{that she was going to}} leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to or see him.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{utilized}} {{his many}} hockey connections throughout Canada and the United States to sign players. Even so, the team started poorly. Early {{in the first}} season the University of Toronto hockey team was in Boston for matches against local universities. The team's manager, Conn Smythe, who later owned and managed the Toronto Maple Leafs, said that his team could easily defeat the Bruins—Ross's team had won only two of their first fifteen NHL games. This began a feud between Smythe and Ross which lasted for over 40 years, until Ross' death; while mostly confined to newspaper reports, they <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to each other at NHL Board of Governor meetings. The Bruins finished their first season with six wins in thirty games, {{one of the worst}} records {{in the history of the}} league. Several records were set over the course of the season; the three home wins are tied for the second fewest ever, and an eleven-game losing streak from December 8, 1924, until February 17, 1925, set a record for longest losing streak, surpassed in 2004 and now second longest in history. With 17 wins in 36 games the following season, the team greatly improved, and finished one point out of a playoff spot.|$|E
