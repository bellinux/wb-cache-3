5|$|The {{last major}} {{eruption}} {{occurred in the}} late Miocene, about 7million years ago. The resulting stratum, the <b>Rattlesnake</b> Formation, lies {{on top of the}} Mascall and is capped by an ignimbrite. The <b>Rattlesnake</b> stratum has fossils of mastodons, camels, rhinoceroses, the ancestors of dogs, lions, bears, and horses, and others that grazed on the grasslands of the time.|$|E
5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous <b>rattlesnake</b> species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave <b>rattlesnake,</b> and the cottonmouth).|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that tail-vibrating nonvenomous snakes sympatric with <b>rattlesnakes</b> may be Batesian mimics of <b>rattlesnakes</b> that gain protection from predators by mimicking the rattling sound produced by <b>rattlesnakes</b> (all of which are venomous). This hypothesis does not explain why Old World nonvenomous snakes also tail-vibrate, since <b>rattlesnakes</b> are solely a New World taxa.|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} was to {{determine}} whether squirrel behavior when <b>rattlesnakes</b> had not been encountered reduced the predatory behavior of <b>rattlesnakes</b> waiting in ambush. They video-recorded predatory behavior of <b>rattlesnakes</b> when ground squirrels flagged their tails. The researchers found that tail-flagging decreased the likelihood that <b>rattlesnakes</b> would strike and increased the likelihood that they would move away from that area.|$|R
50|$|His stageplays, Talk {{about the}} Passion and <b>Rattlesnakes</b> have been {{produced}} globally; they are especially popular in the United States and London. <b>Rattlesnakes</b> is to be produced as a motion picture by Piper Films of London. Talk about the Passion and <b>Rattlesnakes</b> are published by Methuen of London.|$|R
5|$|Abercrombie held a war {{council that}} evening. The options he {{presented}} {{to his staff}} were limited to asking if the next day's attack should be in three ranks or four; the council opted for three. Abercrombie's plan of attack omitted Clerk's recommendation to fortify the summit of <b>Rattlesnake</b> Hill; {{in addition to the}} frontal assault, 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the La Chute River and mounted at the base of <b>Rattlesnake</b> Hill, with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber <b>rattlesnake</b> as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the {{citizens}} of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber <b>rattlesnake,</b> which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|Among the top predators {{of adult}} Carolina wrens are {{domestic}} cats, and snakes {{such as the}} timber <b>rattlesnake.</b> Raccoons and black rat snakes also feed on wren eggs and nestlings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rattlesnakes</b> {{have evolved}} {{specialized}} sensory organs (infrared-sensitive pit organs) that enhance {{their ability to}} predate small mammals. This ability to sense in the infrared {{set the stage for}} ground squirrels to evolve antipredator counter-innovations that take advantage of the specialized sensory organs of <b>rattlesnakes.</b> Owings and colleagues found that ground squirrels shunt blood to their tails when encountering <b>rattlesnakes.</b> This allows ground squirrels to tail flag to <b>rattlesnakes</b> even in the dark with their hot tails that <b>rattlesnakes</b> can detect with infrared-sensitive pit organs. Ground squirrels do not shunt blood to their tails when they encounter gopher snakes, which also feed on their young, but lack infrared-sensitive pit organs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rattlesnakes</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} San Diego County, and a warning sign along the Marsh Trail reminds hikers that <b>rattlesnakes</b> {{are also found}} in the marsh area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rattlesnakes</b> are {{the leading}} {{contributor}} to snakebite injuries in North America. However, <b>rattlesnakes</b> rarely bite unless provoked or threatened; if treated promptly the bites are seldom fatal.|$|R
5|$|Eleven {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and four species of amphibians {{have been found}} in the park. Reptiles include the Great Basin <b>rattlesnake,</b> short-horned lizard, side-blotched lizard, striped whipsnake, and the tiger salamander.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1806, {{the small}} British brig HMS <b>Rattlesnake</b> under Commander John Bastard was {{cruising}} off the Southern {{coast of the}} British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to be operating in the area. In the early afternoon, lookouts on <b>Rattlesnake</b> spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. Bastard immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was {{much larger than the}} British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with <b>Rattlesnake</b> and seemed to be making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a large ship came within sight directly ahead.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of July 8, Clerk went out once again to the base of <b>Rattlesnake</b> Hill to observe the French defenses; his report {{indicated}} that he still felt the French lines could be taken by assault.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>rattlesnakes</b> can discriminate between envenomed and nonenvenomed rodent prey based on venom-related cues deposited during the strike. This behavior {{is crucial to the}} snake’s ability to choose the chemical trail left by an envenomed rodent fleeing the strike area and aids in the snake’s ability to relocate the rodent. The purpose of the current study was to assess the importance of the vomeronasal system (VNS) in mediating a <b>rattlesnake’s</b> ability to distinguish between envenomed and nonenvenomed prey items. The VNS in adult <b>rattlesnakes</b> was temporarily blocked with Xylocaine ointment, and the <b>rattlesnakes</b> were presented with two prey items, one envenomated and one manually killed by the experimenter and not envenomed. <b>Rattlesnakes</b> in the Xylocaine condition failed to discriminate between envenomed and nonenvenomed prey items, whereas this discrimination was evident in the control condition. These data provide direct evidence that the VNS plays a critical role in mediating poststrike prey discrimination in <b>rattlesnakes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Their prey {{are mainly}} small mammals, but may include small birds, frogs, mice, other small animals, or other snakes. Although capable of {{consuming}} other <b>rattlesnakes,</b> {{the most common}} snakes they eat are garter snakes. Like most <b>rattlesnakes,</b> timber <b>rattlesnakes</b> are known to utilize chemical cues to find sites to ambush their prey and will often strike their prey and track them until they can be consumed. Timber <b>rattlesnakes</b> are known to use fallen logs as a waiting site for prey to pass by, giving them an elevated perch from which to effectively strike their prey, which is almost entirely terrestrial rather than arboreal (even arboreal prey such as squirrels tends to be caught {{when they come to}} the ground). The primary foods by genera of timber <b>rattlesnakes</b> were as follows: Peromyscus (33.3%), Microtus (10.9%), Tamias (qv) (10.6%), Sylvilagus (10.4%), Sigmodon (5.3%) and Sciurus (4.2%). Based on examination of the snout-to-vent length, it was found that juvenile timber <b>rattlesnakes</b> differed slightly in dietary preferences from adult <b>rattlesnakes,</b> being more likely to consume smaller prey such as shrews (averaging 8 g and unable to attack subadult eastern cottontail rabbits (averaging 500 - 1000 g but Peromyscus was the number one prey item for both young and adult <b>rattlesnakes.</b> Several birds, although always secondary to mammals, are also known to be hunted, mainly ground-dwelling species such as bobwhites, but also a surprising number of passerines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rattlesnakes</b> {{were known}} to use {{infrared}} radiation to detect prey, but what they discovered suggests that the squirrels evolved {{the ability to communicate}} with <b>rattlesnakes</b> by heating up their tails and thereby signalling with infrared radiation.|$|R
5|$|The city {{is divided}} into 18 {{neighborhood}} councils of which all Missoula residents are a member. The city further contains 10 historical districts: Downtown Missoula, East Pine Street, Fort Missoula, Lower <b>Rattlesnake,</b> McCormick, Northside, Southside, University Area and, {{the campus of the}} University of Montana.|$|E
5|$|The {{tabulated}} IUCN {{ratings for}} the state reptiles all reflect species-level assessments; for most state reptiles, the IUCN does not discuss the subspecies situations. With the Arizona ridge-backed <b>rattlesnake,</b> the IUCN notes the subspecies has similar safety to the overall species, but does not formally rate the subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Four genera are {{represented}} with different {{species in the}} list. Terrapene (box turtles) has Terrapene ornata (Kansas) along with Terrapene carolina (Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee). Under Gopherus (gopher tortoises), there are Gopherus polyphemus (Georgia's state reptile and Florida's state tortoise) and Gopherus agassizii (California and Nevada). Under Crotalus (one of two <b>rattlesnake</b> genera), Arizona named Crotalus willardi willardi, while West Virginia chose Crotalus horridus. With Phrynosoma (horned lizards), Wyoming specified the entire genus, but Texas specified Phrynosoma cornutum.|$|E
50|$|The Laredo <b>Rattlesnakes</b> were a {{professional}} indoor football {{team in the}} Lone Star Football League that began play in the 2012 season. Based in Laredo, Texas, the <b>Rattlesnakes</b> played their home games at the Laredo Energy Arena.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rattlesnakes</b> {{are born}} with fully {{functioning}} fangs and venom, and are capable of killing prey at birth. Adult <b>rattlesnakes</b> shed their fangs every 6-10 weeks. At least three pairs of replacement fangs lie behind the functional pair.|$|R

5|$|In September 1799 Sercey {{dispersed}} {{his remaining}} ships. Brûle-Gueule {{was sent back}} to France on 26 September carrying condemned political prisoners; the corvette was eventually wrecked on the Pointe du Raz with heavy loss of life. Preneuse was ordered to operate against British trade off the coast of Southeast Africa, sailing from Port Louis on 4 August. Lhermitte focused his efforts on the Mozambique Channel and the approaches to the British Cape Colony and on 20 September encountered a squadron anchored in Algoa Bay comprising the 24-gun naval storeship HMS Camel, the 16-gun HMS <b>Rattlesnake</b> (1791) and the schooner Surprise, the former ships lying with their masts and rigging removed. This force was supporting an expeditionary army under General Francis Dundas fighting the Third Xhosa War. Camel was laden with military supplies but neither ship was prepared for battle, with a 30 of Camels sailors and 15 from <b>Rattlesnake</b> trapped on shore by the surf.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{approached}} the anchored ships at 18:00, flying false Danish colours, and anchored nearby. A ship's boat from Camel {{approached the}} new arrival, rapidly realising that Preneuse was a hostile frigate {{and returning to}} their ship. Lieutenant William Fothergill, the most senior officer with the convoy, fired warning shots close to the frigate, which Lhermitte ignored. Both British ships then prepared for action. At 20:30, Preneuse began to approach <b>Rattlesnake</b> and Fothergill opened fire immediately, joined by Camel. Lhermitte returned fire, focusing its broadside on Camel. By midnight Camel had taken several shot in the hull causing widespread flooding, and the crew ceased firing to man the pumps. Lhermitte apparently believed that Camel had abandoned the fight and he switched fire towards <b>Rattlesnake,</b> the engagement continuing until 03:30 at which point Lhermitte slipped his anchor and pulled out of range. Remaining in the bay until 10:00 before standing out to sea. British losses were two killed and twelve wounded, both Camel and <b>Rattlesnake</b> badly damaged. It was later reported in French sources that Lhermitte believed the schooner Surprise to be a well armed naval brig, prompting his withdrawal. Preneuses loss in the action was around 40 killed and wounded, and the frigate {{was reported to be}} badly damaged; messages to this effect were hastily sent to the commander at the Cape, Captain George Losack who sent the 50-gun HMS Jupiter in pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, beavers, and prairie dogs, while {{reptiles}} include the snapping turtle, the box turtle, and various types of snakes. The prairie <b>rattlesnake</b> is South Dakota's only venomous snake. Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, and bass, along with other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish, and chinook salmon, native to the Pacific Northwest, have been successfully introduced in Lake Oahe.|$|E
50|$|The skin of <b>rattlesnakes</b> is {{intricately}} patterned in {{a manner}} that camouflages them from their predators. <b>Rattlesnakes</b> do not generally have bright or showy colors (reds, yellows, blues, etc.), instead relying on subtle earth tones that resemble the surrounding environment.|$|R
50|$|To test these {{hypotheses}} about {{the function of}} tail flagging, they built robosquirrel to record encounters with <b>rattlesnakes.</b> Robosquirrel was programmed to wag its tail {{in the presence of}} a snake and its tail temperature can increase above its body temperature when it encounters snakes. The robosquirrel behaviors presented to <b>rattlesnakes</b> in naturalistic contexts can be precisely controlled. This control of behavior is impossible with living squirrels and so robosquirrel allows researchers to investigate how <b>rattlesnakes</b> respond to specific behaviors.|$|R
50|$|Generally, <b>rattlesnakes</b> invest {{little in}} {{offspring}} following birth. However, like other viperids, female tiger <b>rattlesnakes</b> invest in provisioning resources for developing embryos. She eats {{early in the}} pregnancy and then finds {{a safe place to}} hide while providing the optimal thermal environment for development.|$|R
5|$|Six states chose {{reptiles}} {{named after}} the state. In common names, Arizona and Texas were represented by the Arizona ridge-nosed <b>rattlesnake</b> and Texas horned lizard. Mississippi and North Carolina appeared in scientific names: Alligator mississippiensis and Terrapene carolina carolina. Alabama and New Mexico appeared in both common names (Alabama red-bellied turtle and New Mexico whiptail lizard) and scientific names (Pseudemys alabamensis and Cnemidophorus neomexicanus).|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{commonly}} include ecchymosis and swelling. The pain {{is generally}} {{more severe than}} bites from the copperhead, but less so than those from rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.). The formation of vesicles and bullae is less common than with <b>rattlesnake</b> bites, although necrosis can occur. Myokymia is sometimes reported. However, the venom has strong proteolytic activity {{that can lead to}} severe tissue destruction.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{reptiles}} {{are considered to}} be threatened and two species are endangered– these are protected under the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan. Six more species {{are considered to be}} of special concern, though not protected under the act. The copperbelly water snake is listed as threatened by the federal government, while the eastern massasauga <b>rattlesnake</b> is a candidate species to be included on the US endangered species list.|$|E
