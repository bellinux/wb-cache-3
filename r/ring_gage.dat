40|$|The {{calculation}} of uncertainty for a mea-surement {{is an effort}} to set reasonable bounds for the measurement result according to standardized rules. Since every measurement produces only an esti-mate of the answer, the primary requisite of an uncertainty statement is to inform the reader of how sure the writer is that the answer is in a certain range. This report explains how we have implemented these rules for dimensional calibrations of nine different types of gages: gage blocks, <b>gage</b> wires, <b>ring</b> <b>gages,</b> gage balls, round-ness standards, optical flats indexing tables, angle blocks, and sieves. Key words: angle standards; calibration; dimensional metrology; gage blocks; gages; optical flats; uncertainty; uncer-tainty budget...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{consider}} a method to make robust the process of high-precision length measurements. Quality improvement efforts in many instances have been directed at reducing the variation of a particular characteristic around a nominal design specification. In the included case study we organized and executed controlled experiments for the comparative measurement of the inside diameter of plain <b>ring</b> <b>gages</b> in the infrastructures of an accredited Laboratory.

40|$|The {{requirement}} for primary-level calibration of complex forms, e. g., gear profiles, {{has led to}} development of a method for quantifying the measurement uncertainty on the artifact being calibrated that does not rely on a transfer comparison. This method, developed jointly by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Oak Ridge Metrology Center (ORMC) personnel, consists of breaking down the measurement method into simpler components and quantifying these components using generally accepted artifacts with low uncertainties (<b>gage</b> blocks, <b>ring</b> <b>gages,</b> spheres, etc.). Once quantified, these components are added vectorially according to NIST Technical Note 1297, 1994 Edition. Verification of this method {{can be accomplished by}} intercomparisons with other methods and laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Two near optimum {{full-scale}} Viking aeroshell prototypes (140 deg ring-stiffened conical shells), differing only in {{base ring}} size, were designed and tested under uniform pressure to buckling failure. Part I describes the computerized design procedure which iterates between a design program based on approximate equations to determine skin and <b>ring</b> <b>gages</b> and <b>ring</b> spacings, and a sophisticated system of shell of revolution programs for more accurate analysis {{as a basis}} for redesign. Part II discusses fabrication techniques, test procedures, and test results. Both buckling and prebuckling data are compared with the theoretical predictions of Part I. Appropriate buckling knockdown factors for this type of construction are identified. Measured strains in skin and rings agreed well with theoretical predictions and the buckling pressure was in close agreement with the design ultimate pressure...|$|R
40|$|Packer {{elements}} are traditionally rubber seals that can operate under specified downhole conditions {{and provide a}} seal for either a short-term, retrievable, or a long-term, permanent, completion. In this case a retrievable 19. 7 cm (7 - 3 / 4 ") packer element for a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) environment was designed and tested. The element created a seal between the mandrel, or tubing, and the casing. At high temperature and pressure rubber needs to be contained {{so that it will}} create and maintain an energized seal. In this study only Aflas rubber was tested. Various backup systems were examined; some more traditional designs such as the carbon steel foldback ring were compared to more experimental ideas. Results of theoretical simulations were compared to actual test results in order to gain a greater understanding of element behavior. Experiments were also performed to study the process of element setting, which is difficult to observe due to the high pressures and temperatures required. In a related study alternative materials to rubber such as annealed high-conductivity oxygen-free copper were tested to determine if the properties could be applied for packer element applications. The most successful design was the foldback ring with an anti-extrusion PEEK <b>ring</b> under the <b>gage</b> <b>ring.</b> This design passed a liquid test at 134 MPa (19. 5 k psi) differential pressure and a gas test at 87. 6 MPa (12. 7 k psi) differential pressure. New designs such as the split ring with mesh and the garter spring with mesh did not pass fixture tests but could be successful with further modifications. FEA was used as an analytical tool to create simulations of the element after a setting force is applied. The modeling was shown to correlate to the actual test results and therefore {{it would be a good}} tool to use in future studies. by Stephanie Berger. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|Havoc won {{the seventh}} annual Tournament of Death on May 17, 2008. In the first round, Havoc {{advanced}} by beating the Ram {{in a light}} tube bundles match. In the semi-finals, Havoc and Nick Gage advanced by beating Pinkie Sanchez and Greg Excellent in a fans bring the weapons match. In the finals, Havoc was pitted against Drake Younger, Scotty Vortekz, and Nick Gage in a no rope barbed wire 200 light tubes match to a single pinfall. During the match Havoc was chokeslammed on two chairs by Necro Butcher and was {{dropped out of the}} <b>ring</b> by Nick <b>Gage,</b> but his arm caught the barbed wire and was badly cut from his triceps to his armpit. The same year, he also won the IWA Deep South Carnage Cup, advancing over the Juggulator, WHACKS, and beating Nick Gage, Freakshow, and Corey Shaddix in the finals. He gained The CZW Ultraviolent Underground Championship at Decision '08 after then-Champion Drake Younger, who also held The CZW World Heavyweight Championship gave him the Title following a four-way match.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Mazda {{celebrated the}} 10th {{anniversary of the}} MX-5 with the 10th Anniversary Model, a limited edition {{featuring}} some until-then exclusive features, namely a 6-speed transmission and Bilstein shock absorbers; 15 inch chrome wheels with 195/50R15 tires; a very desirable Torsen limited-slip differential. Performance figures were slightly different, with quicker acceleration and higher top speed than the standard 5-speed model. The model's nickname among owners and enthusiasts was 10AM or 10AE (as in [...] "10th Anniversary Edition"). The car had a unique sapphire blue mica (called innocent blue in Japan) paint colour with two-toned black leather and blue alcantara seats and floor mats, matching 3-spoke Nardi leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, BOSE audio system, bright <b>gage</b> <b>rings,</b> carbon grained center console panel and stainless steel scuff plates. The addition of the sixth gear resulted in different performance results, with 0-100 km/h in 7.6 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the standard 5-speed model, according to Car and Driver, and 0.4 seconds faster according to Motor Trend. However, {{in spite of the}} 10AM's greater weight, its top rated speed increased from 210 to 214 km/h. Combined fuel consumption improved from 8.5 to 8.0 l/100 km.|$|R

40|$|At the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), the D&D task is enormous. Tons of {{plutonium}} has been processed {{over the years}} in approximately 1, 000 gloveboxes, This represents nearly half of the gloveboxes in the DOE complex. In addition, more than a thousand tanks of various designs, with miles of associated piping, supported the processes. A wide variety of operations were performed at RFETS, including aqueous processing, pyrophoric processing, hydriding and dehydriding, metal casting, and machining {{of plutonium}}. Various materials have been handled at the facility, including plutonium, uranium, americium, tantalum, beryllium, chloride salts, and various acids and solvents. Significant amounts of plutonium residues remain in inaccessible equipment in the facilities, which create criticality safety issues. Some of the plutonium has been at RFETS for many years, and there is significant in-growth of americium, a decay product that emits gamma radiation, which potentially increases exposure to the workers. The size reduction portion of the D&D will be difficult and costly. The gloveboxes and tanks are constructed of stainless steel, frequently with lead shielding or double walls that hold water for neutron shielding. Window mountings, glove port <b>rings,</b> site <b>gages,</b> bolted flanges, and various penetrations reinforce the walls. Tanks may be filled with berated glass rings for criticality control, or double walled to hold the process fluid in the space between walls. The gloveboxes and tanks are generally tall enough to require workers to stand on scaffolding or platforms to perform D&D. Gloveboxes and tanks were individually constructed over a span of many years with evolving design specifications; therefore, most gloveboxes are unique and few tank designs are duplicated in more than pairs. This paper describes the cultural transition and technical approaches taken for D&D at RFETS to achieve 2006 closure. Specific emphasis is placed on critical issues such as, workforce safety and retention, strategies for schedule acceleration, and technological breakthroughs for D&D of nuclear facilities...|$|R

6000|$|I {{was an only}} child, and to {{this day}} I do not know whether my father is living or dead. He fled my mother's virtues before my distincter {{memories}} began. He left no traces in his flight, and she, in her indignation, destroyed every vestige that she could of him. Never a photograph nor a scrap of his handwriting have I seen; and it was, I know, only the accepted code of virtue and discretion that prevented her destroying her marriage certificate and me, and so making a clean sweep of her matrimonial humiliation. I suppose I must inherit something of the moral stupidity that would enable her to make a holocaust of every little personal thing she had of him. There must have been presents made by him as a lover, for example--books with kindly inscriptions, letters perhaps, a flattened flower, a <b>ring,</b> or such-like <b>gage.</b> She kept her wedding-ring, of course, but all the others she destroyed. She never told me his christian name or indeed spoke a word to me of him; though at times I came near daring to ask her: add what I have of him--it isn't much--I got from his brother, my hero, my uncle Ponderevo. She wore her ring; her marriage certificate she kept in a sealed envelope in the very bottom of her largest trunk, and me she sustained at a private school among the Kentish hills. You must not think I was always at Bladesover--even in my holidays. If at the time these came round, Lady Drew was vexed by recent Company, or for any other reason wished to take it out of my mother, then she used to ignore the customary reminder my mother gave her, and I [...] "stayed on" [...] at the school.|$|R
