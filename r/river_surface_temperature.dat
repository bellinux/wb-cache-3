The best results are obtained for the prediction at 0700 h UT using meteorological data at 0400 h UT. The reliability of the model is given by a probability alpha = 0. 16 of clear weather forecasting when it is foggy and a probability beta = 0. 26 of fog forecasting when there is clear weather. These results are finally checked on 27 new observations in November 1990 : the 6 foggy days are perfectly predicted and 24 % of the clear days are badly predicted...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a regional study intended to analyze the impact of climatic changes in water resources across the Argentinean Andes, we evaluated the interannual relationships between sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> and streamflows along the Cordillera de los Andes. We selected the following rivers: Bermejo, Atuel, Neuquén, Limay and Chubut. Statistically significant relationships were observed between streamflows from the mentioned <b>rivers</b> and sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> in some regions across the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The Bermejo river streamflow is largely influenced by sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the subtropical Atlantic off the Brazilian coast. The Atuel river streamflow is related to changes in sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> on the Tropical Pacific. Although significant relationships between sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> and Northern Patagonian rivers were observed, their physical interpretation is not straightforward. The lack of sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> records south of 45 °S, might be hampering the identification of the most consistent relationships between the discharges of the Limay and Chubut <b>rivers</b> and sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Analyses of the long-term trends in streamflows and sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> based on two subperiods indicate that important changes occurred in the mid- 1970 in both streamflows across the Andes and sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> in some regions of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

40|$|Studies of <b>surface</b> and air <b>temperature</b> from LANDSAT need a great {{density of}} {{meteorological}} stations following the altitudinal variation {{and complexity of}} terrain. Alternative methods {{for the study of}} the spatial distribution are useful. In this paper, the seasonal variation of <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> is analyzed by LANDSAT 7 ETM + thermal channel information considering an area of the productive valley of the Neuquén River. Landsat 7 ETM + images offer information with 60 m of spatial resolution; its behavior showed agreement with topography. The calculation of <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> using LANDSAT imagery should include surface meteorological data: atmospheric water vapor content and mean air temperature near to the surface, simultaneously to the passage of the satellite. The data were corrected using Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator, available online. Areas near Neuquén <b>river</b> show lower <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in summer, while the southeastern areas presented <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> between 4 ºC and 5 °C smaller, and the zones of greater slope in the northern area on the plateau presented <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> approximately 4 °C.

50|$|The rising {{temperatures}} are having direct impacts on freshwater and wetlands biodiversity. Atlantic salmon is a keystone species in rivers {{along the coast}} of Norway. Salmon have an upper temperature limit in the twenties so future warming may make it increasingly difficult to maintain current population levels. Higher initial temperatures could lead to increased growth and production in the short-term but ultimately there could be a massive collapse if warming trends continue. This has been made evident by the recent decline in mean individual mass and annual mean length of the fish. It is suggested that the size change of Atlantic salmon is made by the collapse and rebuilding of the pelagic fish abundance in the North Atlantic Ocean, a gradual decrease in zooplankton abundance and climate change. It could also promote genetic abnormalities and the spread of disease such as Pancreas Disease (PD) and Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISA). Furthermore, lake and <b>river</b> <b>surface</b> water <b>temperatures</b> are projected to increase further, resulting in a longer summer stratification period and more cyanobacterial blooms. Furthermore, both the Atlantic salmon and the Arctic charr have experienced changes in abundance. Whilst both species coexist it has been the Arctic charr who seems to be more vulnerable to environmental changes, hence leading to its overall decline in numbers.|$|R
40|$|This study applied {{remote sensing}} {{technology}} to analyze how rivers {{in the urban}} environment affect the surface temperature of their ambient areas. While surface meteorological stations can supply accurate data points in the city, remote sensing can provide such data in a two-dimensional (2 -D) manner. The goal {{of this paper is}} to apply the remote sensing technique to further our understanding of the relationship between the surface temperature and rivers in urban areas. The 2 -D surface temperature data was retrieved from Landsat- 7 thermal infrared images, while data collected by Formosat- 2 was used to categorize the land uses in the urban area. The land surface temperature distribution is simulated by a sigmoid function with nonlinear regression analysis. Combining the aforementioned data, the range of effect on the surface temperature from rivers can be derived. With the remote sensing data collected for the Taipei Metropolitan area, factors affecting the surface temperature were explored. It indicated that the effect on the developed area was less significant than on the ambient nature zone; moreover, the size of the buffer zone between the river and city, such as the wetlands or flood plain, was found to correlate with the affected distance of the <b>river</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{represents}} {{an amalgam of}} a group of studies with the purpose of understanding the influence of the Pacific and Atlantic sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> on precipitation and river discharge in Northeastern South America. Sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> is a good representative of phenomena such as ENSO that, in turn, cause worldwide climate variability. The patterns of the Atlantic Ocean sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> anomaly also plays a very important role in the precipitation over the neighboring regions and a special investigation was also carried out to better understanding this influence. The influence of these oceans' sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> on the intraseasonal variability of precipitation in Northeast Brazil was also a particular subject of study. Statistical methods were largely used both during these investigations and in the development of models for forecasting discharge long term in advance at some sites in the Amazon, Orinoco and Tocantins <b>River</b> Basins. Sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> anomalies in both oceans significantly influence precipitation over northeastern South America. The Atlantic Ocean, however, plays a more important role in the case of precipitation over Northeast Brazil while the Pacific Ocean seems to have stronger influence over eastern and northern Amazonia. As a result of changes in precipitation, the river discharge in the Amazon Region is also influenced by changes in sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> patterns. The discharge of rivers located {{to the north of the}} Amazon River is mainly influenced by the Pacific sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> while the Atlantic influences the rivers to the south of the Amazon River. This influence could be clearly observed using the forecast models. Two different methodologies were used to develop forecast models: Canonical Correlation Analysis and Artificial Neural Network. The first is a linear technique and the second a non-linear one. In both cases, the models developed using Pacific sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> were better at forecasting discharge at sites to the north of the Amazon River and those developed from Atlantic sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> at forecasting discharges at sites to the south of the Amazon River. Even though the use of a non-linear technique improved the accuracy of the models in general, it considerably improved the capacity of Atlantic sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> to forecast discharge. This general improvement was to some degree expected considering the very complex and non-linear mechanisms that transform precipitation into discharge...|$|R

CNRM-RCSM 4 includes the regional representation of the atmosphere (ALADIN-Climate model), land <b>surface</b> (ISBA model), <b>rivers</b> (TRIP model) and the ocean (NEMOMED 8 model), with a daily coupling by the OASIS coupler. This model aims to reproduce the regional climate system with as few constraints as possible: there is no <b>surface</b> salinity, <b>temperature</b> relaxation, or flux correction; the Black Sea budget is parameterised and river runoffs (except for the Nile) are fully coupled. The atmospheric component of CNRM-RCSM 4 is evaluated in a companion paper; here, {{we focus on the}} air–sea fluxes, <b>river</b> discharges, <b>surface</b> ocean characteristics, deep water formation phenomena and the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. Long-term stability, mean seasonal cycle, interannual variability and decadal trends are evaluated using basin-scale climatologies and in-situ measurements when available. We demonstrate that the simulation shows overall good behaviour in agreement with state-of-the-art Mediterranean RCSMs. An overestimation of the shortwave radiation and latent heat loss as well as a cold Sea <b>Surface</b> <b>Temperature</b> (SST) bias and a slight trend in the bottom layers are the primary current deficiencies. Further, CNRM-RCSM 4 shows high skill in reproducing the interannual to decadal variability for air–sea fluxes, <b>river</b> runoffs, sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> and salinity as well as open-sea deep convection, including a realistic simulation of the Eastern Mediterranean Transient. We conclude that CNRM-RCSM 4 is a mature modelling tool allowing the climate variability of the Mediterranean regional climate system to be studied and understood.

The extent of tree cover and land <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> exhibited a strong negative correlation. A decrease in vegetation cover and successive increase in urban built up area were found to be related with high <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> This implies that land <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> is an effective tool and may help city planners to make appropriate strategies for improving the tree resources of the urban landscape...|$|R

The damage caused by land cover changes also result in indirect impact, which increase the <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> hence cause variations in <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>temperature</b> variations can generate heat island phenomenon, where the temperatures are warmer than those of surrounding areas...|$|R
40|$|Sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in air-sea interactions. This research was conducted to understand seasonal and interannual variations of sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in the Indonesian waters. The data used in this research was daily sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in 1986 to 2015 which was obtained from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center - National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Method used in this study was the anomaly analysis. The result showed that the seasonal and interannual variations of sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in the Indonesian waters varied. Seasonal variations of SST in the Makasar Strait, Sulawesi Sea, and Halmahera Sea were low. High seasonal variations of sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> occurred in the southern waters of Java, Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, and Banda Sea, which were allegedly due to the upwelling process. In addition, interannual variation of sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in the Indonesian waters fluctuated. From 1986 to 2000, it showed a negative anomaly dominant. Meanwhile, from 2001 to 2015, it showed a positive anomaly dominant. The effect of Indian Ocean Dipole on the fluctuation of sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in the Indonesian waters was stronger than ENSO. Within the last 30 years, the sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in the Indonesian water indicated a rising trend. The highest sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> rise occurred in the Halmahera Sea that reached 0. 66 OC/ 30 years and the lowest was in the Timor Sea of 0. 36 OC/ 30 years...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDespite {{widespread}} use on athletic fields, synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> are considerably {{higher than those}} measured on natural turfgrass when exposed to solar radiation. Elevated temperatures may pose health risks to athletes competing on synthetic turf. Research was conducted at the University of Tennessee Centre for Athletic Field Safety to create a model for predicting synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> using atmospheric data. Synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> was measured on ten different synthetic turf plots (42 m 2) varying in fibre type and infill characteristics. Plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Two temperature sensors placed in the centre of each plot measured <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> on 10 -minute intervals for three 8 -week periods {{over the course of}} two years. Atmospheric data including air temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), precipitation (mm), and solar radiation (W m- 2) were collected on the same interval. Synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> varied due to both air temperature and solar radiation. Predictive models using these data accounted for 86, 95, and 94 % of the variation in daily maximum, minimum, and mean synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> Accuracy of these models for predicting daily mean and minimum synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> using 48 and 72 -hour forecasted air temperature data was excellent (+/- 1 °C). Models using 48 and 72 -hour forecasted were less accurate in predicting daily maximum synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> (+/- 4. 75 to 5. 33 °C). Our findings indicate that 72 hour forecasted air temperature data can be used to predict daily minimum and mean <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of synthetic turf. Such models could be used to schedule athletic events around periods of potentially hazardous <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R
