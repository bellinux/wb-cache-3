5|$|Improved {{telescope}} {{technology in}} the late 19th and 20th centuries allowed astronomers to <b>resolve</b> (<b>that</b> is, see as distinct objects) large-scale surface features on Io. In the 1890s, Edward E. Barnard {{was the first to}} observe variations in Io's brightness between its equatorial and polar regions, correctly determining that this was due to differences in color and albedo between the two regions and not due to Io being egg-shaped, as proposed at the time by fellow astronomer William Pickering, or two separate objects, as initially proposed by Barnard. Later telescopic observations confirmed Io's distinct reddish-brown polar regions and yellow-white equatorial band.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{the party}} comes to {{discover}} that the Crystals formed a seal upon Exdeath, an ancient sorcerer; with them destroyed, not only would the dark essence be released, but over time the planet itself would become uninhabitable. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth; but by the machinations of human folly or the influence of the sealed Exdeath, they fail. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. Galuf's granddaughter Krile arrives by meteorite, restoring Galuf's memory completely; he recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, pursuing him back home with Krile. Bartz and the others <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> the fight is not Galuf's alone, together traveling to the distant planet world, where Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world's Crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeath's lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are blown to a distant continent when a magical barrier is activated during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galuf's kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> is part of our American heritage.|$|E

5|$|When Sodh was {{twenty-two years}} old, he was ordained at Wat Songpinong in his {{hometown}} and was given the Pāli language monastic name Candasaro. Phra (phra meaning 'monk, venerable') Candasaro studied both under masters of the oral meditation tradition as well as experts in scriptural analysis, which was uncommon during that period. In his autobiographical notes, he wrote that he practiced meditation every day, {{from the first day}} following his ordination. In his first years as a monk, he had difficulty obtaining food on traditional alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for laypeople to offer them food. This hardship led him to <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> he would one day built a kitchen for monastics, who would then enjoy convenience in the spiritual life. After his third rainy season (third year after monk's ordination), Phra Candasaro traveled far and wide in Thailand to study scriptures and meditation practice with teachers from established traditions. He learnt about a broad range of things, and was in the habit of respecting all spiritual things. He studied scriptures at Wat Pho and learnt about meditation at eight centers, among which Wat Ratchasittharam. At Wat Ratchasittharam he studied a visualization meditation method with Luang Por Aium, and experienced a development in meditation regarded as important, when he perceived a sphere of light. Buddhist Studies scholars Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell believe Wat Ratchasittharam to be crucial in Luang Pu Sodh's development of Dhammakaya meditation.|$|E

25|$|An ongoing ideological {{conflict}} between the Hilfsverein – a global educational organization led by Jews from Germany – and the Zionist movement, escalated into an intense conflict over the planned language of instruction, known as the War of the Languages. Modern Hebrew was still in its infancy, and technical education was non-existent in the biblical tongue. A strong case was put forward for the Technikum to be run in German. A compromise of English was offered. Only the outcome of World War I and the diminished German influence in Palestine would finally <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> Hebrew would be the official language of the Technion, and later the State of Israel.|$|E

After Kidkill refuses his original act (which was simply Homer prancing around in a monkey suit), he goes to his second plan; an act where he rides a tricycle with Butch Patrick on his shoulders, both of them dressed as Eddie Munster, on a stage as both are being attacked by cobras (some real, some merely animatronic snakes packed with venom).

25|$|The {{border between}} the two states became a major irritant, and in November 1997 a border {{committee}} {{was set up to}} try to <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> specific dispute. After federation and before independence the line of the border had been of minor importance because it was only a demarcation line between federated provinces and initially the two governments tacitly agreed that the border should remain as it had been immediately before independence. However, on independence the border became an international frontier, and the two governments could not agree on the line that the border should take along its entire length, and they looked back to the colonial period treaties between Italy and Ethiopia for a basis in international law for the precise line of the frontier between the states. Problems then arose because they could not agree on the interpretation of those agreements and treaties, and it was not clear under international law how binding colonial treaties were on the two states.|$|E

25|$|On February 4, 1815, the fleet, {{with all}} of the British troops aboard, set sail toward Mobile Bay, Alabama. The British army then {{attacked}} and captured Fort Bowyer at the mouth of Mobile Bay on February 12. The following day, the British army was making preparations to attack Mobile when news arrived of the peace treaty. General Jackson had made tentative plans to attack the British at Mobile and continue the war into Spanish Florida on the grounds the British were using it as a base. He carried out those plans for Florida much later. The treaty had been ratified by the British Parliament but would not be ratified by Congress and the President until mid-February. It did, however, <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> hostilities should cease, and the British abandoned Fort Bowyer and sailed home to their base in the West Indies. Although the Battle of New Orleans had no influence on the terms of the Treaty of Ghent, the defeat at New Orleans did compel Britain to abide by the treaty.|$|E
25|$|Coroners {{continue}} to have jurisdiction to enquire into any treasure found in their districts, and into who are or are suspected to be its finders. Anyone finding an object he or she believes or has reasonable grounds to believe is treasure must notify the coroner for the district in which the object is found within 14 days starting from {{the day after the}} find or, if later, the day on which the finder first believes or has reason to believe the object is treasure. Not doing so is an offence. Inquests are held without a jury unless the coroner decides otherwise. The coroner must notify the British Museum if his or her district is in England, the Department of the Environment if it is in Northern Ireland, or the National Museum Wales if it is in Wales. The coroner must also take reasonable steps to notify any person who appears may have found the treasure; any person who, {{at the time it was}} found, occupied land which it appears may be where the treasure was found; and any other interested persons, including persons involved in the find or having an interest in the land where the treasure was found at that time or since. However, coroners still have no power to make any legal determination as to whether the finder, landowner or occupier of the land has title to the treasure. The courts have to <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> issue, and may also review coroners' decisions in relation to treasure.|$|E

500|$|The British {{followed}} in rapid pursuit. [...] As they advanced, the British light troops signalled with bugle calls, which to Colonel Joseph Reed were {{reminiscent of a}} fox hunt, and seemed to him to be intended as an insult. [...] Probably about this time, the Second and Third battalions of British light infantry, along with the 42nd Highlanders were ordered up as reinforcements. Reed, who had met Knowlton, rode to Washington {{to tell him what}} was going on and encouraged him to reinforce the rangers. Instead of retreating, Washington, in what Edward G. Lengel calls [...] "an early glimmer of the courage and <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> would rally the Continentals from many a tight spot later on", [...] devised a plan to entrap the British light troops. Washington would have some troops make a feint, in order to draw the British down into an area of open ground known as 'The Hollow Way', and then send a detachment of troops around to trap the British.|$|E

They briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city, with Bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where Carter and his friends hid during the siege. He said, [...] "even if all we get is some extra attention for Bosnia on MTV, that's something". The idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible, as the only way into Sarajevo was on a United Nations plane. Manager Paul McGuinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert, it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the Zoo TV crew. As he explained, [...] "U2's effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that U2 is also obliged to <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> issue. Going to Sarajevo seems to me to fall into that category. I think it would endanger the people we go with, endanger the tour, and endanger the band."

500|$|Lennox Samuels from The Dallas Morning News {{felt that}} the [...] "great sense of being hurt that is present in 'Oh Father' is far more {{relatable}} than any other Madonna song." [...] Kevin Phinney from the Austin American-Statesman called it the strongest and the most shocking song on Like a Prayer. Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote that the orchestration of the song was [...] "grandiloquent", while describing Madonna's delivery of the lines as an [...] "angry triumph". Stewart Mason from Allmusic shared Holden's opinion, and described [...] "Oh Father" [...] as [...] " [...] finest ballad performance ever". He added that the [...] "upward modulation of the chorus, accompanied by some overdubbed self-harmonies that feature a very controlled and effective use of Madonna's highest register, is sheer brilliance, giving the song a steely <b>resolve</b> <b>that</b> removes any taint of self-pity from the verses." [...] Music journalist J. D. Considine, while reviewing Like a Prayer for Rolling Stone, believed that despite the song's [...] "lush" [...] string arrangement, some of the lyrics contain a disquieting degree of pain. Hadley Freeman from The Guardian commented that the confessional nature of the lyrics of [...] "Oh Father" [...] was what appealed to her {{the most in the}} song. Negative reception for the song was given by Mark Browning, author of David Fincher: Films That Scar, who called it one of Madonna's weakest efforts, due to the verses sounding more like musical theater than a pop song.|$|E
