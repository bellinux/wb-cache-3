Six crude, hollow, vacuum-formed Dalek props were also created. They were primarily used during location filming of the serial's finale, although several of them can also be seen in the background of some studio shots.

5000|$|Though the ladies' {{version of}} the {{roadster}} largely fell out of fashion in England and many other Western nations as the 20th century progressed, it remains popular in the Netherlands; this is why some people refer to bicycles of this design as Dutch bikes. In Dutch the name of these bicycles is Omafiets ("grandma's bike") though in Frisia they often call them Widdofyts (Frisian for [...] "widow's bike"). The classic Omafiets is still in production in the Netherlands and has changed little since 1911: {{it comes with a}} single-speed gear, 28 x 1½ (ISO 635) wheels, black painted frame and mudguards (with white-blazoning {{at the back of the}} rear one), and a <b>rear</b> <b>skirt</b> guard. Modern variants, be they painted in other colours, with aluminium frames, drum-brakes or multiple gear ratios in a hub gearing system, will all conform to the same basic look and dimensions as the classic Omafiets. (The Dutch gentlemen's equivalent is called the Opafiets (Dutch for [...] "grandpa's bike") or Stadsfiets ("city bike") and generally has the same characteristics but with a [...] "diamond" [...] or [...] "gents'" [...] frame, thereby much the same as the gentleman's English roadster.) ...|$|E

5000|$|New Paradigm Daleks are {{taller than}} {{previous}} variants, having a substantial fender reminiscent of Movie Daleks. The skirt section consists of raised panels with bevelled edges to which forty-eight hemispheres are fixed in twelve columns. The hemispheres are coloured grey {{with the exception}} of the Eternal Dalek, where they are black. The central <b>rear</b> <b>skirt</b> panel is enlarged to form a broad spine featuring a recessed horizontal louvre assembly. Published design drawings and commentary by concept artist Peter McKinstry indicates that this section is capable of opening to deploy alternative weapons which would traverse around the midsection to replace the standard armament, although this has not been portrayed on screen. The skirt is surmounted by a prominent, slatless shoulder section, divided by a horizontal groove and featuring integral appendage boxes. The neck is devoid of struts and consists of four flared rings detailed with small vertical slots, and is mounted towards the front of the Dalek giving the appearance of a prominent hump to the rear shoulder section. The dome, to which two cylindrical lights are fitted, is missing the chamfered lower section applied to previous variants. The gun is larger than that previously seen on the programme and is shown causing the complete disintegration of another Dalek. The eye design features five closely spaced discs of identical diameter behind an eyeball, inset with horizontal fins, on the front of which is a veined [...] "organic" [...] lens which glows with a yellow light. It is mounted to the dome on a ball joint.|$|E
