40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{parallel}} version {{of finding the}} Fuzzy <b>Reasoning</b> <b>Path</b> (FRP) using the knowledge representation model, introduced by Chandwani & Chaudhari [1] known as Fuzzy Deduction Graph (FDG) is presented. In an FDG, a systematic method of finding the Fuzzy <b>Reasoning</b> <b>Path</b> (FRP) already exists, {{which is based on}} Dijkstra‟s shortest path framework [2]. Our FRP algorithm is conglomeration of CYK algorithm of parsing and FRP algorithm for fuzzy reasoning which generates the path with the greatest fuzzy value. In FDG the weights of edges are real numbers in the fuzzy interval [0 - 1]. The maximum of multiplication is obtained on weights instead of minimum of summation of weights [1]. CYK algorithm employs a bottom up approach with the principle of Dynamic Programming (DP) to determine the FRP from source node to the destination node. The concurrency and synchronization in finding FRP process are inherently maintained through parallel PRAM model of construct. We present a complete formulation along with analysis of parallel algorithm for finding FRP...|$|E

While many of the components needed for building such a system have each made substantial progress in recent years—symbolic <b>reasoning,</b> <b>path</b> planning, grasp planning, and trajectory generation—and powerful algorithms for solving problems in individual areas are available, the general problem of robot task planning nevertheless remains a challenge.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} the blackboard model of problem solving to multidisciplinary design is discussed. Multidisciplinary design problems are complex, poorly structured, and lack a predetermined decision path from the initial starting point to the final solution. The final solution is achieved using data from different engineering disciplines. Ideally, for the final solution to be the optimum solution, {{there must be a}} significant amount of communication among the different disciplines plus intradisciplinary and interdisciplinary optimization. In reality, this is not what happens in today's sequential approach to multidisciplinary design. Therefore {{it is highly unlikely that}} the final solution is the true optimum solution from an interdisciplinary optimization standpoint. A multilevel decomposition approach is suggested as a technique to overcome the problems associated with the sequential approach, but no tool currently exists with which to fully implement this technique. A system based on the blackboard model of problem solving appears to be an ideal tool for implementing this technique because it offers an incremental problem solving approach that requires no a priori determined <b>reasoning</b> <b>path.</b> Thus it has the potential of finding a more optimum solution for the multidisciplinary design problems found in today's aerospace industries...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: An {{extended}} {{clinical examination}} (ECE) {{was administered to}} 85 final year medical students at the Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the psychometric quality and the suitability of the ECE as a measurement tool to assess the clinical proficiency of eight separate clinical skills. METHODS: Generalizability studies were conducted to determine the generalizability coefficient and the sources of variance of the ECE. An additional D-study was performed to estimate the generalizability coefficients with altering numbers of stations. RESULTS: The largest sources of variance were found in skill difficulties (36. 18 %), the general error term (26. 76 %) and in the rank ordering of skill difficulties across the stations (21. 89 %). The generalizability coefficient of the entire ECE was above the 0. 70 lower bound (G = 0. 74). D studies showed that the separate skills could yield sufficient G coefficients in seven out of eight skills, if the ECE was lengthened from 8 to 14 stations. DISCUSSION: The ECE proved to be a reliable clinical assessment that enables examinees to compose a clinical <b>reasoning</b> <b>path</b> through self-obtained data.

40|$|The state {{explosion}} {{problem has}} limited further research of Fuzzy Petri Net (FPN). With the rising scale of FPN, the algorithm complexity for related applications using FPN has also rapidly increased. To overcome this challenge, this research proposed three algorithms, which are transformation algorithm, decomposition algorithm and bidirectional reasoning algorithm {{to solve the}} state explosion problems of knowledge-based system (KBS) modelling and reasoning using FPN. Based on {{the goal of this}} research, the entire research is separated into two tasks, which are KBS modelling and reasoning using FPN. In modelling, a transformation algorithm has been proposed while in reasoning, decomposition and bidirectional reasoning algorithms have been proposed. In transformation, the algorithm is proposed to generate an equivalent large-scale FPN for the corresponding large-size KBS using a novel representation method of Fuzzy Production Rule (FPR). In decomposition, the algorithm is proposed to separate a large-scale FPN into a group of sub-FPNs by using a presented index function and incidence matrix. In bidirectional reasoning, the algorithm for optimal path is proposed to implement inference operations. Experimental results show that all proposed algorithms have successfully accomplished the requirements of each link of KBS modelling and reasoning using large-scale FPN. First, the proposed transformation algorithm owns ability to generate the corresponding FPN for the large-size KBS automatically. Second, the proposed decomposition owns ability to divide a large-scale FPN into a group of sub-FPNs based on the inner-reasoning-path. Lastly, the proposed bidirectional reasoning algorithm owns ability to implement inference for the goal output place in an optimal <b>reasoning</b> <b>path</b> by removal of irrelevant places and transitions.

40|$|Objective: Our {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} {{the implementation of a}} formal verification approach for medical protocols with graphical temporal <b>reasoning</b> <b>paths</b> to facilitate the understanding of verification steps. Materials and methods: Formal medical guideline specifications and background knowledge are represented through conceptual graphs, and reasoning is based on graph homomorphism. These materials explain the underlying principles or rationale that guide the functioning of verifications. Results: An illustration of this proposal is made using a medical protocol defining guidelines for the monitoring and prevention of nosocomial infections. Such infections, which are acquired in the hospital, increasemorbidity andmortality and add noticeably to economic burden. An evaluation of the use of the graphical verification found that this method aids in the improvement of both clinical knowledge and the quality of actions made. Discussion: As conceptual graphs, representations based on diagrams can be translated into computational tree logic. However, diagrams are much more natural and explicitly human, emphasizing a theoretical and practical consistency. Conclusion: The proposed approach allows for the visualmodeling of temporal reasoning and a formalization of knowledge that can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of nosocomial infections and some clinical problems. This {{is the first time that}} one emphasizes the temporal situation modeling in conceptual graphs. It will also deliver a formal verification method for clinical guideline analyses...|$|R

We make a comparison of a subgroup of these with experienced speech and language therapists, who were not part of the project team, also completed an assessment of one of these cases under the same conditions. Screen capture was used to record all on screen activity within PATSy web pages (i. e. mouse pointer position, hyperlink and button presses, page scrolling, browser navigation interactions and data entered); Verbal comments made by participants were analysed via a seven-level coding scheme that aimed to describe the events that occur in the process of diagnostic reasoning. Outcomes & Results: Students displayed a range of competence in making an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostically accurate students showed use of specific professional vocabulary, and a greater use of firm diagnostic statements. For the diagnostically inaccurate students, typical difficulties were a failure to interpret test results and video observations, difficulty in carrying out a sequence of tests consistent with a diagnostic <b>reasoning</b> <b>path,</b> and problems in recalling and using theoretical knowledge.

These modalities have been recently investigated with respect to the µ-calculus, which have provided succinctness, without affecting the satisfiability of the extended logic, i. e., it remains solvable in EXPTIME. A natural question that arises is how logics that allow <b>reasoning</b> about <b>paths</b> could be affected by considering graded path modalities. In this paper, we investigate this question in the case of the branching-time temporal logic CTL (GCTL, for short). We prove that, although GCTL is more expressive than CTL, the satisfiability problem for GCTL remains solvable in EXPTIME. This result is obtained by exploiting an automata-theoretic approach. In particular, we introduce the class of partitioning alternating Büchi tree automata and show that the emptiness problem for them is EXPTIME-COMPLETE. The satisfiability result turns even more interesting as we show that GCTL is exponentially more succinct than graded µ-calculus.
