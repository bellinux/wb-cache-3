Chemical analysis, {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies, wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the extracted fibers and cellulose microfibrils from ficus leaves.

40|$|WOS: 000240813000028 International audienceDifferent fibrous {{activated}} carbons {{were prepared}} from natural precursors (jute and coconut fibers) by {{physical and chemical}} activation. Physical activation consisted of the thermal treatment of <b>raw</b> <b>fibers</b> at 950 degrees C in an inert atmosphere followed by an activation step with CO 2 at the same temperature. In chemical activation, the <b>raw</b> <b>fibers</b> were impregnated in a solution of phosphoric acid and heated at 900 degrees C in an inert atmosphere. The characteristics of the fibrous activated carbons were determined in the following terms: elemental analysis, pore characteristics, SEM observation of the porous surface, and surface chemistry. As {{the objective of this}} study was the reuse of waste for industrial wastewater treatment, the adsorption properties of the activated carbons were tested towards pollutants representative of industrial effluents: phenol, the dye Acid Red 27 and Cu 2 + ions. Chemical activation by phosphoric acid seems the most suitable process to produce fibrous activated carbon from cellulose fiber. This method leads to an interesting porosity (S-BET up to 1500 m(2) g(- 1)), which enables a high adsorption capacity for micropollutants like phenol (reaching 181 mg g(- 1)). Moreover, it produces numerous acidic surface groups, which are involved in the adsorption mechanisms of dyes and metal ions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Originally, the Salish obtained wool high in the mountains where the mountain goats spent their summers and shed their old wool. Wool might be found caught or tangled in low bushes. During this season, they would also save wool acquired from goats killed for food. They would roll up the skin with flesh sides together and after several days, the wool would shed naturally. Then it was plucked off to be made into yarn.
