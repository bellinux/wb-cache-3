40|$|Background]: Field {{vaccination}} trials with Mycobacterium bovis BCG, an attenuated mutant of M. bovis, {{are ongoing}} in Spain, where the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) {{is regarded as}} the main driver <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> tuberculosis (TB). The oral baiting strategy consists in deploying vaccine baits twice each summer, in order to gain access to a high proportion of wild boar piglets. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the response of wild boar to re-vaccination with BCG and to subsequent challenge with an M. bovis field strain. [Results]: BCG re-vaccinated wild boar showed reductions of 75. 8 % in lesion score and 66. 9 % in culture score, as compared to unvaccinated controls. Only one of nine vaccinated wild boar had a culture-confirmed lung infection, as compared to seven of eight controls. Serum antibody levels were highly variable and did not differ significantly between BCG re-vaccinated wild boar and controls. Gamma IFN levels differed significantly between BCG re-vaccinated wild boar and controls. The mRNA levels for IL- 1 b, C 3 and MUT were significantly higher in vaccinated wild boar when compared to controls after vaccination and decreased after mycobacterial challenge. [Conclusions]: Oral <b>re-vaccination</b> <b>of</b> wild boar with BCG yields a strong protective response against challenge with a field strain. Moreover, <b>re-vaccination</b> <b>of</b> wild boar with BCG is not counterproductive. These findings are relevant given that re-vaccination is likely to happen under real (field) conditions.

5|$|The {{last major}} European {{outbreak}} of smallpox was in 1972 in Yugoslavia, after a pilgrim from Kosovo {{returned from the}} Middle East, where he had contracted the virus. The epidemic infected 175 people, causing 35 deaths. Authorities declared martial law, enforced quarantine, and undertook widespread <b>re-vaccination</b> <b>of</b> the population, enlisting {{the help of the}} WHO. In two months, the outbreak was over. Prior to this, there had been a smallpox outbreak in May–July 1963 in Stockholm, Sweden, brought from the Far East by a Swedish sailor; this had been dealt with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{assessed}} {{immunity to}} poliomyelitis in {{a representative sample}} of 1064 persons living in northern Greece.

For poliovirus type 3, a gap in immunity was found in individuals aged 10 – 29 years. <b>Re-vaccination</b> <b>of</b> adolescents living in northern Greece is suggested to ensure herd immunity and to minimise the risk of importation of wild poliovirus from endemic countries...|$|R

40|$|In Italy, the {{prevalence}} of Corynebacterium diphtheriae carriage is unknown. Throat swabs from 1970 healthy children, 6 to 14 years of age, were investigated. Three non-toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae biotype mitis, were isolated from as many healthy children. Molecular characterization of the these strains indicates {{that they have been}} persisting for at least 25 years and are endemic rather than having been imported from countries with current endemic or epidemic diphtheria. Although non-toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae occurring in the community are usually thought to be of little or no epidemiological importance, {{it may be possible to}} convert a non-toxigenic diphtheria strain into a toxigenic one by lysogenization with a specific temperate bacteriophage. Despite the virtual elimination of diphtheria in Italy, this long-standing circulation of non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae poses a potentially significant risk to public health and could result in the re-emergence of diphtheria in our country, even though the high proportion of younger population with protective levels of immunity is probably significant in preventing diphtheria spread. Therefore, it is important to maintain mandatory vaccination in childhood and to offer periodical <b>re-vaccination</b> <b>of</b> adults...|$|R

40|$|Like {{other areas}} <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science, the study <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> {{behaviour}} {{is becoming increasingly}} subject to eth-ical regulation and legislation. Sensible and well-informed regulation is to be welcomed both on compas-sionate grounds and because misuse <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is likely to compromise the science itself. However, {{it is evident that}} much of the impetus and direction in the regulation debate is coming from one particular corner <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science: that concerned with utilitarian and commercial interests taking place in con-trolled laboratory environments. This is sustained by an overemphasis on potential medical benefits as the perceived key selling point for animal science to a hostile public. Such a bias risks potentially unfor-tunate consequences for wider aspects <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science, and is unlikely to serve the best welfare interests <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> when viewed from their own biological perspective. I review some of the concerns that arise from this, and suggest that the study <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> behaviour has a uniquely important role to play both in the development <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> welfare science itself and in the public debate about the regulation <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science as a whole...|$|R
