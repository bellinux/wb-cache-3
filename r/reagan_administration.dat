5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{reputation}} underwent a renaissance during the <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> modern assessments of Coolidge's presidency are divided. He is adulated among advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire; supporters {{of an active}} central government generally view him less favorably, while both sides praise his stalwart support of racial equality.|$|E

5|$|Funding for Green Line {{construction}} {{fell into}} place in 1985.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E
5|$|Funding for {{construction}} of the Green Line was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was threatening to cut WMATA's funding by up to 26 percent to $184.5 {{million a year for}} four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> said that it would cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but administration officials said WMATA had more than enough money to complete the Green Line. Prince George's County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build the Green Line into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for defaults, and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.|$|E

5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany.

Paul stated that Treasury Secretary James Baker should be removed from his office for the administration's monetary policy.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the {{military}} {{strength of the}} non-KR groups within Cambodia was minimal, though their funding and civilian support was often greater than the KR.

5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave {{the door open for}} a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the <b>Reagan</b> <b>Administration</b> saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Reagan {{had given his}} first speech on the epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been {{diagnosed}} with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it. By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people {{had been diagnosed with}} AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it.

2500|$|The creation–evolution {{controversy}} {{has grown in}} importance in recent years, particularly {{as a result of}} the Southern strategy of the Republican Party strategist Kevin Phillips, during the Nixon and <b>Reagan</b> <b>administrations</b> in the U.S. He saw that the Civil Rights Movement had alienated many poor white southern voters of the Bible Belt and set out to capture this electorate through an alliance with the [...] "New Right" [...] Christian right movement.|$|R
50|$|The ambassadorship {{continued}} to hold this status through the Ford, Carter, and <b>Reagan</b> <b>administrations</b> but was removed from cabinet rank by George H. W.

5|$|In the 1980s, Scott Armstrong {{attempted}} to convince Edward Bennett Williams, then {{the owner of}} the Baltimore Orioles, to play a game of Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the <b>Reagan</b> <b>Administration,</b> which opposed having any business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The <b>Reagan</b> <b>Administration</b> opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
5|$|The LSA aims {{to advance}} the {{scientific}} study of language and accomplishes this goal through advocacy efforts.

Around that same time, the LSA began working with other professional organizations to meet and exchange research as part of the Consortium of Social Science Associations (COSSA). During the <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> after cuts to social science funding in 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded COSSA as an advocacy effort for the funding of social science research.|$|E
