She then joined Convoy ON 264, which departed Southend that day and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States on 21 November. Empire Cowdray left the convoy to unload her coal at Baltimore, Maryland and then sailed to Philadelphia, where a cargo of grain and crated aircraft was loaded. She then joined Convoy UGS 63, which departed the Hampton Roads, Virginia on 11 December and arrived at Gibraltar on 27 December. She did not dock at Gibraltar, but proceeded to Bizerta, Tunisia, arriving on 31 December and leaving that day for Cagliari, Italy, where she arrived on 2 January 1945. Empire Cowdray was the first Allied merchant ship into Cagliari after Germany forces had left Sardinia. Several ships had been sunk as blockships and all the cranes in the harbour had been sabotaged. The ship was unloaded using her own derricks. There was no motor transport available so transport of her cargo was by horse and cart, which slowed down the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E
500|$|To {{increase}} the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> the Tug and Lighter Company, a unit which {{had served in}} the Siege of Tobruk, was sent to Port Moresby. On arrival on 23 August, it found only two lighters and no tugboats. It improvised, repairing the wharf's crane and salvaging tackle from the wreck of the Macdhui. Harbour craft arrived on Liberty ships {{over the next couple of}} months, but no more than one tug and ten lighters were available at any time during 1942. The African-American 611th Port Company arrived in June, and an Australian docks operating company in mid-September. Major R. C. Ballantyne, who had been in charge of wharf operations at Tobruk, was appointed Docks Superintendent. [...] Unloading was still slowed by the lack of storage space in the wharf area. The dumps had been dispersed in the hills up to [...] from Port Moresby, the roads were poor, and there was a serious shortage of trucks to move stores from the wharf to the dumps.|$|E
500|$|Eight ships {{bound for}} Port Moresby were lying idle off Townsville or Cairns on 12 October, {{waiting to be}} called forward. General Headquarters (GHQ) SWPA {{estimated}} that at the current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> it would take two weeks before they were called forward. Ironically, five of them were carrying equipment and stores needed to upgrade the port facilities. Extending the wharf required piling and heavy timber that was not immediately available. Matthews decided on a bold plan. Tatana Island, about [...] west of Port Moresby, had deep water off its northwest side. About a [...] offshore, it was separated from the mainland by shallow water with a coral reef bottom. He proposed taking the 2nd Battalion, 96th General Service Regiment off its work on aerodrome maintenance and refuelling and rearming aircraft, {{and use them to}} construct a causeway from the mainland to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks could be built. The materials required were immediately available, but doubts were expressed about whether a causeway could withstand the force of storms and tides. Lacking boats for a [...] hydrographic survey, one was conducted by wading during an exceptionally low tide in late September.|$|E
50|$|During normal {{lead-acid}} battery operation, lead sulfate crystals grow {{on the negative}} electrode during discharging and dissolve again during charging. The formation of these crystals is called sulfation. Over time sulfation can become permanent, as some crystals grow and resist being dissolved. This is particularly the case when the battery is forced to perform at very high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> which tends to promote lead sulfate crystal growth {{on the surface of}} the electrode. At moderate <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> the lead sulfate crystals grow throughout the cross section of the electrode plate (which has a sponge-like consistency) since the electrolyte (dilute sulfuric acid) is drawn diffused through the body of the electrode to allow the reaction can take place throughout the plate.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. There {{has been}} a lack of {{reliable}} national data {{on the number of}} pregnant women using drugs and the number of newborns affected by such use. The major reasons for this lack have been inadequate sampling and data collection procedures and the lack of a risk assessment perspective in analysis. This paper corrects for these inadequacies. METHODS. Data from 1979 through 1990 from the National Hospital Discharge Survey, an annual survey by the National Center for Health Statistics, were analyzed. RESULTS. Between 1979 and 1990 there was a 576 % increase in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharges</b> <b>of</b> drug-using parturient women in the United States and a 456 % increase in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharges</b> <b>of</b> drug-affected newborns. After adjustment for underreporting, a "best estimate" of the number <b>of</b> <b>discharges</b> from 1988 through 1990 was about 88, 000 per year for drug-using parturient women and about 48, 000 per year for drug-affected newborns. CONCLUSIONS. Although the data support the occurrence of a national epidemic of drug use among pregnant women during the 1980 s, the size and severity of this epidemic have been overstated...|$|R

Its proximity to the ocean in the lower basin affects its rise and fall with tides and salinity.

Tides typically raise the river level about [...] at Jacksonville, decreasing some to [...] at Orange Park where the river widens, and increasing back to [...] at Palatka as it narrows. As a result of tidal effects, discharge measurements in the lower basin are often inaccurate. However, the estimated <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> between the Ocklawaha River and the center of Jacksonville ranges from [...] per second.

Farther upriver, the discharge rate ranges from [...] per second near Lake Poinsett to [...] per second near DeLand. The confluence of numerous springs, the Econlockhatchee River, and the Wekiva River causes the average discharge to increase by [...] per second between Lake Harney and DeLand, representing the greatest annual average increase of streamflow along the St. Johns.|$|E
