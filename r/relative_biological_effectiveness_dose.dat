40|$|Background:Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) play an {{important}} role in non–small-cell lung cancer recurrence and metastasis. We sought to determine whether CSC-like cells respond differentially to proton and photon beam therapies. Methods:CSC-enriched cells from paclitaxel-resistant human H 460 and A 549 cell lines were irradiated with the same <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>dose</b> and analyzed for cell viability, clonogenic survival, apoptosis, cell migration, cell invasiveness, tumor sphere formation, and CSC markers. The intracellular concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured before and after irradiation. Results:Compared with photons, protons caused significantly lower cell viability in chemoresistant cells and, in CSC-like cells, significantly lower clonogenic survival, invasiveness, and number of tumor spheres; less migration and CSC markers (coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, β-catenin, and side population cells); more apoptosis; and higher ROS level. CSC-like cells contained less than half the ROS levels of parental cancer cells or normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Conclusions:CSC-like cells may be more sensitive to irradiation with protons than photons. The increased sensitivity could be caused by the greater ROS generated by protons. Because chemoresistant CSCs {{play an important}} role in tumor recurrence, protons may be more effective than photons in eliminating recurrent or persistent non–small-cell lung cancer...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{method was}} {{developed}} to convert clinically prescribed RBE (<b>Relative</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>Effectiveness)</b> -weighted <b>doses</b> from the approach used at the Heavy-Ion Medical Accelerator (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Science, Chiba, Japan, to the LEM (Local Effect Model) -based TReatment planning for Particles (TRiP 98) approach used in the pilot project at the GSI Helmholtzzentrum, Darmstadt, and the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The proposed conversion method {{is based on a}} simulation of the fixed spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) depth dose profiles as used for the irradiation at HIMAC by LEM/TRiP 98 and a recalculation of the resulting RBE-weighted dose distribution. We present data according to the clinical studies conducted at GSI in the past decade (LEM I), as well as data used in current studies (refined LEM version: LEM IV). RESULTS: We found conversion factors (RBE-weighted dose LEM/RBE-weighted dose HIMAC) reaching from 0. 4 to 2. 0 for prescribed carbon ion doses from 1 to 60 Gy (RBE) for SOBP extensions ranging from 20 to 120 mm according to the HIMAC approach. A conversion factor of 1. 0 was found for approximately 5 Gy (RBE). The conversion factor decreases with increasing prescribed dose. Slightly smaller values for the LEM IV-based data set compared with LEM I were found. A significant dependence of the conversion factor from the SOBP width could be observed in particular for LEM IV, whereas the depth dependence was found to be small. CONCLUSIONS: For the interpretation and comparison of clinical trials performed at HIMAC and GSI/HIT, it is of extreme importance to consider these conversion factors because according to the various methods to determine the RBE-weighted dose, similar dose values might not necessarily be related to similar clinical outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Ion beam therapy, as an {{emerging}} radiation therapy modality, requires continuous {{efforts to develop}} and improve tools for patient treatment planning (TP) and research applications. Dose and fluence computation algorithms using the Monte Carlo (MC) technique have served for decades as reference tools for accurate dose computations for radiotherapy. In this work, a novel MC-based treatment-planning (MCTP) tool for ion beam therapy using the pencil beam scanning technique is presented. It allows single-field and simultaneous multiple-fields optimization for realistic patient treatment conditions and for dosimetric quality assurance for irradiation conditions at state-of-the-art ion beam therapy facilities. It employs iterative procedures that allow for the optimization of absorbed <b>dose</b> and <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> (RBE) -weighted <b>dose</b> using radiobiological input tables generated by external RBE models. Using a re-implementation of the local effect model (LEM), the MCTP tool is able to perform TP studies using ions with atomic numbers Z < 8. Example treatment plans created with the MCTP tool are presented for carbon ions in comparison with a certified analytical treatment-planning system. Furthermore, the usage of the tool to compute and optimize mixed-ion treatment plans, i. e. plans including pencil beams of ions with different atomic numbers, is demonstrated.

In this work, a newly developed MC-based treatment planning (MCTP) tool for proton therapy is proposed to support treatment planning studies and research applications. It allows for single-field and simultaneous multiple-field optimization in realistic treatment scenarios {{and is based on}} the MC code FLUKA. <b>Relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> (RBE) -weighted <b>dose</b> is optimized either with the common approach using a constant RBE of 1. 1 or using a variable RBE according to radiobiological input tables. A validated reimplementation of the local effect model was used in this work to generate radiobiological input tables. Examples of treatment plans in water phantoms and in patient-CT geometries together with an experimental dosimetric validation of the plans are presented for clinical treatment parameters as used at the Italian National Center for Oncological Hadron Therapy. To conclude, a versatile MCTP tool for proton therapy was developed and validated for realistic patient treatment scenarios against dosimetric measurements and commercial analytical TP calculations.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common primary {{malignant}} bone tumor in children and adolescents. For effective treatment, local control of the tumor is absolutely critical, because the chances of long term survival are EURAMOS 1. Local photon radiotherapy has previously been used in small series and in an uncontrolled, highly individualized fashion, which, however, documented that high dose radiotherapy can, in principle, be used to achieve local control. Generally the radiation dose that is necessary for a curative approach can hardly be achieved with conventional photon radiotherapy in patients with non-resectable tumors that are usually located near radiosensitive critical organs such as the brain, the spine or the pelvis. In these cases particle Radiotherapy (proton therapy (PT) /heavy ion therapy (HIT) may offer a promising new alternative. Moreover, compared with photons, heavy ion beams provide a higher physical selectivity because of their finite depth coverage in tissue. They achieve a higher <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Phase I/II <b>dose</b> escalation studies of HIT in adults with non-resectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas have already shown favorable results. Methods/Design This is a monocenter, single-arm study for patients ≥ 6 years of age with non-resectable osteosarcoma. Desired target dose is 60 - 66 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (Gy E) with 45 Gy PT (proton therapy) and a carbon ion boost of 15 - 21 GyE. Weekly fractionation of 5 - 6 × 3 Gy E is used. PT/HIT will be administered exclusively at the Ion Radiotherapy Center in Heidelberg. Furthermore, FDG-PET imaging characteristics of non-resectable osteosarcoma before and after PT/HIT will be investigated prospectively. Systemic disease before and after PT/HIT is targeted by standard chemotherapy protocols and is not part of this trial. Discussion The primary objectives of this trial are the determination of feasibility and toxicity of HIT. Secondary objectives are tumor response, disease free survival and overall survival. The aim is to improve outcome for patients with non-resectable osteosarcoma. Trail Registration Registration number (ClinicalTrials. gov) : NCT 01005043 </p...|$|R
40|$|Proton therapy dose is {{affected}} by <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> differently than X-ray therapies. The current clinically accepted weighting factor is 1. 1 at all positions along the depth–dose profile. However, the <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> correlates with the linear energy transfer, cell or tissue type, and the dose per fraction causing variation of <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> along the depth–dose profile.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{hypothesize that}} {{flattening}} filter free (FFF) high dose rate irradiation will decrease cell survival in normal and cancer cells with more pronounced effects in DNA repair deficient cells. Additionally, we hypothesize that {{removal of the}} flattening filter will result in an enhanced <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> independent of the dose rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clonogenic survival was assessed after exposure to dose rates of 4 or 24 Gy/min (FFF 10 megavolt [MV] photon beam) using a Varian TrueBeam accelerator. Additionally, cells were exposed to 4 Gy/min with or without flattening filter. <b>Relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> estimations were performed comparing the different beam photon spectra. RESULTS: Cell survival in tumor and normal cell lines was not influenced by high dose rate irradiation. The intrinsic radiation sensitivity of DNA repair deficient cells was not affected by high dose rate compared to normal dose rate. Furthermore, the <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> was {{not significantly different from}} unity in any of the cell lines for both FFF and conventional flattened beam exposures. CONCLUSIONS: High dose rate irradiation did not affect long-term survival and DNA repair for cell lines of different tissues.

50|$|Since {{irradiation}} {{increases with}} {{proximity to the}} source of radiation, and as it is impossible to distance or shield an internal source, radioactive materials inside the body can deliver much higher doses to the host organs than they normally would from outside the body.

Some have hypothesized that alpha's high <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> might be attributable to cell's tendency to absorb transuranic metals into the cellular nucleus where they would be in very close proximity to the genome, though an elevated effectiveness can also be observed for external alpha radiation in cellular studies.

The earlier latency and increasing effectiveness that is fund with HZE ions that are similar to those in earlier studies with neutrons, together with the lack of response of gamma rays that is seen in many low-dose studies, suggests that the scaling concepts that are used in current risk assessment approaches are unable to describe important qualitative effects, and that <b>relative</b> <b>biological</b> <b>effectiveness</b> factors may, in principle, be indefinable or a faulty concept.|$|R
