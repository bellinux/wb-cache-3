40|$|The oscillatory {{pressure}} disturbance {{created by}} the refrigerant flow through pipes and components {{is one of the}} main sources of noise in <b>household</b> <b>refrigerators.</b> This <b>type</b> of excitation is transmitted to the pipes and travels through the structure reaching the cabinet and other parts exposed to the air, where audible airborne sound waves are created. In order to get a better understanding of this type of noise a <b>household</b> <b>refrigerator</b> was especially instrumented with thermocouples, absolute and dynamic pressure transducers and accelerometers. Tests were carried out at different operating conditions, when it was found that the compressor was the main source of excitation, practically affecting the entire refrigeration loop. It was also found that the flow velocity at the outlet of the capillary tube was high enough to induce significant vibrations in the evaporator. Finally, it was found that the entrance of vapor bubbles in the capillary tube produces sporadic and strong excitations. However those excitations do not travel very far along the flow, being attenuated by the condenser and the evaporator, but can nevertheless be transmitted to the pipes. In view of the collected database, comments and suggestions concerning the design of <b>household</b> <b>refrigerators</b> are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|To {{become a}} homeowner, it is {{necessary}} to have sufficient resources and stability in the household situation. In existing studies, <b>household</b> <b>type</b> is often used as a proxy forlevel of stability. <b>Household</b> <b>types</b> with a highlevel of commitment (married couples without and with children) are regarded as stable households, and singles and cohabitors as less stable households. In this paper, it is argued that stability can be reached not only by making a commitment, but also by growing older. Increasing age brings stability into the lives of singles and cohabitors. Age also matters for the structure of resources and costs of different <b>household</b> <b>types.</b> From a combination of theory on age and theory on homeownership in the life course, five hypotheses are derived. They are tested on retrospective data by using discrete-time event-history analysis. From a model with interaction effects, it can be seen whether the probability of becoming a homeowner differs between <b>household</b> <b>types</b> in differentage groups. The results show that married couples have the highest probability of becoming homeowners in age group 18 - 24, whereas the probability is highest for cohabitors inage group 25 - 29, and in age group 30 - 34 for singles. This supports the idea that people become homeowners either when they make a commitment, or when stability is created through the passage of time in a less committing <b>household</b> <b>type...</b>|$|R

We assessed whether associations among family relationships, parenting stress, and child outcomes were {{different in the}} 2 <b>household</b> <b>types.</b> Methods: Parental and child characteristics were matched for 95 female same-sex parent and 95 different-sex parent households with children 6 to 17 years old. One parent per household was interviewed by telephone. Multivariate analyses of variance and multiple linear regressions were conducted. Results: No differences were observed between <b>household</b> <b>types</b> on family relationships or any child outcomes. Same-sex parent households scored higher on parenting stress (95 % confidence interval = 2. 03 – 2. 30) than different-sex parent households (95 % confidence interval = 1. 76 – 2. 03), p =. 006. No significant interactions between <b>household</b> <b>type</b> and family relationships or <b>household</b> <b>type</b> and parenting stress were found for any child outcomes.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{increasing}} variability will have especially profound adverse impacts upon {{the lives of}} rural communities in developing countries. However, households have differing asset bases and livelihood strategies, and therefore may {{have variable levels of}} vulnerability. Designing appropriate climate adaptation strategies must take these differences into account. This study examined the heterogeneity of vulnerability amongst rural communities in Lombok, Indonesia, and considers implications for climate adaptation policy interventions. Three villages, with differing natural resource bases, were selected as case studies: forest, rain-fed agriculture, and coastal fisheries and aquaculture. Based on a questionnaire survey (n= 250), a household typology was generated. Cannon's (2008) vulnerability framework was applied to analyse the factors driving vulnerability for each <b>household</b> <b>type</b> in the villages. Interviews (n= 72) with individuals from different <b>household</b> <b>types</b> were also employed to determine their perceptions about vulnerability and adaptation preferences. Participatory focus group discussions and social network mapping were also utilised to triangulate causes of vulnerability and dependencies between <b>household</b> <b>types.</b> Three main key conclusions emerged. First, although climate variability contributes to increased livelihood vulnerability, the degradation of traditional institutions through modernisation and social change was considered to be a more serious problem. In particular, traditional institutions are an important source of adaptive capacity for poorer households. Second, community structures are complex, with different <b>household</b> <b>types</b> depending on one another for support. Social cohesion and mutual assistance are important for maintaining livelihood activities both in difficult times and during normal daily situations. Third, current development programs do not account for this variability of <b>household</b> <b>types,</b> their adaptation needs or the linkages between them. As a result, wealthier households benefit more than poorer ones, and there is little evidence of 'trickle down' benefits from rich to poor. This inequality could potentially lead to maladaptation. These patterns were similar across all case study villages. However, the dynamic interactions among <b>households</b> <b>types</b> differed based on the strength of social cohesion and local institutions. Therefore adaptation policies must be better designed and be more egalitarian. Specifically they must restore and maintain traditional institutions and social capital. The 'vulnerability components framework' from Cannon (2008) was used to identify necessary intervention points for different <b>household</b> <b>types.</b> These components are interlinked to each other and enable understanding of what causes some people to be more at risk of a hazard than others...|$|R
