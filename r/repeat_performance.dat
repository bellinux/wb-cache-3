5|$|A <b>repeat</b> <b>performance</b> of BWV243a {{may have}} {{accompanied}} the first performance of BWV10 on 2July 1724. The libretto of the cantata performed in Leipzig at {{the feast of}} the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible author of this Magnificat paraphrase. Around a decade before the libretto was reprinted in Leipzig it had already been set by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the libretto, neither which setting of the libretto was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in Leipzig. A year later Bach performed Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande, JLB13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's libretto for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the libretto, surviving without music, starts with a dictum quoted from Luther's German translation of Luke1:46–47.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is all the more remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one <b>repeat</b> <b>performance,</b> and a new piece was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E

She presented a <b>repeat</b> <b>performance</b> before receiving an invitation to stage the play once more at the Café Pittoresque, a well-known cabaret. Having lost her jester-like puppet, she wrote two new plays and performed them with her husband. They were adaptations of Ivan Krylov's fables The Hermit and the Bear and Two Mice. She gave several other performances with her husband, at cafés, friends' homes and at the Hermitage Theatre between 1916 and 1918.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} post-task activities on the TEFL students’ fluency and accuracy in oral production. In particular, the study seeks to discover the effect {{of different types of}} <b>repeated</b> <b>performance</b> (i. e., public and private) as post-task activities on fluency and accuracy of oral production. Our premise is in line with Ellis’s (1994) idea that these types of activities can promote learning. The participants were all TEFL students studying at Iranian universities and institutes. They were assigned into four groups. They all participated in pre and post interview sessions. The students in group A <b>repeated</b> their <b>performance</b> in private. The students in group B <b>repeated</b> their <b>performance</b> {{in front of the class}} and the students in group C as the last experimental group <b>repeated</b> their <b>performance</b> both in public and private. The students in group D as the control group didn’t have any <b>repeated</b> <b>performance.</b> The results indicated that group B outperformed all other groups in fluency.

25|$|The years {{leading up}} to the Second World War were marked by solid efforts for improvement. Ulbrich and Sandreuter, the voice teacher, fell in love and were married on July 11, 1936. Also in 1936, Alfred Courvoisier assumed the presidency. In December, 1938, the choir {{undertook}} a half-hour radio program for the first time. The high point of the year, however, had already taken place on May 12, 1938: their participation in the premiere of Arthur Honegger's Jeanne d'Arc au Bûcher at Theater Basel with Ida Rubinstein as Jeanne and the chamber orchestra Basler Kammerorchester under the direction of Paul Sacher. A <b>repeat</b> <b>performance</b> with the boys' choir took place at the Swiss national exposition in Zürich in 1939.|$|E
25|$|India scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni {{contributing}} 68 {{in their}} first match of 2006 against Pakistan. However, the team finished poorly scoring just 43 runs {{in the last eight}} overs and lost the match due to Duckworth-Lewis method. In the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2–1 lead in the series. The final match of the series had a <b>repeat</b> <b>performance</b> as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series 4–1. Due to his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook Ricky Ponting as number one in the ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April 2006. His reign lasted just a week as Adam Gilchrist's performance against Bangladesh moved him to the top spot.|$|E
25|$|After touring England with West Indies in 1963, {{he moved}} to the North Staffordshire and South Cheshire League in 1964 to play for Norton Cricket Club, who duly won the league title. Sobers made 549 runs in 18 innings at 49.90, {{finishing}} second in the league averages behind only his amateur brother Gerald, also playing for Norton, who averaged 50.12. Gary Sobers did even better with the ball, his 97 wickets at 8.38 heading the league averages. 1965 saw a <b>repeat</b> <b>performance</b> with Norton again winning the league and, though Sobers only averaged 25.38 with the bat, he again topped the league bowling averages with 76 wickets at 8.03. Norton lost the league title in 1966 while Sobers was touring England with West Indies but regained it in 1967 when he returned. He was fourth in the 1967 league batting averages with 41.83 and third in the bowling with 95 wickets at 9.37 (the two bowlers with better averages took only 22 and 24 wickets).|$|E

25|$|Sabatini {{started the}} 1995 season by {{reaching}} the semifinals in Sydney, where she faced Mary Joe Fernández {{in what was}} a rematch of the previous year. At the 1994 Sydney tournament, Fernández put Sabatini away in straight sets in that semifinal encounter. This time, she won in straight sets, snapping a three match losing streak against Fernandez. Sabatini then defeated Lindsay Davenport in the final in straight sets in {{what was to be}} the last singles title of her career. At the 1995 Australian Open, Sabatini, seeded fifth, was dismissed by Marianne Werdel in the first round. In the semifinals of the Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne, Sabatini was leading Kimiko Date 6–1, 5–1 before squandering three match points and double faulting 18 times as Date rallied to beat Sabatini with a scoreline of 1–6, 7–6, 7–6. It {{turned out to be a}} <b>repeat</b> <b>performance</b> of the 1993 French Open quarterfinals, where Sabatini lost an identical lead of 6–1, 5–1 against Mary Joe Fernández. At the 1995 French Open, Sabatini looked to put that memory behind her when she faced second seeded Steffi Graf in the quarterfinals. However, Graf proved too strong for Sabatini and won in straight sets. Later that summer at Wimbledon, Sabatini, seeded eighth, lost to defending champion and third-seeded Conchita Martínez of Spain in the quarterfinals. Martínez had clearly turned the tables against Sabatini in their rivalry, beating Sabatini four out of their last five meetings. At the final grand slam of the year, the US Open in New York, Sabatini beat Martina Hingis in the round of 16. She then defeated Mary Joe Fernández in the quarterfinals before losing to top-seeded Graf. With the victory, Graf had now got the best of Sabatini in eight consecutive matches. Against Graf, this also marked the 40th match and final time the two would meet since their rivalry began in 1985 with Graf winning 29.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata for the First Sunday after Trinity on 23 June 1726. The precise dating of the autograph manuscript was only determined fairly recently by authorities on Bach, particularly those like Alfred Dürr, Christoph Wolff and Klaus Hofmann {{who were involved}} in preparing Urtext editions for the Neue Bach-Ausgabe and establishing the Bach Archive in Leipzig. The circumstances surrounding the composition were clarified by other Bach scholars, notably William H. Scheide and Konrad Küster. Before the dating was known, several commentators had given 1732 as the date of composition, dubbing it the [...] "Refugee Cantata", supposedly composed in response to the arrival in Germany of Protestants banished from Salzburg; it is unknown whether there was a <b>repeat</b> <b>performance</b> of the cantata to commemorate that event.|$|E

500|$|From 1842 onwards, Chopin {{showed signs}} of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: [...] "I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much." [...] He was forced by illness to decline a written {{invitation}} from Alkan {{to participate in a}} <b>repeat</b> <b>performance</b> of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Érard's on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him [...] "hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
500|$|The group {{spent a year}} {{recording}} {{their first}} album, Days Are Gone, in sessions between live shows. The group experimented with drum machines and the music program GarageBand, adding hip hop and R influences to their existing sound. Polydor recommended producers Ariel Rechtshaid and James Ford {{to help with the}} album, who suggested further use of synthesizers, bringing the album closer to a straighforward pop style. Several of the drum tracks were recorded with gated reverb, made famous by Phil Collins. In June 2013, the group performed at Glastonbury Festival, and in addition to their own set, the band appeared with Primal Scream performing background vocals on [...] "It's Alright, It's OK", [...] "Rocks" [...] and [...] "Come Together".
