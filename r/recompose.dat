25|$|Isaac Newton {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into {{a spectrum of}} colours, and that a lens and a second prism could <b>recompose</b> the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that {{regardless of whether it}} was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours. The interest of the Royal Society encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour (later expanded into Opticks). Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Newton (1643–1727) {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into {{a spectrum of}} colours, and that a lens and a second prism could <b>recompose</b> the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that {{regardless of whether it}} was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave-particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the first}} {{performance}} Handel made numerous revisions to his manuscript score, {{in part to}} match the forces available for the 1742 Dublin premiere; {{it is probable that}} his work was not performed as originally conceived in his lifetime. [...] Between 1742 and 1754 he continued to revise and <b>recompose</b> individual movements, sometimes to suit the requirements of particular singers. The first published score of Messiah was issued in 1767, eight years after Handel's death, though this was based on relatively early manuscripts and included none of Handel's later revisions.|$|E

500|$|On March 5, 1999, {{the album}} Silent Hill Original Soundtracks was {{released}} in Japan. The 41st track on the CD, the ending theme [...] "Esperándote", was composed by Rika Muranaka. After Yamaoka had approached her to create {{a piece of music}} for the game, she suggested the use of bandoneóns, violins, and a Spanish-speaking singer. It was decided to make the song a tango, and Muranaka composed the melody for the English lyrics she had conceived. When she arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to record the translated Spanish lyrics with Argentine singer Vanesa Quiroz, Muranaka realized that the syllables did not match the melodic line any more, and she had to <b>recompose</b> it in five minutes.|$|E
500|$|Sandman's theme uses [...] "two {{contrabass}} saxophones, two contrabass clarinets, two contrabass bassoons {{and eight}} very low French horns" [...] to sound [...] "low, aggressive and heavy". Young described Venom's theme as [...] "Vicious, my instructions {{on that one}} were that he's the devil personified. His theme is much more demonic sounding." [...] Venom's theme uses eight French horns. Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance, but rejected the initial music {{to the birth of}} Sandman, finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough. Young had to <b>recompose</b> much of his score at a later stage, as the producers felt there were not enough themes from the previous films. Ultimately, new themes for the love story, Aunt May, and Mary Jane were dropped.|$|E
500|$|In Dhaka, East Pakistan (now in Bangladesh), Harvey made 96 on a matting pitch over {{rough ground}} in the First Test, {{mastering}} the medium pace of Fazal Mahmood, while his teammates struggled to score. In {{the course of the}} innings, Harvey had to overcome a fever, dysentery and physical illness, which forced him to leave six times to <b>recompose</b> himself. Gideon Haigh called it [...] "one of his most dazzling innings". Described by Benaud as [...] "one of the best innings at Test level", it set up an Australian win. During his stay at the crease, his partners contributed 48 runs while seven wickets fell. Harvey's innings allowed Australia to score 225 in reply to the hosts' 200. Harvey then made 30 in the second innings to help ensure an eight-wicket win.|$|E

2500|$|Until {{the late}} modern era, the {{standard}} Jewish belief was that after one dies, one's immortal soul joins God {{in the world}} to come while one's body decomposes.

[...] The idea of a messianic age has a prominent place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of days.

2500|$|He {{starts out}} by admitting that Kenney chose a topic {{unfamiliar}} and more abstract than what people {{would normally be}} used to. Undercutting this idea, however, he argues that without doing so, the {{breadth and depth of}} Kenney's poetry {{as well as that of}} poetry in general, would be very limited. [...] "With its agreeable eddies of temperament, reflections that braid and shatter only to <b>recompose</b> downstream, this book moves like a river in a country of ponds." [...] Then Merrill continues to illustrate Kenney's stylistic approach by praisefully describing the beautiful imagery that he creates by combining, or [...] "doubling," [...] select words. He goes further as to describe Kenney's stylistic approach as [...] "rendering a given scene in sound so artful and imagery so burnished by myth that words appear to have found their poet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{presidents of}} the Mercosur {{countries}} (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Venezuela) said in July 2013 that they would lift the suspension after the inauguration of Paraguay's newly elected President, Horacio Cartes, on 15 August 2013. However, Paraguay {{said it would not}} return to the Mercosur fold as long as Venezuela held its rotating presidency. Venezuela holds Mercosur's rotating presidency until July 2014. Paraguay has objected to Venezuela's inclusion in the trading bloc, and says that a new member can only be included after a unanimous vote and argues that such a vote should not have been held while Paraguay was suspended. Foreign Minister Eladio Loizaga said he would rather deal with Paraguay's neighbours individually at first. [...] "We have pending issues with Argentina, with Uruguay; we have to <b>recompose</b> all that," [...] he said. [...] "Mercosur will be later because our priority are [...] the bilateral relations," [...] he added.|$|E

The fight {{took place at the}} Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield. Khan was able to control some of the fight and managed to survive a fourth-round knockdown from Diaz. Khan managed to hold on throughout the fight to go onto win the fight by a fairly close unanimous decision. The scorecards; Phil Edwards 114–113 – Steve Gray 115–113 – Terry O'Connor 115–112. In the aftermath, Khan praised Díaz, He caught me while I was off balance, and I couldn't get my stance back. I went down. I kept moving to <b>recompose</b> myself. That's what happens. There are little things to work on when we go back in the gym." [...] Khan stated the fight could be his last in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{the cleanup}} is a last minute job {{that could not}} be {{completed}} during production. In [...] "Fever", time constraints forced the production team to rely on Entity FX to create the Talon marquee that hangs outside of the building, something that they typically do not do. While filming the shots in Hamilton's lab that involved kryptonite, the special effects team had to go in during post-production for [...] "Duplicity" [...] and make the kryptonite glow, because the material used in production to make the kryptonite glow did not photograph well. A last minute change in the storyline for [...] "Skinwalker" [...] required Entity FX to digitally adjust the opening teaser. In the original scene that was filmed, a wolf watched the aftermath of an explosion at the LuthorCorp construction site. It was decided that the wolf would watch the explosion as it happened, so Entity FX {{had to go back to}} the scene and <b>recompose</b> it. Hiding the head of the trainer who was holding onto the wolf, Entity FX digitally corrected the color composition and the lighting around the wolf so that it appears as though the explosion was occurring right in front of the wolf.|$|E
