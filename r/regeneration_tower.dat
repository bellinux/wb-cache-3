40|$|Along {{with the}} widely use in {{industries}} and lives, the dehumidification systems have consumed {{a large amount}} of energy. Fortunately, the application of liquid desiccant dehumidification system can greatly reduce the consumption of high-grade energies. To improve the advantages of liquid desiccant system compared with the conventional dehumidification system, one of the key measures is to increase the efficiency of the regeneration sub-system. In this study, models for the <b>regeneration</b> <b>tower</b> and counter-current heat exchanger, which are recognized by previous experiments, are employed and the corresponding VC++ computer program modules are used to describe the heat and mass transfer processes between the liquid desiccant solution and moist air in the regenerator and the heat transfer process in heat exchanger respectively. The orthogonal design is used to arrange the numerical experiment. The results are analyzed by the method of variance analysis to determine the relative significance of operating parameters and the interactions between them. The analysis on the influence factors shows that for the evaporation rate of water vapor in the regenerator, the important parameters are the inlet temperature and concentration of the solution, the mass flow ratio of dry air to dehydrated desiccant, and the NTU of the regenerator. For the regeneration efficiency, the mass flow ratio of dry air to dehydrated desiccant, the NTU of the regenerator and inlet temperature of solution are important parameters. There is no interaction that influences the evaporation rate of water vapor and the regeneration efficiency significantly...|$|E
40|$|In this study, an amine {{sweetening}} {{plant to}} a typical natural gas {{of the northern}} region of Argentina was simulated, using the regular operating conditions {{of this type of}} plant. The simulation was performed with the commercial simulator Aspen-Hysys® V 7. 1, used in oil and gas industry. The sweetening is carried out in a system mainly composed by an absorber and a <b>regeneration</b> <b>towers.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a sensitivity analysis to identify key operational variables of the sweetening process; these variables will be considered in a next optimization study. Identified variables are: temperature and CO 2 concentration, in the regenerated amine stream and, flow and gas flow to be treated, in the absorber tower the amine...|$|R
40|$|Conventionally, CO 2 removal {{requires}} {{the use of}} a water-based amine solution and large absorber and <b>regeneration</b> <b>towers.</b> The capital and ongoing operational costs for this process are substantial, and the use (regeneration and disposal) of the amine solution can be problematic from the perspectives of both safety and the environment. Nitrogen can also be a problematic impurity in natural gas. In this work, a newly developed method is applied to accurately predict the carbon dioxide and nitrogen adsorption isotherms at low temperatures and pressures up to saturation for a commercial carbon molecular sieve as a function of temperature and partial pressure of these components. Accurate prediction of such data is useful in evaluating the feasibility of using pressure swing adsorption to separate nitrogen and carbon dioxide from natural gases at cryogenic temperatures for carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The proposed method showed consistently accurate results across the investigated wide pressure and temperature ranges with an average absolute deviation of less than 1 % for both nitrogen and carbon dioxide. This is expected to benefit in making informed design decisions for the selection of adsorbents for a given application in any process industry...|$|R

40|$|Conventionally, {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) removal {{requires}} {{the use of}} a water-based amine solution and large absorber and <b>regeneration</b> <b>towers.</b> The capital and ongoing operational costs for this process are substantial, and the use (regeneration and disposal) of the amine solution can be problematic from the perspectives of both safety and the environment. Nitrogen (N 2) can also be a problematic impurity in natural gas. Many researchers have been investigating the use of alternative gas-separation technologies (such as membranes and adsorption) targeted at removing N 2 or CO 2 from natural gas more efficiently. In this work, a simple-to-use predictive tool that is easier than existing approaches, is less complicated, and requires shorter computational times is applied to accurately predict the CO 2 and N 2 -adsorption isotherms at low temperatures and pressures up to saturation for a commercial carbon molecular sieve as a function of temperature and partial pressure of these components. Accurate prediction of such data is useful in evaluating the feasibility of using pressure-swing adsorption to separate N 2 and CO 2 from natural gases at cryogenic temperatures. The proposed method showed consistently accurate results across the investigated wide pressure and temperature ranges, with an average absolute deviation of less than 1 % for both N 2 and CO 2 compared to the existing Toth equation, which shows deviations of 3. 5 and 1 % for N 2 and CO 2, respectively. This simple-to-use approach can be of immense practical value for engineers and scientists to have a quick check on adsorption capacities of a given adsorbent at various temperatures and pressures without the necessity of any experimental measurements. In particular, natural-gas-process engineers would find the proposed approach to be user friendly, involving transparent calculations with no complex expressions...|$|R
5000|$|One notable <b>regeneration</b> {{programme}} featuring <b>tower</b> blocks {{was that}} of the Castle Vale estate in Birmingham, built between 1964 and 1969 to rehouse families from inner city 'slums' in areas including Aston and Nechells. 32 of the estate's 34 tower blocks were cleared between 1995 and 2004, with the remaining two being refurbished and re-opened as [...] "vertical warden-controlled schemes". All of the estate's 27 maisonette blocks were also cleared, as were more than 100 bungalows. The remaining low-rise stock, however, was retained. The two remaining tower blocks were comprehensively refurbished. The sites of the demolished flats have been replaced by both private and social housing in low-rise redevelopments.|$|R

The partnership company received planning permission that year to allow opencast coal extraction on what were termed the surface workings of the former colliery site, on the pre-condition that the site {{would be subject to}} land remediation and reclamation, followed by land restoration of the entire Tower Colliery site. The land reclamation works includes: removal of structures; removal of residual contamination; re-profiling of colliery spoil tips; removal of coal workings and mine entries; and provision of surface drainage. The project will create a sloping landform to reproduce semi-natural habitats on the site, and hence prepare the area ground for future mixed-use development.|$|R
40|$|On Thursday, 22 June, 2017, in {{response}} to the Grenfell Tower fire the previous week, Architects for Social Housing held an open meeting in the Residents Centre of Cotton Gardens estate in Lambeth. Around 80 people turned up and contributed to the discussion – residents, housing campaigners, journalists, lawyers, academics, engineers and architects. Attached is an edited film of the meeting made for us by Line Nikita Woolfe, with the assistance of Luc Beloix on camera and additional footage by Dan Davies, and is produced by her company Woolfe Vision. The presentations we gave that evening are the basis of this report, to which we have added our subsequent research as well as that collated from the numerous articles on the Grenfell Tower fire published in the press and elsewhere, to which we have attached the weblinks, with the original documents included whenever they are available. As any resident who has been consulted by their local council on the ‘regeneration’ of their estate knows, their responses to seemingly innocuous questions are similarly used to justify the demolition of their homes. As an example of which, one of the questions put to residents of Central Hill estate by Lambeth council {{at the beginning of their}} consultation was ‘would you like a new kitchen?’ Two-and-a-half-years later the same council used the answers to these consultations to justify the demolition of the entire estate. In the same way, opinions about living in council tower blocks voiced in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire are not made in a political vacuum. It is entirely understandable that a resident pulled from the hell of the Grenfell Tower fire and shoved in front of a camera crew should call for the demolition of similar tower blocks; it is something very different for a journalist who has never lived on an estate to do the same in a national paper, as it is for a politician who has promoted London’s programme of estate demolition to describe tower blocks as ‘criminally unsafe’ on a news programme watched by millions. This report makes no claim to be the truth about the Grenfell Tower fire, but it is a contribution to the attempt to find it, which also means exposing and refuting the lies being spread about its causes. In trying to find that truth, we should be aware of the difference between voicing our personal opinions and formulating conclusions based on what we know. We wanted to use this meeting (film encl.) and report, therefore, to counter the misperceptions and misinformation being propagated in the media, not only about the Grenfell Tower fire but about the council estate it belongs to, and to begin to organise opposition to the use of this disaster and the lives it has claimed to further promote the already widespread programme of estate regeneration that threatens the homes of hundreds of thousands of Londoners. In order to cover these issues in what turned out to be two-and-a-half hours, the meeting was divided into four sections, each with a clear objective: 1) to share what we know collectively about the technical causes of the Grenfell Tower fire; 2) to expose the management structures and political decisions that allowed these technical conditions to be in place; 3) to advise residents of council tower blocks on the safety or otherwise of their homes, and what changes need to happen in order to stop such a disaster ever happening again; and 4) to organise opposition to the use of the Grenfell Tower fire to promote London’s programme of estate demolition. In writing up our presentations, however, we have expanded this report into six parts: 1. Technical Causes of the Grenfell Tower Fire Grenfell Tower Building Regulations Grenfell Tower Cladding 2. Management Decisions responsible for the Grenfell Tower Fire Grenfell Tower Management Grenfell Tower Refurbishment Grenfell Tower Responsibilities 3.

50|$|In the 1850s the Briton Ferry Floating Dock Company was incorporated, {{and bought}} {{land from the}} Earl of Jersey to build the Briton Ferry Docks. When it opened in 1861, the dock {{consisted}} of an outer tidal basin, and an inner floating dock, where the water level was maintained by a single gate, which included a buoyancy chamber. It covered an area of 23.7 acre. The gate was 56 ft wide, and the unique structure with its floating caisson was designed by Brunel's father, Sir Marc Brunel. Following Brunel's death in 1859, Robert Brereton took over as engineer, and also acted as engineer for improvements made in 1872 and 1873.The company later went bankrupt and the Great Western Railway took over the docks as a going concern. After World War II many warships were scrapped there, until the dock was closed in 1959. As part of a <b>regeneration</b> programme, a <b>tower,</b> which formed part of the complex, has been refurbished. It was an accumulator tower for the hydraulic system which operated the dock gate and cranes. The system was designed by William Armstrong, and in 2010, the Institute of Civil Engineers unveiled a plaque at the site to commemorate the 200th anniversary of his birth.|$|R
