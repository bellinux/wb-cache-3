5000|$|Rain tyres have a {{specially}} designed structure making them better adapted for their application than any other tyres. However, not all rain tyres obey the same design principles.

5000|$|Sometimes <b>rain</b> <b>tyres</b> are {{designed}} to have a smaller diameter than their dry counterparts. This means that the wheel spins faster and more water is thrown off the tyre by overcoming centripetal force. Some <b>rain</b> <b>tyres</b> are also narrower than the dry counterparts. This smaller [...] "footprint" [...] reduces the chances of hydroplaning.|$|R

5000|$|Some racing series such as Formula One {{allow an}} {{intermediate}} (inter) tyre. This tyre {{is designed to}} be used in conditions too wet for slick tyres and too dry for wet tyres. They are made with rubber compounds slightly softer than slick tyres and are cut with grooves like the <b>rain</b> <b>tyre</b> but shallower to prevent excessive heat build up. Former Formula One tyre supplier Bridgestone referred to the [...] "intermediate" [...] tyre as the [...] "wet" [...] tyre, and to what are known as [...] "full wets" [...] as [...] "monsoon tyres".|$|E
5000|$|In August 1966, the Bad Roads entered Floyd Soileau's {{studio in}} Ville Platte to record two originals [...] "Blue Girl" [...] and [...] "Too Bad" [...] for their debut single. Upon release on the Jin label, the single became a {{regional}} success. As a result, the group opened for more prominent acts {{such as the}} Music Machine, Sam the Sham, and Question Mark and the Mysterians, while breaking several attendance records in the region. For a brief period, the Bad Roads were among the top musical draws in Louisiana often having to defend themselves from crazed teenage fans intruding the stage. [...] Prior to their follow-up single, the band added organist Perry Gaspard, and Bruce [...] "Weasel" [...] MacDonald replaced Green on guitar. The band's second single included cover versions of the Kinks' [...] "Til the End of the Day" [...] and Them's [...] "Don't Look Back", and was released in early 1967 on their self-produced <b>Rain</b> <b>Tyre</b> label. Though the release was received {{as well as their}} debut, the Bad Roads disbanded in mid-1967.|$|E

50|$|Pickup Truck Racing {{is unique}} in 'big' oval racing, in that unlike e.g. NASCAR the trucks have <b>rain</b> <b>tyres,</b> wipers and rear safety lights, and will race on the ovals in the wet. Speeds are about 18 mph slower than when racing in fully dry conditions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rain</b> <b>tyres</b> or Wet tyres ("tires" [...] in American English, {{commonly}} shortened to wets) {{are special}} tyres used in motorsport in wet weather {{as opposed to}} a slick tyre used in dry conditions. They are very similar in many ways to the tyres found on normal road cars.|$|R
50|$|During the race, Senna {{had shown}} strong pace {{in the opening}} laps. However, he gambled that the rain would stop and {{therefore}} {{did not need to}} change to <b>rain</b> <b>tyres.</b> This strategy failing, he went to the pits to change his tyres, which dropped him to twelfth place and necessitated a subsequently famous overtaking move on Mika Häkkinen's Lotus from the outside for fifth on lap 43 (just as Michael Schumacher started his final lap).|$|R
50|$|In 2015, it was {{announced}} that she was to complete Carlin Motorsport's team for the 2015 FIA European Formula 3 Championship season. She briefly led the third race at Spa, Francorchamps in Belgium on <b>rain</b> <b>tyres,</b> becoming the first female to lead a FIA European Formula 3 race moving through the order from a lowly 27th on the starting grid. Eventually the track dried up and the Colombian female racer had to pit for slicks ending up 15th on the finish line.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rain</b> <b>tyres</b> {{are also}} made from softer rubber {{compounds}} {{to help the}} car grip in the slippery conditions and to build up heat in the tyre. These tyres are so soft that running them on a dry track would cause them to deteriorate within minutes. Softer rubber means that the rubber contains more oils and other chemicals which cause a racing tyre to become sticky when it is hot. The softer a tyre, the stickier it becomes, and conversely with hard tyres.|$|R

50|$|Brabham and Hill duelled at the start, until rain storms {{arrived on}} the circuit. Whilst Brabham {{maintained}} his lead, Rindt who had changed to <b>rain</b> <b>tyres</b> was catching him rapidly, whilst John Surtees in the Cooper was in third, well clear {{of the rest of}} the field. Hill and Jim Clark then battled for second and third until Clark pitted and then Hulme took over second place. As the rain dried, Rindt fell back. Surtees and Hill retired with mechanical problems, leaving Clark in fourth. Brabham duly led home team-mate Hulme, Hill, Clark, Rindt and Bruce McLaren.|$|R
5000|$|At the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix, Verstappen and Ricciardo {{qualified}} {{fourth and}} sixth respectively. In a rain inflicted race, Verstappen barely {{managed to avoid}} hitting the guardrail when he spun on the main straight. After an additional tyre change from intermediates back to <b>rain</b> <b>tyres,</b> he ran in 15th place with just 16 laps remaining. He then made several overtakes in the closing laps to eventually finish on the podium in third place. He received considerable praise for his performance, with his team principal Christian Horner calling it [...] "one of the best drives I've seen in Formula 1".|$|R

50|$|A {{brand new}} 458 Challenge will cost around $300,000 in the US. The only options {{available}} on the car is the color {{and size of the}} passenger seat. All new 458C's come delivered on <b>rain</b> <b>tyres.</b> Racing in the Ferrari Challenge North America series will cost roughly around $15,000-$20,000 per race weekend if the car is run by a dealer team, which they in most cases are. This includes crew support, a fee to Ferrari North America, transportation and living costs plus additional spares. The fee to FNA is approximately $2,000-$3,000 which gives the competitors fuel and tires. Privateer entries can be run at a slightly smaller cost as there will be no dealer fee included.|$|R

50|$|Inexplicably, {{the lights}} went out before the grid had even {{properly}} lined up causing some confusion at the back (Eddie Cheever had been slow away on the warmup lap and was only just coming off the Brabham Straight as {{the lights went}} green). Prost got the jump on Senna at the start, but into the first corner, Senna braked significantly later, and re-took the lead, nearly hitting the Frenchman in the process (Prost did not put up a fight). Further back, Martini fishtailed on his Pirelli <b>rain</b> <b>tyres</b> which were considered to not be as good as the Goodyear shod cars around him, and Nannini overtook him for third. Other drivers who made a good start were de Cesaris and Brundle.|$|R
5000|$|At the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix, Verstappen {{qualified}} fourth. In a rain affected race, {{he barely}} {{managed to avoid}} hitting the guardrail when he spun on the main straight. After an additional tyre change from intermediates back to <b>rain</b> <b>tyres,</b> he ran in 16th place with just 15 laps remaining. Verstappen then made several overtakes in the closing laps to eventually finish on the podium in third place. He received considerable praise for his performance, with his team principal Christian Horner calling it [...] "one of the best drives I've seen in Formula One". However, he came under criticism from Sebastian Vettel, who claimed that Verstappen had pushed him off the track when he gained a position on him at Junção corner late in the race. The race stewards did not share Vettel's view and decided that no reprimand was warranted.|$|R
50|$|Low {{cloud and}} rain {{fell on the}} circuit {{throughout}} {{the beginning of the}} race, causing a multitude of accidents and spins. Although the Sauber C8 generally lacked effective ground effects, it was reliable but off the pace of the Porsches and Jaguars, but the poor weather allowed Mike Thackwell to drive brilliantly on his Goodyear <b>rain</b> <b>tyres</b> to pass Hans-Joachim Stuck in the works Porsche 962C, leading the race on merit. However, a collision between the Argo-Zakspeed of Martin Schanche and the Tiga-Ford of Roy Baker, which required the deployment of the safety car on Lap 22. As the safety car was deployed however, low visibility and confusion over the state of the caution led to the two works Rothmans Porsches of Stuck and Jochen Mass colliding on the front stretch, heavily damaging both cars. Due to the amount of debris littering the track, the event was stopped for two hours.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rain</b> <b>tyres</b> are cut or moulded with {{patterned}} grooves or tread in them. This {{allows the}} tyre to quickly displace the water between {{the ground and}} the rubber on the tyre. If this water is not displaced, the car will experience an effect known as hydroplaning as the rubber will not be in contact with the ground. These grooves do not help the car grip contrary to popular belief, however if these grooves are too shallow, the grip will be impaired in wet conditions as the rubber {{will not be able to}} make good contact with the ground. The patterns are designed to displace water as quickly as possible to the edges of the tyre or into specially cut channels in the centre of the tyre. Not all groove patterns are the same. Optimal patterns depend on the car and the conditions. The grooves are also designed to generate heat when lateral forces are applied to the tyre.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1961 Formula One season, run {{under new}} 1.5-litre rules, Enzo Ferrari fielded the [...] "sharknose" [...] Ferrari 156 with an all-new V6 engine. Mosss Climax-engined Lotus was {{comparatively}} underpowered, but {{he won the}} 1961 Monaco Grand Prix by 3.6 seconds, beating the Ferraris of Richie Ginther, Wolfgang von Trips, and Phil Hill, {{and went on to}} win the partially wet 1961 German Grand Prix. In addition to his skill, two other factors helped compensate for the Lotuss power deficit in these races. The tight circuit at Monaco favored the nimble Lotus, countering the horsepower advantage of the heavier, ill-handling Ferraris; and at the Nürburgring, Moss and manager Ken Gregory took the risky decision to fit <b>rain</b> <b>tyres</b> after a pre-race shower soaked the track. Had the skies cleared and the track dried, the decision would have worked against Moss. The rain returned in the race, and although Mosss tyres rapidly deteriorated he was able to drive away from Hill and Trips to take the win.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout the race, drivers {{may make}} pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, {{they could also}} refuel). Different teams and drivers employ {{different}} pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over {{the course of a}} race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance, and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one [...] "intermediate", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one [...] "full wet", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If <b>rain</b> <b>tyres</b> are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.|$|R
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} race start, reports of rain falling on the track caused the start to be delayed by around ten minutes. Race control {{eventually}} deemed the race to be dry enough {{to be called a}} dry race, thus the <b>rain</b> <b>tyres</b> were not necessary, but would be required later in the race. Dario Franchitti and Alex Tagliani led the field to the line, with the circuit still being dusty from the previous night's repair work. Dust clouds engulfed the start-finish straight, blinding many of the midfield runners. The top five runners managed to negotiate the first chicane cleanly, while behind, half a dozen cars were involved in a first-corner crash. Takuma Sato misjudged his braking into the first corner and clipped the rear of Will Power's Penske machine, which spun him into Scott Dixon. Hélio Castroneves could not avoid running into Dixon's stationary car at the first corner. After many drivers went down the escape road to avoid being involved in the crash, a separate accident took place between Marco Andretti and Mario Moraes. Moraes lost control of his KV Racing Technology car behind Ana Beatriz, hit Andretti and became airborne before coming to rest across the cockpit of Andretti's car. It took several minutes to extricate Andretti from his damaged machinery, but was uninjured and very critical of Moraes' driving. The crash resulted in a seven-lap caution period, and eliminated Sato, Moraes and Andretti from the race. Dixon and Castroneves both recovered to the pit lane to repair damage.|$|R
25|$|The team's 1993 Bathurst {{victory was}} all about speed. The #11 Castrol Holden VP Commodore was clearly the fastest car all week, topping every {{practice}} and qualifying session, except the first practice session, in which the car placed second. The race was a race in three, between Perkins and Hansford, Mark Skaife and Jim Richards in a Winfield sponsored Commodore, and Tomas Mezera and Win Percy in a Holden Racing Team Commodore. When Percy crashed the #15 car after a throttle jammed, the race was a straight fight between Perkins/Hansford and the Skaife/Richards car. The outright speed of the Perkins car saw the team home, despite a late race flurry of <b>rain,</b> which made <b>tyre</b> selection into a lottery.|$|R
50|$|For 2012, Kvyat {{remained}} in the Formula Renault category, competing in both Formula Renault 2.0 Alps and the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 series. His debut in the Alps championship was marked with a dominating double win at Monza. In May {{he returned to the}} Eurocup, and recorded a double win in the opening round of the season at Motorland Aragón. He ultimately clinched the Alps title and finished as runner-up in the Eurocup, following a dramatic season finale at Catalunya. He was leading the race in heavy <b>rain,</b> but his <b>tyres</b> lost all grip during the final laps, and he missed the title by 10 points. Kvyat remained with the Red Bull Junior Team and progressed to the GP3 Series for 2013.|$|R
25|$|Friday's {{afternoon}} qualification {{session was}} {{divided into two groups}} that lasted 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and AM were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All cars were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each and the starting order was determined by the competitor's fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. Light rain fell before qualifying started causing teams to use intermediate tyres on their cars until a dry line emerged on the track and vehicles were equipped with dry-compound <b>tyres.</b> <b>Rain</b> later returned to the track which prevented anyone from improving on their fastest lap times. The session was marked by a battle between Audi and Porsche.|$|R
50|$|The {{conditions}} on the grid were dry before the race, although the sky was overcast; weather forecasts predicted rain {{near the end of}} the race. Most of the frontrunners began the race on the harder compound <b>tyre.</b> <b>Rain</b> that had fallen earlier that morning had removed some of the rubber on the track, meaning that graining, when small grains of rubber come off a tyre, was likely to be a problem; out of the two tyre types, the harder would better cope with this. Räikkönen made a good start, retaining his first position; Massa behind him maintained his second place. Alonso, who started third, was passed by both Trulli and Kubica, but re-passed Kubica at the hairpin turn exit. Glock also made a good start, taking sixth after passing Webber. Going into the first corner, Button touched Bourdais, resulting in damage to the Honda's front wing. Hamilton, who started 13th, passed several drivers to move into 10th by the end of lap one.|$|R
5000|$|..... At {{first he}} {{approached}} the objects of his photographic interest from a distance. From behind a cordon of his colleagues, onlookers and witnesses, he discovered them. Then he shook off his reticence and straight away the vehicles that had been abruptly halted in their tracks, dented, smashed, dismembered and now immobile, fulfil his needs perfectly. But the victims and perpetrators are always missing. Looking {{at some of the}} wrecks {{it is hard to imagine}} that no-one was seriously injured or that no-one died at the scene. No ambulances or hearses all over the place. Only the deformed vehicle gives the impression that some herculean artist had voliently smashed them up, twisted and bent them, thrown them into the water and crushed them. Equally, the aesthetic moment of his photography also only serves to render the immediacy of the events even more precise. For a second glance at the black-and-white photos taken in a strict, documentary style reveals the policeman’s acute powers of perception. The specific circumstances of the event would usually be the key factor in determining the balance between photograph and object. Most of Odermatt’s shots not only show the scene of the incident; at the same time, they also show its possible causes: ice and roads that were slippery in the <b>rain,</b> bald <b>tyres,</b> a slow-moving tractor, or one that is suddenly turning - and the suspected careless driving on the part of those involved. Sometimes they also show the people brought in to help move the wreckage or gawping onlookers. In 1990, Odermatt, the chief of the Nidwalden transport police, reached retirement age.|$|R
500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would <b>rain.</b> Harder <b>tyres</b> would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying for Race 8 {{took place}} on Saturday {{afternoon}} and consisted of a single 15-minute session. While drivers started the session with slick <b>tyres,</b> <b>rain</b> began to fall soon after the session commenced. Michael Caruso got stuck in the sand trap at the first corner of his first flying lap, which caused a red flag and resulted in his exclusion {{from the rest of}} the session. The red flag was not displayed immediately, however, and several drivers were able to complete a timed lap, with the fastest being Cameron Waters ahead of Mostert and Craig Lowndes. The session was restarted after Caruso's car had been extracted, though only those drivers who had failed to set a time prior to the red flag being shown returned to the circuit. With the track now completely wet, the fastest of this group of drivers, Fabian Coulthard, qualified only twelfth, over four seconds slower than Waters' time of 59.6256. The session was stopped for a second time when Reynolds got stuck in the sand trap at Turn 1. With conditions not improving, Waters claimed his first pole position in the championship.|$|R
25|$|In {{the opening}} race in South Africa, Senna {{finished}} {{in second place}} after surviving a collision with Schumacher. Senna won in changing conditions in Brazil and Donington. The latter has often been {{regarded as one of}} Senna's greatest victories, in the process setting a record for the fastest lap in an F1 race driving through the then speed-unrestricted pit lane. He was fifth at the first corner and led the race {{at the end of the}} first lap going on to lap all but second place in a race where up to seven pit stops were required by some drivers for <b>rain</b> or slick <b>tyres.</b> Senna then scored a second-place finish in Spain and a record-breaking sixth win at Monaco. After Monaco, the sixth race of the season, Senna unexpectedly led the championship from Prost in the Williams-Renault. As the season progressed, Alain Prost and Damon Hill asserted the superiority of their Williams-Renault cars, while Senna suffered mechanical failures in Imola, Canada, Britain, Hungary, and Portugal. Senna won the penultimate race of the season in Japan, which was marked by an incident involving Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine, twice unlapping himself against Senna. Immediately after the race, Senna attended at Jordan's garage and, following a lengthy and heated discussion, punched the Irishman in the face.|$|R
5000|$|By this time, McLaren {{was forced}} to take a {{customer}} supply of Ford V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, Benetton. McLaren hoped {{to make up for}} the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system - though the system itself proved difficult at times, especially for new teammate Michael Andretti. With this plan, Dennis finally persuaded Senna to stay with McLaren. The Brazilian, however, agreed to do so only for the first race in South Africa, where he would assess whether McLaren's equipment was competitive enough for him to put in a good season. After driving McLaren's 1993 car, the McLaren MP4/8, Senna concluded that the new car had a surprising potential, albeit with a Ford V8 engine down on power relative to Prost's Renault V10. Senna thus extended his deal with McLaren on a race-by-race basis instead of a full-year contract, ending up staying for the whole of 1993 in any event. Reportedly, this engagement was on a $1 million per race basis and, despite midseason testing with a Lamborghini V12 proved encouraging, with McLaren then signing an engine supply deal with Peugeot for the [...] season, it all proved insufficient to continue to retain Senna past 1993.In the opening race in South Africa, Senna finished in second place after surviving a collision with Schumacher.
