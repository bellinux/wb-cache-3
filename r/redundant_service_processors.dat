40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} {{analysis}} {{of the effectiveness of}} redundant queries based on untrusted computing in computer systems, represented by multi-channel queuing systems with a common queue. The objective of research is the possibility of increasing the efficiency of service requests while performing redundant copies of requests in different devices of a multi-channel system under conditions of calculations unreliability. The <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> of requests requires the infallibility of its implementation at least in one of the devices. Method. We have considered estimation of the average time spent in the system with and without the use of redundant requests at the presentation of a simple queuing model of the M / M / n type to analyze the effectiveness of <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> of requests. Presented evaluation of the average waiting time in the redundant queries is the upper one, since it ignores the possibility of reducing the average waiting time {{as a result of the}} spread of the probability of time querying at different devices. The integrated efficiency of <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> of requests is defined based on the multiplicative index that takes into account the infallibility of calculations and the average time allowance with respect to the maximum tolerated delay of service. Evaluation of error-free computing at reserved queries is received at the requirement of faultless execution of at least one copy of the request. Main Results. We have shown that the reservation of requests gives the gain in efficiency of the system at low demand rate (load). We have defined the boundaries of expediency (efficiency) for <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> of requests. We have shown the possibility of the effectiveness increasing of the adaptive changes in the multiplicity of the reservation of requests, depending on the intensity of the flow of requests. We have found out that the choice of service discipline in information service systems is largely determined by the economic efficiency of information services, estimated by the profit from the error-free provision of information services obtained per time unit (rate of profit). We have demonstrated the existence of an efficiency area of information <b>services</b> at the <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> of requests under failures and errors. We have determined the flow rate threshold of requests below which a <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> of requests is appropriate. Practical Relevance The results presented in the paper can be used in the computer systems design including the systems providing information services...|$|R

30|$|Nascimento et al. ([2011]) {{proposes a}} feature model that captures the variabilities and commonalities among {{software}} fault tolerance strategies (for instance, recovery blocks, N-version programming and N-self-checking programming). The identified variability is mapped into design decisions represented as variation points into a Product Line Architecture. The authors propose an infrastructure that encompasses both the feature model and PLA and relies on key {{activities of the}} autonomic control loop (i.e. collect, analyze, plan and execute) to support dynamic management of software variability. Based on changes of (i) user requirements and (ii) QoS level, and high-level policies, which are represented as adaptation rules, the control loop decides an appropriate fault tolerance strategy to be executed. Consequently, this infrastructure {{is responsible for the}} dependable mediation logic between <b>service</b> clients and <b>redundant</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, since functionally equivalent services may appear with completely different function names, input parameters and return types, hence complicating the dynamic discovery of <b>redundant</b> <b>services.</b> To alleviate this difficulty, their solution relies on the Semantic Web (SW) in order to support dynamic provision of <b>redundant</b> <b>services</b> by describing them in terms of semantics. Also the infrastructure itself may be deployed to be remotely accessible via web technology. Therefore, their solution supports all the described SOA specific requirements.|$|R

The paper {{deals with}} the {{effectiveness}} of multipath transfer of request copies through the network and their <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> {{without the use of}} laborious analytical modeling. The model and support tools for the design of highly reliable distributed systems based on simulation modeling have been created. Method. The effectiveness of many variants of service organization and delivery through the network to the query servers is formed and analyzed. Options for providing <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> and delivery via the network to the servers of request copies are also considered. The choice of variants for the distribution and service of requests is carried out taking into account the criticality of queries to the time of their stay in the system. The request is considered successful if at least one of its copies is accurately delivered to the working server, ready to service the request received through a network, if it is fulfilled in the set time. Efficiency analysis of the <b>redundant</b> transmission and <b>service</b> of requests is based on the model built in AnyLogic 7 simulation environment. Main Results. Simulation experiments based on the proposed models have shown the effectiveness of redundant transmission of copies of queries (packets) to the servers in the cluster through multiple paths with <b>redundant</b> <b>service</b> of request copies by a group of servers in the cluster. It is shown that this solution allows increasing the probability of exact execution of at least one copy of the request within the required time. We have carried out efficiency evaluation of destruction of outdated request copies in the queues of network nodes and the cluster. We have analyzed options for network implementation of multipath transfer of request copies to the servers in the cluster over disjoint paths, possibly different according to the number of their constituent nodes. Practical Relevance. The proposed simulation models can be used when selecting the optimal design solutions for the redundant transmission and maintenance of requests time-critical for stay in information and communication system...|$|R
