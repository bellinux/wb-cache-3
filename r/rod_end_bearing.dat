5000|$|The spherical <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> was {{developed}} by Nazi Germany during World War II. When {{one of the first}} German planes to be shot down by the British in early 1940 was examined, they found this joint in use in the aircraft's control systems. Following this discovery, the Allied governments gave the H.G. Heim Company an exclusive patent to manufacture these joints in North America, while in the UK the patent passed to Rose Bearings Ltd. The ubiquity of these manufacturers in their respective markets led to the terms heim joint and rose joint becoming synonymous with their product. After the patents ran out the common names stuck, although [...] "rosejoint" [...] remains a registered trademark of Minebea Mitsumi Inc., successor to Rose Bearings Ltd. Originally used in aircraft, the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> may be found in cars, trucks, race cars, motorcycles, lawn tractors, boats, industrial machines, go-karts, radio-control helicopters, and many more applications.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|E

40|$|Main and {{connecting}} rod bearings along the crankshaft in a heavy-duty engine oil system requires efficient feed of oil flow to ensure the performance of lubrication, cooling and cleaning. The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main {{and connecting}} rod bearings have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main bearing and the connecting <b>rod</b> large <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for connecting <b>rod</b> large <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> and at lower engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the upper and the lower bearing shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst connecting <b>rod</b> large <b>end</b> and small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow. The feed of oil to main bearing and connecting <b>rod</b> large <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> appears continuously whilst the feed of oil to connecting <b>rod</b> small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> appears {{in the form of a}} few pulsations. Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|R

The review was carried out between April 2013 and February 2014 by a group of eight people with different responsibilities who shared an interest in waves and wave generation. Issues addressed by the Group included {{what needed to be done}} to ensure the wavemakers will continue to operate reliably and to meet the needs of clients in the future. The review considered wavemaking hardware, control systems and software for wave generation and analysis of the results. The need for expertise in the field was also included. Problems or limitations to capabilities in these areas were identified, together with the impact or importance of the problem, options for solutions and pros and cons for each option. The steps required to resolve outstanding issues were documented and where possible the preferred option identified The review led to the following recommendations: Replace the wavemaker in the Towing Tank; Address the rustout issues in the MWB; Replace the actuator <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> in the drive system in the OEB; Replace the hydraulic drives with electric drives and simplify the linkages in the OEB; Bring the control systems for all OCRE wave generation facilities to the same high level; Acquire software for wave generation to include 2 nd order waves and active wave absorption; Fit wave probes to each segment in the OEB to enable active wave absorption; Create a new position (or re-assign an existing staff member) to provide direct support to the operation of wavemakers in the facilities.

50|$|The engine {{suffered}} from an abbreviated development period due to Rolls-Royce {{being required to}} suspend Vulture development in 1940 during the Battle of Britain to concentrate its work on the Merlin, which powered the RAF's two main fighters, the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, {{and as a consequence}} the reliability of the Vulture when it entered service was very poor. Apart from delivering significantly less than the designed power, the Vulture {{suffered from}} frequent failures of the connecting <b>rod</b> big <b>end</b> <b>bearings,</b> which was found to be caused by a breakdown in lubrication, and also from heat dissipation problems. Rolls-Royce were initially confident that they could solve the problems, but in part because of its accelerated development in 1940, the company's much smaller Merlin was already nearing the same power level as the Vulture's original specification, and so production of the Vulture was discontinued after only 538 had been built.|$|R
40|$|The Skitter 2 is a three legged {{transport}} vehicle designed {{to demonstrate the}} principle of a tripod walker in a multitude of environments. The tubular truss model of Skitter 2 is a proof of principal design. The model will replicate the operational capabilities of Skitter 2 including its ability to self-right itself. The project's focus was {{on the use of}} light weight tubular members in the final structural design. A strong design for the body was required as it will undergo the most intense loading. Triangular geometry was used extensively in the body, providing the required structural integrity and eliminating the need for cumbersome shear panels. Both the basic femur and tibia designs also relied on the strong geometry of the triangle. An intense literature search aided {{in the development of the}} most suitable weld techniques, joints, linkages, and materials required for a durable design. The hinge design features the use of spherical <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> In order to obtain a greater range of mobility in the tibia, a four-bar linkage was designed which attaches both to the femur and the tibia. All component designs, specifically the body, femur, and the tibia were optimized using the software package IDEAS 3. 8 A Supertab. The package provided essential deformation and stress analysis information on each component's design. The final structure incurred only a 0. 0544 inch deflection in a maximum (worst case) loading situation. The highest stress experienced by any AL 6061 -T 6 tubular member was 1920 psi. The structural integrity of the final design facilitated the use of Aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubing. The tubular truss structure of Skitter 2 is an effective and highly durable design. All facets of the design are structurally sound and cost effective...|$|R
50|$|Ring oilers {{were used}} for speeds up to around 1,000 rpm. Above this, the oil tended to be thrown {{centrifugally}} from the ring, rather than carried by it (although it is still currently applied on steam turbines with speeds around 3200 rpm). The bearing must also remain horizontal and stable, so although suitable for crankshaft main bearings, {{they could not be}} used on connecting <b>rod</b> big <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> They were not used on vehicles for similar reasons, although the engines concerned at this time were anyway too large and heavy for practical mobile use. Automatic ring oilers were particularly useful for large engines with multiple horizontally opposed cylinders, where it was otherwise difficult to access the central main bearings. Ring oilers were most suited where bearing side-loads were relatively light, but the bearing capacity required more lubrication than could be supplied by a drip feed oiler. For this reason they were widely used on larger electric motors and generators.|$|R
50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The connecting <b>rod</b> small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into {{the eye of the}} small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R

50|$|The T20 solves {{this problem}} by {{incorporating}} a once-through oil injection system known as Posi-Force, which consists of an engine-driven oil pump coupled to the throttle, {{which is designed to}} provide the proper amount of oil needed at the current RPM and throttle opening. The pump draws clean oil from a separate oil tank, and pumps it through hoses into the crankcase, where it is injected into the engine from a nozzle located between the intake manifold and the cylinder. A separate oil injection point is also provided for the main <b>bearing(s)</b> and big <b>end</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> of the crankshaft.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{vertical}} {{bearing capacity}} of a bucket foundation installed in sand can be calculated as sum of the skin friction and <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. However, the current design equations are not considering the non-associated flow characteristics of sand and {{the reduction in the}} skin friction and increase in the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity when the vertical load is applied.

After calculating the skin friction and <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> force at the ultimate state, design equations are derived for each. The skin friction of bucket foundation is shown significantly small compared to the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. Considering the difference with the available design equation for piles, it is recommended that the equation for piles is used for the bucket foundation. A new shape-depth factor (sq･dq) for bucket foundation is recommended which also accounts for the increment of the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity due to skin friction.

The pinned end condition considers the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> free to rotate about all three axes, allows axial translation, and prevents radial movement.
