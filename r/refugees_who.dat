5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both inward and outward.

5|$|Many, if {{not most}} Mauritians are unaware of the {{existence}} of such a graveyard in Mauritius. Each grave recalls the story of deportee life in an alien country, the result of mass deportation from Haifa by the British of <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> escaped Nazi barbarity, only to find themselves in jail in a tiny British island colony where they died of disease instead of creating new lives for themselves in Palestine/Israel.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} other LCL hopefuls, Playford journeyed around the {{electorate}} advocating his platform. The constituency had a considerable German element, descendants of <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> had escaped persecution in the German Empire. Grateful for the past help of Playford's grandfather, they swung their strong support behind {{him and he was}} comfortably elected to the South Australian House of Assembly. With a split in the Labor vote, the first LCL government was formed with Richard Layton Butler as Premier.|$|E
5|$|First {{mentioned}} {{during the}} 17th century, the Rodrigues solitaire {{was described in}} detail by François Leguat, {{the leader of a}} group of French Huguenot <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691–1693. It was hunted by humans and introduced animals, and was extinct by the late 18th century. Apart from Leguat's account and drawing, and a few other contemporary descriptions, nothing was known about the bird until a few subfossil bones were found in a cave in 1789. Thousands of bones have subsequently been excavated. It is the only extinct bird with a former star constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius.|$|E

5|$|He was in Marseille in late 1940-early 1941, {{joining the}} group of anti-fascist and Jewish <b>refugees</b> <b>who,</b> {{protected}} by American diplomat Varian Fry, were seeking to escape Nazi-occupied Europe. Among the people present there were the anti-totalitarian socialist Victor Serge, anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, playwright Arthur Adamov, philosopher and poet René Daumal, and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and Benjamin Péret, as well as artists Max Ernst, André Masson, Wifredo Lam, Jacques Hérold, Victor Brauner and Óscar Domínguez. During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new card game, on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} devastated {{the city of}} Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay. According to some estimates the death toll on the coast outside of Galveston may have been over one thousand. Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed. Communities along the shoreline declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in Southeast Texas. The region received a population boost from some Galveston <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{newspapers}} criticized Missouri for the Haun's Mill massacre and the state's {{expulsion of}} the Latter Day Saints. Illinois accepted Mormon <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> gathered {{along the banks}} of the Mississippi River, where Smith purchased high-priced, swampy woodland in the hamlet of Commerce. Smith also attempted to portray the Latter Day Saints as an oppressed minority, and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government for help in obtaining reparations. During the summer of 1839, while Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic, Smith sent Brigham Young and other apostles to missions in Europe, where they made numerous converts, many of them poor factory workers.|$|E

5|$|Newton's parakeet {{was first}} {{recorded}} by François Leguat in his 1708 memoir A New Voyage to the East Indies. Leguat {{was the leader}} of a group of nine French Huguenot <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> colonised Rodrigues between 1691 and 1693 after they were marooned there. Subsequent accounts were by Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island in 1726, in his Relation de l'Île Rodrigue, and then by the French mathematician Alexandre Pingré, who travelled to Rodrigues to view the 1761 transit of Venus.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1991, Iraq {{accepted}} United Nations (UN) cease-fire {{conditions and}} resolutions, thereby officially ending the Gulf War. This same day, a large multinational, multiple-agency humanitarian effort {{under the authority}} of UN Security Council Resolution No. 688 began to aid the approximately 500,000 Kurdish <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> had fled from Iraqi military forces into the hills of northern Iraq. On 18 April 1991, John Shalikashvili took command of the U.S.-led operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the Kurdish refugees, called Operation Provide Comfort (OPC).|$|E
5|$|Owing to its location, Klis Fortress was an {{important}} defensive position during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. The fortress stands along the route by which the Ottomans could penetrate the mountain barrier separating the coastal lowlands from around Split, from Ottoman-held Bosnia. The Croat feudal lord Petar Kružić gathered together a garrison composed of Croat <b>refugees,</b> <b>who</b> used the base at Klis both to hold the Ottomans at bay, and to engage in marauding and piracy against coastal shipping. Although nominally accepting {{the sovereignty of the}} Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand, who obtained the Croatian crown in 1527, Kružić and his freebooting Uskoks were a law unto themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} of 1991 saw the fiercest {{fighting}} of the war, as the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. The Battle of Vukovar ended on 18 November, when the JNA captured the city after nearly three months of fighting. At the same time, Croatian Serb authorities began systematically expelling non-Serb civilians from areas under their control. The expulsions {{in the area of}} eastern Slavonia were primarily motivated by the aim of changing the ethnic composition in favour of Serbs as well as the resettling of Serb <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> had fled western Slavonia following Operation Swath-10 by the Croatian Army.|$|E
5|$|Their efforts {{resulted}} in a scheme where grain crops grown in the RSK-held part of Sector West were milled in the Croatian-controlled areas, and the supply of potable water to Pakrac was exchanged for electricity supplied from Croatia to the southern portion of Sector West. Fischer also obtained approval for the limited return of refugees from local authorities. The scheme involved up to 2,500 <b>refugees</b> <b>who</b> {{would be allowed to}} rebuild their homes, funded by the Austrian government. The funds, in the amount of 1.3million dollars, were obtained through Michael Platzer, Special Assistant to the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna.|$|E
