Canal 13 produced shows such as Flor de País (Flower of Country), Héroes (Heroes), Los 80 (The Eighties), <b>Recomiendo</b> Chile (I Recommend Chile), Santiago no es Chile (Santiago is not Chile) and Voy y Vuelvo (I'll go and come back later). Televisión Nacional de Chile has broadcast shows such as Chile Elige (Chile Chooses), Hora 25 (25th Hour), Grandes Chilenos de Nuestra Historia (Great Chileans of Our History, based on the BBC's 100 Greatest Britons), Epopeya (Epic), and Algo habrán hecho por la historia de Chile (They {{must have done something}} for the history of Chile). Chilevisión created the miniseries Postales, that lasts about a minute and a half. Chilevisión also dramatized guerrilla Manuel Rodríguez Erdoíza's biography on the homonymic TV series. Starting in 2008, La Red exhibited Agenda Bicentenario (Bicentennial Schedule), showing important places of Chile during its history. Finally, Megavisión launched the TV series Adiós al Séptimo de Línea (Goodbye to the Seventh Line) in 2010, based on Jorge Inostroza's homonymic book.|$|E
