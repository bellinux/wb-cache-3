40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to survey the {{relative}} importance of postoperative <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and perioperative care items, as perceived by a large group of international dedicated professionals. METHODS: A questionnaire with eight postoperative <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and 13 perioperative care items was mailed to participants of the first international Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) congress and to authors of papers with a clear relevance to ERAS in abdominal surgery. The responders were divided into categories according to profession and region. RESULTS: The <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> 'To be completely free of nausea', 'To be independently mobile' and 'To be able to eat and drink as soon as possible' received the highest score irrespective of the responder's profession or region of origin. Equally, the care items 'Optimizing fluid balance', 'Preoperative counselling' and 'Promoting early and scheduled mobilisation' received the highest score across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Functional recovery, as in tolerance of food without nausea and regained mobility, was considered the most important <b>target</b> of <b>recovery.</b> There was a consistent uniformity in the way international dedicated professionals scored the relative importance of <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and care items.

We estimate unique <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes.

A regulated two-stage turbocharging system is an adequate solution for power recovery of diesel engines.

The valve control strategies for boost pressure recovery, which formed the basis of the power recovery method, are presented here. The simulation results showed that this system was effective in recovering the boost pressure at different speeds and various altitudes. The turbine bypass valve and compressor bypass valve had different modes to adapt to changes in operating conditions. The boost pressure recovery could not ensure power recovery over the entire operating range of the diesel engine, because of variation in overall turbocharger efficiency.

While single chemical processes are often well integrated, site-wide heat integration based on Total Site Analysis (TSA) tools often identifies opportunities to further increase energy efficiency.

Total Site targets have been calculated using a Excel ™ targeting spreadsheet and networks have been designed {{with the help of}} Supertaget ™ for both the CTST and UTST methods. To achieve heat <b>recovery</b> and utility <b>targets,</b> both series and parallel utility heat exchanger matches for non-isothermal utilities are allowed in the CTST method, while series matches are allowed in the UTST method if the heat exchangers in series are from the same process. Series matches based on CTST method may create a dependency on two or more separate processes, which operational and control issues may occur, higher piping costs may be imposed, and utility target temperatures may not be achieved in the consecutive processes if one or more processes were to be out of service. Relaxation of the network can resolve these issues for the CTST method; however, if the relaxation occurs {{on the side of the}} utility loop that constrains heat recovery, the net heat <b>recovery</b> <b>targets</b> may not be achieved within the Total Site.

40|$|The {{chemical}} industry sector is energy-intensive and {{highly dependent on}} fossil feedstock. The primary long-term option to reduce fossil feedstock dependence and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is to switch to renewable feedstock. One promising technology is thermochemical gasification of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock into a raw syngas which can be processed into a spectrum of possible products. This study aims at assessing different opportunities to integrate biomass gasification-based processes {{in the production of}} chemicals. The work was conducted {{in the form of a}} case study involving a conventional oxo synthesis plant processing syngas derived from partial oxidation of natural gas, and olefins into various specialty chemicals. The following options were investigated: (i) retaining the existing syngas production unit and fully substituting the natural gas feedstock by either importing or producing biomass-derived synthetic natural gas (bio-SNG) onsite; (ii) scrapping the existing syngas generator and directly producing biomass-derived syngas fulfilling the specifications for downstream oxo synthesis. The results show that the direct route to bio-syngas requires less lignocellulosic biomass compared with the route via intermediate bio-SNG production. Although the bio-SNG route features a higher heat <b>recovery</b> <b>target</b> for production of heat and power, the direct route achieves the highest thermodynamic performance, particularly if LP steam is exported to the oxo synthesis plant. Furthermore, the direct bio-syngas route shows promising opportunities to perform well from both an economic and GHG emission reduction perspective. For price projections based on current policies, a production cost lower than via the fossil route is indicated. The results also indicate that for future energy market conditions associated with major climate emission constraints, there is no direct economic incentive for switching to biomass-based syngas production, suggesting that other policy measures than a CO 2 emissions charge will be necessary to achieve switching from fossil to biomass feedstock in the chemical process industry...|$|E
40|$|Acrylic acid is an {{important}} organic industrial chemical, widely used as a raw material in various production. Poly-acrylic acids have shown excellent performances for polymeric materials. The global consumption {{is expected to grow}} high up to around 8. 2 million tonnes by 2020. The conventional way of producing acrylic acid is performed by the catalytic partial oxygenation process of propylene, which is derived from petroleum and natural gas. This process has been highly dependent on fossil fuels for over 40 years. Under the pressure of 2 °C target and volatility of acrylic acid price due to changeable fossil fuels price, alternative methods of producing acrylic acid on industrial scale are required for breaking the "Carbon lock-in". Renewable resources, such as glucose and glycerol, seem to have big potential. In this project, crude glycerol is used as the feeding stock for producing acrylic acid with acrolein as the intermediate product; the crude glycerol is considered as the byproduct of biodiesel production. Two steps of chemical reaction are involved, namely dehydration and oxidation. Each step is assisted by one kind of highly efficient catalyst, which is selected based on former literature results. Purification process is necessary for achieving high purity of acrylic acid. The simulation is performed with software Aspen Plus ®. Simulation results show that 2. 48 kg of crude glycerol can be converted to 1 kg of acrylic acid of 99. 94 % purity. Pinch analysis helps defining the maximum heat <b>recovery</b> <b>target</b> and helps lower the impact of environment and operating cost by 12 - 14 %. The glycerol based production of acrylic acid is compared with the fossil based production of acrylic acid under EU operating conditions and a glucose based model using sugarcane or corn as feedstock. The comparison mainly suggests that: glycerol based production seems more competitive environmentally and economically than the glucose based one; the environmental impact is heavily influenced by the alternative use of glycerol as a waste from the biodiesel production. In places where crude glycerol can be used as fuel in incineration plants, it may be less environmental friendly to use it for chemical production with the current status of technology; in areas where glycerol can only be treated in conventional waste treatment plants, to use glycerol for value-added production of chemicals (e. g., acrylic acid) seems a very promising method. To this end, further in-depth research is needed towards an integrated (multi-product) glycerol biorefinery...|$|E
