They also moult their fleece naturally, {{rather than having to}} be shorn annually, though older individuals do not moult as easily and may require additional shearing. Fleeces are grey or creamy white on the body, though darker individuals occur whose colouring is similar to the Soay sheep. <b>Rough</b> <b>in</b> quality, the wool is mostly used in the creation of tweeds or carpet yarns. A tweed is a rough-surfaced coarse cloth, typically made in Scotland. Its colour is a mix of flecked colours. The face and legs are wool-free and black and white, with the proportions varying between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{only ever}} {{depicted}} by his unit portrait {{through the course}} of StarCraft and Brood War. He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and <b>rough</b> <b>in</b> appearance. Raynor has a neatly trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of StarCraft II are beginning to grey. His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms. In addition, a number of pieces of concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor isn't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.|$|E

25|$|In {{spring and}} autumn the islands are quieter and more pleasant, {{although}} the sea can be <b>rough</b> <b>in</b> spring, autumn and winter, and the islands are sometimes {{cut off from}} the outside world when the ferry services are cancelled due to storms and high waves.

25|$|The {{first three}} of these books were written before Nithard's {{appointment}} as lay-abbey of St-Riquier {{in the winter of}} 842, the fourth and final in spring of 843 after taking up office there. Although <b>rough</b> <b>in</b> style, partisan in character and sometimes incorrect in detail, the books are the work {{of a man who had}} an intimate knowledge of the events which he relates, who possessed a clear and virile mind, and who above all was not a recluse but a man of action. They are dedicated to Charles the Bald, at whose request they were written.|$|E

25|$|The eastern ridge {{connects to}} the {{adjacent}} Corbett of The Sow of Atholl, and is narrow near the summit as it goes round the rim of Coire Creagach before broadening as it drops in easy angled slopes to a col with a height of approximately 650 metres. This eastern ridge {{is one of the}} main routes of ascent. The NE ridge is another possible route of ascent from upper Coire Dhomhain although its slopes are steep and <b>rough</b> <b>in</b> places. The hills western flank consist of broad slopes which contour around the head of Coire Dhomhain and descend to a col which links to the adjacent Munro of Beinn Udlamain. All drainage from the mountain goes south via the rivers Garry and Tummel to join the drainage basin of the River Tay and reaching the east coast at the Firth of Tay.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, Fo {{moved to}} Milan {{to study at}} the Brera Academy. However, the Second World War intervened. Fo joined the fascist army of Mussolini's Repubblica Sociale Italiana. Years later, Fo did not deny this {{affiliation}} but supported this moot thesis: he did it to avoid arousing suspicion, because his family {{was active in the}} anti-fascist Resistance and Fo helped his father to smuggle refugees and Allied soldiers to Switzerland by disguising them as Lombard peasants. His father is also thought to have helped smuggle Jewish scientists to the safety of Switzerland. As {{the end of the war}} approached, Fo joined an anti-aircraft division of the navy, anticipating an immediate discharge due to a shortage of munitions. He was mistaken and was instead dispatched to a camp in Monza at which Benito Mussolini himself arrived. Fo soon deserted with the aid of false documents and wandered for a while before joining a parachute squadron. He then deserted this as well, prompting a further unsuccessful search for the Resistance movement during which he slept <b>rough</b> <b>in</b> the countryside.|$|E
25|$|The boats {{continued}} {{their search for}} Mavromicali's galley along the shore towards Cape Kitries. On 8 February, near Scardamoula, they sighted a vessel {{that appeared to be}} their quarry, but were unable to catch it before it took refuge in a port. Williams sent all his boats into the port to demand that the surrender of the galliot. The boats then left, having received a promise that Mavromicali would sail to Zante or Napoli di Romania the following morning. Not trusting Mavromicali's word, Zebra anchored only 300 yards from the galliot. When Williams tried to send a further message to Mavromicali, the emissaries were rebuffed and although Williams wanted to respond by seizing the galliot the seas were too <b>rough.</b> <b>In</b> the morning, Williams saw that the hills were ringed with armed men and when the British reminded Mavromicali of his agreement, the Governor made no reply. Eventually Zebra fired a carronade at the bow of the galley, dismounting one of the galliot's four guns. Mavromicalli agreed to give up his ship and the British then seized her. Zebra sailed on 10 February with her capture and arrived in Zante on the next evening.|$|E

500|$|Some Megalithic Period Menhirs {{are next}} to Neolithic pits, {{suggesting}} a gradual transition {{between the two}} phases.

Craftsmanship was superior during this period with finds of wheel made durable [...] hard red ware, copper objects, and tools made of bone and stone. Structures made of rubble were also found.

The bark is generally dark brown to grey—smooth in younger plants though it can be furrowed and <b>rough</b> <b>in</b> older plants. Branchlets may be bare and smooth or covered with a white bloom.

Field observations at Hale Conservation Park show the bulk of new growth to take place over spring and summer from October to January.|$|E
500|$|Sexuality {{and sexual}} {{identity}} {{is the most}} prevalent theme in the novel. The title is an obscure Victorian pornographic slang reference to cunnilingus. Nick Rennison in Contemporary British Authors characterises Tipping the Velvet as an [...] "unabashed and unapologetic celebration of lesbian eroticism and sexual diversity". Donna Allegra writes with appreciation of how the existence of Waters' characters in a heterosexual existence forces an analysis of closeted positions. The sexism of the period puts a stranglehold on women, forcing readers to compare women in the Victorian era with present-day sexual attitudes. Nan never has difficulty accepting her love for Kitty Butler and other women; Kitty's union with Walter, however, [...] "reeks of lesbophobia", according to Allegra. Music halls could be <b>rough</b> <b>in</b> some areas, but Kitty is shown handling drunken and rowdy audiences with humour and grace. The only instance where she is overcome and flees the stage is when a drunken patron shouts a euphemism for a lesbian at her. This episode leads to the final scene of Part I when Nan stumbles upon Kitty and Walter in bed. Kitty does not display any pleasure in their union, but rather complacence tinged with shame. Allegra compares Kitty's desire for normality overshadowing her desire for love with Nan to [...] "compulsory heterosexuality... emblematic of and particular to lesbian existence".|$|E
