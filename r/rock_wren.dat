5|$|Two {{types of}} {{amphibians}} {{are found in}} the mounded prairie region, typically around vernal pools. The Pacific tree frog lives in large numbers on the rocks, while tadpoles of the rarer western toad can be seen between March and May. Mammals such as California voles, Heermann's kangaroo rats, raccoons, and long-tailed weasels can also be found in this region. The western meadowlark and two species of sparrows are the most common types of birds that are seen in the area. Turkey vultures, <b>rock</b> <b>wren,</b> three species of hawks, and other birds patrol the cliffs {{on the sides of the}} plateaus.|$|E
25|$|Both the <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> and the rifleman {{also show}} sexual {{dimorphism}} in size; unusually for passerines, the female {{is larger than}} the male. The female rifleman also exhibits other differences from the male, having a slightly more upturned bill than the male and a larger hind claw.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand wrens {{are tiny}} birds; the rifleman is the {{smallest}} of New Zealand's birds. Their length ranges from 7 to 10cm, and their weight from as little as 5–7 g for the rifleman to an estimated 50 g for the extinct stout-legged wren. The New Zealand <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> (and probably the bushwren) weighs between 14 and 22 g, and the extinct long-billed wren weighed around 30 g.|$|E
50|$|In 2008-2010, a {{total of}} 40 <b>rock</b> <b>wrens</b> were {{translocated}} to Secretary Island, an 8140 ha rodent-free island in Fiordland, the third-tallest island in New Zealand. In 2010 a survey located 12 unbanded <b>rock</b> <b>wrens,</b> indicating they were successfully breeding.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>wrens</b> mostly eat {{invertebrates}} on the ground, {{but will}} sometimes take berries and seeds, and even nectar from flax flowers.|$|R
50|$|Migrating birds flock the forested areas {{surrounding}} the reservoir. Loons, grebes, ducks, and hawks are often seen year round. <b>Rock</b> <b>wrens</b> and golden eagles are occasionally spotted {{in a nearby}} red rock formation.|$|R
25|$|The {{relationships}} between the genera and species are poorly understood. The extant genus Acanthisitta has one species, the rifleman, and the other surviving genus, Xenicus, includes the <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> and the recently extinct bushwren. Some authorities have retained Lyall's wren in Xenicus, as well, but it is often afforded its own monotypic genus, Traversia. The stout-legged wren (genus Pachyplichas) was originally split into two species, but more recent research disputes this. The final genus was Dendroscansor, which had one species, the long-billed wren.|$|E
25|$|The plumage of the New Zealand wrens is {{only known}} for the four species seen by European scientists. All these species have dull green and brown plumage, and all except Lyall's wren have a {{prominent}} supercilium above the eye. The plumage {{of males and females}} were alike in Lyall's wren and the bushwren; the <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> shows slight sexual dimorphism in its plumage and differences between the plumage of riflemen are pronounced, with the male having bright green upperparts and the female being duller and browner.|$|E
25|$|After {{the wave}} of extinctions and range contractions caused {{by the arrival of}} mammals in New Zealand, the New Zealand wrens have a much reduced range. The New Zealand <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> is now {{restricted}} to the South Island and is declining in numbers. The range of the rifleman initially contracted with the felling of forests for agriculture, but it has also expanded its range of habitats by moving into plantations of introduced exotic pines, principally the Monterey pine. It also enters other human-modified habitat when it adjoins native forest.|$|E
5000|$|Among birds, the white-tailed {{ptarmigan}} (Lagopus leucurus) {{are present}} on the mountain, but so well camouflaged that they are difficult to see even when almost underfoot. [...] Brown-capped rosy finches (Leucosticte australis), pipits and <b>rock</b> <b>wrens</b> (Salpinctes obsoletus) are also seen near the summit.|$|R
50|$|Among birds, the white-tailed {{ptarmigan}} (Lagopus leucurus) {{are present}} on Rollins Pass, especially above treeline. Their camouflage is effective against the exposed blocks of granite rendering them virtually {{invisible to the}} eye. Brown-capped rosy finches (Leucosticte australis), <b>rock</b> <b>wrens</b> (Salpinctes obsoletus), and pipits are also seen or heard at timberline and near the summit.|$|R
2500|$|In the valley’s {{riparian}} areas, dusky flycatchers, yellow warblers, orange-crowned warblers, house wrens, {{and spotted}} towhees {{are common in}} the summer months. [...] In the sage steppes and grasslands, summer residents include horned larks, Brewer's sparrows, vesper sparrows, common ravens, sage thrashers, sagebrush sparrows, black-throated sparrows, and greater sage grouse. [...] In the rimrock areas, there are chukars, <b>rock</b> <b>wrens,</b> canyon wrens, cliff swallows, and barn swallows. [...] The valley also hosts mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, black-headed grosbeaks, green-tailed towhees, yellow-rumped warblers, MacGillivray's warblers, mountain bluebirds, white-headed woodpeckers, and flammulated owls. [...] The larger birds include great horned owls, long-eared owls, prairie falcons, golden eagles, and bald eagles.|$|R
25|$|Other {{bird species}} include the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), the black vulture (Coragyps atratus), the {{northern}} cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), the blue grosbeak (Passerina caerulea), the house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), the lesser goldfinch (Spinus psaltria), the broad-billed hummingbird (Cynanthus latirostris), the black-chinned hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri), Costa's hummingbird (Calypte costae), Gambel's quail (Callipepla gambelii), the common raven (Corvus corax), the Gila woodpecker (Melanerpes uropygialis), the gilded flicker (Colaptes chrysoides), the cactus wren (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus), and the <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> (Salpinctes obsoletus). Four types of doves call the Southwest home: the white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), the mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), {{the common ground}} dove (Columbina passerina), and the Inca dove (Columbina inca).|$|E
25|$|New Zealand wrens, {{like many}} New Zealand birds, {{suffered}} several extinctions after {{the arrival of}} humans in New Zealand. Two species became extinct after {{the arrival of the}} Māori and the Polynesian rat, and are known today only from fossil remains; a third, Lyall's wren, became extinct on the main islands, surviving only as a relict population on Stephens Island in the Cook Strait. This species and the bushwren became extinct after the arrival of Europeans, with the bushwren surviving until 1972. Of the two remaining species, the rifleman is still common on both the North and the South Islands, while the New Zealand <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> is restricted to the alpine areas of the South Island and is considered vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Like all New Zealand passerines, the New Zealand wrens are sedentary, and are {{not thought}} to {{undertake}} any migrations. It is not known if the extinct species migrated, but it is considered highly unlikely, as three of the extinct species were flightless. The situation with the <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> is an ornithological mystery, as they are thought to live above the snow line where obtaining food during the winter would be extremely difficult. Searches have {{found no evidence that}} they move altitudinally during the winter, but they are also absent from their normal territories. They may enter a state of torpor (like the hummingbirds of the Americas or a number of Australian passerines) during {{at least part of the}} winter, but this has not yet been proved.|$|E
2500|$|Ana River {{habitats}} {{support a}} diverse population of upland game birds, songbirds, shorebirds, waterfowl, and birds of prey. [...] In the dry high desert country along the upper Ana River, California quail and mourning doves are very common. [...] There {{is also a}} small breeding population of ring-necked pheasants in that area along with greater sage grouse, and chukars. Songbirds common to the upper Ana River area include bullock's orioles, sage thrashers, canyon <b>wrens,</b> <b>rock</b> <b>wrens,</b> and sagebrush sparrows. Songbirds commonly found in the marshy areas of the lower Ana River include Brewer's sparrows, lark sparrows, marsh wrens, red-winged blackbirds, and yellow-headed blackbirds.|$|R
50|$|Pairs {{maintain}} a year-round territory, {{and work together}} to build a large enclosed nest with an entrance tunnel. The nest is lined with feathers, often from other species of birds. Guthrie-Smith recovered 791 feathers from one nest in the 1930s, most from weka, but including some kiwi, kakapo, kea, and kereru. (<b>Rock</b> <b>wrens</b> are such assiduous collectors of feathers that their nests have been checked for kakapo feathers, to determine if those endangered parrots are in the area.) Around three eggs are laid in late spring and incubated for three weeks. Chicks take about 24 days to fledge and are fed for at least 4 weeks.|$|R

25|$|The New Zealand wrens are endemic and {{restricted}} to the main and offshore islands of New Zealand; {{they have not been}} found on any of the outer islands such as the Chathams or the Kermadec Islands. Prior to the arrival of humans in New Zealand (about 1280 AD), they had a widespread distribution across the North and South Islands and on Stewart Island/Rakiura. The range of the rifleman and bushwren included southern beech forest and podocarp-broadleaf forest, with the range of the bushwren also including coastal forest and scrub, particularly the Stewart Island subspecies. The New Zealand <b>rock</b> <b>wren</b> is specialised for the alpine environment, in areas of low scrub and scree from 900 m up to 2,400 m. Contrary to its other common name (the South Island wren), fossil evidence shows it was more widespread in the past and once lived on the North Island. Lyall's wren was once thought to have been {{restricted to the}} tiny Stephens Island in Cook Strait, but fossil evidence has shown the species was once widespread on both the North and South Islands. The stout-legged wren was similarly found on both islands, but fossils of the long-billed wren have only been found on the South Island. Fossils of the long-billed wren are far less common than those of the other species, in fact, its bones are the rarest fossil finds in New Zealand.|$|E

2500|$|New Zealand wrens {{are mostly}} insectivorous foragers of New Zealand’s forests, with one species, the New Zealand <b>rock</b> <b>wren,</b> being {{restricted}} to alpine areas. Both the remaining species are poor fliers {{and four of}} the five extinct species are known to be or are suspected of having been flightless (based on observations of living birds and the size of their sterna); along with the long-legged bunting from the Canary Islands, they are the only passerines known to have lost the ability to fly. Of the species for which the plumage is known they are drab-coloured birds with brown-green plumage. [...] They form monogamous pair bonds to raise their young laying their eggs in small nests in trees or amongst rocks. They are diurnal and like all New Zealand passerines, for the most part, are sedentary.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{currently}} confined to alpine and subalpine zones (900-2500 m altitude) of the Southern Alps, the Tasman Mountains of Northwest Nelson, and the Victoria Range of Westland, {{all in the}} South Island; it is New Zealand's only truly alpine bird. Subfossil remains suggest before Polynesian settlement it was also found in lowland forest and in the North Island. Its current alpine distribution is a habitat where few rodents can survive, full of sheltering rocks and dense vegetation.Their preferred habitat {{is close to the}} treeline, amongst rockfalls, scree, fellfield, and low scrub. <b>Rock</b> <b>wrens,</b> unlike many alpine birds, do not migrate to lower elevations in winter; instead, they seem to shelter and forage in rockfalls beneath the snow layer.|$|R
25|$|The Salmon Falls Creek {{watershed}} {{varies widely}} {{in terms of}} different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden currant, cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, {{the vast majority of}} the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and <b>rock</b> <b>wrens,</b> cliff swallow, violet-green swallow, barn swallow, screech owl, long-eared owl, great horned owl, kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon. Mule deer also inhabit areas of the middle and upper Salmon Falls Creek basin.|$|R
40|$|Columnar basalt pillars, {{lava flows}} and other channeled scabland {{formations}} provide the dramatic {{backdrop for the}} Columbia National Wildlife Refuge landscape, {{as they have for}} thousands of years. Intermingled with lands managed by other Federal agencies and the State of Washington, the Refuge helps to create a connected system of wildlife habitats important to migratory and resident species. A few thousand acres of lakes and wetlands, along with their adjacent uplands, attract many thousands of mallards, northern pintails, Canada geese, Sandhill cranes, and other migrating waterfowl and waterbirds to this otherwise arid environment. Long-billed curlews, Wilson’s phalaropes, black-necked stilts, and American avocets find nourishment in the refuge’s mudflats and nest in nearby grasslands. Shrub-steppe habitat on Columbia National Wildlife Refuge is healing from the scars of wildfires, invasive species, and other adverse impacts, with loggerhead shrikes, sage thrashers, sage sparrows, and other sagebrush-obligate species becoming more abundant within contiguous blocks of bunchgrass and sagebrush habitat. Badgers, burrowing owls, and Washington ground squirrels continue to thrive as they play out their ancient predator and prey relationships. The nests of prairie falcons, ferruginous hawks, canyon and <b>rock</b> <b>wrens</b> are secure—high on the refuge’s cliffs, outcroppings and talus slopes—which they share with other rocky residents including rattlesnakes, skinks, bats, marmots, and colorful lichens.

5000|$|The geology of Annet is of Hercynian granite overlain with {{raised beach}} deposits. On the {{southern}} end there is a [...] "thick bed of soil, part sand and part soil". The island is low-lying with a top height of 18 m and the coast consists of boulder storm beaches. The effects of wind exposure, salt spray and lack of topography, restricts diversity and only 53 species of vascular plants have been recorded. The north of the island is dominated by a well developed, thick, thrift (Armeria maritima) turf whilst the southern part is dominated by dense stands of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), with some sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus). Thickets of tree mallow (Lavatera arborea) have developed {{at the back of}} some of the boulder beaches. There were scattered colonies of shore dock (Rumex rupestris) until a storm in 1982 swept away some of the boulder beaches. One colony remains in the corner of a relatively sheltered beach in the south of the island at a freshwater seepage. Shore dock is one of the primary reasons for the selection of the Isles of Scilly as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Annet is the ″British stronghold″ for the lichen Roccella fuciformis.A description of the island by Hilda Quick, a former resident of St Agnes published in 1964 is still relevant today:Many people are disappointed at being unable to visit the famous bird sanctuary, but in fact, there is very little to see there by day. There will be shearwater corpses lying about, (victims of the gulls) several large colonies of gulls, some oystercatchers, <b>rock</b> pipits, and <b>wrens.</b> The walking on the island is horrid, much of it over loose stones hidden in long grass, some bramble and bracken, and awkward great clumps of thrift. What Annet is famous for is its colonies of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels; but since they nest underground, and only come and go in the dark, there is nothing to be seen of them by day. One has to camp out for the night, which is often a chilly process, and requires special permission.
