30|$|Commentators {{have argued}} that for {{research}} involving vulnerable subjects, the risk of research procedures that do not offer a prospect of direct benefit should be capped {{at the level of}} minimal risk [5, 56, 57]. This position reflects the concern that vulnerable subjects should not be put at undue risk for the sake of society and that such research is exploitative. However, advocating such a <b>risk</b> <b>ceiling</b> would seriously impair important research. Also, there is justification for allowing research procedures without a prospect of direct benefit and no more than a minor increment above minimal risk. For example, with a concept of minimal risk reflecting an absolute standard linked to socially acceptable risks, procedures that involve a minor increment above minimal risk would pose no significant threat to the subject's health. Procedures common in critical care research relevant to this risk category would include non-contrast CT scans and the obtainment of additional bronchoalveolar lung (BAL) fluid in patients undergoing this procedure for clinical diagnostic purposes.|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Biomedical research involving human subjects is an arena of conflicts of interests. One {{of the most}} important conflicts is between interests of participants and interests of future patients. Legal regulations and ethical guidelines are instruments designed to help find a fair balance between risks and burdens taken by research sub-jects and development of knowledge and new treatment. There is an universally accepted ethical principle, which states that it is not ethically allowed to sacrifice individual interests for the sake of society and science. This is the principle of precedence of individual. But there is a prob-lem with how to interpret the principle of precedence of individual in the context of research without prospect of future benefit involving children. There are proposals try-ing to reconcile non-beneficial research involving children with the concept of the best interests. We assert that this reconciliation is flawed and propose an interpretation of the principle of precedence of individual as follows: not all, but only the most important interests of participants, must be guaranteed; this principle should be interpreted as the secure participant standard. In consequence, the issue of permissible <b>risk</b> <b>ceiling</b> becomes ethically crucial in research with incompetent subjects...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of including measures of emotion processing, such as tests of facial emotion recognition (FER), {{as part of}} a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment is being increasingly recognized. In clinical settings, FER tests need to be sensitive, short, and easy to administer, given the limited time available and patient limitations. Current tests, however, commonly use stimuli that either display prototypical emotions, bearing the <b>risk</b> of <b>ceiling</b> effects and unequal task difficulty, or are cognitively too demanding and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations in FER testing in patient populations, we aimed to define FER threshold levels for the six basic emotions in healthy individuals. Forty-nine healthy individuals between 52 and 79 years of age were asked to identify the six basic emotions at different intensity levels (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 %, and 125 % of the prototypical emotion). Analyses uncovered differing threshold levels across emotions and sex of facial stimuli, ranging from 50 % up to 100 % intensities. Using these findings as "healthy population benchmarks”, we propose to apply these threshold levels to clinical populations either as facial emotion recognition or intensity rating tasks. As part of any comprehensive social cognition test battery, this approach should allow for a rapid and sensitive assessment of potential FER deficits. (JINS, 2015, 21, 568 - 572...|$|R

5000|$|By restricting flight, wing {{clipping}} {{may help}} prevent indoor birds from <b>risking</b> injury from <b>ceiling</b> fans or flying into large windows. But {{there is no evidence}} to show that clipped birds are safer than full-winged ones, only that clipped birds are subject to different kinds of accidents than full-winged birds. [...] Social pet birds (such as parrots) may also be clipped both to restrict independence and in attempts to make them tamer and easier to manage in order to encourage them to socialize with their owners. Some parrots that show aggression to certain people or other birds may be clipped to prevent attack. However, birds can be trained to accept flight requests or 'commands' and this removes the need for wing-clipping (Glendell 2007). Clipped birds should not be taken outdoors unrestrained, as even clipped birds have been known to fly away when spooked outdoors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The cadmium (Cd) {{contaminated}} {{rice fields}} in Mae Sot District, Tak Province, Thailand {{has been one}} of the major environmental problems in Thailand for the last 10 years. We used disability adjusted life years (DALYs) to estimate the burden of disease attributable to Cd in terms of additional DALYs of Mae Sot residents. Cd exposure data included Cd and β 2 –microglobulin (β 2 -MG) in urine (as an internal exposure dose) and estimated cadmium daily intake (as an external exposure dose). Compared to the general Thai population, Mae Sot residents gained 10 %– 86 % DALYs from nephrosis/nephritis, heart diseases, osteoporosis and cancer depending on their Cd exposure type and exposure level. The results for urinary Cd and dietary Cd intake varied according to the studies used for <b>risk</b> estimation. The <b>ceiling</b> effect was observed in results using dietary Cd intake because of the high Cd content in rice grown in the Mae Sot area. The results from β 2 -MG were more robust with additional DALYs ranging from 36 %– 86 % for heart failure, cerebral infarction, an...|$|R
40|$|Political risk {{insurance}} {{is concerned with}} the risk associated with government intervention and restriction of trade into emerging markets. It may encompass long-term perils (investment related), such as the confiscation, expropriation or nationalization of an infrastructure project in an emerging market or short term perils (export trade related), such as contract frustration, embargo or currency inconvertibility. Today exposure to the political will of a host country is being challenged by economic events blurring the landscape for political risk, which is creating a growing need for better informed econometrics, and advanced analysis of risk vs. reward, as well as a broader interpretation of covered perils and events. The need for reinsurance capacity in Political Risk is higher {{than it has been in}} a decade. However, more and more reinsurers are either restricting the coverage or entirely leaving the practice. This paper proposes an objective reinsurance pricing methodology to assess the risk of writing a large political risk reinsurance portfolio based on country <b>risk</b> ratings, sovereign <b>ceilings,</b> political <b>risk</b> default rates and severity assumptions based on historical data. The paper also incorporates a mechanism to indicate the effects of regional and trade correlations based on the advanced credit modeling. Having such an objective methodology to assess the risk of reinsuring political risk should broaden support from traditional reinsurance markets and attract risk capital from the capital markets...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUNLABELLED: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Several {{comparative}} measures (ratios, differences, or {{the number}} needed to treat) are used to express {{the effect of a}} drug or another intervention. These measures can vary in the way they are affected by the background risk measured from the reference group. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This paper reviews the formulation, interpretation and limitations of measures of effect. We describe a little-known parameter, the attained effect or clinical result ratio, a positive reformulation of the relative risk difference, and suggest how available parameters can be best used to summarize results of studies of the effect of drugs. AIMS Measures to compare two drugs are often affected by the background risk in the reference group; a ceiling effect results when the background risk is small. We review measures of the effect of drugs, including a special formulation of the relative risk difference, the attained effect or clinical result ratio, that addresses background <b>risk</b> and <b>ceiling</b> effect. METHODS: Existing measures are the risk and odds ratios, the absolute and relative risk differences, and the number needed to treat. The attained effect is defined as the observed gain in success (the difference of proportion of success between the two interventions), divided by the maximum attainable gain, the maximum proportion of success one can expect. We illustrate the relationship between these measures with published results of two meta-analyses. RESULTS: In studies of the effectiveness of cell salvage, the baseline risk ranged between 8 and 95 %. This variability affected the risk difference and number needed to treat, while the attained effect, with a <b>ceiling</b> residual <b>risk</b> of 2 %, showed that the gain in success was half the maximum attainable gain. In studies of the effectiveness of therapy in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus, where the baseline risk was less variable, and there was no ceiling effect, the maximum attained effect indicated that the gain could be much smaller. CONCLUSION: The attained effect, interpreted as the proportion of effectiveness that remains to gain for future interventions, can usefully complete the number needed to treat as a clinically informative effect measure...|$|R

This method should be applicable to various types of environmental contamination problems if exposure assessment information is available...|$|R
