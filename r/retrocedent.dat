These companies typically participate {{in one or}} more reinsurance treaties to protect buyers, most commonly insurers (called [...] "cedants") or reinsurers (called [...] "retrocedents"). This contract may be structured as a derivative in cases in which it is [...] "triggered" [...] by one or more indices or event parameters (see below), rather than losses of the cedant or <b>retrocedent.</b>|$|E
