But, like all theories, it has undergone considerable modifications in actual fact. Theoretically, an advocate gives his services to his client gratuitously but in fact he receives an honorarium or fee, though not a remuneration for his advocacy. A medical practitioner was originally supposed to act for the good of humanity, and it is only in comparatively recent times that he has been privileged to sue for remuneration for his work. A minister of the Gospel is still supposed to work for the good of his congregation, and the stipend which accompanies or flows from his work is rather the free-will offering of a grateful people than the <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> paid to him in accordance with contract. It so happens, then, in the administration of the law, that the only persons now who are not remunerated for their services are the high sheriffs, justices of the peace, and jurors...|$|E

Low <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> farm <b>work</b> and the resultant low profitability are the largest problems of many farms. Several causes of the low profitability are evaluated. We show that all relevant causes are closely interrelated and that the extraordinarily high labour intensity has the largest impact. Subsequently, we analyse several causes of the extremely large share of agricultural employment in the Polish economy. Low skills of farm workers, the poor performance of the land market and the high level of subsidisation of the social security system for farmers (KRUS) are identified as the most important causes. Finally, some policy recommendations are given. ...|$|R

The article formulates conceptual provisions that reveal the essence of the “fair compensatory policy” notion. In the result of the study the article assesses impact on the effective feature “the level of perception of the system <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> labour as fair by employed workers” of such factor features as the level of satisfaction of the worker with the size <b>of</b> <b>remuneration,</b> level <b>of</b> transparency of the system <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> labour, level <b>of</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> on complexity <b>of</b> <b>works</b> and duties, and the level <b>of</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> on individual results of labour.

Moreover, such a situation is possible also in case of dissatisfaction of the worker with the size of his or her remuneration.

The new system of planning of the production and procurement of agricultural products has become an important feature of this policy. It is based on the establishment of firm purchase plans, the closer proximity of purchase prices to socially necessary expenditures, and price markups for selling products to the state in excess of the plan.

40|$|Background: The {{provision}} {{of health care}} in South Africa has been compromised by the loss of trained health workers (HWs) over the past 20 years. The public-sector workforce is overburdened. There is a large disparity in service levels and workloads between the private and public sectors. There is little knowledge about the nonfinancial factors that influence HWs choice of employer (public, private or nongovernmental organization) or their choice <b>of</b> <b>work</b> location(urban, rural or overseas). This area is under-researched and this paper aims to fill these gaps in the literature. Method: The study utilized cross-sectional survey data gathered in 2009 in KwaZulu-Natal province. The HWs sample came from three public hospitals (n= 430), two private hospitals (n= 131) and one nongovernmental organization hospital (n= 133) in urban areas, and consisted of professional nurses, staff nurses and nursing assistants. Results: HWs in the public sector reported the poorest working conditions, as indicated by participants' self-reports on stress, workloads, levels <b>of</b> <b>remuneration,</b> standard <b>of</b> <b>work</b> premises, level <b>of</b> human resources and frequency of in-service training. Interesting, however, HWs in the nongovernmental organization sector expressed a greater desire than those in {{the public and private sectors}} to leave their current employer. Conclusions: To minimize attrition from the overburdened public-sector workforce and the negative effects of the overall shortage of HWs, innovative efforts are required to address the causes of HWs dissatisfaction and to further identify the nonfinancial factors that influence <b>work</b> choices <b>of</b> HWs. The results highlight the importance of considering a broad range of nonfinancial incentives that encourage HWs to remain in the already overburdened public sector. ...|$|R
