40|$|Abstract—In modern non-customized {{multicore}} architectures, computing cores commonly share {{large parts}} of the memory hierarchy. This paper presents a scheme for controlling the shar-ing of main memory among cores, respectively the concurrently executing real-time tasks. This is important for the following: concurrent memory accesses are served sequentially by the memory controller. As task execution stalls until memory fetches are served, the latter significantly contributes to the execution time of the tasks. With multiple real-time tasks concurrently competing for the access to the memory, the main memory can easily become the Achilles heel for the timing correctness of the tasks. To provide hard timing guarantees, release of access requests issued to the main memory has therefore to be controlled. Run-time budgeting is a well accepted technique for controlling and coordinating the use of a shared resource, particularly when the underlying hardware cannot be altered. Whilst guaranteeing timing correctness of the hard real-time applications, worst-case based <b>resource</b> <b>budgeting</b> commonly leads to performance degradations of the co-running (so called soft real-time) appli-cations. In this paper we propose to combine worst-case based <b>resource</b> <b>budgeting</b> with run-time monitoring for dynamically re-configuring the budget schemes. Thereby we aim at increasing the responsiveness of the soft real-time applications, while satisfying the strict timing constraints of the co-running hard real-time tasks. We have implemented the proposed scheme in a microker-nel and present its empirical evaluation for which an industrial benchmark suite has been employed...|$|E

40|$|Critical {{real-time}} systems {{require the}} estimation of the worst-case execution time (WCET) for scheduling purposes and <b>resource</b> <b>budgeting.</b> Measurement-based probabilistic timing analysis (MBPTA) has been shown recently as a powerful approach for WCET estimation.

While aging has been deeply analyzed for conventional time-deterministic caches (i. e., implementing modulo placement), little {{work has been done}} to assess the reliability of time-randomized caches. In this line, only the WCET analysis of faulty time-randomized caches has been introduced recently. However, the intrinsic robustness of randomized hardware designs has not been assessed yet. In this paper we perform, for the first time, an assessment of the agingrobustness of random placement cache designs: random modulo and hash-based random placement. We propose a new random modulo implementation preserving its key benefits in terms of low critical path impact, low miss rates and MBPTA compliance; while reducing hot-carrier injection aging by achieving a better, yet random, activity distribution across cache sets. On the other hand, we show that gains in terms of bias temperature instability aging are limited for random placement designs on their own. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Interactions {{between the}} {{components}} of a multiple-signal sexual display can be complex, and previous work has shown that alteration of one component can lead to changed investment in either the altered or other display components. Extended phenotype signals (nonbody structures that carry a signalling function) provide an ideal means to manipulate signal quality in a noninvasive manner, to investigate investment patterns in display components. We made three predictions as to how males might alter investment in display components in response to artificial enhancement of an extended phenotype signal, and tested those predictions using three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. The addition of brightly coloured ornaments (threads) to the nests of male sticklebacks led to increased investment in both courtship of females and nest construction. In a field experiment, males offered coloured threads spent increased time engaged in interactions with females, and in the laboratory, they built nests that were neater and more compact (better quality), relative to males offered dull threads. Our findings support a hypothesis based on <b>resource</b> <b>budgeting,</b> and suggest that resources saved by having an artificially enhanced nest are reallocated to other courtship behaviours. The study provides a framework for investigating the interaction between signal components, and demonstrates that manipulation of extended phenotype signals can {{provide insight into the}} ways in which animals balance investment in interacting signal components in sexual displays...|$|E

Our methodology utilizes the concept of “soft ” instruction templates, which can be adapted by adding operations to them or deleting operations from them {{at any time during the}} design space exploration process, allowing for global design decisions to be interleaved with finegrained optimizations. We have integrated our methodology in an open source compiler, and verified it using a commercial extensible processor.

40|$|The recent {{increase}} of foreign students {{in higher education}} conflicts with <b>resource</b> <b>budgeting</b> and priorities. Universities are compelled to implement diverse strategies to keep them solvent. Interestingly, one of the responses to increase revenues is to recruit out-of-state students especially international students for higher tuition returns additionally, universities posit internationalization as a necessary component to becoming a “metropolitan research university of distinction” (Task Force 2006, 1). The goal is to elevate its standing in the global market of higher education. However, these efforts compromise the education of foreign students and how thesestudents are taught. By recruiting foreign students, universities transfer both increased costs and intercultural competency onto them. Neoliberal rationality permeates these policies as it “structures and organizes …the action of rulers, but also {{the conduct of the}} ruled” (Dardot and Laval 2013, 4). The American Council in Education (ACE) says as much when it states, “Graduates must possess intercultural skills and competencies to be successful in this globalized world” (2011, 3). Students are accountable for their “collection of skills” (Gershon 2011, 539). Thus, students are expected to be multicultural yet be responsible for their own “entrepreneurial virtues” that a globalized world requires. In the case of foreign students, they are expected to be intercultural ambassadors as universities “slowly and steadily shift… its investment toward the higher yielding crop,” that is them (Clawson and Page 2011, 18 - 19). Presently, universities project themselves as marketplaces where students can acquire skills to become their “own business” (Gershon 2011, 539). Students are expected to become “global citizens,” therefore, higher education institutions “must commit to helping students achieve these outcomes” (ACE 2012, 3). U. S higher education asserts itself to English as a Second Language (ESL) students as the best option to acquire English as a desirable and marketable skill. This paper suggests that foreign students experience themselves as the newcustomers of culture inthe university marketplace. In short, what effect does the commodification of higher education have in shaping foreign students’ agency? Currently, universities emphasize the acquisition of a second language as a vehicle for global, social and economic mobility, while foreign students perceive English proficiency as a valuable skill. When recruitinginternational students, universities highlight living in a city where English is the predominant language spoken as an American cultural experience. This suggests foreign students should expect to experience a true cultural experience immersed in a new language. However, the cultural experiences “commonly offered [are] ongoing international festivals or events on campus” (13), in other words, campus life. In addition, the ESL courses are reduced to a service learning program administered by native English-speaking student peers. By offering native undergraduates credit for mentoring in these classes, such as “International Peer Service Learning,” they “assist” ESL students “with linguistic and cultural activities” (FORLNG 123). This is problematic because cultural transference is assumed to just happen in this setting. Recent research on ESL programs in higher education focus on the pedagogy used to teach them, online, tutors, computer essay-scoring programs, and so on. Therefore, this studyexamines how ESL programs re-shape foreign students expectations of learning outcomes. This project seeks to remedy this gap by conducting open-ended interviews in a semi-structured format to students at Boise State University. Works Cited Clawson, Dan, and Max Page.

40|$|Abstract. Pre-deployment {{tests of}} sensor {{networks}} in indoor testbeds can only deliver a very approximate {{view of the}} correctness and performance of a deployed sensor network and it is therefore common that after deployment problems and failures occur {{that could not be}} observed during pre-deployment tests. Finding and fixing such problems requires visibility of the system state, such that an engineer can identify causes of misbehavior. Unfortunately, exposing the internal state of sensor nodes requires resources such as communication bandwidth and energy: the better visibility of system state is required, the more resources are needed to extract that state from the sensor network. In this paper we propose a concept and tool that give the user explicit control over this tradeoff. Essentially, the user can specify a <b>resource</b> <b>budget</b> and our tool strives to provide best possible visibility while not exceeding the <b>resource</b> <b>budget.</b> We present the design of our vLevels framework and report the results of a case study demonstrating that the overhead of our approach is small and that visibility is automatically adjusted to meet the specified <b>resource</b> <b>budget.</b> ...|$|R
