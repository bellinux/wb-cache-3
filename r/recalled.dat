Learning from toy <b>recalls</b> Current research on product <b>recalls</b> suggests that <b>recalls</b> present significant challenges to managers and affect organizational performance. However, very little is known about the effect of product <b>recalls</b> on organizational learning. In this paper, we argue that product <b>recalls</b> help organizational learning and reduces future <b>recalls.</b> Specifically, we contend that product <b>recall</b> experience of various types is associated with reduced future <b>recalls.</b> We test our contentions on the toy <b>recalls</b> initiated by 192 unique firms over an 11 -year period and found broad support for our hypothesis. Our findings have important implications for the research and practice on organizational learning and product <b>recalls.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Modality {{can refer}} {{to a number of}} {{characteristics}} of the presented study material. However, this term is usually used to describe the improved <b>recall</b> of the final items of a list when that list is presented verbally in comparison with a visual representation. The effect is seen in free <b>recall</b> (<b>recall</b> of list items in any given order), serial <b>recall</b> (<b>recall</b> of list items in the order of study), short-term sentence <b>recall</b> (<b>recall</b> specific words from sentences with similar meanings) and paired associate <b>recall</b> (<b>recall</b> of a pair from presentation of one of its members). For paired associates, the effect is limited to an increased probability of <b>recall</b> for the final 2 or 3 pairs studied. In free <b>recall</b> and serial <b>recall,</b> the modality effect is seen as simply an exaggerated recency effect in tests where presentation is auditory. In short-term sentence <b>recall</b> studies, emphasis is placed on words in a distractor-word list when requesting information from the remembered sentence. This demonstrates the modality effect can be more than auditory or visual.|$|R
5000|$|Free <b>recall</b> {{is a basic}} {{paradigm}} in the psychological study of memory. In this paradigm, participants study a list of items on each trial, and then are prompted to <b>recall</b> the items in any order (hence the name [...] "free" [...] <b>recall).</b> Items are usually presented {{one at a time}} for a short duration, and can be any of a number of nameable materials, although traditionally, words from a larger set are chosen. The <b>recall</b> period typically lasts a few minutes, and can involve spoken or written <b>recall.</b> The standard {{paradigm in}}volves the <b>recall</b> period starting immediately after the final list item; this can be referred to as immediate free <b>recall</b> (IFR) to distinguish it from delayed free <b>recall</b> (DFR). In delayed free <b>recall,</b> a short distraction period is interpolated between the final list item and the start of the <b>recall</b> period. Both immediate free <b>recall</b> and delayed free <b>recall</b> have been used to test certain effects that appear during <b>recall</b> tests, such as the primacy effect and recency effect. Free <b>recall</b> consists of two stages: the emptying of a limited capacity working memory and a reactivation stage.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} 5 {{experiments}} investigated whether false memory in associated word lists present with serial position effects (SPE) and how any such effects behave {{in response to}} manipulations of true <b>recall</b> SPE. <b>Recall</b> {{for a series of}} events is typified by SPE such that items nearer the beginning, primacy effect, and end, recency effect, of a series are remembered better than middle items. <b>Recall</b> is also typified by the intrusion of falsely remembered information. Word-lists segmented into trimesters of either semantically (e. g., hot, snow, warm [...] . / bed, rest, awake [...] . / looking, lens, shatter [...] .) or phonologically (e. g., code, called, fold [...] . / sweep, sleet, steep [...] . / class, grass, glad [...] .) associated words produced false <b>recall</b> (e. g., cold, sleep, glass), allowing for the simultaneous investigation of SPE for true and false <b>recall.</b> Typical SPE for true <b>recall</b> were observed for each of the five Experiments. For immediate free <b>recall,</b> semantic false <b>recall</b> declined from early to late study trimesters whereas phonological false <b>recall</b> displayed a false primacy and recency effect similar to true <b>recall</b> SPE. Phonological false <b>recall</b> was significantly reduced when a 15 second distractor task was implemented during the retention interval. Dividing attention during study using a concurrent handwriting task reduced true <b>recall</b> whereas semantic false <b>recall</b> increased at primacy and phonological false <b>recall</b> increased at recency. This suggests distinct processes underlying the two forms of false <b>recall.</b> Dividing attention using an articulatory suppression task produced less true <b>recall</b> and less false <b>recall</b> than using concurrent handwriting. This research indicates that false <b>recall</b> SPE exist and that the semantic and phonological forms of false <b>recall</b> SPE are distinct.

40|$|Background: Eye {{movement}} desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is {{an effective}} treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. The working memory (WM) theory explains its efficacy: <b>recall</b> of an aversive memory and making eye movements (EM) both produce cognitive load, and competition for the limited WM resources reduces the memory's vividness and emotionality.

In one view, the independent associations hypothesis, the strength of forward and backward <b>recall</b> are hypothesized to be independent of each other.

40|$|A vast {{literature}} {{and our own}} common sense tell us that free <b>recall</b> (i. e., <b>recalling</b> information without hints) is harder and less successful than cued <b>recall</b> (i. e., <b>recalling</b> information with hints). In this dissertation, I argue that in past work free and cued <b>recall</b> has not been directly comparable because cued <b>recall</b> procedures encourage guessing {{and the nature of}} the cues promotes accurate guesses. These biases often inflate cued <b>recall</b> performance above free <b>recall,</b> creating the illusion that cued <b>recall</b> is superior to free <b>recall.</b> To control for these issues, I introduce the recognized <b>recall</b> procedure. Recognized <b>recall</b> requires subjects to produce a word on every test trial and subsequently to recognize those produced words as “old” or “new. ” Across eight experiments with recognized <b>recall,</b> it is demonstrated that cueing does help subjects produce more studied words than in free <b>recall,</b> however, subjects are often unable to recognize those extra words produced. Worse yet, false memories are observed to rise in all cases of cueing. Three subsequent experiments demonstrate that cueing fails to improve <b>recall</b> consistently because cues do not always cue the same meaning of the word as was encoded at study. A final experiment demonstrates that free associates of studied words produced by subjects can be highly effective at improving memory if used as cues at test. It is concluded that cues can improve memory if they are specific to the study episode but can often lead to a rise in false memories. Thus, in terms of consistently optimizing accurate <b>recall</b> while minimizing false memories, free <b>recall</b> may actually be superior to cued <b>recall...</b>|$|R
