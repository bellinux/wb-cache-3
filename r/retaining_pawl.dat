50|$|In 1968, the MG 3 was {{introduced}} and entered production. Compared to the MG1A3, the MG 3 features an improved feeding mechanism with a belt <b>retaining</b> <b>pawl</b> {{to hold the}} belt up to the gun when the top cover plate is lifted, an added anti-aircraft sight and a new ammunition box. MG 3s were produced for Germany and for export customers by Rheinmetall until 1979. Some additional production of the MG 3 in Germany {{was carried out by}} Heckler & Koch. The MG 3 and its variants all share a high level of parts interchangeability with the original MG 42.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{prolong the}} life of {{cartridge}} <b>retaining</b> <b>pawl</b> and link stopper in a gun cartridge retaining Mechanism, three compression springs ’ stiffness are reduced via design study and optimization design based on dynamic analysis. Presenting the load of shell on a typical stage while entering-bore, differential equations of motion in this mechanism are established. With translational velocity of shell as the design variable, a design research and simulation analysis are made. And the relationship between shell velocity and proper shell-feed is acquired. An evaluation function is built using springs ’ stiffness with preference-selection. With this evaluation function as the optimum objective, spring stiffness as design variables, and proper shell-feed as constraint condition, the minimum of three spring stiffness is obtained after calculation. The results indicate that compared with the original design parameters optimization results, are significantly improved with the stiffness decreased separately by 20. 27 %, 11. 99 % and 6. 86 %...|$|E
50|$|In November 2013, FN Herstal {{unveiled}} the improved Mk3 {{version of the}} Minimi light machine gun. The upgrades were based on operational experience and user feedback over the past 10-15 years. It {{can be converted to}} fire either 5.56x45mm or 7.62x51mm rounds. The stock is 5-position adjustable that is also adjustable for cheek rest height with a folding shoulder rest and hydraulic buffer. The feed tray has <b>retaining</b> <b>pawls</b> to hold ammunition from the belt in place while loading. The handguard has three forward picatinny rails. A new bipod is 3-position height adjustable and seamlessly integrates into the shape of the handguard when folded back regardless of accessories that may be attached. Others features include a more ergonomic cocking handle and an optional heat shield to protect from barrel heat. Users that already have Minimi machine guns can partially or completely upgrade their existing weapons with the Mk3 features.|$|R
