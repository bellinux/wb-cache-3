For this reason, diverse systems of application are being developed to reduce application volumes and improve the uniformity of pesticide deposition. The goal of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of two application systems of pesticides in citrus trees. One system used a prototype for terrestrial application with <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> <b>atomizers</b> that are widely used in agricultural aviation, and the other system used hollow cone tip hydraulics. For {{the treatment of the}} trees the insecticide Metidation was used at the dose of 180 gr per hectare. To study the droplet spectrum, water-sensitive papers were installed at different positions in the trees canopy, and for the study of insecticide deposition leaves of the treated plants were collected. The water-sensitive papers were collected and analyzed using a computerized image analysis system (e-Sprinkle, EMBRAPA, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and the leaves analyzed by the technique of gas chromatography. Pesticide deposition was similar in both application system, although the solution volume used by the application system equipped with <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> <b>atomizers</b> was one quarter of the volume used by the application system equipped with hydraulic tips, reducing considerably the cost of the phytosanitary treatments...|$|R
40|$|Cotton turf and hotwire {{measurements}} {{were used to}} experimentally assess the highly swirling flow characteristics in a spray dryer fitted with a <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> <b>atomizer.</b> The numerical simulation captured key features of the flow field. Analysis revealed that rapid rotation of an atomizing disc tends to centrifugally split the central inlet jet. The flow field exhibited significant long time-scale transient behaviour. However, this centrifugally split jet resulted in a balanced upward recirculation region in the chamber as expected by the jet-feedback mechanism. Detailed analysis using a 'transient air-steady particle' approach revealed that this approach is applicable for such highly swirling transient flows as well. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting the deposition results, particularly in regions of low particle velocities. This is anticipated be an important consideration in future attempts to simulate the predominantly transient flows in spray dryers. (C) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

This study included the characterization of the {{droplet size spectrum}}, via laser diffraction instrument, generated by three blades angles, of 45, 60 and 75 degrees. The spray solution was composed of Picoxystrobin+ Cyproconazole fungicide (SC), at 20 mL c. p. L&# 8722; 1, and at a flow rate of 6 L min&# 8722; 1. As the angle decreased from 75 to 45 degrees, the rotational speed of the atomizers increased and the volume median diameter (VMD) decreased. However, increasing the rotational speed also increased the percentage of droplets smaller than 100 µm (% < 100 µm). At the blade angles of 45 and 60 degrees the atomizers showed that % < 100 µm was higher than 20 % and VMD was smaller than 198 µm. The <b>disc</b> type <b>atomizer</b> resulted in the lower values of relative span (RS).

40|$|The {{investigation}} was conducted {{as a part}} of the requirements for a Masters Degree in Agriculture at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The work is a result. of cooperation between the Department of Agricultural Engineering and The Swedish Sugar Company. Earlier Swedish investigations have indicated that band spraying with small volume rates (30 - 60 l/ha) can produce a result as good as when spraying with conventional volume rates (about 200 l/ha). Therefore, there is an interest to find an equipment able to distribute small volume rates of spray in a reliable way. The intention was to compare a new Swedish air-turbine-powered <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> to two other <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizers,</b> two flat fan nozzles and one air atomizing nozzle in band spraying in sugarbeet. The nozzles were used in two field trials with different combinations of spray rates, liquid pressure and, where appropriate, air pressure. The trials were conducted in order to elucidate differences in biological effect. The differences were small and only in some cases significant. There was however a tendency towards better and more even effect to the overall spraying with SS 11001 which was included as a comparison. Droplet size was determined with a laser instrument and the results were in very good accordance with what one can expect when varying pressure, flow rate and measuring point in the spray. All the centrifugal nozzles gave a more narrow drop size spectrum than the hydraulic nozzles, though partly dependent on where the measurement was carried out in the spray. The air atomizing nozzle gave a droplet size as small as 50 m. A comparison of treatments with the same amount of spray, i. e. the same herbicide concentration, does not distinctly show better weed control of small droplets than of big ones. The air-turbine-powered <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> showed some technical disadvantages. Disc rotational speed varied a lot and the screening caused drop.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of fuel sprays {{generated by a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> exposed to a cross flow of air. The effects of two variables, the rotational speed and cross-flow velocity, on the droplet sizes were studied. The <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> was driven at speeds up to 15, 000 rpm with a fuel flow rate of 15 kg/h and cross flow from 10 to 150 m/s. For any given rotational speed, the fuel droplet sizes decreased as the air cross flow increased, reaching an almost constant value of about 8 3 ̆bcm at 150 m/s cross-flow velocity. At cross-flow velocities less than about 50 m/s, the fuel droplet sizes decreased as the rotational speed increased. However, at a cross-flow velocity greater than 100 m/s, the fuel droplet sizes did not changed significantly as the rotational speed increased. Of the two variables studied, each influenced the droplet size differently in a certain cross-flow velocity region. The rotational speed influenced the droplet size at relatively low cross-flow velocity. By exceeding a cross-flow velocity of 75 m/s, the dynamic effect of high-speed cross flow became dominant. This effect can be generalized to the Weber number based on the orifice diameter and the non-dimensional droplet size. In this correlation, the following three distinct spray regimes were identified according to the Weber number based on orifice diameter: rotation dominant, intermediate, and cross flow dominant. 9 2012 by Begell House, Inc.

40|$|The {{effect of}} shear rate and oxygen injury during {{atomization}} {{and the combination}} of these factors on the survival of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris in spray drying was studied using laboratory and pilot scale spray dryers. The atomization was carried out using a two-fluid nozzle in the laboratory study and a two-fluid nozzle or <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> in the pilot scale study. The extent of oxygen-induced death was determined using ascorbic acid in the feed and atomizing the feed with gaseous nitrogen. The lowest levels of bacterial death were observed at lowest characteristic shear rate and in the presence of nitrogen and ascorbic acid. Quantitative analysis showed that lower shear rate, creating an oxygen-limiting environment during atomization and drying, and using oxygen scavengers in the feed were successful in enhancing bacterial survival in spray drying. We also report for the first time that, at least for L lactis, the extent of death during the atomization stage far outweighs death during the drying stage, and that the majority of bacterial death (up to 93 %) occurs during the atomization stage. The death of bacteria was found to be less when using a <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> or when using a two-fluid nozzle atomizer at lower flow rate. This work shows that bacterial death during spray drying can be minimized by using oxygen scavengers such as ascorbic acid and/or an anaerobic atomizing medium (such as nitrogen), and by altering the spraying conditions.

40|$|Nowadays, {{pesticides}} use {{is necessary}} to satisfy the growing demand for agricultural products. During pesticide spray application, the agricultural mixture containing the active ingredient is fragmented to a cloud of droplets of various sizes and speeds. The droplet size distribution within the spray affects {{the efficiency of the}} treatment. According to the target, a specific droplet size should be used. However, hydraulic nozzles usually used in field application produce sprays with a wide droplet size distribution containing an important proportion of small or too large droplets. This results in non-optimal application and therefore losses of product into the environment. This statement conducted the research as early as in the 60 ’s to create the <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer.</b> This device is able to produce narrow droplet size distribution using Plateau-Rayleigh break up mechanism. The characteristics of the produced spray by the rotary atomiser can be tuned by adjusting the rotational speed and the volumetric flow rate. Although offering agronomic and environmental qualities this has not met success for the application of plant protection products in field crops because of their cost, size and complexity. The aim of the thesis was the design of a hydraulic nozzle with the <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> qualities and without the constraints of rotating parts. Unlike the <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> which has two control variables, the developed hydraulic nozzle will have a narrower operating range, thus a specific geometry has to be design for each kind of treatment. The new hydraulic nozzle design is composed by an inlet pipe ending perpendiculary on a plate. There is a thin opening at the junction between the pipe and the plate. The edge of the plate is constituted of channels formed by structures. These channels aim to divide the liquid sheet in multiple jets. The breakup of these jets into droplets generate a narrow droplet size distribution. The thesis can been seen as a roadmap providing design tools at each step starting from the determination of an optimal droplet size according to the kind of treatment and ending with a nozzle geometry. The prediction of the optimal droplet size according to the treatment was done using integrated modelling approach of the spray transport and retention by the plant. As each spray requires a specific nozzle geometry, an analytical model of the flow on the nozzle was developed. This model allows the determination of geometry according to the desired spray. Finally, a prototype of nozzle has been built. The measurement of the spray characteristics of the prototype was realized using a developed high-speed imaging technique providing the droplet size and speed. The prototype showed results in term of narrowing of the droplet size distribution...|$|R

The droplet size, velocity, and spray distribution were measured using a phase Doppler particle analyzer system. The spray was photographed using a high-speed camera. The <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> was driven at speeds of 5000 rpm, 10, 000 rpm, and 15, 000 rpm. The fuel flow rate was held constant at 15 kg/h, and the air cross-flow velocities varied from 25 m/s to 150 m/s. The overall spray shape was observed to shrink toward the axis of rotation with increasing cross-flow speeds. High-speed visualization showed that the injected ligaments disintegrate into fairly large droplets and spread out in the radial direction at lower cross-flow velocities. At higher cross-flow speeds, the injected ligaments are abruptly deflected and broken up in the downstream direction close {{to the surface of the}} atomizer and are mixed with the cross-flow air stream immediately. The axial velocity profile indicates that a strong recirculation zone is formed just below the rotating nozzle. A high tangential velocity is shown to exist close to the injection point. Further downstream, the radial velocity component is shown to be dominant, while the tangential velocity becomes weak. The axial velocities show similar trends for the same cross-flow velocities, as the droplets follow the dominant air stream formed by the cross flow regardless of rotational speed. Near the injection orifice, relatively larger droplets are concentrated in a narrow region close to the radius of the atomizer. As the liquid jet travels downstream, the droplets are dispersed by the cross flow and distributed over a wider area. The cross flow influences the Sauter mean diameter directly; however, the rotational speed of the nozzle only has a large effect on the spray at slower cross-flow conditions.

The {{increasing use of}} a wide range of toxic chemical pesticides deliberately released into the environment can cause important problems such as human health threats, bioaccumulation and pest resistance, and soil and groundwater pollution. In response to concerns about the effects of chemical pesticides on environments and human health, there have been significant interests in biological pesticide technology with low toxicity, less residue, and reduced pest resistance. Biopesticide technology is limited in real applications, due to the lack of appropriate sprayer and standard technology. In this paper, a <b>rotary</b> cage <b>atomizer</b> for biopesticide was developed. The influence of biopesticide atomizer structure (cage diameter and cage mesh number), operational parameters (flow rate and rotational speed), and liquid types (bacillus thuringiensis and beauveria bassiana) on atomization performance and biopesticide application efficacy was investigated using PIV and a Winner laser diffraction particle analyzer. The pattern of liquid inlet was fixed experimentally by the droplet 2 ̆ 7 s flow field uniformity. The impacts of individual factors on droplet size were analyzed using a T-test to eliminate inter-correlation among the variables of interest. A multiple linear regression model, which predicted the volume median diameters (VMD), was established. The model showed a high degree of correlation with the experimental results. The model took into account not only the cage diameter, but its number of cage meshes, the liquid flow rate, and rotational speed of the cage. Furthermore, a histogram and normal P-P plot of standardized residuals were used to assess the model 2 ̆ 7 s goodness-of-fit and the measured data were also analyzed to prove model fitness and feasibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the droplet spectrum, the deposition and uniformity of spray distribution with different spraying systems and traveling speeds of a self-propelled sprayer in two phenological stages of the cotton plant (B 9 and F 13). The experimental design was randomized blocks and treatments were three spraying techniques: common flat spray tips; tilted flat jet with air induction, at 120 L ha- 1; and <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> disk, 20 L ha- 1, combined with four traveling speeds: 12, 15, 18 and 25 km h- 1, with four replications. Spraying deposition was evaluated for both leaf surfaces from the cotton plant apex and base (stage B 9) and middle part of the plant (stage F 13) with a cupric marker. A laser particle analyzer also assessed the droplet spectrum. The centrifugal power spray system produces more homogeneous droplet spectrum and increased penetration of droplets into the canopy in both phenological stages. Variation on the operating conditions necessary for increased traveling speed negatively influences the pattern of spraying deposits...|$|R
40|$|The aerial {{application}} of pesticides is a valuable tool in agriculture, when based on well-defined technical criterion. This paper aimed to evaluate the spatial dependence of the drops spectrum and its deposition by an aerial application over the soybean crop (Glycine max). An experimental agricultural aircraft was used, model Acrobat, from England Company, equipped with eight <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizers,</b> model Micronair AU 5000, applying a spray volume of 20 L ha- 1. To obtain the droplet spectrum were used hidro sensitive targets consisting of paper, distributed in the middle third and higher plants. Spectrum analysis of the drops was made using the computer program "CIR" version 1. 5 in 2002. To determine the amount deposited on {{the leaves of the}} upper, middle, and bottom of the soybean plants, we used the bright blue food coloring added to the spray solution. These leaves were washed and the amount determined by spectrophotometry. The analysis of spatial dependence was evaluated using the GS + version 7 program. The results show no spatial dependence for the attributes. There was a low percentage of coverage in the upper and middle third of the plants. The geostatistical analysis can be used to characterize the spatial attributes of application coverage, but should be used a sampling grid of smaller size...|$|R
40|$|Particle {{stickiness}} during {{spray drying}} {{can lead to}} operational problems or be used to perform agglomeration inside the chamber. A simplified computational fluid dynamics approach is proposed to simulate the spray drying of 40 % w/w aqueous solutions of maltodextrin DE 12 and DE 21 in a pilot cocurrent spray dryer equipped with <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer.</b> Drying was simulated at steady state considering the geometry of the equipment (drying chamber, air inlet, atomizer) and the close relation between drying air and product properties. To {{take into account the}} lower drying rate of liquid solutions compared to pure water, the water vapor pressure of the drying particles was decreased with a coefficient determined from experimental data on air temperatures and humidities measured in the chamber. The evolution of particle temperature and water content was simulated. From these values and glass transition temperatures of the considered materials, it was possible to determine zones and operating conditions for which particles could be sticky inside the chamber. Maltodextrin DE 12 was quickly dried close to the atomizer reaching a stable nonsticky state below glass transition temperatures Tg, while maltodextrin DE 21 with lower Tg could exhibit a sticky behavior in a wider part of the chamber, depending on the liquid flow rate. This approach provides a methodology to evaluate possible stickiness to avoid fouling of the plant or to optimize powder insertion position for agglomeration...|$|R
40|$|Field {{trials and}} {{assessments}} of the balsam fir sawfly (Neodiprion abietis) nucleopolyhedrovirus (NeabNPV: Baculoviridae, Gammabaculovirus) against its natural host were conducted in July and August 2002 near Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, in naturally regenerated, precommercially thinned stands dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Two experimental blocks, {{each with its own}} untreated control, were established. The purpose of the Island Pond block was to examine the spread of NeabNPV from a 313 -ha aerial treatment block out into adjacent populations of balsam fir sawflies. The purpose of the Old Man’s Pond block (2, 093 ha) was to determine whether NeabNPV could disperse into populations of balsam fir sawflies within a 200 -m zone between spray swaths. NeabNPV was applied to treatment blocks by a Cessna 188 B AgTruck aircraft equipped with MicronAir AU 4000 <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizers</b> at an application rate equivalent to 1 × 109 NeabNPV occlusion bodies/ha in 2. 5 L of 20 % aqueous molasses. At Island Pond, NeabNPV infection increased with time following the spray, especially for individuals close to the treatment block, and infection rate decreased to a measured distance of 400 m from the treatment block. At Old Man’s Pond, NeabNPV infection rose higher (80 % vs. 15 %) and sawfly densities declined more (84 % vs. 60 %) in the area between spray swaths than in the control block...|$|R
40|$|The {{spray drying}} process {{consists}} of a fast convective drying of liquid droplets by hot air. Initially, the water activity (aw) of a drop is close to 1. During drying, the drop surface aw decreases while viscosity increases until reaching a sticky rubbery state before further drying. This can be observed for products such as carbohydrates, leading to particles sticking on walls (product losses) or to adhesion between particles leading to agglomeration. In this study, particle stickiness was investigated in a cocurrent pilot spray dryer by measuring drying air properties (temperature and relative humidity) at different positions. This allowed describing the evolution of temperature and mean water content of the drying drops. Two model products (maltodextrin DE 12 and DE 21) were spray dried varying process parameters liquid flow rate (1. 8, 3. 6, and 5. 4 kg/h), air temperature (144 degrees, 174 degrees, and 200 degrees C), airflow rate (80 - 110 kg/h), and <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> speed (22, 500 - 30, 000 rpm). The two products exhibit different drying behaviors {{in relation to their}} affinity towards water (sorption isotherms) and glass transition temperature evolution with aw (stickiness). Depending on drying conditions and product, the drop stickiness was observed very rapidly, close to the atomizer, or later, along the chamber. This approach can be used to identify conditions and positions corresponding to sticky particles...|$|R

A commercial CFD code was applied using an Euler-Lagrangian approach for {{two phase flow}} calculations. Special {{attention was paid to}} the droplet impingement process on the substrate. Orthogonal impact velocities and size distributions of the droplets depositing on substrates were analyzed in detail. The obtained simulation results show substantial differences of the impacting droplet characteristics of these three atomizers, which will have significant influences on the properties of the forming paint films...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spray {{droplet size}} {{has long been}} {{recognized}} as an important variable that applicators of vector control sprays {{must be aware of}} to make the most effective spray applications. Researchers and applicators have several different techniques available to assess spray droplet size from spray nozzles. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the droplet size spectrum produced by three nozzles commonly used in vector control in a high-speed wind tunnel, when characterized using three different laser-based droplet size measurement systems. Three droplet sizing systems: Malvern Spraytec laser diffraction, Sympatec HELOS laser diffraction, and TSI Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA), were simultaneously operated, but under different operating conditions, to measure the spray droplet size-spectra for three spray nozzles. The three atomizers: a TeeJet ® 8001 E even flat fan nozzle, a BETE ® PJ high pressure fog nozzles, and a Micro-nair ® AU 5000 <b>rotary</b> <b>atomizer</b> were evaluated in a high speed wind tunnel at airspeeds of 53 and 62 m/s (120 and 140 mph). Based on the results of this work, only the BETE ® PJ high pressure fog nozzles met the label requirements for both Fyfanon ® and Anvil®. While the other nozzle might met the Dv 0. 5 (VMD – volume median diameter) requirement for Fyfanon®, the resulting Dv 0. 9 values exceeded labeled size restrictions. When applying Anvil with the BETE PJ high pressure fog nozzles, it is important to use the smaller two ori...|$|R
