Two periods of his life that are very well {{documented}} are his years of work in Andalucía as a purchasing agent for the Spanish navy (i.e., the King). This led to his imprisonment for a few months in Seville after a banker where he had deposited Crown funds went bankrupt. (Since Cervantes says that Don Quixote was [...] "engendered" [...] in a prison, that is presumably a reference to this episode.) He also worked as a tax collector, travelling from town to town collecting back taxes due the crown. He applied unsuccessfully for [...] "one of four vacant positions in the New World", one of them as an accountant for the port of Cartagena. At the time he was living in Valladolid, then briefly the capital (1601-1606), and finishing Don Quixote Part One, he was presumably working in the banking industry, or a <b>related</b> <b>occupation</b> where his accounting skills could be put to use. He was turned down for a position as secretary to Pedro Fernández de Castro y Andrade, the Count of Lemos, although he did receive some type of pension from him, which permitted him to write full-time during his final years (about 1610 to 1616). His last known written words - the dedication to Persiles y Sigismunda - were written, he tells us, after having received Extreme Unction. He died in 1616 of type II diabetes. His burial place in Madrid was reportedly rediscovered in March 2015, but his unpublished manuscripts were mostly lost.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological {{evidence}} for the association of socioeconomic status with prenatal depression has been inconsistent. The current cross-sectional study examined the association between employment, job type, household income, and educational level and the prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Methods Subjects were 1741 Japanese women. Depressive symptoms were defined as present when subjects had a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score of 16 or higher. Adjustment was made for age, gestation, region of residence, family structure, personal and family history of depression, smoking, secondhand smoke exposure {{at home and at}} work, employment, household income, and education. Results The prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy was 19. 3 %. Compared with unemployment, employment, part-time employment, and full-time employment were significantly associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy: the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 0. 65 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 50 [*]−[*] 0. 86), 0. 66 (95 % CI: 0. 46 [*]−[*] 0. 95), and 0. 66 (95 % CI: 0. 48 [*]−[*] 0. 90), respectively. Regarding the job type held, women with a professional or technical job and those with a clerical or <b>related</b> <b>occupation</b> had a significantly lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy: the adjusted ORs were 0. 67 (95 % CI: 0. 47 [*]−[*] 0. 96) and 0. 62 (95 % CI: 0. 43 [*]−[*] 0. 90), respectively. Sales, service, production, and other occupations were not significantly related to the prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy. There were no relationships between household income or education and the prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Conclusions Employment, whether full-time or part-time, and holding a professional or technical job or a clerical or <b>related</b> <b>occupation</b> may be inversely associated with the prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy. </p...|$|E

30|$|The {{next step}} in the {{empirical}} approach consists in attributing measures for task contents to each field of study. This way, each of the 79 fields of study is associated with its most closely <b>related</b> <b>occupation,</b> which is quite straightforward in most of the cases, and the task content of this occupation is assigned to the corresponding area of study. Each field of study is represented by only one 4 -digit occupation. Although the assignment of the occupation most closely related to a given field of study has some degree of arbitrariness, classifying workers into matched, weakly matched, and mismatched is much more challenging, since the boundaries for these categories are usually unclear. For example, the occupation most closely associated with a degree in mechanical engineering is mechanical engineer, {{but it is not clear}} how an individual with a degree in mechanical engineering who works as a civil engineer or as a mechanical engineering technician would be classified. Appendix Table  6 shows the field of study-occupation matches, and the occupations defined as the most closely associated with each area of study.|$|E
30|$|The U.S. {{remains one}} of the main {{destinations}} for skilled immigrants. Due to increasing globalization and demographic changes, the demands for skilled professional immigrants will likely continue in the future (Facchini & Lodigiani, 2014). In 2014, about 31 % of employed immigrants held professional, managerial, or related occupations, compared to 40 % of native-born workers who were professionals or managers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016). Among newly admitted lawful permanent residents, 12 % held a managerial, professional, or <b>related</b> <b>occupation,</b> and 24 % of new lawful permanent residents obtained their green cards based on employment preferences (Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, 2016). Of all employment-sponsored immigrants, 36 % were professionals with advanced degrees or immigrants of exceptional ability.

These statistics indicate that skilled workers have {{played a crucial role in}} the building of the U.S. economy and achieving U.S. international competitiveness (Jasso, 2009), but very few studies examined their socioeconomic status and experiences in the U.S. labor market (Haley & Taengnoi, 2011).|$|E

In line with those works, this paper examines how population size, income, educational level, and housing construction in more than 200 large U.

The study assesses the impact of both the initial level of crime rate in 2000 and the change in crime rate during the 2000 s on population, income, human capital, and housing growth. OLS and instrumental variable methods are used, with spatial autocorrelation taken into account in the Chicagos community areas study. The results indicate that crime had strong negative effects on the measures of urban growth considered.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} applicability of the value theory approach in delineating prestige classes in 6 Indian villages & to compare the stratification structures thus obtained in terms of their substantive value & social meaningfulness. A major hypothesis was that stratification structures based on prestige ranks of individuals would differ both in social meaningfulness & substantive value in developed & in less developed villages. Of 6 villages selected from the 169 villages in a development block in Central Punjab, 3 villages were selected from those considered most progressive (developed), & 3 were considered least developed. Several prestige judges were selected in each village & they ranked the prestige of household heads on a four-point scale. Stratification structures differed between the less & more developed villages. In the more developed villages: (1) structures were more open & less rigid, (2) the shape of the structure was pyramidal, (3) a greater proportion of lower caste persons moved up in prestige, (4) prestige class structures showed increasing differentiation from caste, (5) the r between prestige class & literacy & level of living was more pronounced, (6) the influence of caste & <b>related</b> <b>occupation</b> was less pronounced, & (7) there was an increasing evaluative emphasis on achievement-oriented performance. In the less developed villages: (A) the shape of the structure was like an hourglass, (B) mobility of lower caste persons was almost nonexistent, (C) the number of persons with status equilibrium was relatively greater, & (D) caste & related occupations were the most important determining factors of prestige. 8 Tables, 1 Figure.

40|$|We {{study the}} labor supply of South Indian boat-owners using daily data on labor force {{participation}} {{and the value}} of catches from 2000 to 2007. Our panel is among the most extensive ever used for this purpose and the …rst to pertain to a non-service <b>related</b> <b>occupation</b> in a developing country. Our analysis compares two hypotheses about the response of labor supply to increases in wages and income: the conventional framework of intertemporal substitution versus reference-dependent preferences. We show that boat-owners’labor participation depends not only on their expected earnings but also on their recent earnings, supporting income-referencedependent preferences models. In our preferred speci…cations, participation elasticities with respect to expected earnings range between 0. 57 and 0. 61 while the responsiveness to changes in recent income is (in absolute value) a tenth the magnitude of the response to changes in expected earnings. The richness of our data allows us to estimate a participation equation conditional on expected earnings, recent earnings, recent e¤ort, and individual e¤ects. We exploit di¤erent sets of earnings shifters to identify participation elasticities (internationallydetermined prices, lunar phases, and wind direction). Finally, our results also imply that short-term labor supply models should include recent earnings conditional on recent hours or days worked as an explanatory variable. Since recent earnings are positively correlated with expected earnings and negatively related to the probability of participation, omitting this variable yields downwardly-biased elasticity estimates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the mechanical engineering technology curriculum effectiveness at the junior college in Taiwan by using the CIPP evaluation model. The study concerned the areas of the curriculum, curriculum materials, individualized instruction, support services, teaching effectiveness, student achievement, and job performance. A descriptive survey method was used with questionnaires for data collection from faculty, students, graduates, and employers. ^ All categories of respondents tended to agree that the curriculum provides appropriate occupational knowledge and skills. Students, graduates, and faculty tended to be satisfied with the curriculum; faculty tended to be satisfied with student achievement; graduates tended to be satisfied with their job preparation; and employers were most satisfied with graduates 2 ̆ 7 job performance. ^ Conclusions were drawn in the context, input, process, and product of the CIPP model. In Context area: Students were dissatisfied with curriculum flexibility in students characteristics. Graduates were dissatisfied with curriculum design for student 2 ̆ 7 s adaptability in new economic and industrial conditions; practicum flexibility in student characteristics; and course overlap. Both students and graduates were dissatisfied with practicum credit hours. Both faculty and students were dissatisfied with the number of required courses. ^ In Input area: Students, faculty, and graduates perceived audiovisuals and manipulative aids positively. Faculty and students perceive CAI implementation positively. Students perceived textbooks negatively. ^ In Process area: Faculty, students, and graduates perceived all support service negatively. Faculty tended to perceive the ratios of graduates who enter advanced study and <b>related</b> <b>occupation,</b> and who passed the professional skills certification, negatively. Students tended to perceive teaching effectiveness in terms of instructional strategies, the quality of instruction, overall suitability, and receivable, negatively. Graduates also tended to identify the instructional strategies as a negative perception. Faculty and students perceived curriculum objectives and practicum negatively. Both faculty and students felt that instructors should be more interested in making the courses a useful learning experience. ^ In Product area: Employers were satisfied with graduates 2 ̆ 7 academic preparation and job performance, adaptability, punctuality, and their ability to communicate, cooperate, and meet organization needs. Graduates were weak in terms of equipment familiarity and supervisory ability. ^ In sum, the curriculum of the five-year mechanical engineering technology programs of junior college in Taiwan has served adequately up to this time in preparing a work force to enter industry. It is now time to look toward the future and adapt the curriculum and instruction for the future needs of this high-tech society. ...|$|E

40|$|Istanbul {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{metropolis}} of the world, standing upon two continents, but its modern history, which is linked to planning exercise, can be traced back the beginning of the last century. In fact, the industrialization was the most attractive factor for people without job, living in the underdeveloped rural regions of the country, bringing serious problems to the city: urban sprawl, unemployment, insufficient infrastructures and public services and, over all, the illegal settlements called gegekondu (built-in-a-night houses), located in the outskirts of the urban area. In general, the growth goes over forward three branches, which are population, land use and transportation network, but it is possible to recognize in the linear form the influence of mobility factors: ferry, railways and highways. The current structure of the metropolitan area of Istanbul clearly shows the relationship between the mobility system and an uncontrolled urban sprawl. Starting from 1950 public investments have been oriented towards the construction of urban highways as an answer to the increasing exodus of rural population and to the <b>related</b> <b>occupation</b> of urban soils. In this sense, many authors underline how the proposed solutions and the reasons of the problems paradoxically tend to coincide. On the other hand, planning tools which have been used in the past have proved ineffective and have produced a largely illegal and ungovernable city. In fact, it is possible to describe the evolution of city planning as a result of the difficult to apply planning and development tools successfully experienced in the European countries but not adequately conceived with regards to the local social and economic structure of Istanbul. In particular, polycentrism, which has been largely evocated in planning tools – think of Sir Patrick Abercrombie’s proposals, at the middle of the Fifties, or of Luigi Piccinato’s plan of the metropolitan area (1969) – has constantly exceeded by the diffusion of illegal settlements. It probably means that changes are faster than the duration required for the processes which are used in planning and transportation organization. Also the new tools, as strategic plan and urban project, seem to show their limits. A larger integration between still sectoral urban policies can contribute to the definition of innovative approaches. An example is given by the pilot project “Street are Ours, One Day a Month”: the slogan “moving people is more important than moving cars” clearly shows the “communicative” dimension of the initiative, aimed at the experimentation of innovative forms of alternative mobility in the framework of a broader involvement of inhabitants in planning choices. In this sense, the pilot project is oriented towards a reinforcement of the meanings related to the concept of proximity, involving not only mobility issues, but also those of community and local identity...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Ministry of Health and Omnimed, a {{non-profit}} U. S. -based organization {{that works with}} international communities to provide basic health education, have partnered to provide health training to community health workers (henceforth referred to as village health workers or VHWs) in rural villages in Uganda. The training is provided via an intensive five-day long session that introduces {{a wide variety of}} themes in basic health education taught by experts in the respective fields. The participants are selected by the local government based on their age, reliability, level of education and availability. On the first day, the participants are given a pre-test that evaluates their level of knowledge about the subjects that will be taught during the training session, and are given the same questions as a post-test {{on the last day of}} training. This is done to evaluate how much information the participants learned about basic health during the training. The participants are followed after this training by quarterly meetings, focus groups and further, more specific, training sessions. We analyzed data from the pre- and post-tests to evaluate the amount of information learned through the training sessions and we also evaluated feedback from the focus groups to determine how trainees thought the program was affecting their community and to analyze the challenges facing the VHWs. Objectives: The objective of this project was two-fold: 1) to evaluate the amount of information about basic health retained by VHWs who participated in a week-long training session; and 2) to follow-up with VHWs to see what changes they noticed in their communities and determine what challenges they face in disseminating health information in their villages. Methods: The study sample consisted of 110 participants who were asked to complete the pre- and post-tests. The pre- and post-training test consisted of 49 multiple choice questions, written in Luganda, with a total possible score of 105. The pre-test was distributed to the participants on the first day of the training session. Participants were administered post-tests on the last day of the training session. The questions and the delivery of the exams were the same at both points in time. The grading of the tests was as follows: each correct answer received one point, incorrect answers received no points, and questions with more than one answer received no points. We compared the percentage of correct answers of the pre- and post-tests to determine any changes in knowledge as a result of the training session. A total of 99 trainees were recruited to participate in focus groups. Focus groups were conducted three and six months after the original training session and involved five to ten VHWs per session. Questionnaires were distributed to the groups and questions were read aloud with discussion about each topic. We asked the VHWs: 1) Have you noticed healthy changes in your community?; 2) What changes have you noticed; 3) How does the community view a VHW?; and 4) What support could you use as a VHW? Results: The VHWs selected from the communities were aged 25 - 40, were more likely to be female than male, and generally had a non-health <b>related</b> <b>occupation.</b> One hundred and two participants completed both the pre- and post-tests. The average difference between test scores at the two points in time was an improvement of 20. 25 points, or 19. 3 %. The range of differences between the scores was - 5 to + 61. Given that the VHWs were not previously educated about basic health, this was viewed a marginal improvement. However, the data from the focus groups indicates that the VHWs were enacting changes in their community. The participants in the focus group were also aged 25 - 40 and 43 were males and 56 were females. The focus groups demonstrated that 86 % of the VHWs noticed positive changes in the community; including the creation of latrines (34 %), more drying racks (16 %), more hand-washing (11 %), increased usage of boiled water (9 %) and the newfound creation and usage of “tippy-taps” (8 %). When asked if the community viewed the VHWs as a positive asset, 81 % answered yes. Lastly, when queried as to what support VHWs could use to facilitate their work, the majority answered some type of transport (51 %); while other popular answers were gumboots and raingear, more training, cell phones or a stipend to compensate them for their work. Conclusion: The increased mean score of the post-tests indicates that the VHWs did learn basic health information during the training session. However, the improvement in score was not as notable as one would expect given the intense nature of the trainings and the baseline level of knowledge being somewhat low. The data from the focus groups, however, indicated that VHWs are creating positive change in their communities. This could mean that the simple act of appointing one person to educate their community imbues in them a responsibility to spread the knowledge that they do possess; however basic it may be. It also could indicate that the VHWs learned more at the training sessions than the test scores reveal. This could be due to a multitude of factors, including difficulty with reading, the advanced nature of the test questions, difficulty with multiple choice questions, or difficulty applying knowledge to the test, especially considering that most of the VHWs were adults many years out of school. In light of this information, one could consider a different method of evaluation, and more focus on the follow-up to assess what the VHWs are actually able to do in their communities. Moving forward, it would be ideal to evaluate the villages themselves via a system of door-to-door surveys that ask the villagers about changes they have or have not made and if they have seen any improvement in their health. This information will provide further evidence as to whether VHWs are an ideal model in the field of health education...|$|E
