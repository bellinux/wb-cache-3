They (mainly) comprise escape codes that {{can be sent to}} or received from the terminal. The escape codes sent to the terminal perform various functions that a CRT terminal (or software terminal emulator) is capable of that a teletypewriter is not, such as moving the terminal's cursor to positions on the screen, clearing and scrolling all or parts of the screen, turning on and off attached printer devices, programmable function keys, changing display colours and attributes (such as <b>reverse</b> <b>video),</b> and setting <b>display</b> title strings. The escape codes received from the terminal signify things such as function key, arrow key, and other special keystrokes (home key, end key, help key, PgUp key, PgDn key, insert key, delete key, and so forth).|$|R

50|$|The <b>video</b> <b>display</b> RAM was not memory-mapped as it {{had been}} on the {{previous}} Models I and III. Rather, whenever a program called functions requiring video RAM to be modified, TRSDOS executed code that switched the 2KB bank of video RAM into Z-80 address space (the upper 2KB of hexadecimal F400 - FFFF). The keyboard matrix and typeahead buffer also occupied this address range. While this freed 1920 bytes of Z-80 address space, it was marginally slower than writing directly into video RAM. The video hardware supported characters in <b>reversed</b> <b>video</b> and Model I/III style block graphics. A 40 character wide display mode was available a using double-width raster image. An alternate character set was available which included the entire Greek alphabet and special symbols.|$|R

50|$|To {{keep the}} price of the {{computer}} and the component count down, a novel technique was used to implement the <b>video</b> <b>display.</b> Instead of an expensive <b>video</b> <b>display</b> controller chip with dedicated memory, the Super-80 used discrete TTL logic to implement the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> and 512 bytes of system RAM was shared between the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> and the CPU. Fifty times per second, the CPU was turned off for around 10 ms by asserting the Z80 BUSREQ (DMA) pin. The <b>video</b> <b>display</b> circuitry would then read from the shared RAM while it refreshed the image on the screen. In addition to a 50% degradation in processor performance, this meant that {{it was not possible to}} perform any accurate timing in software, since the programmer had no control over when the next <b>video</b> <b>display</b> refresh cycle would occur. The <b>video</b> <b>display</b> could be switched off under software control for greater processing speed, or when accurate software timing was required. The most common situation in which that occurred was when the built-in cassette interface was being used. The location of the 512 bytes of video memory was normally at the top of the available RAM, but could be changed by writing to an I/O port.|$|R

All together, the <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> cover more than 28,000 sq ft, making Raymond James Stadium the third-largest <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> in the NFL. The original sound system and the stadium's luxury boxes were also upgraded. A second round of improvements are planned for after the 2016 season is complete.|$|R

5000|$|The VDU Expansion Board (VDUEB) was an {{enhanced}} <b>video</b> <b>display</b> {{board for the}} Super-80 developed by Microcomputer Engineering (MCE). The VDUEB gave the Super-80 an 80Ã—25 <b>video</b> <b>display</b> with limited graphics capabilities. It {{was based on a}} 6845 CRTC I.C. and had its own 2kB of video RAM and 2kB of character generator RAM. Installation of the VDUEB board was a one-way process, as it required major modifications to the Super-80 printed circuit board including cutting of tracks and soldering in many wire links between various parts of the board. The VDUEB was then connected via three I.C. sockets formerly occupied by the original <b>video</b> <b>display</b> circuitry. Removal of the original DMA based <b>video</b> <b>display</b> effectively doubled the performance of the computer, since the CPU was no longer being disabled 50 times per second for <b>video</b> <b>display</b> refreshes. The board gave the Super-80 similar <b>video</b> <b>display</b> capabilities to the Applied Technology Microbee computer, released about six months after the Super-80. This led to many Microbee games being ported to the VDUEB equipped Super-80. The VDUEB proved to be a popular modification, with a users' group forming for owners of VDUEB equipped computers - The [...] "Super-80 VDUEB Users' Club".|$|R
50|$|Dawgzilla is {{the name}} of the high {{definition}} LED <b>video</b> <b>display</b> board and sound system located behind the north end zone of Joe Aillet Stadium. The video board was designed, manufactured, and installed by Daktronics during the summer of 2009. The HD-X <b>video</b> <b>display</b> measures 25 feet high by 45 feet wide with a 16-millimeter pixel pitch. Two ribbon boards placed directly above and below the main <b>video</b> <b>display</b> each measure 4 feet high by 45 feet wide with 23-millimeter pixel pitches. The total <b>video</b> <b>display</b> area measures 1,485 square feet, which made Dawgzilla the largest video board in the Western Athletic Conference after its construction in 2009. Also installed atop the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> is a custom Sportsound sound system. The video board is mounted on a brick foundation constructed by Lincoln Builders and is flanked by artistic metal displays. The Dawgzilla project cost $2 million and was financed through a partnership with Learfield Sports and Community Trust Bank.|$|R
