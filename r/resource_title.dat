40|$|Abstract. Tagging {{has become}} a {{standard}} way of organizing information on the Web, particularly in folksonomies – data repositories freely created by communities of users. A few tags attached to each resource create a bridge between heterogeneous data and users accustomed to keyword-based search and browsing. To establish this connection, tagging requires users to manually define tags for each resource they enter to the system. This potentially time-consuming step can be eased by tag recommender systems, which propose terms that users may choose to use as tags. This paper suggests and evaluates potential sources of recommended tags, focusing on folksonomies oriented towards individual users. These suggestions are used to propose a three-step tag recommendation system. Basic tags are extracted from the <b>resource</b> <b>title.</b> In the next step, the set of potential recommendations is extended by related tags proposed by a lexicon based on co-occurrences of tags within resource’s posts. Finally, tags are filtered by the user’s personomy – {{a set of tags}} previously used by the user. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Collaborative tagging {{systems are}} social data repositories, in which users manage {{resources}} using descriptive keywords (tags). An {{important element of}} collaborative tagging systems is the tag recommender, which proposes {{a set of tags}} to each newly posted resource. In this paper we discuss the potential role of three tag sources: resource content as well as resource and user profiles in the tag recommendation system. Our system compiles a set of resource specific tags, which includes tags related to the title and tags previously used to describe the same resource (resource profile). These tags are checked against user profile tags – a rich, but imprecise source of information about user interests. The result is a set of tags related both to the resource and user. Depending on the character of processed posts this set can be an extension of the common tag recommendation sources, namely <b>resource</b> <b>title</b> and resource profile. The system was submitted to ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for “content-based ” and “graph-based ” recommendation tasks, in which it took the first and third place respectively. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{library of}} the Università degli Studi Milano-Bicocca has adopted the Scout Portal Toolkit (SPT) {{open-source}} software to catalog, display, and share collections of data about web resources. The {{result was the}} creation of “LINX – Link e strumenti X la ricerca”, which has a dedicated Earth Sciences section. LINX is a collection of free resources for education and research selected by the library staff and/or recommended by users: web sites, databases, virtual reference desks, repositories, etc. It is conceived as a place where all library patrons, and external users as well, can suggest and share resources. It is open to everybody, not just for browsing, but also for taking an active part in cataloging the resources. These resources are cataloged with simple and qualified Dublin Core Metadata Elements and classified in one or more categories or subcategories. LINX can be searched by <b>resource</b> <b>title,</b> author and keywords, and browsed by category. With LINX, the library offers its patrons, and scholars and researchers in general, a chance to share their bookmarks in an informal way, and help each other find their way among the many resources available on the net. A special feature of the LINX database is that it allows users not only to interact with library staff by recommending specific resources, but also to interact with each other by posting comments on the existing resources. To recommend a new resource, {{there is no need to}} register: users just have to fill in a dedicated form; library staff will then evaluate the resource, complete the description and publish it. Users will be notified when their record is published. Registration is required when users want to set alerts, rate resources and add comments: ratings and comments can be viewed by other users as well. LINX also has a page called “Risorse suggerite” for logged in users, where the system suggests other web resources according to the ratings given by the same user to existing records. University audience has the advantage of connecting to LINX from the familiar frame of the institutional library site, whose home page links directly to the database. The choice to include only free resources means that all the data are available to everybody at any time, regardless of location and user status. For the Earth Sciences domain, LINX means finding useful material such as cartography websites, directories of open access journals, repositories and websites of professional associations and institutions already selected and gathered in categories and subcategories. The Earth Sciences category is divided into several subcategories corresponding to more specific subjects, such as Mineralogy, Environmental Geology and Oceanography. The sense of community is fostered by the ability to suggest, rate and comment. In a context where scholars and researchers are struggling against information overload, even within a single discipline, LINX is the tool Bicocca has chosen to help its users find the right material for their needs...|$|E

40|$|Children from low-income {{families}} {{are known to}} struggle academically, but lack of health services may also impact their education.

Unfortunately, the school nurse-to-student ratio may {{limit the amount of}} time nurses can give to the recognition of health problems and appropriate follow-up. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 provides Title 1 funding to schools whose enrollment includes at least 40 % of {{low-income families}}. These federal funds are intended to be used to bridge the achievement gap between low-income students and other students. It was hypothesized that Title 1 schools are more susceptible to increased nursing service demand due to the academic and health disparities among low-income students.

Therefore, application scheduling algorithms can become unscalable (albeit polynomial) and thus unusable in large-scale environments. One reason for unscalability is that these algorithms perform implicit resource selection. One can achieve better scalability by performing explicit resource selection decoupled from scheduling (aka ”decoupled”approach). Furthermore, we hypothesize that one can achieve similar or even better performance as with the nondecoupled approach (aka ”one step ” approach) by selecting resources judiciously. Leveraging the Virtual Grid Execution System [16], we demonstrate that the decoupled approach is indeed both scalable and effective in large-scale and highly heterogeneous <b>resource</b> environments. <b>title.</b> I...|$|R
