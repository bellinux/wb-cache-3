40|$|Multipath {{remains a}} {{dominant}} error source in Global Positioning System (GPS) applications that require high accuracy. With {{the use of}} differential techniques {{it is possible to}} remove many of the common-mode error sources, but the error effects of multipath have proven much more difficult to mitigate. The research aim of this work is to enhance the understanding of multipath propagation and its effects in GPS terrestrial applications, through the modelling of signal propagation behaviour and the <b>resultant</b> <b>error</b> effects. Multipath propagation occurs when environmental features cause combinations of reflected and/or diffracted replica signals to arrive at the receiving antenna. These signals, in combination with the original line-of-sight (LOS) signal, can cause distortion of the receiver correlation function and ultimately the discrimination function and hence errors in range estimation. To date, a completely satisfactory mitigation strategy has yet to be developed. In the search for such a mitigation strategy, it is imperative that a comprehensive understanding of the multipath propagation environment and the <b>resultant</b> <b>error</b> effects exists. The work presented here, provides a comprehensive understanding through the use of new modelling and simulation techniques specific to GPS multipath. This dissertation unites the existing theory of radio frequency propagation for the GPS L 1 signal into a coherent treatment of GPS propagation in the terrestrial environment. To further enhance the understanding of the multipath propagation environment and the <b>resultant</b> <b>error</b> effects, this dissertation also describes the design and development of a new parabolic equation (PE) based propagation model for analysis of GPS multipath propagation behaviour. The propagation model improves on previous PE-based models by incorporating terrain features, including boundary impedance properties, backscatter and time-domain decomposition of the field into a multipath impulse response. The results provide visualisation as well as the defining parameters necessary to fully describe the multipath propagation behaviour. These resultant parameters provide the input for a correlation and discrimination model for visualisation and the generation of resultant receiver error measurements. Results for a variety of propagation environments are presented and the technique is shown to provide a deterministic methodology against real GPS data. The unique and novel combined modelling of multipath propagation and reception, presented in this dissertation, provides an effective set of tools that have enhanced the understanding of the behaviour and effect of multipath in GPS applications, and ultimately should aid in providing a solution to the GPS multipath mitigation problem...|$|E

The developed system uses an autofocus sensor based on the Foucault knife-edge principle and piezo-based stages for scanning the samples in axial and lateral directions. It is built with a reduced number of components and designed to offer a simple set-up for the analysis of optical aberrations. The traditional way of addressing optical aberrations in scanning system is to improve the optical system such that it works as a paraxial lens. Breaking this paradigm and observing the optics as part of a complex system, it is possible to use simpler optics and correct the <b>resultant</b> <b>errors</b> computationally. These errors are systematic and, {{as long as they can}} be measured and modelled, they can be predicted and corrected. This way, the design of the system becomes more flexible and the task of error handling can be divided between optics optimization and computational correction, reducing overall size and weight, raising system dynamics and reducing costs.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of predicting {{the amount of}} the tool wear in machining processes is an interesting topic for industries, since tool wear affects surface integrity of the final parts and tool life is strictly connected with substitution policy and production costs. The definition of models able to correctly forecast the tool wear development is an important topic in the research field. For this reason in the present work, a comparison between response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) fitting techniques in tool wear forecasting was performed. For developing these predictive models, experimental values of tool wear, obtained by longitudinal turning operations with variable cutting parameters, were collected. Once selected, the best configuration of the two previously mentioned techniques, the <b>resultant</b> <b>errors</b> with respect to experimental data were estimated and then compared.
