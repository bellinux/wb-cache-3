40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Conversion {{of solar}} energy to {{mechanical}} power {{through the use}} of thermostatic bimetals and linear Fresnel lenses was found to be both theoretically and experimentally feasible. Using linear Fresnel lenses to concentrate sunlight on bimetallic coils caused a simple sun powered motor to produce <b>rotational</b> <b>shaft</b> power. However, continuous rotational motion could not be sustained. Efficient energy transfer through the Fresnel lenses and the ability of the bimetal to absorb and dissipate solar energy were determined to be critical factors limiting motor operation. Several developments were suggested by the experiment which may improve overall energy efficiency of the motor and possibly create continuous rotational motion. Both thermostatic bimetals and linear Fresnel lenses appear to have a promising future in the field of solar energy conversion. Further research may reveal many practical applications for the sun powered motor and its component parts...|$|E

With such features, the skeletal specimen can move more like a human than conventional robot linkage mechanisms.|$|E

As add-on devices, they can be directly mounted on a <b>rotational</b> <b>shaft,</b> in order to intervene as early as possible in the transfer path between disturbance and the noise radiating surfaces. A MIMO (Multi-Input-Multi-Output) form of the FxLMS control algorithm is employed to generate the appropriate actuation signals, relying on a linear interpolation scheme to approximate time varying secondary plants. The proposed active vibration control approach is tested on an experimental test bed comprising a rotating shaft mounted in a frame to which a noise-radiating plate is attached. The disturbance force is introduced by an electro-dynamic shaker.

The methodology begins with the design using 3 D modelling software followed by the development of a mathematical model of the MR brake.

They can be explained qualitatively by applying the hydrodynamic lubrication model with the axial oil film rupture being considered.

This experimental report shows the effect of the circumferential oil groove and holes into the inner oil film and the slope of the bush inner side end, which are not considered in the theoretical model, on the bush rotational speed and the high-speed stability. It is found that the bush rotational speed levels off at a lower <b>shaft</b> <b>rotational</b> speed, resulting in the lower bush speed, and that the oil whip disappears at a lower shaft speed, when the supplied pressure is lower.

40|$|The Gyro {{centrifugal}} pump {{developed as a}} totally implantable artificial heart was designed with a free impeller, in which the <b>rotational</b> <b>shaft</b> (male bearing) of the impeller was completely separated from the female bearing. For this type of pump, {{it is very important}} to keep the proper magnet balance (impeller-magnet and actuator-magnet) in order to prevent thrombus formation and/or bearing wear. When the magnet balance is not proper, the impeller is jerked down into the bottom bearing. On the other hand, if magnet balance is proper, the impeller lifted off the bottom of the pump housing within a certain range of pumping conditions. In this study, this floating phenomenon was investigated in detail. The floating phenomenon was proved by observation of the impeller behavior using a transparent acrylic pump. The impeller floating phenomenon was mapped on a pump performance curve. The impeller floating phenomenon is affected by the magnet-magnet coupling distance and rotational speed of the impeller. In order to keep the proper magnet balance and to maintain the impeller floating phenomenon at the driving condition of right and left pump, the magnet-magnet coupling distance was altered by a spacer which was installed between the pump and actuator. It became clear that the same pump could handle different conditions (right and left ventricular assist), by just changing the thickness of the spacer. When magnet balance is proper, the floating impeller phenomenon occurs automatically in response to the impeller rev. It is called "the dynamic RPM suspension"...|$|E

40|$|To achieve {{cost-effective}} {{and reliable}} structural design of floating wind turbines, efficient and accurate time domain numerical approaches {{are required to}} analyse structural responses in design conditions, e. g. wind and waves.

The approach considers floating wind turbines as a system of several structural components, e. g. blades, <b>rotational</b> <b>shaft,</b> nacelle, tower, mooring lines, columns, pontoons and braces. A finite element model is developed to represent global stiffness of the structural components. The external and inertia loads on the structural components are modelled as distributed loads. Hydrodynamic loads on each structural component are derived from the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients obtained by solving the first order boundary value problem using WAMIT.
