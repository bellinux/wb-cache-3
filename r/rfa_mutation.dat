5000|$|In Escherichia coli, {{different}} classes of DNA-damaging agents can initiate the SOS response, as described above. Taking {{advantage of an}} operon fusion placing the lac operon (responsible for producing beta-galactosidase, a protein which degrades lactose) {{under the control of}} an SOS-related protein, a simple colorimetric assay for genotoxicity is possible. A lactose analog is added to the bacteria, which is then degraded by beta-galactosidase, there-by producing a colored compound which can be measured quantitatively through spectrophotometry. The degree of color development is an indirect measure of the beta-galactosidase produced, which itself {{is directly related to the}} amount of DNA damage. [...] The E. coli are further modified in order to have a number of mutations including a uvrA mutation which renders the strain deficient in excision repair, increasing the response to certain DNA-damaging agents, as well as an <b>rfa</b> <b>mutation,</b> which renders the bacteria lipopolysaccharide-deficient, allowing better diffusion of certain chemicals into the cell in order to induce the SOS response. [...] Commercial kits which measures the primary response of the E. coli cell to genetic damage are available and may be highly correlated with the Ames Test for certain materials.|$|E
40|$|A set of R (rough) mutants, {{in which}} the {{synthesis}} of the cell wall lipopolysaccharide is defective, were analyzed genetically. These same Salmonella minnesota mutants have been used extensively in biochemical studies. By combining the information from all these studies, we obtained a complete genetic description {{of many of these}} mutants. Most of them turned out to be double rfe rfa mutants {{in which the}} rfe mutation (close to ilv) accounts for inability to synthesize O-specific structures and the <b>rfa</b> <b>mutation</b> accounts for defects in the synthesis of the core and, thus, for the lipopolysaccharide chemotype. These mutants demonstrate that in S. minnesota of O group L, as well as in S. typhimurium of the O group B, the rfb gene cluster close to his determines the synthesis of the O-specific side chain of the lipopolysaccharide, and the rfa genes in a cluster close to pyrE determine the synthesis of the lipopolysaccharide core. Phosphorylation of the core is determined by a rfaP gene also in this cluster and so far identified only by these S. minnesota mutants. In addition, the rfe gene(s) close to ilv is required for O-side chain synthesis in S. minnesota but not in S. typhimurium...|$|E
40|$|In this {{experimental}} study, antimutagenic {{activity of}} compounds obtained from Eclipta alba Linn was screened by using Ames assay for detecting direct mutagenic activity and those requiring the metabolic activation. The crude compound extracted from Eclipta alba was considered as antimutagen and analyzed in this experiment. Two strains of Salmonella typhimurium, TA 163 and TA 96 {{were used to}} analyze the test. These two strains are confirmed as histidine requiring mutant strains. When the mutagen is added to the culture, the strain is mutated back, thereby loosing the histidine dependence for its growth. By this study, the crude compound of Eclipta alba prevents the strain to be mutated back to the non dependence for the genotyping of the Salmonella strains were performed by histidine requirement, <b>rfa</b> <b>mutation</b> analysis, UVrB mutation, R-factor analysis toxicity tests and antimutagenicity assay.   The antimutagens obtained from the plant extract were determined for antimutagenic activity against direct acting mutagens and mutagen needing activation. For direct acting mutagens, NPD (N- nitro-o-phenyl diamine), MNNG (N- methyl-N-nitro-N-nitro soguanidine) and NaNa 3 (sodium azide) with 1 mg of the plant extract gives 98 %, 95. 2 % and 90. 7 % inhibition the reverted colonies were observed whereas the mutagen needing activation 2 -AAf (2 -acetyl aminofluorine) gives 96. 6 % inhibition was observed. These above results indicated that the extract could inhibit the mutagenicity induced by direct acting mutagens as well as mutagens needing activation. Thus the extracts isolated from the test plant have possibility of antimutagenic activity of compound and further biochemicals extracted from the test plant will be analyzed...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} R (rough) Salmonella {{minnesota}} mutants with rfb, rfe, and <b>rfa</b> <b>mutations</b> leading to various defects in the biosynthesis of cell wall lipopolysaccharide was analyzed {{as to their}} enterobacterial common antigen (CA) content. All mutants that had functional rfe genes were CA+ as is the wild-type parent. This includes mutants with the most defective lipopolysaccharide core types, demonstrating that core structures are not {{a necessary part of}} CA. All rfe− mutants (complete lipopolysaccharide core, defective synthesis of O side chains) were defective in the synthesis of CA. A smooth strain was accidentally found to be CA−; the mutation responsible for this defect was also located, like rfe, very close to ilv...|$|R
40|$|The barrier {{properties}} of lipopolysaccharide were studied by testing {{the influence of}} O-antigen on the binding of ligand to maltoporin in the outer membranes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Maltoporin (LamB protein) of Escherichia coli K- 12 was capable of interacting with macromolecular starch polysaccharides, as was previously shown by the binding of intact bacteria to fluorescein-labeled amylopectin or to starch-Sepharose columns. In contrast, strains with complete O-antigenic lipopolysaccharide showed reduced binding to these substrates. A similar result was obtained with Salmonella typhimurium LT 2, which did not bind to starch unless <b>rfa</b> <b>mutations</b> removed noncore polysaccharide. The exclusion limit of the lipopolysaccharide permeability barrier to alpha-glucans was tested by measuring the maltoporin-dependent transport of maltose and its inhibition by maltodextrins of various sizes. Only amylopectin (molecular weight, greater than 25, 000) was excluded in transport experiments, whereas maltodextrins with molecular weights of up to 2, 000 were not excluded {{by the presence of}} an O-polysaccharide layer...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the tol-pal genes induce {{pleiotropic}} effects such as {{release of}} periplasmic proteins into the extracellular medium and hypersensitivity {{to drugs and}} detergents. Other outer membrane defective strains such as tolC, lpp, and <b>rfa</b> <b>mutations</b> are also altered in their outer membrane permeability. In this study, electron microscopy and Western blot analyses were used to show that strains with mutations {{in each of the}} tol-pal genes formed outer membrane vesicles after growth in standard liquid or solid media. This phenotype was not observed in tolC and rfaD cells in the same conditions. A tolA deletion in three different Escherichia coli strains was shown to lead to elevated amounts of vesicles. These results, together with plasmid complementation experiments, indicated that the formation of vesicles resulted from the defect of any of the Tol-Pal proteins. The vesicles contained outer membrane trimeric porins correctly exposed at the cell surface. Pal outer membrane lipoprotein was also immunodetected in the vesicle fraction of tol strains. The results are discussed in view {{of the role of the}} Tol-Pal transenvelope proteins in maintaining outer membrane integrity by contributing to target or integrate newly synthesized components of this structure...|$|R
40|$|A {{detection}} and classification system for mutagens {{has been developed}} that identifies the six possible base-pair substitution mutations. A set of six Salmonella typhimurium (TA 7001 to TA 7006) strains has been constructed, each of which carries a unique missense mutation in the histidine biosynthetic operon. In addition to the his mutation, these strains carry different auxiliary features that enhance the mutability of the target his mutation. These include the R factor pKM 101, which has the SOS-inducible mucAB system; a deletion of the uvrB component of excision repair; and <b>rfa</b> <b>mutations</b> to increase the accessibility of bulky chemicals to the bacteria. Another set of strains (TA 7041 to TA 7046) contain a wild-type rfa gene. Reversion via the base substitution unique to each strain was verified by sequence analyses of > 800 revertants obtained from different types of mutagens. The strains have considerably lower spontaneous reversion frequencies and detect a variety of mutagens at a sensitivity comparable to the Salmonella tester strains TA 100, TA 102, and TA 104. The low spontaneous frequency of reversion of a mixture of the six tester strains (approximately 10 revertants per plate) enables a single mutation assay with the mixture that is followed by classification {{of the type of}} mutation with the individual strains...|$|R
40|$|Tn 10 insertions were {{selected}} {{on the basis}} of resistance to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -specific bacteriophage U 3. The majority of these were located in a 2 -kilobase region within the rfa locus, a gene cluster of about 18 kb that contains genes for LPS core biosynthesis. The rfa::Tn 10 insertions all exhibited a deep rough phenotype that included hypersensitivity to hydrophobic antibiotics, a reduction in major outer membrane proteins, and production of truncated LPS. These mutations were complemented by a Clarke-Carbon plasmid known to complement <b>rfa</b> <b>mutations</b> of Salmonella typhimurium, and analysis of the insert from this plasmid showed that it contained genes for at least six polypeptides which appear to be arranged in the form of a complex operon. Defects in two of these genes were specifically implicated as the cause of the deep rough phenotype. One of these appeared to be rfaG, which encodes a function required for attachment of the first glucose residue to the heptose region of the core. The other gene did not appear to be directly involved in determination of the sugar composition of the core. We speculate that the product of this gene is involved in the attachment of phosphate or phosphorylethanolamine to the core and that it is the lack of one of these substituents which results in the deep rough phenotype...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} Ames {{tester strains}} of Salmonella typhimurium {{are separated by}} many steps in their pedigree, some involving mutagen treatments, and contain independently isolated uvrB—bio—gal deletions and <b>rfa</b> <b>mutations.</b> In this work the araD 531 mutation was introduced into the Ames tester strains TA 100 and TA 98. The responsiveness of the resulting strains (BA 15 and BA 14) {{to a number of}} chemical mutagens was then assessed by monitoring the induction of forward mutations to L-arabinose resistance (Ara test). Here we have shown that these two strains of the Ames test differ greatly in their responses to mutagens, in ways that are not associated with the mutagenic specificities of the original his mutations. In general, the genetic background of strain TA 100 appears to be more sensitive to the killing effects of chemicals than that of TA 98. The greatest differences were found with nifurtimox (NFX) and its analogue, compound IK. The Ara test responded to the mutagenic effects of these two nitrofurans when carried out in the genetic background of strain TA 98 but not in that of TA 100. A higher sensitivity to the lethal effects of NFX and IK together with the greater nitro-reduction capability of strain TA 100 as compared with TA 98 might explain the differences. In conclusion, our results indicate that the standard Ames S. typhimurium tester strains are not isogenk and that genetic differences at loci other than his might be significant for mutagenicity testing. To this respect the routine use of the isogenic set of S. typhimurium strains constructed by Popkin et al. (Mut. Res., 224, 453 - 464, 1989) and derived from strain hisD 3052 (as the standard TA 98) seems advisable...|$|R
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{recombination}} between direct repeats is synergistically reduced in rad 1 rad 52 double mutants, {{suggesting that the}} two genes define alternate recombination pathways. Using a classical genetic approach, we searched for suppressors of the recombination defect in the double mutant. One mutation that restores wild-type levels of recombination was isolated. Cloning by complementation and subsequent physical and genetic analysis revealed that it maps to RAF 1. This locus encodes the large subunit of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein complex, RP-A, which is conserved from S. cerevisiae to humans. The <b>rfa</b> 1 <b>mutation</b> on its own causes a 15 -fold increase in direct-repeat recombination. However, unlike most other hyperrecombination mutations, the elevated levels in rfa 1 mutants occur independently of RAD 52 function. Additionally, rfa 1 mutant strains grow slowly, are UV sensitive, and exhibit decreased levels of heteroallelic recombination. DNA sequence analysis of rfa 1 revealed a missense mutation that alters a conserved residue of the protein (aspartic acid 228 to tyrosine [D 228 Y]). Biochemical analysis suggests that this defect results in decreased levels of RP-A in mutant strains. Overexpression of the mutant subunit completely suppresses the UV sensitivity and partially suppresses the recombination phenotype. We propose that the defective complex fails to interact properly with components of the repair, replication, and recombination machinery. Further, this may permit the bypass of the recombination defect of rad 1 rad 52 mutants by activating an alternative single-stranded DNA degradation pathway...|$|R
40|$|The large subunit of {{replication}} protein A (Rpa 1) {{consists of}} three single-stranded DNA binding domains and an N-terminal domain (Rpa 1 N) of unknown function. To determine the essential role of this domain we searched for mutations that require wild-type Rpa 1 N for viability in yeast. A mutation in RFC 4, encoding a small subunit of replication factor C (RFC), was found to display allele-specific interactions with mutations in the gene encoding Rpa 1 (<b>RFA</b> 1). <b>Mutations</b> that map to Rpa 1 N and confer sensitivity to the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea, such as rfa 1 -t 11, are lethal in combination with rfc 4 - 2. The rfc 4 - 2 mutant itself is sensitive to hydroxyurea, and like rfc 2 and rfc 5 strains, it exhibits defects in the DNA replication block and intra-S checkpoints. RFC 4 and the DNA damage checkpoint gene RAD 24 {{were found to be}} epistatic with respect to DNA damage sensitivity. We show that the rfc 4 - 2 mutant is defective in the G 1 /S DNA damage checkpoint response and that both the rfc 4 - 2 and rfa 1 -t 11 strains are defective in the G 2 /M DNA damage checkpoint. Thus, in addition to its essential role as part of the clamp loader in DNA replication, Rfc 4 plays a role as a sensor in multiple DNA checkpoint pathways. Our results suggest that a physical interaction between Rfc 4 and Rpa 1 N is required for both roles...|$|R
40|$|Background: pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} have been isolated from Echium amuenum. These alkaloids knowing as hepatotoxic, damage the liver. Mutagenicity of pure {{pyrrolizidine alkaloids}} has been identified. Thus, the mutagenic {{effect of the}} methanolic flower extract was tested using Amest test. Materials and Methods: The long maceration process (for 48 hrs) is carried out in order to extract all constitutes. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) method {{was used to evaluate}} aflatoxin B 1 contamination and histidine amino acid presence. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined with the dilution method. Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100 was used to determination of mutagenicity. The genotype was confirmed by using histidine requirement, R- factor presence, <b>rfa</b> and uvrB <b>mutations</b> tests. The mutagenicity assay was performed by four extract concentrations (0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 mg/ml). Sodium azide (NaN 3) and methanol were used as the mutagens (positive control) and negative control, respectively in the absence or presence of liver-metabolizing enzymes. Results: The data indicate that Echium amuenum has not significant mutagenic activity against negative control. The presence of liver-metabolizing enzymes did not exhibit a significant change against the properties of extract. Conclusion: It seems that this extensive used plant in traditional medicine, doesn’t contain mutagenic or genotoxic effect in usual doses...|$|R
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAD 1 and RAD 52 are {{required}} for alternate pathways of mitotic recombination. Double-mutant strains exhibit a synergistic interaction that decreases direct repeat recombination rates dramatically. A <b>mutation</b> in <b>RFA</b> 1, the largest subunit of a single-stranded DNA-binding protein complex (RP-A), suppresses the recombination deficiency of rad 1 rad 52 strains (J. Smith and R. Rothstein, Mol. Cell. Biol. 15 : 1632 – 1641, 1995). Previously, we hypothesized that this <b>mutation,</b> <b>rfa</b> 1 -D 228 Y, causes an increase in recombinogenic lesions {{as well as the}} activation of a RAD 52 -independent recombination pathway. To identify gene(s) acting in this pathway, temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations were screened for those that decrease recombination levels in a rad 1 rad 52 rfa 1 -D 228 Y strain. Three mutants were isolated. Each segregates as a single recessive gene. Two are allelic to RSP 5, which encodes an essential ubiquitin-protein ligase. One allele, rsp 5 - 25, contains two mutations within its open reading frame. The first mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence of Rsp 5, but it decreases the amount of full-length protein in vivo. The second mutation results in the substitution of a tryptophan with a leucine residue in the ubiquitination domain. In rsp 5 - 25 mutants, the UV sensitivity of rfa 1 -D 228 Y is suppressed to the same level as in strains overexpressing Rfa 1 -D 228 Y. Measurement of the relative rate of protein turnover demonstrated that the half-life of Rfa 1 -D 228 Y in rsp 5 - 25 mutants was extended to 65 min compared to a 35 -min half-life in wild-type strains. We propose that Rsp 5 is involved in the degradation of Rfa 1 linking ubiquitination with the replication-recombination machinery...|$|R
