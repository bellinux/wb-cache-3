25|$|The {{most heavily}} studied betalain is betanin, also called {{beetroot}} red {{after the fact}} that it may be extracted from <b>red</b> <b>beet</b> roots. Betanin is a glucoside, and hydrolyzes into the sugar glucose and betanidin. It is used as a food coloring agent, and the color is sensitive to pH. Other betalains known to occur in beets are isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. The color and antioxidant capacity of betanin and indicaxanthin (betaxanthin derived of L-proline) are affected by dielectric microwave heating. Addition of TFE (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) is reported to improve the hydrolytic stability of some betalains in aqueous solution. Furthermore, a betanin-europium(III) complex has been used to detect calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores, including Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus.|$|E

2500|$|The species {{description}} of Beta vulgaris {{was made in}} 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in [...] "Species Plantarum", {{at the same time}} creating the genus Beta. Linnaeus regarded sea beet, chard and <b>red</b> <b>beet</b> as varieties (at that time, sugar beet and mangelwurzel had not been selected yet). In the second edition of [...] "Species Plantarum" [...] (1762), Linnaeus separated the sea beet as its own species, Beta maritima, and left only the cultivated beets in Beta vulgaris. Today sea beet and cultivated beets are considered as belonging to the same species, because they may hybridize and form fertile offspring. The taxonomy of the various cultivated races has a long and complicated history, they were treated at the rank of either subspecies, or convarieties or varieties. Now rankless cultivar groups are used, according to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.|$|E

40|$|Preparation method may {{influence}} acid diffusion and buffering capacity of foods, which will consequently influence food breakdown and nutrient release during gastric digestion. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the acid uptake into <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> during in vitro gastric digestion and characterize the buffering capacity of <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> as a result of different preparation methods. Red beets were cut into cylinders and they were examined as raw, steamed (15 min at 105 Â°C) or pickled (steamed 15 min at 105 Â°C, 7 days immersed in 2 % acetic acid). Cylinders were covered to insulate their sides and back to have a one-dimensional diffusion system, before soaking in simulated gastric juice for up to 96 h (37 Â°C). Before digestion, buffering capacity was measured by adding 0. 2 M HCl to blended raw, steamed, or pickled beets until the pH value was below 1. 5. After digestion, acidity measurements were performed. Acidity was significantly influenced by preparation method and digestion time (p < 0. 05). Acidity of raw beets had the greatest increase from 0. 46 mmol H+/g dry matter to 3. 71 mmol H+/g dry matter during 96 hours of incubation. On the contrary, decrease of acidity was observed in pickled beets during 96 hours of incubation (15. 28 mmol H+/g dry matter to 7. 50 mmol H+/g dry matter). Preparation method significantly influenced buffering capacity (p < 0. 001). Pickled beets had a higher buffering capacity of 0. 051 mmol H+/(pH g) compared to raw and steamed beets which had buffering capacity values of 0. 035 and 0. 034 mmol H+/(pH g), respectively. Beet resistance to changes in pH, or buffering capacity, may cause differences in acid uptake of <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> in the gastric environment after different preparation methods. Higher acid uptake (3. 25 mmol H+/g dry matter) was observed in raw beets with respect to steamed beets (2. 35 mmol H+/g dry matter) during 96 hours of incubation as a result of higher buffering capacity and structural changes due to preparation method. The study of the relationship between food preparation and behavior during digestion can be important for development of innovative functional food products for specific consumer groups...|$|R

30|$|Betalains are a {{group of}} {{water-soluble}} plant pigments that are used as food colorants. They are ammonium derivatives of betalamic acid and present in considerably high amounts in certain foodstuffs, including <b>red</b> <b>beets,</b> prickly pear fruits, and Amaranthus seeds (Strack et al. 2003). These pigments have no toxic effects on the human body; as important commercial color additives, no upper limit {{is necessary for the}} recommended daily intake of betalains (Delgado-Vargas et al. 2000). More interestingly, very few pharmacological applications of betalains exist. Recently, they have received attention because they show antiviral, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities (Manohar et al. 2017; Sreekanth et al. 2007; Kanner et al. 2001). Beet roots currently represent the main commercial source of betalains. Thus, the high pigment content in beetroots is crucial. Recent efforts are centered around the betalain content in <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> through selective breeding, because the average pigment content in beets is approximately 130  mg/ 100  g fresh weight (Delgado-Vargas et al. 2000; Sekiguchi et al. 2013). Betalains can be extracted from plant roots with pure water, at room (or reduced) temperature. But the use of methanol or ethanol solutions in most cases is necessary to achieve complete extraction. Chemical extraction is characterized by high production cost and serious environmental pollution. Agricultural fields used for planting beets are diminishing with the decrease in arable land, and the cost associated with overcoming of environmental pollution is unsustainable for manufacturing enterprises because betalains are inexpensive products. Therefore, the search for a novel production method with low cost and high productivity has become an important issue for betalain production (Pavlov et al. 2005; Moreno et al. 2008).|$|R

Of the many agricultural products processed in these canneries, <b>red</b> <b>beets</b> (Beta vulgaris) constitute a major problem {{not only because of}} their organic content but also because of their highly colored nature. This beet color may pass through subsequent waste treatment processes, enter a receiving stream and impart an undesirable color to the water. Many canneries discharge their waste to the city sewers and the screening and primary treatment orocesses of sewage treatment plants give only slight color reductions. It is toe secondary treat ment processes which afford a means of removing beet waste color.

The most interesting results were obtained in determination of correlations between protein and non-protein SH-groups. Under the conditions of osmotic stress, while the contents of non-protein SH-groups in the isolated vacuoles was reduced, non-protein SH-groups in homogenate was greatly increased. This {{may be explained by}} the influx of the substances containing SH-groups out of vacuoles.

Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed no differences in the deposition of waxes and stomata distribution in the epidermis of cladodes.
