40|$|The HIFiRE- 1 is a 7 -degree half-angle {{circular}} cone with a 2. 5 -mm nose radius. A successful HIFiRE- 1 flight {{experiment was}} carried out in March 2010. Due to an anomaly in the exoatmospheric pointing maneuver, the <b>reentry</b> <b>angle</b> of attack was higher than anticipated (5 – 15 degrees instead of near zero). A test campaign in the H 2 K hypersonic wind tunnel at DLR Cologne gathered high-frequency pressure fluctuation data and global heat flux via infrared (IR) thermography at the high angles of attack and Reynolds numbers encountered in the as-flown trajectory. This paper presents analysis of data collected at 0 ° angle of attack at freestream Reynolds numbers from 5. 7 to 10. 7 e 6 /m for 1. 6 - and 2. 5 -mm-radius nosetips. The transition onset and end locations derived from IR thermography coincide well with the earliest and largest amplification of pressure fluctuations identified by the fast-response surface-mounted pressure transducers. Stability analysis of the astested conditions was done with the Stability and Transition of Boundary Layers (STABL) software suite. An N-factor of 5. 5 correlates well with transition location for the 1. 6 -mm radius nosetip. For the blunter nosetip, N ≈ 5. 2 at transition. The peak pressure-fluctuation frequencies predicted by STABL agree within 8...|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{spacecraft}} systems were {{at the front of}} the cylinder, up against the front bulkhead. The crew were seated in one row near the rear bulkhead and access hatch, with 2 [...] "crew" [...] seats on the sides with flight controls on the rear bulkhead and one passenger in the middle. Cargo was carried in the middle of the capsule, at the capsule's center of gravity, to simplify loading effects on <b>reentry</b> <b>angles</b> and lift.|$|R
50|$|The Command Module's {{center of}} mass was offset {{a foot or so}} from the center of {{pressure}} (along the symmetry axis). This provided a rotational moment during <b>reentry,</b> <b>angling</b> the capsule and providing some lift (a lift to drag ratio of about 0.368). The capsule was then steered by rotating the capsule using thrusters; when no steering was required, the capsule was spun slowly, and the lift effects cancelled out. This system greatly reduced the g-force experienced by the astronauts, permitted a reasonable amount of directional control and allowed the capsule's splashdown point to be targeted within a few miles.|$|R
40|$|Reentry {{analyses}} {{consisting of}} ablation response, thermal response and thermal stress response {{have been conducted}} on the Lightweight Radioisotope Heater Unit (LWRHU) for Cassini/Venus-Venus-Earth-Jupiter-Gravity-Assist (VVEJGA) reentry conditions. Sequential ablation analyses of the LWRHU aeroshell, and the fuel pellet have been conducted in reentry regimes where the aeroshell has been deemed to fail. The failure criterion for ablation is generally assumed to be recession corresponding to 75 % and 100 % of the wall thickness. The 75 % recession failure criteria allows for uncertainties that result {{mainly because of the}} high energies involved in the VVEJGA reentries compared to orbital decay reentries. Risk evaluations should consider the fact that for shallow flight paths the unit may disassemble at high-altitude as a result of ablation or may remain intact with a clad that had been molten. Within the limitations of the methodologies and assumptions of the analyses, the results indicate that: (1) For a side-on stable LWRHU reentry, aeroshell ablation failures occur for all <b>reentry</b> <b>angles.</b> (2) For a side-on spinning LWRHU reentry, aeroshell ablation failures are minimal. (3) For the tumbling LWRHU reentry, the aeroshell survives for most angles. (4) For the thermostructural analyses, using both a 1 % and 5 % allowable strain, all <b>reentry</b> <b>angles</b> and orientations examined resulted in small localized failures, but aeroshell breach is not predicted for any case. The analyses included in this report concentrate on VVEJGA reentry scenarios. Analyses reported previously have demonstrated that the LWRHU has adequate design margin to survive reentry from orbital decay scenarios and most injection scenarios at speeds up to escape speeds. The exception is a narrow range of flight path angles that produce multiple skip trajectories which may have excessive ablation...|$|R

Due to an anomaly in the exoatmospheric pointing maneuver, the <b>reentry</b> <b>angle</b> of attack was higher than anticipated (5 – 15 degrees instead of � 0). A test campaign in the H 2 K hypersonic wind tunnel at DLR Cologne was mounted to gather high-frequency pressure fluctuation data and global heat flux via infrared thermography at the high angles of attack and Reynolds numbers encountered in the as-flown trajectory. This paper describes the analysis and interpretation of the surface pressure fluctuations; thermographic analysis is contained in a companion paper. Pressure-fluctuation power spectra were computed at azimuths from the windward to leeward rays in 45 ° increments at ten sensor locations along the ray, and the expected laminar, transitional, and turbulent regimes were encountered. The disturbances along the windward and leeward rays are presumed to arise from amplified second-mode waves. At 6 ° angle of attack, 250 -kHz disturbances were detected along the 135 °-from-windward ray; it is unclear whether these fluctuations arise from second-mode or crossflow instabilities. At 9 ° angle of attack, similar pressure fluctuations occur along the 135 ° ray prior to separation near the leeward ray...|$|E
40|$|Boundary {{layer and}} aeroheating {{characteristics}} of several X- 33 configurations have been experimentally {{examined in the}} Langley 20 -Inch Mach 6 Air Tunnel. Global surface heat transfer distributions, surface streamline patterns, and shock shapes were measured on 0. 013 -scale models at Mach 6 in air. Parametric variations include angles-of-attack of 20 -deg, 30 -deg, and 40 -deg; Reynolds numbers based on model length of 0. 9 to 6. 6 million; and body-flap deflections of 0, 10 and 20 -deg. The effects of discrete and distributed roughness elements on boundary layer transition, which included trip height, size, location, and distribution, {{both on and off}} the windward centerline, were investigated. The discrete roughness results on centerline were used to provide a transition correlation for the X- 33 flight vehicle that was applicable across the range of <b>reentry</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. The attachment line discrete roughness results were shown to be consistent with the centerline results, as no increased sensitivity to roughness along the attachment line was identified. The effect of bowed panels was qualitatively shown to be less effective than the discrete trips; however, the distributed nature of the bowed panels affected a larger percent of the aft-body windward surface than a single discrete trip...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} strategic, multi-facility test program, {{subscale}} {{testing of}} NASA s Crew Exploration Vehicle was conducted in both legs of NASA Langley s Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel. The objectives of these tests were to generate aerodynamic and surface pressure data over a range of supersonic Mach numbers and <b>reentry</b> <b>angles</b> of attack for experimental and computational validation and aerodynamic database development. To provide initial information on boundary layer transition at supersonic test conditions, transition studies were conducted using temperature sensitive paint and infrared thermography optical techniques. To support implementation of these optical diagnostics in the Unitary Wind Tunnel, the experiment was first modeled using the Virtual Diagnostics Interface software. For reentry orientations of 140 to 170 degrees (heat shield forward), windward surface flow was entirely laminar for freestream unit Reynolds numbers equal to or less than 3 million per foot. Optical techniques showed qualitative evidence of forced transition on the windward heat shield with application of both distributed grit and discreet trip dots. Longitudinal static force and moment data showed the largest differences with Mach number and angle of attack variations. Differences associated with Reynolds number variation and/or laminar versus turbulent flow on the heat shield were very small. Static surface pressure data supported the aforementioned trends with Mach number, Reynolds number, and angle of attack...|$|R
40|$|Wall Mach number {{distributions}} {{were determined}} over {{a range of}} test-section free-stream Mach numbers from 0. 2 to 0. 92. The test section was slotted and had a nominal porosity of 11 percent. Reentry flaps located at the test-section exit were varied from 0 (fully closed) to 9 (fully open) degrees. Flow was bled through the test-section slots {{by means of a}} plenum evacuation system (PES) and varied from 0 to 3 percent of tunnel flow. Variations in <b>reentry</b> flap <b>angle</b> or PES flow rate had little or no effect on the Mach number distributions in the first 70 percent of the test section. However, in the aft region of the test section, flap angle and PES flow rate had a major impact on the Mach number distributions. Optimum PES flow rates were nominally 2 to 2. 5 percent wtih the flaps fully closed and less than 1 percent when the flaps were fully open. The standard deviation of the test-section wall Mach numbers at the optimum PES flow rates was 0. 003 or less...|$|R
40|$|A {{low-speed}} {{investigation has}} been made to determine the static and oscillatory longitudinal and lateral stability derivatives of a proposed reentry vehicle having an extensible heat shield for <b>reentry</b> at high <b>angles</b> of attack. The heat shield is extended forward to give the desired aerodynamic-center position for high-angle-of-attack reentry and, after completion of the reentry phase, is retracted to give stability and trim for gliding flight at low angles of attack. Near an angle of attack of 900 the reentry configuration was statically stable both longitudinally and directionally, had positive dihedral effect, and had positive damping in roll but zero damping in yaw. The landing configuration had positive damping in pitch, roll, and yaw over the test angle-of-attack range but was directionally unstable and had negative dihedral effect between an angle of attack of about 10 and 20 deg...|$|R
50|$|Engineers {{building}} a space capsule must take forces such as gravity and drag into consideration. The space capsule must {{be strong enough}} to slow down quickly, must endure extremely high or low temperatures, and must survive the landing. When the space capsule comes close to a planet’s or moon’s surface, it has to slow down at a very exact rate. If it slows down too quickly, everything in the capsule will be crushed. If it doesn’t slow down quickly enough, it will crash into the surface and be destroyed. There are additional requirements for atmospheric <b>reentry.</b> If the <b>angle</b> of attack is too shallow, the capsule may skip off the surface of the atmosphere. If the angle of attack is too steep, the deceleration forces may be too high or the heat of reentry may exceed the tolerances of the heat shield.|$|R

The results indicate that: (1) for hypersonic stream Mach numbers, the flow field over the straight-wing configuration is essentially independent of Mach number, (2) transition Reynolds number decreases with increasing angle of attack, (3) at some critical angle of attack, the wing-shock standoff distance is greatly increased and the stagnation line moves downstream from the wing leading edge, (4) value of the critical angle of attack is very sensitive to the flow shock density ratio or effective gamma, and (5) at angles of attack above the critical value for all gases, the nondimensional level of heat transfer to the wing is higher for the higher shock density ratio flows...|$|R
40|$|Launch vehicle {{explicit}} guidance mechanism {{depends on}} the estimation of the desired burnout conditions and driving the vehicle to achieve these conditions. The accuracy of the vehicle at the target point depends on how tightly these conditions are achieved {{and what is the}} strategy used to define the trajectory. It has been observed inthe literature that most of the guidance mechanisms during reentry use vacuum guidance equations that is durin greentry the atmospheric effects are not considered. In order to achieve minimum miss distance at the target point theat mospheric effects are to be considered during the guided phase and appropriate corrections should be executed,otherwise depending on the <b>reentry</b> flight path <b>angle</b> and ballistic coefficient the errors can be as high as tens of nautical miles. In this paper, the authors develop a novel approach to these vacuum guided launch vehicle problems. The paper elaborates how to calculate a prior the reentry dispersion during the ascent phase guidance and provide guidance corrections such that the terminal conditions are achieved with higher accuracy.

40|$|The {{design of}} flight control systems for high {{performance}} maneuvering reentry vehicles presents a significant {{challenge to the}} control systems designer. These vehicles typically have a much higher ballistic coefficient than crewed vehicles like as the Space Shuttle or proposed crew return vehicles such as the X- 38. Moreover, the missions of high performance vehicles usually require a steeper <b>reentry</b> flight path <b>angle,</b> followed by a pull-out into level flight. These vehicles then must transit the entire atmosphere and robustly perform the maneuvers required for the mission. The vehicles must also be flown with small static margins in order to perform the required maneuvers, which can result in highly nonlinear aerodynamic characteristics that frequently transition from being aerodynamically stable to unstable as angle of attack increases. The control system design technique of dynamic inversion has been applied successfully to both high performance aircraft and low beta reentry vehicles. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the application of this technique to high performance maneuvering reentry vehicles, including the basic derivation of the dynamic inversion technique, followed by the extension of that technique to the use of tabular trim aerodynamic models in the controller. The dynamic inversion equations are developed for high performance vehicles and augmented to allow the selection of a desired response for the control system. A six degree of freedom simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the dynamic inversion approach, and results for both nominal and off nominal aerodynamic characteristics are presented...|$|R
