40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to examine factors {{influencing}} attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> among {{a sample of}} Latinos (N= 312) and Latinas (N= 427). The predictive role of gender role attitudes was the overarching factor of interest. The study utilized the constructs of machismo/caballerismo and marianismo in efforts to capture the most culturally-relevant understanding and manifestation of gender role attitudes for the population of interest. Machismo/caballerismo and marianismo are largely ignored in empirical research but quite prevalent in Latino theoretical literature. The study also aimed to investigate the applicability of acculturation, a variable commonly included in Latino research but overlooked in rape research. The primary hypotheses tested {{in the study were}} whether the gender role attitudes of men and women would predict negative attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims.</b> It was proposed that higher levels of traditional gender role attitudes (i. e., machismo for males and marianismo for females) would predict higher levels of negative attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims.</b> Conversely, higher levels of caballerismo (i. e., less traditional male gender role attitudes) would predict lower levels of negative attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims.</b> Analyses revealed that gender role attitudes did not predict attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> for either females or males in the sample. Among the female sample, social desirability was the only variable that significantly predicted attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims.</b> Among the male sample, socioeconomic status was found to be the only significant predictor of attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims.</b> Secondary hypotheses posited that degree of acculturation would affect the strength of the relationship between gender role attitudes and attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims.</b> This proposed moderating relationship was not tested as there was no significant relationship between the gender role and attitudes towards <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> variables...|$|R

Very few subsequent artists have been influenced by Etty, and one of the few later works on which Candaules can be considered an influence is The Knight Errant, painted by John Everett Millais in 1870, which in its depiction of a <b>rape</b> <b>victim,</b> distraught and with her face turned away from the viewer, was a return to the style developed by Etty in Candaules of forcing the viewer to feel complicity in witnessing the sexual degradation of a woman, and which drew similar criticism.|$|E

His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.|$|E
40|$|To date, {{research}} on effective rape avoidance strategies has involved media-recruited, acknowledged <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> and avoiders, {{most of whom}} were assaulted by total strangers. In the present study, rape avoidance research was extended to a sample of acquaintance <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> and avoiders who were located by a self-report survey that identified women who both do and do not conceptualize their assaults as rape. The study's goal was to determine whether acknowledged <b>rape</b> <b>victims,</b> unacknowledged <b>rape</b> <b>victims,</b> and <b>rape</b> avoiders could be discriminated by situational variables including the response strategies used in the assault. Victims and avoiders were significantly discriminated. Compared to <b>rape</b> <b>victims,</b> avoiders (1) were less likely to have experienced passive or internalizing emotions {{at the time of the}} assault, (2) perceived the assault as less violent, and (3) were more likely to have utilized active response strategies (i. e., running away and screaming).

40|$|The aim of {{the given}} study is to {{investigate}} {{the impact of the}} legal as well as the sociocultural systems of Iran on the secondary victimization of <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> in the country. As a theoretical background of the study, two feminist theories, Feminist criminology and Radical Feminist, will be used. By the help of these theories the influences of patriarchy on secondary victimization of <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> in Iran will be explained. While case study is used to frame the design of the study, qualitative content analysis will also be used to collect the needed data through analyzing different sources and materials. The findings show that the lack of comprehensive laws regarding rape crime in Iran and the way service providers view and perceive <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> have led to re-victimization of <b>rape</b> <b>victims.</b> Moreover, analyzing the sociocultural system of the country demonstrated that the prevalence of rape myths and gender inequality in the society have also contributed to re-victimization of such victims.
