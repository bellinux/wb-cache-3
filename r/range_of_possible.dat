5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E

Only {{a few of}} them provide an automatic way to verify if software behaves correctly using generated test data. We propose to use software model as imprecise test oracle. UML modelling language extension OCL can be used as test oracle. Imprecise OCL constraints can be viewed as expressions which define expected results within some <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> values. Imprecise OCL constraints can be viewed as expressions which define expected results within some <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> values. When software is executed using generated test data the output is verified against imprecise OCL constraints. If output does not satisfy imprecise OCL constrains, unit under test definitely contains bugs. And if output satisfies imprecise OCL constraints the tester can assume that unit under test has no bugs. Key words: OCL, {{software testing}}, test oracle...|$|R

5|$|Small-molecule and {{macromolecular}} crystallography {{differ in}} the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by {{a wide range of}} methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.|$|E

40|$|Uncertainties in {{projections}} of future climate change {{caused by an}} increase in greenhouse gas concentrations have been a subject of intensive study in recent years. However, in most cases, uncertainties in parameters and characteristics of models used to obtain those projections, such as climate sensitivity or radiative forcing, are described only by <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> values. The resulting uncertainties in variables describing climate change, such as surface warming or sea level rise, are therefore also given just by <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> values. However, for assessing the <b>possible</b> impact <b>of</b> climate change, it would be more useful to have probability distributions for these variables. There are two significant difficulties in obtaining such distributions. First, it is necessary to know probability distributions for the above mentioned uncertain parameters and model characteristics. Second, existing climate and economics models are computationally too expensive for traditional methods of uncertainty propagation such as Monte Carlo simulation. We demonstrate a method for calculating probability distributions for surface air temperature change and sea level rise that result from uncertainties in climate sensitivity and the rate of heat uptake by the deep ocean. These distributions are obtained by applying the Deterministic Equivalent Modeling Method to the MIT climate model. This method provides an effective way of deriving an approximation for the model an...|$|R

The second were adaptive strategies. The idea here is to choose strategies that can be improved as more is learned as the future progresses. Granger Morgan et al.

25|$|It {{was soon}} noted by other mathematicians, {{prominent}} among these being Hermann Weyl, Jan Arnoldus Schouten, and Élie Cartan, that a covariant derivative could be defined abstractly without {{the presence of}} a metric. The crucial feature was not a particular dependence on the metric, but that the Christoffel symbols satisfied a certain precise second order transformation law. This transformation law could serve {{as a starting point for}} defining the derivative in a covariant manner. Thus the theory of covariant differentiation forked off from the strictly Riemannian context to include a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> geometries.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the (weighted) normal {{equations}} matrix XTX is ill-conditioned. When fitting polynomials the normal equations matrix is a Vandermonde matrix. Vandermonde matrices become increasingly ill-conditioned as {{the order of the}} matrix increases. In these cases, the least squares estimate amplifies the measurement noise and may be grossly inaccurate. Various regularization techniques can be applied in such cases, the most common of which is called ridge regression. If further information about the parameters is known, for example, a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> values of , then various techniques can be used to increase the stability of the solution.

While most sequence alignment tools calculate match scores using only the best scoring alignment, HMMER3 calculates match scores by integrating across all possible alignments, to account for uncertainty in which alignment is best. HMMER sequence alignments are accompanied by posterior probability annotations, indicating which portions of the alignment have been assigned high confidence and which are more uncertain.|$|E
