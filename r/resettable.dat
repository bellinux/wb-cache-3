25|$|Some {{companies}} manufacture <b>resettable</b> miniature thermal circuit breakers, which screw into a fuse socket. Some installations {{use these}} Edison-base circuit breakers. However, any such breaker sold today does have one flaw. It may {{be installed in}} a circuit-breaker box with a door. If so, if the door is closed, the door may hold down the breaker's reset button. While in this state, the breaker is effectively useless: it does not provide any overcurrent protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturer}} may {{specify the}} voltage drop across the fuse at rated current. There {{is a direct}} relationship between a fuse's cold resistance and its voltage drop value. Once current is applied, resistance and voltage drop of a fuse will constantly grow {{with the rise of}} its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The voltage drop should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications. Voltage drop often is not significant in more traditional wire type fuses, but can be significant in other technologies such as <b>resettable</b> (PPTC) type fuses.|$|E
2500|$|RCDs {{are usually}} {{testable}} and <b>resettable</b> devices. Commonly {{they include a}} button that when pressed, safely creates a small leakage condition, and a switch that reconnects the conductors when a fault condition has been cleared. Depending upon their design, some RCDs disconnect both the energized and return conductors upon a fault, while others only disconnect the energized conductor and rely upon the return conductor being at ground (earth) potential. [...] The former {{are commonly known as}} [...] "double-pole" [...] designs; the latter as [...] "single-pole" [...] designs. [...] If the fault has left the return wire [...] "floating" [...] or not at its expected ground potential for any reason, then a single-pole RCD will leave this conductor still connected to the circuit when it detects the fault.|$|E

5000|$|Tuttuki Bako (ツッツキバコ) is {{a roughly}} cubic {{hand-held}} electronic game created by Bandai in 2008. The game comprises five mini-games (called [...] "Stages"), and a <b>resettable</b> alarm clock.

50|$|If {{a person}} is {{concerned}} about damaging the data lines of the microcontroller, additional over-voltage protection diodes and/or separate drivers should be added between the microcontroller and UEXT connector. Additionally, a <b>resettable</b> fuse might be added between the host power and pin 1 to protect against over-current conditions. Open source UART dongles are available that are explicitly designed to be pin compatible with UEXT, and {{may be used to}} interface a UEXT device directly with a computer over USB.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Resettable</b> Fuse is a {{polymeric}} positive {{temperature coefficient}} (PPTC) device that is a passive electronic component used to protect against overcurrent faults in electronic circuits. The device {{is also known as}} a polyfuse or polyswitch. They are similar in function to PTC thermistors in certain situations but operate on mechanical changes instead of charge carrier effects in semiconductors. These devices were first discovered and described by Gerald Pearson at Bell Labs in 1939 and described in US patent #2,258,958.|$|E
5000|$|Tuttuki Bako also {{features}} a <b>resettable</b> alarm clock option that allows the player to interact with and set a virtual alarm clock that will then go off at the selected hour. Further selection options include time, sound volume, and contrast. On the back-side of the device there is an embedded [...] "Reset" [...] button {{that can only be}} pushed with a pin. This button restores the original conditions bringing the clock and alarm to 00:00AM and resetting any highscores to 0.|$|E
50|$|Also in {{the example}} above, ideally the {{calibration}} value of 100 units {{would be the best}} point in the gage's range to perform a single-point calibration. It may be the manufacturer's recommendation or it may be the way similar devices are already being calibrated. Multiple point calibrations are also used. Depending on the device, a zero unit state, the absence of the phenomenon being measured, may also be a calibration point. Or zero may be <b>resettable</b> by the user-there are several variations possible. Again, the points to use during calibration should be recorded.|$|E
50|$|The STC-16 used a {{shortened}} {{and modified}} Anadol chassis and suspension system, while using a 1600 cc Ford Mexico engine. The transmission system, {{on the other}} hand, {{was the one that}} was used by some high performance Cortina and Capri models in Britain. The STC-16 had all the typical dashboard gauges and indicators which the British and Italian sports cars of that period had. Apart from the Speed and rpm indicators, a <b>resettable</b> cruise distance indicator (something new for that period) as well as a Lucas ampermeter and Smiths oil, fuel and engine temperature indicators were installed on the dashboard.|$|E
5000|$|The {{research}} and development team at Prefco developed 'The McCabe Link'- a <b>resettable</b> Bi-metal fire link that is a heat releasing device for fire and smoke protection applications. The McCabe Link became recognized as a life saving invention by the UL and ASHRAE. [...] Prefco also manufactured fire and smoke dampers that allow ventilation systems to draw toxic smoke from a building that is on fire. Their products are sold throughout the United States, Canada, South America, Asia and the Middle East. Prefco helped standardize the smoke control industry worldwide, and was instrumental in changing laws on fire regulation and safety.|$|E

50|$|Manual call {{points are}} used to {{initiate}} an alarm signal, and operate {{by means of a}} simple button press. They can form part of a manual alarm system or an automatic alarm system. There will be an indicator on the monitoring unit for visual indication to locate the call point easily, and there should be a visual identifier of the unit which triggered the alarm, typically a mechanical flag which operates on a latch and must be manually reset, e.g. by a key.Previously, the old British standard did not allow hinged covers and plastic <b>resettable</b> elements. Plastic elements must have the same printing as the EN 54 glass.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{weakness}} in Schmidt's machine {{is that the}} results are in no case recorded positively inside the machine. They are only revealed after processing data obtained from the <b>resettable</b> counters in the machine or from the paper punch connected it. While machines may be foolproof, human beings seldom are... If Schmidt had used two machines, his scores for high- and low-aiming runs could have been kept separate from the start. Nonresettable counters could have ensured that all attempts were recorded and some supervision of the use and recording of the counters would have instilled more confidence into readers of the reports than {{they are likely to}} have at present.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of thermal {{overload}} relay. In one type, a bi-metallic strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically <b>resettable</b> depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced for 1980 models, an {{optional}} <b>resettable</b> trip meter was installed on speedometers and the mileage counter {{was moved to}} the top of the speedometer as part of the optional Sport Instrumentation Group. The Sport Instrumentation Group also included the optional tachometer in the center of the cluster, as well as oil and ammeter gauges. In 1984, the body moulding and interior trim were updated. In 1985-1986 models, the upper accent mouldings were moved below the front marker. For 1985, the rear tailgate moulding on XLT models was updated and previewed the design of the 1987 model. This molding has become increasingly rare and fetches a high price. A cargo light was available as an option and was included in the Light Group option package. (A Combination Stop/cargo lamp was not required until September 1, 1993 for the 1994 year model.) ...|$|E

50|$|The LMC {{model is}} based on the concept of a little man shut in a closed mail room (analogous to a {{computer}} in this scenario). At one end of the room, there are 100 mailboxes (memory), numbered 0 to 99, that can each contain a 3 digit instruction or data (ranging from 000 to 999). Furthermore, there are two mailboxes at the other end labeled INBOX and OUTBOX which are used for receiving and outputting data. In the center of the room, there is a work area containing a simple two function (addition and subtraction) calculator known as the Accumulator and a <b>resettable</b> counter known as the Program Counter. The Program Counter holds the address of the next instruction the Little Man will carry out. This Program Counter is normally incremented by 1 after each instruction is executed, allowing the Little Man to work through a program sequentially. Branch instructions allow iteration (loops) and conditional programming structures to be incorporated into a program. The latter is achieved by setting the Program Counter to a non-sequential memory address if a particular condition is met (typically the value stored in the accumulator being zero or positive).|$|E
5000|$|Fig. 3 shows {{a typical}} Pulses Plus schematic. The pack {{includes}} diodes in each branch {{to minimize the}} possibility of reverse charging the cells. PTCs, or positive temperature coefficient thermistors act as <b>resettable</b> fuses. PTCs begin to get warm at a trip current. The warmth increases their resistance which produces even more heat, and the PTC quickly [...] "trips" [...] and shuts off most of the current. The PTC rarely trips in a typical ADCP pack, because the safety circuit is the primary protection against short circuits (defined to be any current above about 8 A). The safety circuit also turns off the pack before its voltage falls below a threshold. If the pack were allowed to fully discharge, one branch could discharge before the others, {{which could lead to}} the discharged branch being charged by the remaining cells. Any attempt to charge a lithium cell is potentially dangerous, and turning the pack off at about 75-80% of its starting voltage prevents this from happening. At this voltage, only around 3% of the capacity remains, but the remaining capacity still allows years for disposal of the pack before it discharges fully.|$|E
40|$|<b>Resettable</b> {{adiabatic}} flip-flops {{are essential}} {{in the design}} of adiabatic counters, thus, a comprehensive study for IECRL, PFAL and EACRL 4 -phase quasi-adiabatic logic families have been done in this paper. In addition, a new <b>resettable</b> quasi-adiabatic flip-flop circuit is proposed for each of them. Using the non-resettable and the proposed <b>resettable</b> adiabatic flip-flops, a practical sequential circuit comprising of a 2 -bit twisted ring counter is designed and the energy consumption, for four distinct states, at different ramping times is measured. The simulation results show that the energy consumption of the <b>resettable</b> counter is comparable with its non-resettable counterparts. Moreover, amongst the adiabatic logic used, the PFAL based implementation of both the non-resettable and the <b>resettable</b> counters exhibits the least energy consumption at all ramping times...|$|E
