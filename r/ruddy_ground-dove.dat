40|$|Mites {{associated}} with birds have different {{relationships with their}} hosts, ranging from accidental association to true ecto- and endoparasitism. A total of 51 samples of the ruddy ground dove, Columbina talpacoti (Temminck, 1810) (Columbiformes), from São Paulo State, Brazil, were examined for mites. Five of the samples were nests. Mites belonging to the following taxa were found: Astigmata—Analgidae (three species), Falculiferidae (four species) and an unidentified Pyroglyphidae species; Mesostigmata—a single species of Macronyssidae; Prostigmata—a single species each of Cheyletidae, Ereynetidae, Harpirhynchidae and Syringophilidae. Diplaegidia columbigallinae Cerny´, 1975 and Byersalges talpacoti Cerny´, 1975 were the most frequent species. Known associations of each mite species to other columbiform birds are reported.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} {{accomplished}} {{with the aim}} to evaluate and to characterize the risks {{for the presence of}} Megninia spp. in poultry farms from Minas Gerais, using for that Correspondence Analysis (CA). A secondary database was used and adapted for this study, with information from 402 chicken houses of 42 laying hens commercial properties. Variables used to compose the correspondence model were selected through tests of Qui-square being considered the significant result of P≤ 0, 05. A risk index was built to the presence of Megninia spp. starting from variables considered as risk factors for the presence of those ectoparasites. The CA graph produced for the epidemiological characterization of the presence of Megninia spp. presented an accumulated qui-square value of 58, 55 %. There was an association of the risk index with the age ranges of the poultry, among the presence Megninia spp. and the use of mineral oil and acaricide in the ration and; finally, an association between the <b>ruddy</b> <b>ground-dove</b> (Columbina talpacoti) presence and the absence of mites of the Megninia genus. The results supply knowledge on the epidemiology of Megninia spp. In addition, these information can contribute in the decision, reducing the risks of possible infestations in poultry farms and the negative effects of that parasitism...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{geographic}} {{overlap between}} areas of Atlantic rainforest and human activities allows interactions to occur {{between humans and}} wild and domestic animals. Despite the great importance of the domestic animal-wildlife-human interface that occurs at poultry farms {{in terms of public}} health, economic production and wildlife conservation, there are few studies in Brazil examining the distribution and health of wild birds that interact with poultry farms. From January to December 2010, mist nets were used to capture 166 free-ranging birds that were within close proximity to three poultry farms in Atlantic rainforest remnants in south-eastern Brazil. The species composition was examined, and molecular methods were used to test for avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. The avian communities near the poultry farms were dominated by three synanthropic species, which corresponded to 70 % of all captured individuals: house sparrows Passer domesticus (33 %), saffron finches (Sicalis flaveola) (22 %), and <b>ruddy</b> <b>ground-doves</b> (Columbina talpacoti) (15 %). These predominant bird species were in poor body condition (27 %), were infested with feather mites (43 %), or presented both conditions (23 %). No evidence of infection by avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus or M. gallisepticum was identified in any of the studied birds. Although no evidence of the studied pathogens was, our findings demonstrate that differences in the environmental characteristics and biosecurity practices influence the wild bird community near poultry farms, which in turn may affect the health status of these synanthropic birds and strengthen their role in the transmission of pathogens...|$|R
