Raja is shown performing the single in various <b>risqué</b> outfits, such {{as a pair of}} white sunglasses and a leopard print body suit. He also appears outside his drag persona.

5|$|But at {{some point}} in 1972, family {{friendly}} programming began being interspersed with (and was eventually replaced by) “blue movies”, such as Swedish Fly Girls. The chain would come to be known for its generally <b>risque</b> material. In 1981, prints of both Caligula and Dracula Sucks were confiscated from multiple Towne locations, and the company was sued by the Government of Alberta under obscenity laws.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became {{symbols of the}} {{slightly}} <b>risqué</b> glamour and decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.|$|E
5|$|Michael Eisner, then CEO, and Roy E. Disney, Vice Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, felt Who Framed Roger Rabbit was too <b>risqué</b> {{with sexual}} references. Eisner and Zemeckis {{disagreed}} over various {{elements of the}} film, but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege, he refused to make alterations. Roy E. Disney, head of Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt it was appropriate to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner.|$|E

5|$|Carte {{started his}} career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music {{publishing}} and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be as popular as the <b>risqué</b> French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and, together with his wife Helen Carte, he nurtured their collaboration {{on a series of}} thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and built the state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Offenbach {{produced}} {{his first}} full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), which was exceptionally well received and has remained {{one of his}} most played works. During the 1860s, he produced at least 18 full-length operettas, as well as more one-act pieces. His works from this period included La belle Hélène (1864), La Vie parisienne (1866), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867) and La Périchole (1868). The <b>risqué</b> humour (often about sexual intrigue) and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach's facility for melody, made them internationally known, and translated versions were successful in Vienna, London and elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Striptease made news {{again when}} it was shown in a fourth-grade class in Chicago, Illinois. The teacher claimed the {{students}} chose the film, but he drew criticism since the film was <b>risqué.</b> (The violent 1996 film Scream was shown in the same school on the same day, causing further controversy.) In 2000 in Ireland, some viewers criticized the Radio Telefís Éireann for running Striptease. These viewers questioned the film's appropriateness and some considered it demeaning to women. However, the station felt it was not pornography and it was aired at night.|$|E

5|$|In a 1982 {{interview}} with Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Henson said ideas for his feature film The Dark Crystal originated from his efforts at character creation on Saturday Night Live. Henson told the Associated Press in 1982 that The Dark Crystal characters evolved directly from his Saturday Night Live creations. Henson described the evolutionary process from The Land of Gorch to Dark Crystal, saying that because The Land of Gorch was featured on late-night television, it helped {{expand the scope}} of his puppets, including <b>risqué</b> behavior. He described the challenge that motivated him to further develop concepts from The Land of Gorch on Dark Crystal, saying his next motivation was to draft a universe of puppets for a feature film without humans.|$|E
5|$|Other major plot {{elements}} were the 1937 marriage of Winnie to engineer Will Wright and {{the disappearance of}} Will during World War II, leaving a pregnant Winnie behind. This realistic and unfortunate situation was too <b>risqué</b> for some newspapers: The Baltimore Sun dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie. The comic strip changed significantly over the years; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war, seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after a few decades. She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years, including {{a stint in the}} Peace Corps.|$|E
5|$|The calypso song {{complex is}} {{characterized}} by satirical, political, <b>risque</b> and humorous lyricism, a competitive and celebratory nature and its function in social organization and informal communication. Jamaican mento {{is perhaps the most}} well-known form of calypso-like music. The island of Carriacou is home to a calypso-like song style, as well as canboulay feasts, calinda songs and steel bands, all similar to though distinct from the related Trinidadian traditions. Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style, and there are competitions similar to calypso tents on the island. The Antiguan benna is part of the same song complex, featuring news-oriented and ribald, often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic, uptempo style.|$|E

5|$|The {{name for}} the bikini design was coined in 1946 by Parisian {{engineer}} Louis Réard, the designer of the bikini. He named the swimsuit after Bikini Atoll, where testing on the nuclear bomb was taking place. Fashion designer Jacques Heim, also from Paris, re-released a similar design earlier that same year, the Atome. Due to its controversial and revealing design, the bikini was slow to be adopted. In many countries it was banned from beaches and public places. While still considered <b>risqué,</b> the bikini gradually {{became a part of}} popular culture when film starsBrigitte Bardot, Raquel Welch, Ursula Andress and othersbegan wearing them on public beaches and in film.|$|E
5|$|While {{reaching}} {{a peak of}} twenty-five on the Billboard Hot 100, it topped the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The charting gave Usher his eleventh number-one on the chart, tying Ray Charles and R. Kelly for the fifth-most number-one's since the chart's inception. The song's accompanying music video features Usher pursuing his love interest in <b>risque</b> scenes. Usher performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 BET Awards. The song earned Usher a Grammy Award for Best Male R Vocal Performance, at the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{contained}} suggestive dialogue {{and the female}} cast wore revealing clothes, the production was considered highly <b>risqué</b> at the time. The script alluded to a contemporary scandal involving actor Fatty Arbuckle, and one scene featured actresses stripping {{as part of a}} card game. Reviewers generally panned the play as unfunny and vulgar, and local authorities attempted to censor it. A New York City magistrate ruled the Broadway production was obscene, and obscenity charges were brought against Woods, but a grand jury declined to indict him. The city's Commissioner of Licenses attempted to revoke the theater's license, but this effort was blocked in court. Woods promoted the controversy to increase ticket sales, and the play {{was one of the most}} successful of the season. It had no long-term literary impact and was never published, but it did stimulate arguments over censorship of theatrical performances.|$|E

5|$|French women {{welcomed the}} design but the Catholic Church, some media, and a {{majority}} of the public initially thought the design was <b>risqué</b> or even scandalous. Contestants in the first Miss World beauty pageant wore them in 1951, but the bikini was then banned from the competition. Actress Brigitte Bardot drew attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Other actresses, including Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner, also gathered press attention when they wore bikinis. During the early 1960s, the design appeared on the cover of Playboy and Sports Illustrated, giving it additional legitimacy. Ursula Andress made a huge impact when she emerged from the surf wearing what is now an iconic bikini in the James Bond movie Dr. No (1962). The deer skin bikini Raquel Welch wore in the film One Million Years B.C. (1966) turned her into an international sex symbol and was described as a definitive look of the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the United States Library of Congress {{deemed the}} film {{culturally}} significant and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Animal House is first on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies. In 2000, the American Film Institute ranked the film No. 36 on 100 Years... 100 Laughs, {{a list of}} the 100 best American comedies. In 2006, Miller wrote a more comprehensive memoir of his experiences in Dartmouth's AD house in a book entitled, The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie, in which Miller recounts hijinks that were considered too <b>risqué</b> for the movie. In 2008, Empire magazine selected Animal House as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. The film was also selected by The New York Times as one of The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made.|$|E
5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also supposed to have a large scar on her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a <b>risqué</b> line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time.|$|E
