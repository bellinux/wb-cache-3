Hilts were crafted of willow and walnut wood, bearing an octagonal shape.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{nightingale}} excrement {{dates back}} to the Heian period (AD7941185) when it was introduced to the Japanese by the Koreans. Koreans used the guano to remove dye from kimono fabric, allowing them to make intricate designs on the clothing. The Japanese used the bird droppings to <b>remove</b> <b>stains</b> from silk garments such as kimonos. Then, during the Edo period (AD 16031868), the Japanese expanded its use by using it as a beauty treatment. Some sources, however, report that as early as the third century Japanese women used bags of rice bran and supplies of nightingale droppings to whiten their skin. Geishas and kabuki actors used heavy white makeup that contained zinc and lead, which likely caused many issues such as skin diseases. Uguisu no fun was used to thoroughly remove this makeup and to whiten and balance skin tone. Also, Buddhist monks used the droppings to polish and clean their bald scalps.|$|E

50|$|Color safe bleach is a {{chemical}} that uses hydrogen peroxide as {{the active ingredient}} (to help <b>remove</b> <b>stains)</b> rather than sodium hypochlorite or chlorine. It also has chemicals in it that help brighten colors. Hydrogen peroxide is also used for sterilization purposes and water treatment, but its disinfectant capabilities may be limited due to the concentration in the colorsafe bleach solution as compared to other applications.|$|E
50|$|A lady's maid's {{specific}} duties included {{helping her}} mistress with her appearance, including make-up, hairdressing, clothing, jewellery, and shoes. A lady's maid would also <b>remove</b> <b>stains</b> from clothing; sew, mend, and alter garments as needed; bring her mistress breakfast in her room; and draw her mistress's bath. However, {{she would not}} be expected to dust and clean every small item as that is the job of a housemaid.|$|E
50|$|Surfactants (detergents) are {{molecules}} that have one polar end and one non-polar end {{and can be}} used for stain removal. They can help to emulsify compounds that are not usually soluble in water. For example, if you put oil in water, they tend to stay separated. If you put oil, detergent, and water together and shake them up, then you get a mixture that can help to <b>remove</b> <b>stains.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{juice of}} the lemon {{may be used}} for cleaning. A halved lemon dipped in salt or baking powder is used to {{brighten}} copper cookware. The acid dissolves the tarnish and the abrasives assist the cleaning. As a sanitary kitchen deodorizer the juice can deodorize, <b>remove</b> grease, bleach <b>stains,</b> and disinfect; when mixed with baking soda, it <b>removes</b> <b>stains</b> from plastic food storage containers. The oil of the lemon's peel also has various uses. It is used as a wood cleaner and polish, where its solvent property is employed to dissolve old wax, fingerprints, and grime. Lemon oil and orange oil are also used as a nontoxic insecticide treatment.|$|R
50|$|There {{are special}} {{consideration}} when cleaning stained wood. One {{of the most}} common stains is water stains on stained wood. Techniques to <b>remove</b> the water <b>stains</b> have been documented that use a hot iron to <b>remove</b> the water <b>stain.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Abrasives, {{like the}} dental {{polishing}} agents used in dentists' offices, also cause {{a small amount}} of enamel erosion which is termed [...] "polishing" [...] action. Some brands contain powdered white mica, which acts as a mild abrasive, and also adds a cosmetically pleasing glittery shimmer to the paste. The polishing of teeth <b>removes</b> <b>stains</b> from tooth surfaces, but has not been shown to improve dental health over and above the effects of the removal of plaque and calculus.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the surface}} of a {{mattress}} can be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner, {{it is very difficult to}} completely <b>remove</b> <b>stains</b> from most standard mattresses. An unprotected mattress can become marked or stained quite quickly as natural perspiration produced throughout the night passes through a standard cloth sheet and creates a characteristic yellowish-brown tidemark where it has been absorbed into the upper surface of the mattress. Mattresses are also susceptible to many other contaminant.|$|E
50|$|The {{solvents}} used in {{rubber cement}} present some hazards, including flammability and potential for abuse as inhalants. Therefore, {{as with any}} adhesive, rubber cement {{should be used in}} an open area. Also, care needs be taken to avoid heat sources, as n-heptane and n-hexane are highly flammable. Rubber cement and rubber cement thinner (which is used to replace the solvent that evaporates from the container and to <b>remove</b> <b>stains</b> of glue) that contain acetone will damage polished surfaces and many plastics.|$|E
50|$|Bleaches {{are used}} as {{household}} chemicals to whiten clothes and <b>remove</b> <b>stains</b> and as disinfectants, primarily {{in the bathroom and}} kitchen. Many bleaches have strong bactericidal properties, and are used for disinfecting and sterilizing and thus are used in swimming pool sanitation to control bacteria, viruses and algae and in any institution where sterile conditions are needed. They are also used in many industrial processes, notably in the bleaching of wood pulp. Bleach is also used for removing mildew, killing weeds and increasing the longevity of cut flowers.|$|E
50|$|Potassium hydrogenoxalate {{occurs in}} some plants, notably sorrel. It is a {{commercial}} product, used in photography, marble grinding, and to <b>remove</b> ink <b>stains.</b>|$|R

[...] Images from the ends of benches were <b>removed,</b> <b>stained</b> glass windows were destroyed and the cross-keys of St Peter were blotted out on the spire. In 1645 some of the vestments and the organ were sold.|$|R
