40|$|Abstract. In fenite data books the <b>reversible</b> <b>permeability</b> {{for small}} {{excitation}} levels is usually given vs. external dc magnetic field for different {{values of the}} effective permeability. To determine these curves the incremental permeability has to be measured on cores with different air gaps. Due to the grinding of different air gaps the determination of those curves is very costly. Also a judgement of the incremental permeability from ring cores, which {{are used in the}} material development, is not possible. In this paper the calculation of the incremental permeability for cores with homogeneous cross section from measured data of ring cores is presented. The <b>reversible</b> <b>permeability</b> vs. dc magnetic field and the amplitude permeability vs. flux density has to be measured. With those data the <b>reversible</b> <b>permeability</b> vs. flux density for the ring core can be calculated. Gans made the assumption that the <b>reversible</b> <b>permeability</b> vs. flux density is a material property. By calculating the drop of the flux density due to an air gap the incremental permeability for a gapped core with homogeneous cross section can be calculated {{as a function of the}} external dc magnetic field. Calculated and measured data for E-cores made of the S+M material N 87 are in excellent accordance. 1...|$|E

Thyroxine-induced decrease in membrane potential is partially or completely reversed by addition of EGTA into the incubation medium.

40|$|Intestinal barrier {{function}} is reduced in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL) - 13, which are up-regulated in IBD, induce barrier defects {{that are associated with}} myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activation and increased claudin- 2 expression, respectively, in cultured intestinal epithelial monolayers. Here we report that these independent signaling pathways have distinct effects on tight junction barrier properties and interact in vivo. MLCK activation alters size selectivity to enhance paracellular flux of uncharged macromolecules without affecting charge selectivity and can be rapidly reversed by MLCK inhibition. In contrast, IL- 13 -dependent claudin- 2 expression increases paracellular cation flux in vitro and in vivo without altering tight junction size selectivity but is unaffected by MLCK inhibition in vitro. In vivo, MLCK activation increases paracellular flux of uncharged macromolecules and also triggers IL- 13 expression, claudin- 2 synthesis, and increased paracellular cation flux. We conclude that <b>reversible,</b> MLCK-dependent <b>permeability</b> increases cause mucosal immune activation that, in turn, feeds back on the tight junction to establish long-lasting barrier defects.

For the acid to directly affect leaf tissues, it must pass through the leaf cuticle, but {{little is known about the}} permeability of cuticles to protons, or about the effect of different anions on this permeability. We investigated the movement of protons through isolated astomatous leaf cuticles of grapefruit (Citrus X paradisi Macfady.), rough lemon (Citrus limon [L. ] Burm. fils cv Ponderosa), and pear (Pyrus communis L.) using hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric acids. Cuticles were enzymically isolated from leaves and placed in a diffusion apparatus with pH 4 acid on the morphological outer surface of the cuticle and degassed distilled water on the inner surface. Changes in pH of the solution on the inner surface were used to determine rates of effective permeability of the cuticles to the protons of these acids. Most cuticles exhibited an initial low permeability, lasting hours to days, then after a short transition displayed a significantly higher permeability, which persisted until equilibrium was approached. The change in effective permeability appears to be <b>reversible.</b> Effective <b>permeabilities</b> were higher for sulfuric acid than for the others.

40|$|Measurement {{shows that}} the unequalized flux-vs-wavelength {{response}} of a magnetic tape first falls at 6 dB/octave, then at 12 dB/octave with decreasing wavelength.

Permeability to Lucifer Yellow dye (476 Da) increased dose dependently when arachidonic acid was applied focally to the abluminal surface of the vessels. This was completely reversible at all but the highest dose. The permeability increase was 1. 65 × 10 − 6 ± 0. 247 × 10 − 6 cm s− 1 (mean ± s. e. m.) at 0. 25 mm, 3. 53 × 10 − 6 ± 0. 872 × 10 − 6 cm s− 1 at 0. 5 mm, 12. 61 × 10 − 6 ± 3. 44 × 10 − 6 cm s− 1 at 1 mm and 18. 46 × 10 − 6 ± 5. 90 × 10 − 6 cm s− 1 at 2 mm arachidonic acid.

40|$|TNF-a is a {{cytokine}} {{that produces}} increased permeability in the peripheral vasculature; however, {{little is known}} about the effects of TNF-a on the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Using primary cultured bovine brain microvessel endothelial cells (BBMEC) as an in vitro model of the BBB, this study shows that TNF-a produces a reversible increase in the permeability of the brain microvessel endothelial cells. The BBMEC monolayers were pre-treated with 100 ng/ml of TNF-a for periods ranging from 2 to 12 hours. Permeability was assessed using three molecular weight markers, fluorescein (376 MW), fluorescein-dextran (FDX- 4400; 4400 MW), and FDX- 70000 (MW 70000). The permeability of BBMEC monolayers to all three fluorescent markers was increased two-fold or greater in the TNF-a treatment group compared to control monolayers receiving no TNF-a. Significant changes in permeability were also observed with TNF-a concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml.

40|$|Physiological {{regulation}} of nodule gas permeability has {{a central role}} in the response of legumes to such diverse factors as drought, defoliation, and soil nitrate. A new method for quantifying nodule respiration and O 2 permeability, based on noninvasive spectrophotometry of leghemoglobin, was evaluated using intact, attached nodules of Lotus corniculatus. First, the relationship between nodule respiration (O 2 consumption) rate and internal O 2 concentration was determined from the rate of decrease in fractional oxygenation of leghemoglobin (FOL) under N 2. The rate of increase of FOL under 100 % O 2 was then used to calculate nodule O 2 permeability, after correcting for respiration. Inactivation of nitrogenase by exposure to 100 % O 2 for 15 minutes led to decreases in both permeability and O 2 -saturated respiration (Vmax), but the brief (< 15 seconds) exposures to 100 % O 2 required by the assay itself had little effect on either parameter. A gradual increase in external O 2 concentration from 20 to 40 % resulted in a <b>reversible</b> decrease in <b>permeability,</b> but no change in Vmax. The new method is likely to be useful for research on nodule physiology and might also be applicable to agronomic research and crop improvement programs...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory {{mediators}} {{have a role}} in {{the formation}} of cerebral oedema and there is evidence that cGMP is an important signal in vascular permeability increase. We have investigated the role and the source of cGMP in mediating the permeability response to acutely applied bradykinin and the histamine H 2 agonist dimaprit on single cerebral venular capillaries, by using the single vessel occlusion technique. We found that 8 -bromo-cGMP applied acutely resulted in a small and <b>reversible</b> <b>permeability</b> increase with a log EC 50 − 7. 2 ± 0. 15 m. KT 5823, the inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, abolished the permeability responses to both bradykinin and dimaprit, while zaprinast, an inhibitor of type 5 phosphodiesterase, potentiated the response to bradykinin. On the other hand, l-NMMA blocked the response to dimaprit, but not that to bradykinin. Inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase, LY 85353 and methylene blue, also inhibited the permeability response to dimaprit, but not bradykinin. The permeability responses to the natriuretic peptides ANP and CNP were of similar magnitude to that of bradykinin with log EC 50 − 10. 0 ± 0. 33 m and − 8. 7 ± 0. 23 m, respectively. The natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist HS- 142 – 1 blocked permeability responses to bradykinin as well as to ANP, and leukotriene D 4 blocked the responses to CNP and bradykinin, but not to dimaprit. In conclusion, the histamine H 2 receptor appears to signal via cGMP that is generated by a NO and soluble guanylyl cyclase, while bradykinin B 2 receptor also signals via cGMP but through particulate guanylyl cyclase...|$|E

The analysis of MPI characteristics that affect sensitivity and reliability contributes not only reductions in inspection design cost and time but also improvement of analysis of experimental data.

Selection of a magnetic field source, which produces a magnetic field gradient large enough to detect a defect in a test sample or component, {{is an important factor}} in magnetic particle inspection. In this work a finite element method (FEM) has been employed for numerical calculation of the MPI simulation technique.

At low concentrations the drug inhibited {{the growth of}} the yeast and <b>reversible</b> changed cell <b>permeability</b> to Na+ and K+. At high levels it was lethal. The intracellular K+ concentration of cells with reversible damage (stage I) could be increased by addition of K+ to the medium, but cells irreversibly damaged (stage II) were not able to retain K+. The addition of K+ to the medium did not influence the growth-inhibitory or killing action of AmB. Addition of Mg 2 + to cultures increased S. cerevisiae resistance to the killing effects of AmB. At low concentrations of AmB, growth inhibition was also decreased by extracellular Mg 2 +, but at higher concentration of AmB, growth inhibition was increased, probably because the prevention by Mg 2 + of the lethal effect allowed expression of the inhibitory effect in a greater range. Simultaneous addition of K+ and Mg 2 + markedly decreased both the inhibitory and lethal action of AmB at all concentrations.

40|$|The {{brain is}} the center of {{cognitive}} function and also regulates the physiology of the body. Due to its importance, it requires special vascular structure which separates itself from the peripheral circulation to maintain its electrical physiology and protect from insult from circulation. The vasculature of the brain is lined with a single layer of endothelial cells which is sealed with adherent and tight junction molecules. The endothelial cell lining is further insulated with pericytes and astrocytic endfeet. Also endothelial cells express varieties of transporters which selectively allow the entrance of molecules into the brain. This physicochemical vascular entity is called the blood brain barrier. This structural barrier is, however, detrimental in the delivery of molecules to the brain. Many of drugs are dropped out from the pipelines because they cannot show the expected effect in the brain. To overcome this, many approaches were devised to increase the drug delivery to the brain, they were either invasive or ineffective. In previous study, we have shown that adenosine receptor signaling can increase the permeability of large molecules to the brain. Adenosine receptor is the G-protein coupled receptor which is involved in numerous physiological reactions. Activation of adenosine receptor showed potent and reversible increased permeability to the large molecules. In this dissertation, we aimed to reveal if activation of adenosine receptor signaling can increase the permeability in the human primary brain endothelial cell monolayer. Indeed we observed robust and <b>reversible</b> <b>permeability</b> increase in human brain endothelial cells. This was mediated by increased Rho-GTPase activity and following stress fiber formation which subsequently disrupted the tight and adherens junctional molecules. Activation of AR also increased the permeability to chemotherapeutics Gemcitabine. Also, we studied if adenosine receptor signaling can increase transcellular pathway which is mainly mediated by transporters highly expressed on the brain endothelial cells, especially P-glycoprotein. Indeed we observed that AR activation can increase the accumulation of the P-glycoprotein substrate in human primary brain endothelial cells by down regulating the expression and function of P-glycoprotein. Also, we could observe that it down-regulates the P-glycoprotein and thereby increase the accumulation of epirubicin, a P-glycoprotein substrate, in the brain of the mouse. Collectively, we showed that AR activation can increase the permeability paracellular permeability of the human primary brain endothelial cells and also down regulate the P-glycoprotein function and enhance the transcellular permeability. These dual mechanism of regulating the permeability of the blood brain barrier might be beneficial in drug delivery in the brain which will benefit millions of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative disease or brain cancers. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E

However, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) inhibits the transport of intravenous antibodies to tumors in the brain. Recent studies have demonstrated that focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles (MBs) is a promising method to transiently disrupt the BBB for the drug delivery to the central nervous system. To find the optimal FUS and MBs that can induce reversible increase in the BBB permeability, we employed minimally invasive multiphoton microscopy to quantify the BBB permeability to dextran- 155 kDa with similar molecular weight to an antibody by applying different doses of FUS in the presence of MBs with an optimal size and concentration. The cerebral microcirculation was observed through a section of frontoparietal bone thinned with a micro-grinder. About 5 minutes after applying the FUS on the thinned skull in the presence of MBs for 1 minute, TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate) -dextran- 155 kDa in 1 % bovine serum albumin in mammalian Ringer’s solution was injected into the cerebral circulation via the ipsilateral carotid artery by a syringe pump. Simultaneously, the temporal images were collected from the brain parenchyma ~ 100 – 200 µm below the pia mater. Permeability was determined from the rate of tissue solute accumulation around individual microvessels. After several trials, we found the optimal dose of FUS. At the optimal dose, permeability increased by ~ 14 -fold after 5 minutes post-FUS, and permeability returned to the control level after 25 minutes. FUS without MBs or MBs injected without FUS did not change the permeability. Our method provides an accurate in vivo assessment for the transient BBB permeability change under the treatment of FUS. The optimal FUS dose found for the <b>reversible</b> BBB <b>permeability</b> increase without BBB disruption is reliable and can be applied to future clinical trials.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Primary {{monolayer}} {{cultures of}} chick renal epithelial cells grown on plastic coverslips were reversibly dissociated with the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The cellular responses during dissociation and reaggregation in Hank's {{balanced salt solution}} (BSS) were observed with phase optics and recorded by time-lapse cinemicrography. The epithelial cells grow as a confluent sheet closely adherent to the plastic substrate. EDTA induces a series of responses by {{the cells of the}} monolayer. The chelation of divalent cations by EDTA induces the cells of the monolayer to relinquish mutual adhesive contacts. On newly freed surfaces veiling is initiated for a brief period and then subsides. Cellular contraction continues followed by very active surface blebbing. On continued chelation this activity also ceases at which time the cells are completely separated, fully rounded and highly refractile. Cultures containing fully separated cells were perfused with Hank's BSS and allowed to reassociate into a coherent monolayer. After a brief refractory period surface blebbing resumes and continues for a time giving way to a less vigorous surface expansion. The cells flatten to the substrate, expand centrifugally, and make contact with adjacent cells. This initial contact is extended over greater surface areas until a coherent sheet of cells indistinguishable from the untreated cultures has been established. The EDTA effects are interpreted as being a result of the extraction of divalent cations while the recovery responses are interpreted as a reversal of the EDTA effects by the calcium containing medium. The responses during separation and recovery are discussed in terms of altered sol-gel relationships, <b>reversible</b> cellular <b>permeability</b> properties and <b>reversible</b> changes in the cellular adhesiveness. The sequence of events during separation and reconstitution of the confluent sheet have been studied with the electron microscope to establish changes in the ultrastructure corresponding to those observed with the light microscope. The fine structure of the untreated tissues has been studied with special emphasis on the cellular interrelationships. With the exception of the intracellular cement all adhesive modifications are disrupted during EDTA induced separation and those that are disrupted exhibit a striking recovery during incubation in Hank's BSS. During the separation and recovery sequences microvilli are elaborated at the free surfaces of the cells, they are retracted on fully separated cells and reappear during recovery. Their possible role in cell contact is discussed. In addition to the surface effects EDTA elicits disruption of certain intracellular components. Peripheral microtubules are destroyed during the separation sequence and reappear in the recovery cells, however, those observed in association with the centriole are not affected. The microtubules are discussed in terms of a labile cytoskeleton functioning in formation and maintenance of cell asymmetries. Polyribosomes are decreased in numbers during chelation. This is interpreted as being due to extraction of magnesium by the chelating agent and its removal permits their increase during recovery. The mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi lamellae and the centriole and its derivatives are not altered by treatment. Many of the EDTA induced responses are discussed in the light of events occurring during normal mitosis. The surface responses and cytoplasmic effects of EDTA treatment suggests that a related phenomenon occurs during normal mitosis...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{compaction}} and fouling {{increases the}} operational costs of membrane processes and decreases {{the lifetime of}} the membrane. Fouling {{is a major problem}} in most membrane processes, and it must be considered when membranes, membrane modules and processes are designed and developed. Compaction may also decrease the performance of the membrane process, and wrong operation conditions may damage the membrane permanently. On the other hand, compaction may be beneficial to the membrane process if it densifies the membrane structure and thereby increases its retention. Together, compaction and fouling may have dramatic effects on the viability of the membrane process, and the effects are hard to predict without experimental data. Ultrasonic Time-Domain Reflectometry (UTDR) can be used to monitor the membrane casting process, compaction, fouling and cleaning in real time and non-invasively. UTDR is based on the detection of the time of flight of the sound waves that are reflected from the membrane surface. However, the usability and accuracy of this technology are very sensitive to changes in the process conditions, such as the temperature, pressure and concentration, {{due to the fact that}} sonic velocity is affected by them. In this thesis, environmental compensation for UTDR has been developed to measure sonic velocity with an additional reference transducer or a double transducer. The double transducer has two sensors at different distances, which allows determination of sonic velocity. UTDR with the reference transducer was found to be more accurate in practical use than UTDR with estimated sonic velocity. Inside the module, integrated transducers seemed to be more sensitive to detecting membrane fouling than measurements through the top plate of the membrane module, which is the common way to use the technique. The developed environmental compensation with transducers integrated inside the module were used to study membrane compaction. Compaction has earlier been studied mostly with offline methods, which lack <b>reversible</b> compaction and <b>permeability</b> information. Online monitoring revealed how different temperatures and pressures affected the reversible and irreversible compaction of different polymeric membranes and their permeability. It was noticed that reversible compaction can be mistaken for concentration polarization as they both have a similar effect on membrane permeability. This may lead to the adoption of inappropriate mitigation methods. Also membrane retention was studied to achieve better understanding of how retention is affected by irreversible compaction of the membrane, and it was confirmed that it was possible to modify membrane retention by pre-compaction of the membrane. It was possible to increase the retentions of all tested membranes by compacting them in higher pressure before use...|$|R
