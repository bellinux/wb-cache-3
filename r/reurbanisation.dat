25|$|The city's {{population}} {{declined in}} the late 18th and early 19th centuries, dipping under 200,000 in 1820. By {{the second half of}} the 19th century, industrialisation spurred renewed growth. Amsterdam's population hit an all-time high of 872,000 in 1959, before declining in the following decades due to government-sponsored suburbanisation to so-called groeikernen (growth centres) such as Purmerend and Almere. Between 1970 and 1980, Amsterdam experienced its sharpest population decline ever, and by 1985 the city had only 675,570 residents. This was soon followed by <b>reurbanisation</b> and gentrification, however, leading to renewed population growth in the 2010s. The municipal department for Research, Information and Statistics expects a new record population to be set in 2020.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-18th {{century the}} city needed new urban {{improvements}} {{to provide for}} the swift flow of goods and people between the Ribeira neighbourhood and other areas of Porto. In this context, governor João de Almada e Melo opened a new street, the São João Street, that connected the Ribeira Square and the upper town, and promoted the <b>reurbanisation</b> of the square itself. The project, executed between 1776 and 1782, is credited to John Whitehead, English consul in Porto. The square was to become enclosed on its north, west and east sides by buildings with arcades, while {{the south side of the}} square, facing the Douro, was enclosed by the mediaeval walls (Muralhas Fernandinas) of Porto. These walls were torned down in 1821, opening the square to the river.|$|E
50|$|The Capital city of Budapest was {{established}} on 17 November 1873 with {{the unification of}} three separate towns, named Buda, Óbuda and Pest. In 1720 Buda and Óbuda had 9,600 residents, while Pest was a small town with only 2,600 inhabitants. In the 18th and 19th century Pest became the natural commercial, transportation, industrial and cultural center of Hungary, Buda and Óbuda remained small towns. The population of Pest reached 50,000 in the 1820s, 100,000 in the 1840s and 200,000 in the 1860s. At {{the time of the}} unification Buda and Óbuda had 69,543 inhabitants, Pest was home to 227,294 people. The first modern Hungarian census was held in 1869-70, when the Hungarian Central Statistical Office enumerated 302,085 people at the present-territory of Budapest. Between the unification and the World War I Greater Budapest quadrupled its population, got a new global city upon the Danube. At that time Budapest was one of the fastest-growing city in Europe, triggered by industrialisation and high natural growth rate and fertility of rural ethnic Hungarians. Internal migration peaked in the 1960s with near 250,000 people in correlate to post World War II baby boom and forced collectivization. The city became extremely overcrowded, the central government also perceived the problem and limited getting apartment in 1965, preventing overpopulation, housing shortage and the collapse of public works. This restriction raised a strong wave of suburbanization, which peaked after fall of the Communism, the number of inhabitants dropped to 1.7 million, while garden housing development is still decisive in the suburbs. <b>Reurbanisation</b> and gentrification getting on since the mid-2000s.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>reurbanisation</b> is {{discussed}} in this article from theoretical and methodological perspectives. <b>Reurbanisation</b> has been defined as one of the stages of urban development recently, but it is also tied to processes of gentrification, or perceived as a policy aimed at the revitalisation of inner cities. The main objective of this contribution is to discuss three principal and different perspectives of reurbanisation: firstly, <b>reurbanisation</b> as defined on the macro-scale of settlement system development; secondly, the concept as elaborated at the micro-scale of the transformation of inner cities; and, thirdly, <b>reurbanisation</b> viewed as a specific urban policy at the local government scale of analysis. The authors’ singular understanding of the <b>reurbanisation</b> process – as suburban-to-urban migration – is then presented as an alternative conceptualization of <b>reurbanisation.</b> This paper presents and evaluates the use of the <b>reurbanisation</b> concept in research on residential environments in current conditions in the Czech Republic and relates it to the broader domain of research on post-socialist cities...|$|E
40|$|After {{a decade}} of {{tremendous}} population loss indicating severe decline, some large east German cities have been displaying signs of <b>reurbanisation</b> since the late 1990 s. Using the city of Leipzig as an example, this paper identifies the major characteristics, progress and underlying spatio-temporal dynamics of <b>reurbanisation,</b> and examines {{whether it is a}} long-term process of urban living or features only short-term tendencies. Socio-demographic indicators are used to observe the development of inner-city districts. At the spatial scale of municipal districts, time-series data are analysed for the years 1993 to 2005. The paper argues that <b>reurbanisation</b> has occurred primarily in inner-city districts and has progressed considerably since the early 1990 s. However, the spatio-temporal distribution of the relevant indicators shows that <b>reurbanisation</b> is far from being a homogeneous process. In light of this, the paper presents a ring of reurbanisation-sensitive municipal districts around the city centre. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{caracteristics}} of urbanisation under postfordist {{conditions in}} Switzerland are {{the emergence of}} large polycentric metropolitan areas and the overlay of suburbanisation and <b>reurbanisation</b> processes at the same time. This thesis investigates {{the impact of these}} urbanisation processes on the population structure and the geography of political behaviour. The dynamics of the population structure was measuerd with an adapted social area analysis method for the whole country. The expansion of the urban space in Switzerland was followed by the diffusion of urban lifestyles into the suburban and rural areas and the formation of quartered metropolitan areas. While the existing sociospatial structures of the large agglomerations are still dependent of the economic and cultural context, the patterns of ongoing processes of periurbanisation, gentrification and marginalisation are independent of the context. The geography of political behaviour was measured with results of popular referenda. A strong homology between the sociodemographic and political topography could be observed. The parallels between sociodemographic changes and change of political behaviour are obvious. <b>Reurbanisation</b> is mirrored in the appearance of a typicalurban left-liberal mentality. The consequences of gentrification and marginalisation are a political divergence between former working-class areas. Unlike the processes of socio-spatial change, which are independent of the cultural context the dynamics of the political geography in urban areas differs between Francophone and Swiss German agglomerations...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{point for}} this {{dissertation}} is {{the phenomenon of}} a “renaissance of the urban” or “reurbanisation” {{and the question of}} what consequences may arise from this trend concerning mobility and travel demand within urban areas. Besides that the thesis draws on the discussion on residential self-selection and the question to which extend spatial differences in travel behaviour may be attributed to the built environment directly or are results of attitude- / preference-induced residential location choices. The opening question of the dissertation thus is, whether <b>reurbanisation</b> is the result of travel oriented residential self-selection and vice versa what role accessibility may play within strategies to strengthen <b>reurbanisation.</b> In this context the main aim is to analyse the effects of residential self-selection on travel mode choice on two levels. On an individual level it is analysed whether <b>reurbanisation</b> is in part a result of residential self-selection and which effects on travel behaviour arise from that. On the collective level it is explored whether a group of “intentional urbanites” exists and how they vary from other groups of urban dwellers in terms of travel related attitudes and preferences. The analyses on both levels are based on extensive statistical data derived from a survey on location choice (comprising travel related attitudes and location preferences) and travel mode choice among “movers” (2. 513 households with 5. 126 individuals) in three German cities. The dataset contains cross-sectional data as well as quasi-longitudinal data from the time prior to location choice. On the individual level the effects of residential self-selection are assessed by means of statistical control within binary logistic regression models on location as well as travel mode choice. The identification of intentional urbanites is based upon a classification which draws on the concept of spatial match / mismatch. The logistic regression models on location choice provide evidence that choosing an inner city location is to a significant extent result of travel or accessibility related preferences and thus that self-selection is at work. Not surprisingly, especially households which prefer location where shops, working places etc. are in walking or biking distance have a high probability to self-select into inner urban areas. It can be concluded that <b>reurbanisation</b> is at least partly the result of travel related self-selection and that therefore specific urban accessibility qualities are an important urban asset to “fuel” <b>reurbanisation.</b> Furthermore the models prove the expected direct and indirect effects of residential self-selection on travel mode choice. Firstly the travel related location preferences have a strong direct effect on mode choice even when controlling for built environment and individual characteristics. Secondly it can be concluded that also indirect effects of location preferences via the built environment characteristics of the self-selected living location are existing. Based on the above mentioned classification a consonant group of “intentional urbanites” is identified and distinguished from other citizen groups namely “other urbanites” and “suburbanites”. The intentional urbanites represent about one third of the overall sample and two thirds of the inner city sample and thus are a relevant group for the development of travel demand. Compared with the other citizen groups a clear profile of the intentional urbanites concerning location preferences, travel related attitudes, car ownership as well as travel mode choice can be distinguished which is in line with the results on the individual level. Compared with other urbanites the Intentional urbanites a) have a stronger location preference for good short range accessibilities, b) have a significantly lower car ownership rate (before and after moving), c) show a significantly higher positive evaluation of attitudes on cycling as well as public transport (without negative evaluations of attitudes concerning car use), d) have a significantly higher share of bicycle trips and lower share of car trips, e) show a more multimodal behaviour. Therefore the intentional urbanites are a considerable potential for a sustainable development of urban mobility and travel demand. To make use of the potential active and consistent planning strategies have to be implemented. Besides focussing on mobility rather than traffic an adequate planning approach aims on creating dense, functionally diverse living environments and high quality transportation systems resulting in excellent accessibilities as well as providing attractive street design which promote the use of environmentally friendly travel modes. Besides that the results show that such strategies have to be accompanied by demand oriented measures. An integrated policy approach may then promote further self-selection and subsequently support <b>reurbanisation...</b>|$|E

As a consequence {{of political and economic}} transition increased social differentiation resulted in increased social segregation in urban areas. Some areas such as high-rise housing estates and part of older inner city areas were affected by social degradation and concentration of low-income population and ethnical minorities.

40|$|Brussels, {{originally}} {{an industrial}} city, {{has become an}} administrative centre, generating a series of disaffected areas. Sustainable development policies aim to improve {{the standard of living}} through urban, social and economical enhancements. Indeed, these policies are considering the construction, the renovation and the requalification of obsolete areas into new dwelling centres. In this context, the present paper shows the results of a broader research commissioned by the Brussels Capital Region, on the residential densification between 1989 and 2007. Through the analysis of this inventory, we have identified two main techniques concerning the rehabilitation of old places into residential uses: firstly the requalification of isolated buildings and secondly the <b>reurbanisation</b> of brownfields. Following two methodological approaches (morphological observation and analysis of social perception), this research has shown us that, in the last twenty years of housing production in Brussels, the main abandoned buildings and sites that were available were requalified increasing density and improving urbanity through the diversity of urban forms relating to public and private spaces...|$|E

However, the effects of urban growth have been limited mainly to the cores of second-tier cities, creating new challenges in the urban fringe of city regions and for cities outside the major agglomerations.

40|$|Summary. The {{past two}} decades have seen {{profound}} changes in European patterns of demo-graphic behaviour, family formation and household structure. One aspect of the `second demo-graphic transition ’ is the appearance of new and more varied household forms, especially in the large cities. Data are analysed here for France’s 10 largest cities for the period 1975 ± 90, with particular reference to their central areas. While some continue to experience population decline through out-migration, for most the 1980 s saw a reversal of their demographic fortunes, thus adding further evidence to the hypothesis of <b>reurbanisation</b> observed elsewhere. Analysis of household change shows large increases in numbers in most cities, even where overall population is declining. Households are becoming smaller, with up to 75 per cent of households in central cities consisting of 1 or 2 persons. The increase in 1 -person households, to which particular attention is paid in this paper, has been rapid. The paper also demonstrates the decline in `traditional families ’ in the cities. The rise of living alone is linked to age, gender, social status and ethnicity, with young professionals, especially women, {{at the cutting edge}} of household change. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{reintegration}} of the urban system new settlements are emerging on the urban rim, transitional zones are reurbanised, derelict areas within the cities are being deve-loped and degraded urban areas of derelict industrial complexes are being renaturalised. In the periphery combined research and production parks are being set up, in the open land-scape integrated business, trade and recreational centres are springing up. Decentralisation and recentralisation of focal points of development accompany the contemporary processes of <b>reurbanisation</b> and suburbanisation – they are simultaneous and move in two-direction i. e. {{to and from the}} city. We understand them as manifestation of a dynamic balance among contradiction existing between the centre and the rim. Deindustrialisation and relocation of production and distribution from the centres of gravity to the periphery generate extensive degraded urban areas within cities and between the city and suburbs. The periphery is being urbanised with the creation of new, dispersed and nonhierachical poles of development, and the city and inner city is undergoing reurbanization. The general environmental conditions in the city and in the countryside are being equalised, the potentials of development are being sought in the comparative advantages of local conditions: be it attractive urban dis-tricts, be it suburban entities or countryside areas...|$|E
40|$|Stimulated by the European {{integration}} process, {{the need}} for high-grade transport connections between the major European urban agglomerations is growing. Coinciding with the <b>reurbanisation</b> efforts of the major cities, the high-speed train (HST) is eminently suitable to fill that need, as it essentially connects urban centres, and is relatively environment-friendly. The authors set out to analyse how the HST can make an optimum contribution {{to the development of}} welfare in urban regions. The paper is based on an international comparative investigation in fourteen European cities: Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brno, Brussels, Cologne, Geneva, Li�ge, Lille, Lyons, Marseilles, Nantes, Rotterdam, Strasbourg, and Turin. Some criteria have been derived for the successful integration of the HST system in an urban area: accessibility, economic potential, the quality of the living environment, a balanced spatial distribution of activities, a balanced social distribution of effects, and organising capacity. HST integration should contribute to harmonious long-term urban development, and a balance should therefore be struck between, among other elements, internal accessibility {{and the quality of the}} living environment. There is no such thing as a standard solution for optimum HST integration in a city. Each individual city must take account of its own spatial-economic structure and the criteria identified to find out what solution will contribute most to a balanced development of urban welfare. A clear vision of and a well-considered strategy for HST integration remains essential, in order not to lose out on the profitable prospects of economic development opened to the urban region. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the patterns}} of internal migration and population change across the communes of Denmark {{as part of a}} multi-country study of regional population dynamics in Europe, comparing the 1980 s and 1990 s. Section 2 of the report reviews the recent history of internal migration and regional/local population change in Denmark. Section 3 documents data sources and structure. Section 4 provides a detailed cartographic analysis of {{the patterns of}} in-migration, out-migration and net-migration at commune level for 1985 and 1998 (the years selected for study), while section 5 reviews population change between 1985 and 1998. Overall net migration shifts have decreased between the two years. The spatial pattern combines losses from peripheral regions (western Jutland, Bornholm) and Copehagen suburbs with gains to commuting belts centred on Copenhagen and the other large towns. As many other high income European countries, there is a profound contrast between the migration behaviour of young people and other adults (families, older workers and the retired). Young people move strongly towards the centre of the capital region and other large towns, while the other groups deconcentrate. Section 6 analyses the relationships between net migration/population change and the settlement system, to calibrate more precisely the patterns observed on the maps, while sections 7 and 8 look at the relationships between internal migration and economic/functional classifications of the communes. The former relationships are stronger than the latter, but are not as well clearly structured with respect to the urban hierarchy or population density as in many other countries studied. Denmark has reached a system state beyond simple counterurbanisation to be characterised by periurbanisation in the Copenhagen region, <b>reurbanisation</b> in Copenhagen itself and moderate outflows from rural regions...|$|E
