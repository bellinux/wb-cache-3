2500|$|The 1 Ton 109inch was {{produced}} from 1968 to 1977, covering late IIA and series III Models. It {{was basically a}} Series IIB Forward Control built with a standard 109in body, featuring 2.6-litre petrol engine, lower <b>ratio</b> <b>gearbox,</b> ENV front and rear axles, (Salisbury front and rear on later Series IIIs) though some late IIAs were fitted with ENV axles in front and Salisbury on the rear. Later series IIIs had a Rover type front axle with uprated differential. The chassis frame was unique to the model and featured drop-shackle suspension similar to the military series Land Rovers. 900x16 tyres were a standard feature and these machines were commonly used by utility companies and breakdown/recovery firms. [...] Only 170 IIA and 238 Series IIIs (1 Ton) were built for the home market. Export markets had even fewer examples, making {{this one of the}} rarest types of Land-Rover ever built.|$|E

The wiring for ABS, A/C, power mirrors, power windows, power locks, and sunroof was removed. Instead of using the GTR's leather interior, the lighter cloth interior of the GTX was used.|$|R

In Brazil, Ford offered the 1,600 cc version with its Corcel II in 1980, which later offered an ethanol version of this engine with a 12:1 compression <b>ratio.</b> <b>Gearboxes</b> were four-speed manuals until 1988, and five-speed boxes thereafter. The R12 had a slightly higher status in this country than other places, {{given the fact that}} the Argentine Renault cars lineup was narrow at the time (R4, R6 and Renault Torino). This caused the factory to add extras such as air conditioning and quality upholstery to close the gap between this car and the Torino until the arrival of the R18 in 1982. For this same reason, virtually all of the estate models (Break) were built with the TS's mechanical and comfort features.|$|R
50|$|A close <b>ratio</b> <b>gearbox</b> {{combined}} with a high lift camshaft made for lively acceleration and performance at higher rpm than the standard A65. The bottom gear was a bit high, however, so riders {{had to learn to}} slip the clutch up to 10 mph. Above 5000 rpm customers also complained about excessive vibration, with a tendency to weave above 90 mph.|$|E
50|$|Other key {{improvements}} over the TR3 included a wider track front and rear, slightly larger standard engine displacement, full synchromesh on all forward gears, and {{rack and pinion}} steering. In addition, the optional Laycock de Normanville electrically operated overdrive could now be selected for second and third gears as well as fourth, effectively providing the TR4 with a seven-speed manual close <b>ratio</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|E
