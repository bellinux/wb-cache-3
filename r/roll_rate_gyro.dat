50|$|The fourth launch was K-26 on April 30, which {{carried a}} Milstar {{communications}} satellite. During the Centaur's flight, an uncontrolled roll motion developed, causing the upper stage and payload rotate at ever-increasing rate. This threw the stage off course {{so when it}} came time for restart, the Centaur cartwheeled out of control and left its payload in a useless orbit. This failure was found to be the result of an incorrectly programmed equation in the guidance computer. The error caused the <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> data to be ignored by the flight computer, resulting in open-loop firing of the roll control thrusters until the RCS fuel was depleted.|$|E

40|$|High angle-of-attack flight regime {{research}} {{is currently being}} conducted for modern fighter aircraft at the NASA Ames Research Center's Dryden Flight Research Facility. This flight regime provides enhanced maneuverability to fighter pilots in combat situations. Flight research data are being acquired to compare and validate advanced computational fluid dynamic solutions and wind-tunnel models. High angle-of-attack flight creates unique aerodynamic phenomena including wing rock and buffet on the airframe. These phenomena increase the level of excitation of the structural modes, especially on the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. With high gain digital flight-control systems, this structural response may result in an aeroservoelastic interaction. A structural interaction on the X- 29 A aircraft was observed during high angle-of-attack flight testing. The <b>roll</b> and yaw <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> sensed the aircraft's structural modes at 11, 13, and 16 Hz. The <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> output signals were then amplified through the flight-control laws and sent as commands to the flaperons and rudder. The flight data indicated that as the angle of attack increased, the amplitude of the buffet on the vertical stabilizer increased, which resulted in more excitation to the structural modes. The flight-control system sensors and command signals showed this increase in modal power at the structural frequencies up to a 30 degree angle-of-attack. Beyond a 30 degree angle-of-attack, the vertical stabilizer response, the feedback sensor amplitude, and control surface command signal amplitude remained relatively constant. Data are presented that show the increased modal power in the aircraft structural accelerometers, the feedback sensors, and the command signals {{as a function of}} angle of attack. This structural interaction is traced from the aerodynamic buffet to the flight-control surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this report, is to {{evaluate}} feasibility of using The Global Positioning System as an aiding tool for vehicle state estimation based on nonlinear techniques, {{and to develop a}} potential solution to the road bank angle problem. Previous work within the CEmACS project, includes development of a general nonlinear observer for lateral and longitudinal velocity, and an augmentation in the form of road-tire friction adaptation. Because the existing solutions have been shown to lack robustness with regards to certain disturbances, such as road grade and road bank angle, it has been stated that the estimation scheme should be upgraded, so that these disturbances can be accounted for. By including GPS velocity or a or a <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> measurement in the observer feedback loop, the possibility of detecting previously inobservable quantities is gained. In simple terms, evaluation of feasibility corresponds to demonstrating improvements and limitations of new solutions, using relatively crude methods in the test procedures. Problems related to the above mentioned task, are approached by means of signal processing and control theory. Following an intuitive sequence of operations, the report presents GPS theory and results first, as this lays the foundation for all subsequent results. Methods used comprise simple differentiaton, rotational kinematics and discrete filtering. Secondly, theory and results related to nonlinear observers, with focus on GPS aiding, are examined thoroughly. Lyapunov theory, known from control engineering, is used to evaluate stability, while data from simulations and actual vehicle tests is used to show how a new observer scheme can improve existing solutions. Before the most important results are presented, something should be said about their accuracy and significance. It has already been pointed out that the methods used are not based on optimality requirements, and consequently the results are best viewed as indicators of potential, rather than absolute solutions. This is especially true for the GPS velocity calculations, which are based on differentiation of position measurements; generally not a desired approach. In this report, it is firstly shown that GPS position measurements can be used to compute receiver velocity in the body-fixed coordinate frame. While this is a crude approach, resulting in relatively poor signal to noise ratio, it is easily implemented on low-level equipment. It is also shown {{that it is possible to}} use these velocities as measurements in a nonlinear observer structure, slightly modified from previous solutions within the CEmACS project. By doing this, accurate estimates of road grade and bank v angle are achieved, so long as these vary slowly enough. Stability of the observer is not proven in the general sense, but it is shown that it can be made stable through realistic assumptions and gain selection. Stability is further demonstrated through the use of data sets from actual vehicle tests. Secondly, a mathematical model of roll dynamics is combined with a roll rate measurement to create the possibility of detecting road bank angle. This is done by the now familiar nonlinear observer approach. Usefulness is demonstrated by simulations, but no stability proof is presented. The main conclusion is that it is feasible to use GPS aiding to account for robustness problems in a vehicle state estimation scheme, and that the inclusion of a roll rate measurement opens up possibilities for 9 ̆ 3 cheap 9 ̆ 4 bank angle detection. A direct implementation of results presented in the report may not be ideal, but the fact that the system works for a large set of conditions, suggests that it is worthwhile to develop it further. This is especially true when it is assumed that GPS receivers will become an integral part of new vehicles in the near future. Refinements and upgrades can be made in the form of more advanced GPS technology, new parameter estimation techniques and integration with the road-tire friction adaptation scheme...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple system}} {{composed}} of a single axis accelerometer or inclinometer, an inexpensive solid-state <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> and a micro-controller is explored as a predictive rollover sensor. Inclinometers or accelerometers alone cannot predict rollover due {{to the effects of}} lateral forces during turns. These forces cause such systems to over estimate the roll angle of the vehicle by a wide margin, resulting in false alarms and rendering them useless. Inexpensive solid-state <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> are likewise not up to the task because of large variations in the bias both under temperature and parametric variations. Using both of these sensors along with proprietary algorithms similar to those developed for the Archangel Air Data Attitude Heading Reference System (ADAHRS) for aviation, a successful predictive system can be constructed. Using Fuzzy Logic Adaptive Signal Processing (FLASP) algorithms, the drift is removed from the gyro in real time without extensive calibrations or modeling and the effects of lateral forces are removed from the accelerometer/inclinometer. This results in a system possessing redundant and, therefore, highly reliable information concerning both the <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> and angle of the vehicle. The efficacy of this method is clearly demonstrated by the flight proven Archangel ADAHRS used in aircraft. In the system, the combination of the <b>roll</b> <b>rate</b> and angle are used to predict an impending rollover up to 500 ms in advance 1. This information used in conjunction with an active yaw control system could be used to prevent the rollover.

40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{attitude}} estimation {{device is}} proposed utilizing cost-effective measurement sensors. The device fuses a rate gyroscope with an accelerometer array to estimate {{and eliminate the}} <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> bias online yielding accurate real time aircraft attitude tracking. Attitude determination algorithms are dependent on instantaneous and accurate measurements of translational and rotational body rates for precise estimation of vehicle orientation in three-dimensional space. Measurement error of instantaneous rate sensors, gyroscopes, is introduced via inherent biases and signal noise resulting in gyro drift. Integration of the rate signal for calculation of a net displacement amplifies these minute measurement errors leading to inaccurate and unreliable attitude observation. The proposed device is a departure from typical attitude observers and bias estimators due to its reliance on accelerometers measuring the local gravitational vector in lieu of additional magnetic field sensors or GPS. The end result of this work is a longitudinal attitude estimation device able to compute a <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> bias in real-time producing accurate pitch angle tracking while subjected to simulated aircraft flight conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology for designing a low-cost attitude and heading estimation system which {{is composed of}} three single-axis <b>rate</b> <b>gyros,</b> a tri-axis accelerometer, and a tri-axis magnetometer. <b>Rate</b> <b>gyro</b> sensor we have chosen is a small relatively inexpensive piezoelectric vibrating <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> originally developed for the automobile market and active suspension systems by Murata. It generates voltage output proportional to the angular velocity of the vehicle around the principal axis of the device. Accelerometer is a tri-axis digital output linear accelerometer developed by ST that includes a sensing element and an IC interface {{able to take the}} information from the sensing element and to provide the measured acceleration signals to the external world through an I 2 C/SPI interface. Magnetometer is an integrated tri-axis magnetic field sensing module manufactured by PNI. It is used to measure Earth?셲 magnetic field. SPI interface allows easy access to its measurement parameters and resulting field measurement data. Output signals coming from these sensors are fused through two Kalman filters. One Kalman filter is used to estimate roll and pitch angles and the other is for heading angle estimation. By using this method, we have obtained attitude (roll and pitch angle) and heading information which are reliable over long period of time. Results from a set of simulation works have shown the performance of the presented method.

Instrumentation included an inertial measurement unit, a GPS, and a 3 -axis sonic anemometer. ^ Before flight, the inertial measurement unit was calibrated for rotation rate, temperature, and acceleration. Each of these calibrations was linear. ^ The dynamic modes were estimated based on aircraft geometry, mass, and moments of inertia. For the short period pitch, Dutch roll, and roll modes, the estimates were compared to results from flight and were found to match. The Phugoid and spiral modes were found to be impractical to flight test due to space constraints and atmospheric turbulence, respectively. The low wing loading of the UAV strengthened the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> data. ^ The Euler angles were calculated from <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> data and compared to other measurement or calculation methods, including a ground-based video camera and equations using GPS and sonic anemometer data. It was found that roll and pitch angle errors fluctuate around zero due to coupling between the Euler angle equations. Yaw angle, however, does not exhibit this behavior. It was established that Euler angle drift rates of less than 6 °/s can be achieved through calculation from <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> and that better results may be obtained by updating the Euler angles with outside sources of information. ^ The angles of attack and sideslip angles were calculated from <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> and GPS data and compared to sonic anemometer calculations.
