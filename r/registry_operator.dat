On 8 November 2005 ICANN adopted 2 a consensus policy developed by its Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) concerning the review and approval of requests by gTLD <b>registry</b> <b>operators</b> for new <b>registry</b> services. 3 This policy was implemented on 25 July 2006 4 as the Registry Services Evaluation Policy. 5 The policy provides for the evaluation of a proposed registry service by a team of experts selected from a standing Registry Service Technical Evaluation Panel (RSTEP) 6 when ICANN determines that the service could raise significant security or stability issues. The process begins with a preliminary determination by ICANN that an RSTEP review is or is not required for a particular proposed registry service. 7 If ICANN determines that a review is required, an RSTEP review team investigates and evaluates the proposed service with respect to its potential impact on security or stability, as defined by th...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of the architecture of the Internet is the Domain Name System (DNS), which is administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Logically, the DNS is organized into Top Level Domains (such as. com), Second Level Domains (such as amazon. com), and third, fourth, and higher level domains (such as www. amazon. com). The physically infrastructure of the DNS consists of name servers, including the Root Server System which provides the information that directs name queries for each Top Level Domain to the appropriate server. ICANN is responsible for the allocation of the root and the creation or reallocation of Top Level Domains. The Root Server System and associated name space are scarce resources in the economic sense. The root servers have a finite capacity and expansion of the system is costly. The name space is scarce, because each string (or set of characters) can only be allocated to one <b>Registry</b> (or <b>operator</b> of a Top Level Domain). In addition, name service is not a public good in the economic sense, because it is possible to exclude strings from the DNS and because the allocation of a string to one firm results in the inability of other firms to use that name string. From the economic perspective, therefore, the question arises: what is the most efficient method for allocating the root resource? There are only five basic options available for allocation of the root. (1) a static root, equivalent to a decision to waste the currently unallocated capacity; (2) public interest hearings (or beauty contests); (3) lotteries; (4) a queuing mechanism; or (5) an auction. The fundamental economic question about the Domain Name System is which of these provides the most efficient mechanism for allocating the root resource? This resource allocation problem is analogous to problems raised in the telecommunications sector, where the Federal Communications Commission {{has a long history of}} attempting to allocate broadcast spectrum and the telephone number space. This experience reveals that a case-by-case allocation on the basis of ad hoc judgments about the public interest is doomed to failure, and that auctions (as opposed to lotteries or queues) provide the best mechanism for insuring that such public-trust resources find their highest and best use. Based on the telecommunications experience, the best method for ICANN to allocate new Top Level Domains would be to conduct an auction. Many auction designs are possible. One proposal is to auction a fixed number of new Top Level Domain slots each year. This proposal would both expand the root resource at a reasonable pace and insure that the slots went to their highest and best use. Public interest Top Level Domains could be allocated by another mechanism such as a lottery and their costs to ICANN could be subsidized by the proceeds of the auction. ...|$|R
40|$|Web breaks are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most significant runnability problems in a pressroom. This work concerns the analysis of relation between various parameters (variables) characterizing the paper, printing press, the printing process and the web break occurrence. A large number of variables, 61 in total, obtained off-line as well as measured online during the printing process are used in the investigation. Each paper reel is characterized by a vector x of 61 components. Two main approaches are explored. The first one treats the problem as a data classification task into "break" and "non break" classes. The procedures of classifier training, the selection of relevant input variables and the selection of hyper-parameters of the classifier are aggregated into one process based on genetic search. The second approach combines procedures of genetic search based variable selection and data mapping into a low dimensional space. The genetic search process results into a variable set providing the best mapping according to some quality function. The empirical study was performed using data collected at a pressroom in Sweden. The total number of data points available for the experiments was equal to 309. Amongst those, only 37 data points represent the web break cases. The results of the investigations have shown that the linear relations between the independent variables and the web break frequency are not strong. Three important groups of variables were identified, namely Lab data (variables characterizing paper properties and measured off-line in a paper mill lab), Ink <b>registry</b> (variables characterizing <b>operator</b> actions aimed to adjust ink registry) and Web tension. We found that the most important variables are: Ink registry Y LS MD (adjustments of yellow ink registry in machine direction on the lower paper side), Air permeability (character- izes paper porosity), Paper grammage, Elongation MD, and four variables characterizing web tension: Moment mean, Min sliding Mean, Web tension variance, and Web tension mean. The proposed methods were helpful in finding the variables influencing the occurrence of web breaks and can also be used for solving other industrial problems...|$|R
