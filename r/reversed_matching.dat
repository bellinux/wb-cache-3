30|$|This test {{indicates}} that the style descriptor selection process drastically improves the mix consistency and its perceived quality, with 17 out of 18 evaluators preferring that mix (p value 7.25 × 10 − 5). Figure  12 a also shows that the mix with the style descriptor received higher ratings on average (an average rating of 3.89 versus 2.39 respectively). The ODF matching mix was also preferred more often than the <b>reversed</b> <b>matching</b> scenario, but the distinction is less clear (10 out of 15 evaluators 2, p value 0.151, and an average rating of 3.76 versus 3.41 respectively). The user tests also resulted in valuable qualitative feedback 3. The first mix with all DJ features was received very well. Compared to the second mix (style-agnostic track selection), it {{was said to be}} “more consistent,”“tunes that match in style and feel,” that it had “more continuity” and less dissonance. The mix with style-agnostic track selection was critiqued as being “too rushed,” changing too much between sub-genres and that it “sounded like a DJ that was occasionally just throwing tunes into the mix without much thought.” Only one user preferred the second mix over the first, because “it incorporates more vocals, this makes me think that it {{is more likely to be}} made by a human.” The transition quality for the second set of mixes was more or less the same according to many participants, which {{indicates that}} selecting songs based on ODF similarity might not significantly influence the mix quality. Nevertheless, as there is a slight preference towards the ODF-based selection, this feature is kept in the DJ system. Other informal feedback {{indicates that the}} key detection algorithm and the vocal activity detection might need improvement, as some users noticed bad harmonic mixing or vocal clashes in some transitions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{relation}} {{among three}} classes of combinatorial objects parametrized by partitions is discussed: the branching flag is a tree-type generalization {{of the flag}} in a vector space over a finite field; the branching nest is its finite set-theoretical counterpart; and the <b>reverse</b> <b>matching,</b> equinumerous to branching nests, is a dual concept of the complete matching. A mapping will be constructed of the set of branching flags into that of branching nests, which will give a decomposition {{of the variety of}} branching flags into cells parametrized by reverse matchings. Its Poincaré polynomial is related to a refinement of q-Stirling numbers...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} paper, a new framework is proposed {{to increase the}} total number of correct matches for stereo correspondence using tri-stereo images. The research work investigates some of the less explored properties of Disparity Space Image (DSI), and considers the local maxima in addition to the global maximum of the cost function and propose a new tri-stereo matching method as Modified Dual Winner Takes All (MDWTA) using edges of disparity space image. Conventionally using a single DSI from a stereo pair optimization techniques are applied to get the disparity, whereas the proposed approach uses Winner Takes All (WTA) approach using two DSIs from a triplet. The dual property of DSI that is {{the manner in which it}} stores cost for rows and columns for forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>matching</b> is introduced. This property is applied to check consistency for forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>matching</b> in a single pass, which gives initial correct matches. Next a left-centre-right consistency check is applied to discard inconsistent disparities obtained from these three views. Subsequently to obtain disparity for gaps thus generated a rule is formulated using local maxima, edges and adjacent global maximum to find correct disparity. Evaluation of the results obtained is carried by comparing them with block matching WTA method and other recent methods such as, Dynamic Programming (DP) and Semi-Global Matching (SGM) applied on images from Terrain Mapping Camera of Chandrayaan- 1 and PRISM sensor of the ALOS mission. Methodology proposed is also verified using standard Middlebury stereo dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives an increased number of correct matches by 10 - 15 % as compared to basic WTA and DP. However the results obtained are better to SGM for certain regions and features...|$|R
40|$|An {{essential}} goal {{in medical}} image registration is, the forward and reverse mapping matrices should be inverse to each other, i. e., inverse consistent. Conventional approaches enforce such consistency in deterministic fashions, either through incorporation of sub-objective cost function to impose consistent property during the registration process or by construction of consistent mapping on predetermined landmarks sets. Assuming {{that the initial}} forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>matching</b> matrices have been computed and used as the inputs to our system, this paper presents a stochastic framework which yields perfect consistent registration. During the optimization process to reach the perfect consistency, we model the errors of the registration matrices and the imperfectness of the consistent constraint as stochastic processes. An iterative generalized total least square (GTLS) strategy has been developed so that consistency is optimally imposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a set of {{algorithms}} that combine the anisotropic smoothing using the heat kernel with the outlier rejection capability of robust statistics. The proposed algorithms are applied on structural vector flows that model the internal shape variation in volumetric images. The 3 D shapes are represented by sparse cross-sections along the main axis of the object. The dual directional block matching algorithm is used to initially extract the structural flows. This algorithm uses block matching between pixel blocks from consecutive images representing sparse cross-sections through a volume. Two flows are produced using forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>matching</b> along the main axis of the 3 D object. After smoothing, the structural flows are used for slice interpolation. Experimental results provide a comparison among the given algorithms when used for digital 3 D reconstruction of an incisor and of two human bones...|$|R

40|$|Recently, we {{introduced}} a new congestion signaling method called ACK Spoofing, which offers significant benefits over existing methods, such as packet dropping and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). Since ACK Spoofing requires the router to create a “short circuit” signaling path, by matching marked data packets in a congested buffer with ACK packets belonging to the same flow that are traveling in the opposite direction, {{the focus of this}} paper is evaluating the feasibility of <b>reverse</b> flow <b>matching.</b> First, we study the behavior of individual flows from real bi-directional Internet traces to show that ACK Spoofing has the potential to significantly reduce the signaling latency for Internet core routers. We then show that <b>reverse</b> flow <b>matching</b> can be implemented at reasonable cost, using essentially the same hardware as the packet filtering logic commonly employed in Layer 2 transparent bridges. Finally, we show that this architecture can be scaled to accommodate worst-case traffic patterns on multi-gigabit links that would render ordinary route caching algorithms completely ineffective...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{focus on}} multicriteria {{preference}} elicitation by matching. In this widely employed task, {{the decision maker}} (DM) is presented with two multicriteria options, a and b, and must assess the performance value on one criterion for b, left blank, so that she is indifferent between the two options. A <b>reverse</b> <b>matching,</b> which is normatively equivalent, can be created by integrating {{the answer to the}} description of b and letting the DM adjust a performance value on the previously totally specified option a. Such a procedure is called a bi-matching. Consistency requires that isopreferences resulting from the forward and backward matchings be identical, but they empirically differ in a systematic direction. In a matching task, multicriteria conflict refers to the magnitude of the advantage or disadvantage to be compensated. We investigate the effect of the multicriteria conflict, or trade-off size, on the difference of judgement between forward and backward matchings. We observed that the difference of judgement is increased both by multicriteria conflict and by asking deteriorating rather than improving judgements at both steps of the bi-matching. We derive some implications for the practice of preference elicitation...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{improvements}} in microelectronics performance and signal processing techniques have positively impacted development in NDE techniques specifically also {{with regard to}} aeronautical applications. Composite materials such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) have gained increasing application in aerospace {{over the past years}} and decades. Their primary advantage is their strength to-weight ratio. It is of parallel importance to ensure the quality of structures made from CFRP in production as well as in service. Ultrasonic non-destructive testing of CFRP is not always easy due to the anisotropic properties it exhibits. This can result in faulty defect sizing and image artefacts while ultrasonic testing.
