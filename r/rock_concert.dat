After his original plan of mixing the band with assorted paintings had been rejected, Maben went on holiday to Naples in the early summer.|$|E
50|$|The term 'rock concert' is also {{occasionally}} used {{to refer}} to live performances by distinctly non-rock acts. Live performances by pop, hip-hop, and R&B bands may not be <b>rock</b> <b>concerts</b> in the strictest sense, but they are often referred to as <b>rock</b> <b>concerts</b> regardless. These performances typically share many characteristics with <b>rock</b> <b>concerts,</b> such as an overall party atmosphere.|$|R

Such concerts were {{crucial to the}} {{formation}} of youth identity in the U.S. during a time of social revolution, and have continued to represent elements of society frequently seen as [...] "rebellious," [...] especially against the strictures of mid-twentieth-century social normativities. One of the most well-known <b>rock</b> <b>concerts</b> was undoubtedly Woodstock, and millions of much smaller <b>rock</b> <b>concerts</b> go on every year.|$|R

Taylor's and McGuinness' original plans were to feature the video on The Tube, but trade unions objected to their limited representation on the concert crew. However, a compromise was reached, allowing 15 minutes of the concert to be broadcast on The Tube.|$|E
5|$|The Broadcast and Video Production {{department}} {{is designed to}} teach students about the television industry.

5|$|Wall, {{along with}} Tommy Tallarico, has {{produced}} the Video Games Live concert series, which began on July 6, 2005. The two had been planning the concert series, which presents orchestrated versions of music from dozens of games, for three years. The concerts consist of segments of video game music performed by a live orchestra with video footage and synchronized lighting and effects, {{as well as several}} interactive segments with the audience, conducted by Wall. Video Games Live was intended to take the idea of a symphonic video game music concert, which was popular in Japan, and combine it with a <b>rock</b> <b>concert</b> to make it appealing to western fans. The series is international and ongoing, with more than 70 shows planned for 2009. Although Wall composed the soundtracks to three games released in 2005 including the award-winning score to Jade Empire, his works released since then have been 2007's Mass Effect and 2010's Mass Effect 2. Mass Effects score earned Wall several awards and nominations, as did Mass Effect 2.|$|E
