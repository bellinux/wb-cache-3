40|$|Scope : Bioprocessing {{of whole}} grain cereals {{may affect the}} {{bioavailability}} of phytochemicals associated with grain fiber and ultimately lead to different health outcomes. Here, we studied the impact of long-term feeding with intact and bioprocessed <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> on the urinary phytochemical profile of mice. Methods and results : Non-targeted HILIC-ESI-qTOF-MS metabolite profiling approach was applied on urine samples collected from 3 groups of diet-induced obese mice fed for 8 weeks {{with one of the}} three diets: high-fat (HF) control diet, HF diet enriched with intact <b>rye</b> <b>bran,</b> or HF diet enriched with bioprocessed <b>rye</b> <b>bran.</b> The most striking finding was the increased urinary excretion of several amino-acid derived betaines after both rye diets. These included proline betaine, alanine betaine, valine betaine, phenylalanine betaine, pipecolic acid betaine, and trigonelline, but not glycine betaine. Furthermore, bioprocessing may have improved the bioavailability of rye derived phytochemicals, as higher increase in e. g. ferulic acid and benzoxazinoid metabolites were observed in urine of mice fed with bioprocessed than intact <b>rye</b> <b>bran.</b> Conclusion : Urinary excretion of various betaines was greatly increased in mice fed rye brans. Furthermore, bioprocessing of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> appears to serve as a beneficial way to improve the bioavailability of various phytochemicals...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{evaluation}} {{was performed}} to investigate how size and concentration of small <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> particles in a continuous phase with varying viscosity influence the sensory perception of grittiness. The threshold for the sensation of grittiness of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> particles in a starch gel, evaluated by triangular sensory tests, was very low. The particles were discerned at a concentration of 0. 1 - 0. 3 %, {{despite the fact that}} they were very small (20 - 180 m). The sensory panel was able to detect the increase in particle concentration in a ranking test, but the ability to detect the increase in concentration was not influenced by particle size. The rheological properties of the medium did not influence the detection threshold. Practical ApplicationsDue to health benefits, addition of dietary fiber in food products is popular. <b>Rye</b> <b>bran</b> is a by-product, which is very high in dietary fiber, and for which new applications are requested. <b>Rye</b> <b>bran</b> consists mainly of insoluble dietary fiber and the <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> particles are hard and irregular in shape. To understand the oral sensitivity of these kinds of particles is important to avoid the negative sensation of grittiness of dietary fiber fortified products. Since it was shown that even the size fraction of 20 m was perceived as gritty at very low concentrations (0. 2 - 0. 3 %), the milling technique is probably not the solution to reduce the grittiness. Preferably a way of making the particles softer, with less sharp edges should be sought, at least if the <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> is going to be added to a smooth food matrix of a starch gel...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rye</b> <b>bran</b> {{contains}} dietary fiber, and lipids. Unsaturated {{fatty acids}} make <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> products vulnerable to oxidation and formation of off-flavor. High level of dietary fiber gives <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> a rough {{feel in the}} mouth. Therefore, extrusion was chosen to make <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> products more appealing to consumers. The literature review covered flavor of rye, lipids in rye, lipid oxidation in cereals, extrusion of cereals, and principles of the HS-SPME-GC-MS method. The aim of this thesis was to study stability of lipids of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> during the extrusion process using different extrusion parameters, and the stability of extrudates during storage. Four experiments were carried out. The first three were to analyze the effect of extrusion die temperature (80, 100, 120 and 140 °C), water content of the <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> feed (13, 16, 22, and 30 %) and particle size of the <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> (633 ± 13 and 15 ± 1 ?m). In the last experiment, five most interesting samples were selected from the previous three experiments and reproduced. A stabilization of relative humidity was conducted. HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis was run after stabilization to determine effects of the parameters on the initial quality of extrudates, and then every two weeks till the 10 -week time point. In total of 88 (max.) volatile compounds were detected. Among them, 30 volatiles were selected for further study based on peak areas at first, mainly lipid oxidation and Maillard reaction products (MRPs) : aldehydes, furans and pyrazines. PCAs analyzing the extrudates were run with the 30 compounds as variables. Ten volatiles appeared {{to have a significant}} effect on the PCA model. From the first experiment, extrusion temperature of extrusion die had a small effect on the oxidation stability. The indicator of oxidation, hexanal, of all samples had almost the same level at initial point (around 3. 0 * 107 counts/s). The increasing tendency during storage was also similar. MRPs were more likely to appear in the extrudates produced at higher temperature (140 °C). From the second experiment, water content had great impact on the oxidation and MRPs. MRPs were better released at 2 -week time point and then decomposed or reacted with other compounds. The initial state of oxidation was similar, but during the storage, the lower the water content was, the better the oxidative stability the extrudates had. Comparing the results of the experiment 2 and 3, the level of MRPs was much higher when the particle size of the bran was small, while the oxidative stability was improved in the third experiment, especially in the 16 % water content samples. In conclusion, water content and particle size of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> had significant influence on the initial state of the extrudates. Samples produced with lower water content and bran with finer particle size had better oxidative stability and higher level of MRPs. This will be important in the developing of extruded <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> products...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rye</b> <b>bran</b> of two {{different}} particle sizes (coarse: 440 mm and fine: 28 mm) were prepared by milling of commercial <b>rye</b> <b>bran.</b> Coarse and fine <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> was added into a blend of rye endosperm flour and corn starch (70 : 30) to achieve two bran levels, 15 or 30 %, to produce directly puffed extrudates. A co-rotating twin screw extruder was used with a screw speed of 500 rpm, barrel temperature profile: 40 - 70 - 75 - 90 - 95 - 110 - 110 C and constant feed rate of 67 g/min. Feed moisture content of 17 % was used either as in barrel-water feed or as preconditioning. Fine bran addition effectively improved macrostructural properties as compared to coarse bran through increasing expansion by 3. 3 e 11. 7 % and piece density by 3. 8 e 10. 5 %. Reduction of bran particle size significantly (P < 0. 05) increased crispiness by 66. 7 e 203. 3 %. Particle size reduction of bran had only minor influences on cell wall thickness, cell area and hydrolysis index of the extrudates. Extrudates made with 30 % fine bran at in barrel-water feed provided the crispiest extrudates with lower in vitro hydrolysis index.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess environmental and familial factors that might be etiologically related to CD. METHODS: Twenty-one families with 3 or more affected first-degree relatives were studied, together with 10 matched control families. There were 74 patients with CD, 84 unaffected family members, and 59 controls. Family members were interviewed together at the parental home. A 176 -item questionnaire delved into first symptoms, childhood vaccinations and diseases, food items, potable water supplies, social activities, travel, pets, and home and surrounding environment. Questions were directed specifically for 2 time-frames, childhood until age 20 and a 10 -year epoch before the onset of first symptoms within a family. The possible factors linked to disease were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: There were significantly more smokers in the patients and their relatives than in controls. Patients had more appendicitis during adolescence, ate less oats, <b>rye,</b> and <b>bran</b> than controls, and consumed more unpasteurized cheese. Patients drank significantly less tap water and more well water than controls. Clustering of cases in time occurred in 13 of the 21 affected families.

40|$|Abstract Background Several studies {{report that}} dietary fibre from {{different}} sources promotes {{the feeling of}} satiety and suppresses hunger. However, results for cereal fibre from rye are essentially lacking. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate subjective appetite during 8 h after intake of iso-caloric rye bread breakfasts varying in rye dietary fibre composition and content. Methods The study was divided into two parts. The first part (n = 16) compared the satiating effect of iso-caloric bread breakfasts including different milling fractions of <b>rye</b> (<b>bran,</b> intermediate fraction (B 4) and sifted flour). The second part (n = 16) investigated the dose-response effect of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> and intermediate rye fraction, each providing 5 or 8 g of dietary fibre per iso-caloric bread breakfast. Both study parts used a wheat bread breakfast as reference and a randomised, within-subject comparison design. Appetite (hunger, satiety and desire to eat) was rated regularly from just before breakfast at 08 : 00 until 16 : 00. Amount, type and timing of food and drink intake were standardised during the study period. Results The Milling fractions study showed that each of the rye breakfasts resulted in a suppressed appetite during the time period before lunch (08 : 30  12 : 00) compared with the wheat reference bread breakfast. At a comparison between the rye bread breakfasts the one with <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> induced the strongest effect on satiety. In the afternoon the effect from all three rye bread breakfasts could still be seen as a decreased hunger and desire to eat compared to the wheat reference bread breakfast. In the Dose-response study both levels of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> and the lower level of intermediate rye fraction resulted in an increased satiety before lunch compared with the wheat reference bread breakfast. Neither the variation in composition between the milling fractions nor the different doses resulted in significant differences in any of the appetite ratings when compared with one another. Conclusion The results show that rye bread can be used to decrease hunger feelings both before and after lunch when included in a breakfast meal. <b>Rye</b> <b>bran</b> induces a stronger effect on satiety than the other two rye fractions used when served in iso-caloric portions.

50|$|We {{only know}} little about the other types of bread in the olden times. More refined bread types for special {{occasions}} and feasts were prepared from sifted rye flour, and loaves made from wheat must have been eaten. Around 1400, the emblem of the bakers’ guild became the triangular skonrogge (i.e. a small leavened rye bread that is cleaved and baked again until dry, also Danish beskøjt, French biscuit, Latin bis-coctus: baked twice). Around 1600, the skonrogge was replaced as the baker’s emblem by the pretzel-shaped kringle, which is still the emblem of the bakers’ guild today. We find the first systematic description of Danish bread in 1821 in Charles Adolph Dénys Mourier’s book on bread and bread-making. He describes various leavened bread types: rugbrød (whole rye bread), franskbrød (white wheat bread), sigtebrød (sifted rye bread) and tvebakker (wheat biscuits), as well as unleavened bread types: fladbrød (wheat, <b>rye,</b> oats, <b>bran</b> in various combinations) and wafers.|$|R

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects on postprandial glucose, insulin and triglyceride concentrations of meals enriched with soluble dietary fibres from oats, <b>rye</b> <b>bran,</b> sugar beet fibre or a mixture of these three fibres. METHODS: Thirteen healthy human volunteers (6 men and 7 women, aged 20 - 28 years) {{were included in the}} study. The subjects came to the study centre once a week after an overnight fast to ingest test meals and a control meal in random order. The meals contained either oat powder (62 g, of which 2. 7 soluble fibre), <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> (31 g, of which 1. 7 g soluble fibre), sugar beet fibre (19 g, of which 5 g soluble fibre), a mixture of these three fibres (74 g, of which 1. 7 g soluble fibre from each source, giving 5 g soluble fibre) or no added fibre (control) and were all adjusted to contain the same total amount of available carbohydrates. Blood samples were drawn before and every 30 min up to 180 min after the meals. RESULTS: Meals with <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> gave a lower postprandial glucose peak when compared with the control meal, and this effect was more pronounced in women compared to men. Oat powder, containing a low amount of total fibre and a high amount of carbohydrates in liquid matrix, gave a higher incremental glucose peak concentration compared to <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> and sugar beet fibre and higher insulin incremental area under curve compared to control.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that dietary fibre is good for the health. Cereals, and in {{particular}} the outer parts of the cereal kernels, are rich in dietary fibre. <b>Rye</b> <b>bran,</b> wheat bran, oat bran and barley fibre have been investigated regarding their suitability as additives in low-fat meat products. Two types of meat products, frankfurter-type sausages and meatballs have been evaluated in this thesis. In the sausages the meat protein network governs the texture and water-holding properties, whereas the meatballs have a more particulate structure, where a more crumble texture is perceived and the water-holding capacity is lower. Cereal bran particles can be difficult to add to a food-system without also adding a disagreeable sensation of grittiness. Evaluations of how the size and concentration of small <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> particles in a continuous phase of varying viscosity influence the sensory perception of grittiness were performed. The threshold for the sensation of grittiness resulting from <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> particles in a starch gel was very low and independent of the particle size. The particles were detected already at concentrations of 0. 1 - 0. 3 %, {{despite the fact that they}} were so small (20 - 180 μm). The rheological properties of the suspension medium did not influence the detection threshold. One reason for this obvious perception of grittiness of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> particles could be their irregular shape and hardness. One way of altering these adverse properties of the bran particles could be by treating them with hydrolytic enzymes. The xylanases and endoglucanases evaluated in this thesis did not increase the water-holding capacity of the rye or wheat bran or the viscosity of the aqueous phase. The water-holding capacity was probably reduced because of the lower amount of insoluble material after solubilization by the enzymes, while the lower viscosity showed that the solubilized dietary fibre were degraded into smaller molecules which could no longer contribute to the viscosity. Due to the gelling ability of the inherent β-glucan of the oat bran upon heating, it was found to be the most suitable for addition to low-fat sausages. These sausages exhibited low process and frying losses, together with high values of both firmness and sensory acceptance. The barley fibre gave a poor texture of the sausages and was the least preferred. This barley β-glucan could not form a gel, probably because of a smaller molecular weight and a less favourable structure, compared to the oat β-glucan. <b>Rye</b> <b>bran</b> is suitable for addition to meatballs, probably due to its particulate nature, which is more acceptable in this type of meat product, where the gelling properties are not as important as in sausages...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of ball milling for in situ production of fermentable AXOS in wheat and <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> {{in a dry}} milling process was investigated. An extensive lab scale ball mill treatment (120 h, 50 % jar volume capacity) increased the wheat bran water-extractable arabinoxylan (WE-AX) level from 4 % (untreated bran) to 61 %. Extractable AX fragments had an arabinose to xylose (A/X) ratio of 0. 7 and an average degree of polymerization (avDP) of 70. Ball-milling of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> gave rise to similar results, the A/X ratio of the extracted AX being somewhat lower (0. 5) compared to wheat bran. Optimization of the ball mill treatment by varying the degree of filling of the milling jar permitted to obtain equally high WE-AX levels (> 65 %) in wheat and <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> within a 24 h ball-milling period. Ball-milling at optimal conditions yielded wheat bran AXOS with an A/X ratio of 0. 7 and an avDP of 38. Ball milling (24 h, 50 % jar volume capacity) of isolated wheat bran pericarp increased the WE-AX level from 1 (untreated pericarp) to 63 %. The extractable material was characterized by a high A/X (0. 97) and a low avDP (44). In vitro fermentation of the wheat bran AXOS preparation (A/X 0. 7, avDP 38, 42 % AXOS) with human fecal inoculum showed that 45 % and 65 % of the arabinose and xylose residues, respectively, were consumed within 48 h, leaving behind AXOS with a high A/X ratio (1. 0). Fermentation gave rise to production of short-chain fatty acids, the largest increase being observed for butyric acid. Surprisingly, {{in spite of the}} very high A/X value, the wheat pericarp AXOS preparation (A/X 0. 97, avDP 44, 61 % AX) was partially fermented (30 and 40 %, of the arabinose and xylose residues, respectively). These results show that AXOS can be produced in situ in wheat or <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> in a single-stage dry milling process, rendering a wet extraction step redundant. It can be assumed that these preparations can exert prebiotic properties similar to what we observed in chickens 1 - 2 and rats 3 with isolated wheat bran-derived AXOS. status: accepte...|$|E
50|$|During the 18th century, {{the moral}} economy of France {{was based on}} wheaten bread.

Wheaten bread was also thought to be indispensable to one's well-being after French medical chemists had associated gluten with several nourishing elements in plants. As bread had a high gluten content compared to other cereals, it was given a reputation of being the alimentary ideal. Consequently, consumers became extremely concerned {{with the quality of}} their wheaten bread, resulting in a meticulous surveillance of wheaten bread production; they did not want their bread to contain filler additives such as <b>bran,</b> <b>rye,</b> barley, and legume flour.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyFood Science InstituteJ. Scott SmithAdvanced glycation end{{products}} (AGEs) {{are formed}} in many cooked meat products via Maillard browning reactions. Current research suggests consumption of these compounds {{may be a}} contributor to chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases. Thus, information on the prevalence and inhibition of these compounds in food is desirable. The first objective {{was to determine the}} AGE content, as determined as N[superscript]ε-carboxymethyllysine (CML) level, in cooked meat and fish prepared by general cooking methods recommended by U. S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS). We found AGE was detected in all the cooked samples, but the levels depended on the different cooking conditions. Broiling and frying at higher cooking temperatures produced higher levels of CML and broiled beef contained the highest CML content (21. 84 μg/g). However, the baked salmon (8. 59 μg/g) and baked tilapia (9. 72 μg/g) contained less CML as compared to the other samples. In order to investigate the inhibitory effect of selected natural antioxidant on AGEs formation in cooked meat, four cereal brans, wheat (Jagger, JA), triticale (Spring Triticale, ST; Thundercale, TH), and <b>Rye</b> (RY) <b>bran</b> were added to beef patties before cooking. RY (42. 0 % inhibition), ST (27. 5 % inhibition), and TH (21. 4 % inhibition) brans significantly decreased CML formation compared with the control. The inhibition of CML was correlated to the water-holding activity (WHC) of the samples, and the radical scavenging activity of the brans. The effect of cereal bran extracts (JA, ST, TH, and RY), was studied in a bovine serum albumin and glucose (BSA-GLU) model system. The ST extract significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited CML formation compared to the control group. ST particularly contained vanillic acid (VA), chlorogenic acid (CHA), gentisic acid (GEA), and ferulic acid (FA), where GEA and CHA mitigated CML with an average percentage decrease of 29. 6 % for CHA and 51. 1 % for GEA. It therefore may be useful in preventing AGEs formation by using ST bran as a food addictive, which contains abundant phenolic acids. In summary, current dietary AGEs database will provide important information for use in estimating AGEs exposure, and also these data demonstrate that a significantly reduced intake of dietary AGEs can be achieved by low heat AGE cooking methods such as baking, which can be used at home or in the meat industry. Cereal bran addition to meat products may reduce formation of AGEs that is a desired attribute for the processed meat products industry...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop in vitro {{digestion}} models for mimicking the physiological conditions of upper intestine and microbial conversions in the colon. The main emphasis was on the microbial metabolism of plant phenolic compounds: pure quercetin derivatives, pure anthocyanins and lignans from <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> and flaxseed. When cereal samples are introduced to an in vitro colon a removal of digestible components, is needed. An enzymatic in vitro digestion model was developed for maximal starch removal from cereal samples. Pepsin, pancreatin and bile concentrations were optimized using an experimental design. Surprisingly, pepsin and bile also affected the extent of starch hydrolysis in synergy with pancreatin. 5 - 11  % of the original amount of starch remained in the residues of cereal products. Proteins were also partly hydrolysed. The in vitro enzymatic digestion model {{was used for the}} pretreatment of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> and flaxseed samples. An anaerobic in vitro colon model, conventionally used for the fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates, was developed further for studying pure of phenolic compounds. Human faecal microbiota from several healthy donors was used in the preparation of an inoculum. A low inoculum concentration was used for decreasing the metabolite concentration from the faecal background in the studies concerning pure flavonoids. A dense faecal suspension was suitable for the conversion of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> and flaxseed lignans to enterolactone when the plant matrix was present. Flavonoids were deconjugated and degraded to phenolic acids by faecal microbiota. Specific activities of the deconjugative enzymes from the faecal inocula reflected the deconjugation rates of flavonoids. Quercetin aglycone was converted to hydroxyphenylacetic acids, but not to methylated phenolic acids. The extent of metabolism was 60  %, showing that ring-fission was a dominating route in the microbial metabolism of quercetin. Anthocyanins also underwent similar conversion, but the estimated extent of metabolite formation was low (less than 5  %). Protocatechuic acid was identified, and a phenoxyacid or a phenoxyaldehyde was proposed, as ring-fission products of cyanidin. In addition, it was suggested that anthocyanins undergo conjugation with an unknown moiety of 85 mass units. This conjugate was observed for several anthocyanins. Enterolactone production from plant lignans proceeded steadily and slowly for 48  hours in the in vitro colon model using the dense (16. 7  %) faecal suspension. Flaxseed lignan conversion to enterolactone was suppressed by the presence of rye matrix. The enterolactone-producing microbiota may be sensitive to non-physiological, low pH values caused by acidoc components from <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> in the presence of microbiota. The presence of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> matrix did not interfere with enterolactone formation in an in vivo rat model. The difference in the response to the <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> matrix {{may be due to the}} absorption of the released and metabolised compounds in rats. Rats may also adapt to the diet during their feeding period. This may have enhanced the enterolactone production, and may have further increased the difference between the bioactivity of the microbiota in the in vitro and in vivo models used in this study. Clinical human and animal trials describe end-point metabolism after adaptation to the test diet. The in vitro colon model assists in elucidation of the role of microbiota in the metabolical network of human digestive system and it helps in identification of the crucial reactions. Applications of this method can be extended from the studies of food components to pharmaceutical research. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{domestication}} {{and transmission}} of cereals {{is one of}} the most fundamental components of early farming, but direct evidence of their use in early culinary practices and economies has remained frustratingly elusive. Using analysis of a well-preserved Early Bronze Age wooden container from Switzerland, we propose novel criteria for the identification of cereal residues. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we identified compounds typically associated with plant products, including a series of phenolic lipids (alkylresorcinols) found only at appreciable concentration in wheat and <b>rye</b> <b>bran.</b> The value of these lipids as cereal grain biomarkers were independently corroborated by the presence of macrobotanical remains embedded in the deposit, and wheat and rye endosperm peptides extracted from residue. These findings demonstrate the utility of a lipid-based biomarker for wheat and <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> and offer a methodological template for future investigations of wider range of archaeological contexts. Alkylresorcinols provide a new tool for residue analysis which can help explore the spread and exploitation of cereal grains, a fundamental component of the advent and spread of farming...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of colonic fermentation has been realised during {{recent years as}} it {{has been found to be}} associated with colonic health and thus the overall health of the individual. The fermentation of dietary fibre and the addition of probiotics can have positive effects on the luminal environment and the colonic microbiota. Short-chain fatty acids, formed by the fermentation of dietary fibre, have also been found to have health-promoting effects, especially butyric acid has attracted much interest in relation to colonic health. This thesis describes investigations of hindgut fermentation in rat experimental models during normal and inflammatory conditions. Different cereals and blueberry husks were used alone or together with probiotics to study their effect on fermentation, and also their potential influence on the inflammatory process. Dietary fibre in blueberry husks was found to be very resistant to hindgut fermentation and this, together with the high excretion of fat and protein, contributed to a high faecal bulk. Blueberry husks yielded a high caecal proportion of acetic acid compared with other fibre materials and the fibre-free diet using the same rat model. Lower bacterial counts indicated that blueberry husks also have antimicrobial activity. The addition of probiotics resulted in lower amounts of carboxylic acids (CA) in the caecum and higher amounts in serum. Bifidobacterium spp. were able to lower the ammonia level in the serum, regardless of diet. A diet containing malt yielded higher levels of butyric acid in the hindgut and in the portal blood, where higher levels of propionic acid were also found, compared with diets containing whole-grain barley and brewer’s spent grain. The bifidobacteria counts were lower with malt than the other two barley fractions. The addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 271 resulted in higher proportions of butyric acid and higher levels of ammonia. The highest levels of butyric acid were found when L. rhamnosus 271 was given together with whole-grain barley. <b>Rye</b> <b>bran,</b> blueberry husks and probiotics all reduced the degree of inflammation in rats with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) -induced colitis, as evidenced by the lower disease activity index (DAI) and levels of inflammatory markers. The levels of CA in the distal colon were higher in rats given <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> than in those given blueberry husks, indicating that the fermentation of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> was slower. The addition of probiotics to the <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> diet shifted the site of fermentation to the caecum. Supplementing the blueberry husks with probiotics changed the pattern of CA in the group given blueberry husks; reducing the proportion of acetic acid and increasing that of propionic acid. The caecal counts of Enterobacteriaceae were also reduced in the groups given diets containing fibre and probiotics, and a positive correlation was found between Enterobacteriaceae and the DAI, while the DAI was negatively correlated with several CA, including butyric acid. Only <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> increased the caecal counts of lactobacilli, while the addition of probiotics to blueberry husks increased the lactobacilli caecal counts compared with blueberry husks alone. Blueberry husks and, to some extent, the combination of oat bran and blueberry husks, had the ability to ameliorate the inflammatory response, as evidenced by the lower DAI, lower numbers of colon wounds, and lower levels of haptoglobin and IL- 18. Oat bran and the combination of oat bran and blueberry husks yielded larger caecal pool sizes and distal levels of CA than blueberry husks alone. Adding probiotics to blueberry husks resulted in higher distal levels of butyric acid. Blueberry husks reduced the Enterobacteriaceae counts, while the addition of probiotics to all fibre diets yielded higher levels of lactobacilli. In conclusion, blueberry husks, <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> and the combination of oat bran and blueberry husks were able to attenuate the DSS-induced colonic inflammation, although blueberry husks seemed to have the strongest attenuating effect, which could be due to its specific dietary fibre composition or possibly the polyphenol content. The addition of probiotics improved the effects in the hindgut...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rye {{and wheat}} bran {{were treated with}} several xylanases and endoglucanases, and the effects on {{physicochemical}} properties such as solubility, viscosity, water-holding capacity and particle size {{as well as the}} chemical composition of the soluble and insoluble fractions of the bran were studied. A large number of enzymes with well-defined activities were used. This enabled a comparison between enzymes of different origins and with different activities as well as a comparison between the effects of the enzymes on rye and wheat bran. RESULTS: The xylanases derived from Bacillus subtilis were the most effective in solubilising dietary fibre from wheat and <b>rye</b> <b>bran.</b> There was a tendency for a higher degree of degradation of the soluble or solubilised dietary fibre in <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> than in wheat bran when treated with most of the enzymes. CONCLUSION: None of the enzymes increased the water-holding capacity of the bran or the viscosity of the aqueous phase. The content of insoluble material decreased as the dietary fibre was solubilised by the enzymes. The amount of material that may form a network to retain water in the system was thereby decreased.

40|$|Dietary {{factors may}} affect {{development}} and progression of prostate cancer. Experimental and epidemiological {{studies have suggested}} an effect of phytoestrogens on prostate cancer. Lignans are the predominant phytoestrogen in a Western diet. The effects of a diet rich in phytoestrogens and in particular lignans, as compared to a control diet, were assessed in several prostate cancer models. In paper I, 70 athymic nude mice with transplanted subcutaneous LNCaP tumours, an androgen sensitive human prostate cancer cell line, were fed one out of six phytoestrogen rich diets or a control diet after tumour injection. The rye diet, with high lignan content, decreased tumour take and growth, decreased secretion of prostate specific antigen and increased apoptosis. Addition of fat to the rye diet decreased the beneficial effects. In paper II, transgenic mice designed to develop prostate cancer (TRAMP) were fed <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> or a control diet {{from the age of}} four weeks. <b>Rye</b> <b>bran</b> decreased prostate epithelial cell volume by 20 %, and increased cell apoptosis by 31 % as compared to the control diet. In paper III, we examined the effects of 7 -hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), a purified lignan, in nude mice with subcutaneous LNCaP tumours in two different concentrations as compared to a control diet. Mice on the HMR diets had a reduced tumour take rate, lower total tumour volume, increased proportion of non-growing tumours, and increased apoptosis as compared to the control diet. Paper IV was a three week intervention study exploring the effects of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> bread vs. a control diet in men with prostate cancer. The men in the rye group had increased levels of plasma enterolactone and in biopsies from the prostate after the intervention an increase in apoptosis was observed in comparison with biopsies obtained before the intervention. In paper V, we examined the association between plasma levels of enterolactone, and risk of prostate cancer in a nested case control study. In the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Cohort, enterolactone concentrations were measured in plasma obtained at a mean time of 5 years before diagnosis from 265 cases of prostate cancer, and from 525 matched controls. We found no significant association between plasma enterolactone and risk of prostate cancer. Men with very low enterolactone levels (bottom decile) however, had significantly higher risk of prostate cancer. Phytoestrogen rich diet including soy, <b>rye</b> <b>bran,</b> substances purified from rye, and a purified lignan (HMR) all inhibited prostate tumour growth. However, it cannot be concluded that the effects observed were due solely to lignans as other components in rye grain such as tannins, phytic acid, ferulic acid, vitamins and minerals {{may have contributed to the}} beneficial effects. Thus, additional studies are needed to further elucidate the effects of phytoestrogens on prostate cancer development and progression...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} how a diet high in dietary fiber, with several fiber sources included, modulates glucose and lipid metabolism and the inflammatory response in humans. METHODS: Subjects (n = 25) aged 58. 6 (1. 1) years (mean and SD) with a BMI of 26. 6 (0. 5) kg/m(2) and a total cholesterol (TC) of 5. 8 (0. 1) mmol/L (mean and SEM) were given a high fiber (HF) and low fiber (LF) diet, in a randomized controlled 5 -week crossover intervention, separated by a 3 -week washout. The HF diet consisted of oat bran, <b>rye</b> <b>bran,</b> and sugar beet fiber incorporated into test food products; one bread roll, one ready meal, and two beverages consumed daily. Equivalent food products, without added fibers, were provided in the LF diet. RESULTS: Total dietary fiber intake was 48. 0 g and 30. 2 g per day for the HF and LF diet, respectively. Significant reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) was observed between the diets (P = 0. 017) and a significant reduction in fibrinogen within the HF diet (P = 0. 044). There were no significant effects in other measured circulating cytokines or in glucose, insulin, and lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a 5 -week high dietary fiber intake of oat bran, <b>rye</b> <b>bran,</b> and sugar beet fiber might reduce the low-grade inflammatory response measured as CRP which could, together with reduced fibrinogen, help to prevent the risk of cardiovascular disease...|$|E
40|$|In cereal industry, when {{cereal grains}} are milled {{to extract the}} starchy {{endosperm}} for white flour, large quantities of bran are classed as by-products and end up in animal feed. Bran, depending on the extraction rate, comprises of small amount of germ and endosperm along with aleurone layer, nucellar epidermis, seed coat and fruit coat. Bran is rich in dietary fibre, phytochemicals like phytic acid, phenolic components, lignans and flavonoids which is important in healthy human diet. To make use of all the nutrients present in this fraction of the cereal by-product could be a new value added product. This thesis aims at investigating if twin screw extrusion cooking of wheat (n= 18) and <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> (n= 18) {{has an effect on}} β-glucan and fructan content. The total β-glucan content and fructan content was analysed using enzymatic assay kits available from Megazyme ltd.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} {{interest}} in healthy and qualitative food, there is an increasing interest in dietary fiber. In Europe, the average daily intake of fiber lies beneath the recommended intake. In this context, bran {{may be part of}} the solution because it is one of the most concentrated sources of dietary fiber. The objective of this study is to examine the differences in chemical composition, physical characteristics and structure of wheat-, rye-, oat- and maize bran. This information is important in the context of understanding the physiological effects of bran consumption. Commercial bran contains residual endosperm that interferes with the characterization of the botanical bran. Therefore, methods were developed to reduce the endosperm contamination with a minimal loss of non-endosperm material. The starch content of wheat bran was drastically reduced (from 24 % to 2 %) and a clear reduction in starch content was also obtained for <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> (from 45 % to 7 %), oat bran (from 57 % to 13 %) and maize bran (from 62 % to 2 %). Chemical characterization was performed, showing large differences in composition between bran of different cereals. Oat bran had the highest beta-glucan content (17 %). Maize bran was characterized by a high arabinoxylan content (43 %) and a low mineral content (1 %). <b>Rye</b> <b>bran</b> contained more water-soluble compounds, mainly fructan (7. 5 %) and water extractable arabinoxylan (1. 3 %), than wheat bran (3. 4 % and 0. 6 %, respectively). The bran samples furthermore differed in physical characteristics. Oat bran had the highest capacity to strongly bind water (1. 7 g/g dry bran) compared to wheat bran (0. 8 g), <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> (0. 8 g) and maize bran (0. 9 g). Moreover, when an extract was made of the different bran samples, the oat bran extract was the most viscous. Furthermore, the water extractable content of rye (35 %) and oat bran (31 %) was higher compared to wheat (24 %) and maize bran (13 %). Also bran morphology, which was examined using cryo-SEM microscopy, was highly cereal dependent. It can be concluded that the chemical composition, the physical characteristics and the structure of wheat, rye, oat and maize bran differ markedly. Hence, their physiological effects in humans can be expected to differ accordingly. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Based on a {{previous}} study [14], {{the effects of a}} broader range of temperatures (up to 70  °C) and pH on the extraction of <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> AXs were tested. For α-amylase inactivation, the bran (10.8  kg) was dry heated at 130  °C for 90  min in an oven (Memmert GmbH &Co. KG, Schwabach, Germany). Sodium hydroxide was used at two concentrations (0.17 and 0.25  M which correspond to pH of 11.83 and 12.80, respectively) and mixed with <b>rye</b> <b>bran</b> in a 1 : 10 ratio. The extraction was performed at 30, 50, and 70  °C for 100  min with constant agitation. Afterward, the solids were removed using a horizontal centrifuge decanter (Sharples, Waldkraiburg, Germany), and the pH was reduced to pH 8 using phosphoric acid. The supernatant was preserved with 0.15  g/L of potassium sorbate. Proteases (200  mL Alcalase®; 20  g Corolase® PP and 228  mL Corolase LAP®) were added and stirred at 50  °C for 2  h. Then, the pH was decreased again to 6.5 for 16  h for further enzymatic treatment (17  mL Corolase® 7089, 13  mL Papain®; 15  g Veron Amylofresh®; 15  g Veron®P; 200  mL Neutrase®; 150  mL Thermamyl®; 150  mL AMG®). Enzymes were inactivated by heat treatment at 95  °C for 20  min. Subsequently, the extracted solution was ultra/dia-filtrated using a 8 -kDa ceramic membrane (TAMI Industries, Hermsdorf, Germany) at 50  °C, and the remaining solution was then portioned. A representative amount of the extract (20  L) was then freeze dried (FreeZone 6, Fa. Labconco, Outside, USA).|$|E
