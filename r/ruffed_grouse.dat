5000|$|Like most grouse, {{they spend}} most of their time on the ground; mixed {{woodland}} rich in aspen seems to be particularly well-liked. These birds forage on the ground or in trees. They are omnivores, eating buds, leaves, berries, seeds, and insects. According to nature writer Don L. Johnson:"More than any other characteristic, it is the <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse's</b> ability to thrive on a wide range of foods that has allowed it to adapt to such a wide and varied range of habitat on this continent. A complete menu of grouse fare might itself fill a book. One grouse crop yielded a live salamander in a salad of watercress. Another contained a small snake." ...|$|R
50|$|Elk, moose, black bear, {{and other}} {{wildlife}} {{are found in the}} WMA. Hunting is permitted during hunting season in the WMA, including for upland game species such as <b>ruffed</b> and dusky <b>grouse.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Small mammal {{species that}} inhabit along the trails are beaver, squirrel, river otter, chipmunk, porcupine, bobcat, {{two species of}} fox, boar, woodchuck, raccoon, and coyote. Bird species that reside in the trails are wild turkey, <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> {{mourning}} dove, raven, two species of eagle, wood duck, three species of owl, and three species of hawk as well as warblers.|$|E
5|$|The local fauna of the Three Sisters {{includes}} fish such as brook and rainbow trout, birds such as {{blue and}} <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> and larger species like the Columbian black-tailed deer, mule deer, Roosevelt elk, and American black bear. In addition to predator bobcats, cougars, and coyotes, raccoons, martens, weasels, and American minks live throughout the Three Sisters area.|$|E
50|$|The {{area has}} {{extremely}} diverse ecological composition, which includes five of seven major life zones in North America. Indigenous populations of Rocky Mountain Elk exist {{as well as}} mule deer, antelope, black bear, cougar, California bighorn sheep, <b>ruffed</b> and blue <b>grouse,</b> pileated woodpecker, sharp-shinned hawk, bald eagle, pine marten, mink, beaver. There are 378 animal and 22 fish species present.|$|R
50|$|Strawberry Mountain Wilderness {{is home to}} {{at least}} 378 kinds of animals and 22 species of fish. These include Rocky Mountain elk, mule deer, antelope, black bear, cougar, bighorn sheep, <b>ruffed</b> and blue <b>grouse,</b> pileated woodpecker, sharp-shinned hawk, bald eagle, pine marten, mink, and beaver. Some species of fish in the Middle Fork of the Malheur River include bull trout, Great Basin redband trout, and rainbow trout.|$|R
50|$|Fishing {{and hunting}} {{are the primary}} {{recreational}} and tourism activities for Redditt, and the Northwestern Ontario region in general. Though so called ecotourism is also being promoted, it has however failed to develop fully. Locals (including the First Nations, or Aboriginal Peoples) historically engaged in hunting and fishing for food. As such, whitetail deer, moose, ducks and geese were and are the primary quarry for local hunting. <b>Ruffed</b> and spruce <b>grouse</b> are popular upland game birds. Snowshoe hare is a tradition catch for women and children. Walleye (pickerel), northern pike, whitefish and lake trout were the primary food fish species. Outfitting and sport hunting is still focused on whitetail and moose. Black bear and wolf {{are becoming more and}} more desirable for non-resident hunters, especially those from Europe and the USA. Many local residents find employment as hunting and/or fishing guides. The primary sport fish species are walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, lake trout and muskie.|$|R
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest {{at least part of the}} year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow’s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse</b> and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and green heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse</b> and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
25|$|Birds of the aspen parkland include kingfishers, <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> magpies and {{northern}} orioles. {{and in particular}} several species of warblers find this a preferred habitat.|$|E
25|$|The {{woodlands}} meanwhile {{are abundant}} {{with a variety}} of bird species. Black-capped chickadee, hairy woodpeckers, <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> magpies, and great horned owls can be observed in all seasons. Summer residents include: red-eyed vireo, least flycatcher and northern oriole.|$|E
25|$|The park also {{provided}} a habitat for the woodland creatures most common in Pennsylvania, white-tailed deer, turkey, squirrels, chipmunks, and <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse.</b> The hunting of these animals is permitted during the hunting seasons designated by the Pennsylvania Game Commission.|$|E
25|$|More common birds {{observed}} in the area include <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse</b> and wild turkey, the latter being common {{enough to be a}} game species in the springtime. In all, 98 species of birds are believed to make their home here.|$|E

25|$|Wildlife is {{abundant}} {{on the slopes}} of Blue Knob. Species such as white-tailed deer, <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> turkey, coyote, porcupine and fox are difficult to see, but finding their tracks in the snow is not uncommon. Black bears are also resident on the mountain {{and are more likely to}} be seen during the early morning and evening hours. Red-tailed hawks, warblers, vireos and songbirds are found here throughout the seasons.|$|E
25|$|Creating young-forest {{habitat for}} American {{woodcock}} helps more than 50 {{other species of}} wildlife that need early successional habitat during part or all of their life cycles. These include relatively common animals such as white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, moose, bobcat, wild turkey, and <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> and animals whose populations have also declined in recent decades, such as the golden-winged warbler, whip-poor-will, willow flycatcher, indigo bunting, and New England cottontail.|$|E
25|$|The large mature {{trees and}} thick woods of Boyd Big Tree Preserve Conservation Area {{make it and}} ideal habitat for a large variety of {{woodland}} creatures. The park is home to white-tailed deer, black bear, wild turkeys, <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse</b> and eastern gray squirrels. Bluebirds and warblers can also be observed at Boyd Big Tree Preserve Conservation Area. There is an observation area on Blue Mountain where bird watchers can see the annual migration of hawks.|$|E
25|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in much of}} McConnells Mill State Park. Hunters are expected to follow {{the rules and regulations}} of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse,</b> squirrels, turkey, white-tailed deer, and rabbits. The hunting of groundhogs is not permitted at the park. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission assures that anglers will have plenty of chances to catch fish by stocking trout and bass in the waters of Slippery Rock Creek.|$|E
25|$|Dominant fauna of the Escarpment are {{the species}} found {{elsewhere}} in the Catskills: white-tailed deer, porcupine, fisher, black bear and snowshoe hare. There have been some rare bobcat sightings up on the ridge. Bird species like the rare Bicknell's thrush and <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse</b> nest in the boreal forests. A few timber rattlesnake dens are known to exist on the rocky ledges of Overlook {{at the southern end}} of the range. The paucity of water on the ridgetops and the slopes means that there are few major fish or amphibian species in the Escarpment, save around North-South Lake.|$|E
25|$|Migratory {{waterfowl}} (ducks, geese, and swans) and upland {{game birds}} (ptarmigans and grouse) were a valued source of fresh meat. Grouse (spruce grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse</b> Lower Tanana deyh Tanacross deyh, ch'ehtêeg, tsą́ą' ts'uug Upper Tanana daih, ch'ahtagn, tsąą'ts'uu) and ptarmigan (willow ptarmigan and rock ptarmigan Lower Tanana k'orrh'eba, ddhełk'ola Tanacross k'étmah, ddheł k'aal Upper Tanana k'atbah) were taken opportunistically throughhout {{the year with}} bow and arrows or with snares and fence-snare arrangements. Ducks and geese were easily captured when molting. Men in birchbark canoes quietly approached waterfowl in bays and coves and shot them with bow and arrows. Women and children then caught the birds and collected eggs from their nests.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make Anticosti Island a hunter's paradise, several animal species have been {{introduced}} since 1896, making the island an unprecedented biological experiment. In all, sixteen new species have been introduced, but six proved to be unsuccessful, including bison, caribou, elk, mink and fisher. For ten species it has been fruitful: six species of terrestrial mammals (such as white-tailed deer, moose, beaver, snowshoe hare and muskrat), two species of frogs, and two species of non-migratory birds (<b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse</b> and the spruce grouse). Of all these species introduced, the success of white-tailed deer is particular noteworthy. From an initial group of about 200 introduced in 1896 and 1897, the population of white-tailed deer has grown to an estimated 160,000 animals today, representing a density of 20 deer/km2.|$|E
25|$|The fish {{population}} draws birds to {{the waters of}} Holman Lake. Bald eagles and osprey do not nest at Little Buffalo State Park, but they do fish the waters. Great blue heron and green heron wade in the shallows of the lake in search of fish, frogs and crayfish. Wood ducks make their home at the lake along with mallards and Canadian geese. The woods and field surrounding the lake are {{the home of the}} once rare bluebird. These birds became endangered due to the loss habitat. They nested only in tree cavities. People have helped the bluebird by constructing birdhouses that mimic the woodpecker holes that bluebirds would naturally use to build their nests. Turkeys and <b>ruffed</b> <b>grouse</b> live in and thrive in the forests of Little Buffalo State Park.|$|E
