40|$|The {{properties}} of the bias frame of the STIS SITe 1024 x 1024 CCD, including its serial and parallel overscan regions, are described. Overscan regions are listed for all supported binning factors. There are {{significant differences in the}} (2 -D) behavior of the bias level in the sensitive region of the STIS CCD with respect to that found in the serial and parallel overscan regions, resulting in the necessity of an additional 2 -D zero level correction. Flat fields taken with the (operational) amplifier D show an amplifier non-linearity: the bias level of a given row is found to be dependent on the signal in that row. Analysis of the right-hand side overscan region of flat field images shows that the bias value is depressed with respect to the nominal bias value by an amount proportional to the mean signal in the row. The dependence on signal level depends on the binning in the X direction of the CCD. The maximum dependence is found in the case of unbinned data, where the overscan bias level is depressed by 1 electron per (average) <b>row</b> <b>signal</b> of roughly 1380 electrons. For the majority of science observations, we recommend to perform overscan subtraction by a smooth, low-order fit to the bias level in the left-hand serial overscan. Such a fit will be insensitive to the “depression problem”, since only a few rows will be affected in case of scientific observations. Observers will be able to estimate the effect of the “depression problem ” from the parallel (virtual) overscan in raw, full-frame CCD images...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{solve the}} problem that all <b>row</b> <b>signals</b> use the same {{reconstruction}} algorithm, a type of Bayesian compressive sensing based on importance models is proposed, which reconstructs more important signals firstly even if losing some unimportant signals. Compared to Bayesian compressive sensing whose performances is not well when sampling ratio is lower, the proposed algorithms can improve reconstruction quality effectively. The importance models include two processes, one is judging whether the signal is important {{and the other is}} how to reconstruct important signals better. In this paper, the improved reconstruction algorithm is based on sparse important signal and assigning measures by important weights. The two algorithms give priority to the more important column coefficient signals in the reconstruction process. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms have better reconstruction effect than the traditional Bayesian compressive sensing, and especially, the performance of reconstruction algorithm based on assigning measures by important weights is improved obviously when the sampling rate is relatively low.

Acceleration <b>row</b> <b>signals</b> proximal to the regurgitant orifice were detected in 27 or the 31 patients who had prosthetic mitral regurgitation by left ventriculography (sensitivity 87 %). All four patients without acceleration flow signals had mild prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angiography. No acceleration flow signals were detected in any patient without prosthetic regurgitation by left ventriculography (specificity 100 %). Individual values of the maximal area of acceleration flow signals obtained from three orthogonal planes in seven patients with mild prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angi ography ranged from 0 to 17 mm 2 (mean 4 ± 6). In 8 patients with moderate prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angiography, the maximal area of acceleration flow signals ranged from 21 to 58 mm 2 (mean 33 ± 15), whereas the maximal area of acceleration flow signals in 16 patients with severe prosthetic regurgitation ranged from 20 to 173 mm 2 (mean 102 ± 41). The maximal area of the acceleration flow signals from three planes correlated well with the angiographic grade of prosthetic mitral regurgitation. There {{was a significant difference}} in the maximal area of acceleration flow signals between mild and moderate (p < 0. 001), moderate and severe (p < 0. 001) and mild and severe (p < 0. 001) prosthetic mitral regurgitation.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that in bulk dentin {{collagen}} is arranged perpendicular to dentin tubules [47]. The dentin region adjacent to the DEJ, sometimes termed mantle dentin, contains only few tubules and practically no peri-tubular dentin [12], and lower mineral content [11]. Because mantle dentin exhibits lower mineralization and higher collagen content [18] than bulk dentin, the DEJ is tougher than bulk dentin or enamel [16]. Imbeni et al. [13] concluded that the collagen orientation at the DEJ is a key factor in the reinforcing mechanism. Near the DEJ, orientation of the collagen fibers changes to be parallel to tubules [16, 54, 55]. It has been suggested that collagen fibers cross the DEJ from dentin into enamel [16, 63], contributing considerably to the bonding of the two tooth hard tissues. The increased intensity of the collagen-related signal visible in Fig.  7 is in perfect agreement with the expected higher concentration of collagen in this region. We speculate that the decreased degree of orientation observed (cf. Fig.  7, central <b>row,</b> collagen <b>signal),</b> is related to the change in orientation of the fibrils. The SAXS signal yields the average over the illuminated area defined by the finite X-ray spot size of 5  ×  25  μm 2.

Since the members of the pairs are actually similar from the statistical point of view, we can check which method is the most stable numerically by recording the differences provided by the methods between the two members of the pairs for various important quantities of the scaling analyses, such as the multifractal support, the most frequent Holder exponent, and the Hurst exponent and considering as the better one the method that provides the minimum differences.

40|$|UnrestrictedRecently, high {{intensity}} focused ultrasound (HIFU) was successfully used for noninvasive {{treatment of the}} benign or malignant tissues. In ultrasound image-guided HIFU (US-gHIFU) using an integrated HIFU/imaging transducer, real-time simultaneous therapy and imaging is more desirable because it allows for tracking tissue movement and monitoring feedback induced by a treated target. However, reflected HIFU signals corrupt the quality of signals received by an imaging transducer during treatment.; In {{the first part of}} this thesis, it was demonstrated that these interference signals can be significantly reduced in the formed brightness mode (B-mode) ultrasound image by implementing coded excitation with fixed notch filtering. In the second part, short pulse excitation with adaptive noise canceling technique was proposed to optimally suppress therapeutic interference with variable amplitudes while maintaining the original image form as closely as possible. To demonstrate the performance of these techniques, a design of the integrated HIFU/imaging phased array transducer was proposed for treatment of malignant prostate tissues. The center <b>row</b> forms imaging <b>signals</b> and the two identical outer rows work together to produce HIFU signals. As a preliminary experiment, the prototype integrated HIFU/imaging transducer composed of three single elements was built and the performance of the proposed techniques was verified with a soft biological tissue specimen.; The third part investigates formation of a large tissue lesion per HIFU sonication to reduce the overall treatment time. The goal of this study is to show the feasibility of enlarging tissue lesion size with a dual-focus therapeutic ultrasound transducer by increasing the depth-of-focus (DOF). The proposed transducer for treatment of the malignant prostate tissues consists of a disc- and an annular-type element of different radii of curvatures to produce two focal zones. To compensate attenuation and tomaintain uniform beamwidth of the elongated DOF, each element transmits ultrasound of a different center frequency: the inner element at a higher frequency for near field focusing and the outer element at a lower frequency for far field focusing. By activating two elements at the same time with a single transmitter capable of generating a dual-frequency mixed signal, the overall ablated region of the proposed transducer can be considerably extended. By employing this design to integrated IFU/imaging transducer, not only real-time simultaneous therapy and imaging, but also reduced HIFU treatment time can be achieved at the same time...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} the trajectories and corresponding observed tracks of 300 keV electrons [...] - as typically used in transmission electron microscopy [...] - in silicon. The goal of this project is to generate simulated 300 keV electron trajectories and emulate charge carrier transport and Timepix pixel function to obtain a set of pixel tracks resembling those observed during irradiation of a Timepix chip detector with 300 keV electrons. Simulated electron trajectories were obtained using Geant 4; subsequently, charge sharing was simulated using an energy deposition [...] to [...] pixel distance power law approximation (qpixel ∝ Δxpixel- 3). Using a Gaussian Fano noise approximation, an optimum correspondence of Gaussian peak fit sigma to peak position ratio was found at a simulated Fano factor of 0. 0915. This optimum simulated Fano factor is within 25 % of Fano factors obtained in prior ab initio Fano simulations. Additionally, both observed and simulated pixel track signal intensities were added together aligned by peak signal pixel, in which a pixel charge carrier threshold was applied to all individual pixels in each simulated pixel track. At a pixel charge carrier threshold of + 4. 0 × 104 e to each individual simulated pixel tracks, the ratio between peak pixel <b>row</b> and column <b>signal</b> and the bordering pixel rows and columns is equal for both observed and simulated cumulative tracks. Yet, observed cumulative track tails contain more signal compared to peak level than simulated cumulative track tails; this effect is well explained by the non-linearity of Timepix pixel response to incident charges. These results indicate that it may be feasible to accurately recreate Timepix 300 keV electron pixel tracks using computer simulations; still, more in-depth research towards scattering of 300 keV electron tracks in silicon and towards resulting charge carrier production and transport is needed to ascertain whether superresolution transmission electron microscope imaging is in any way feasible in Timepix chip detectors.
