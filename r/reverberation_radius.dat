40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius,</b> also known as critical distance, in rooms with non-uniformly distributed sound absorption. The <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> is the distance from a sound source at which the direct sound level equals the reflected sound level. The currently used formulas to calculate the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> have been derived by the classic theories of Sabine or Eyring. However, these theories are only valid in perfectly diffused sound fields; thus, only when the energy density is constant throughout a room. Nevertheless, the generally used formulas for the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> have been used in any circumstance. Starting from theories for determining the reverberation time in non-diffuse sound fields, this paper firstly proposes a new formula to calculate the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> in rooms with non-uniformly distributed sound absorption. Then, a comparison between the classic formulas and the new one is performed in some rectangular rooms with non-uniformly distributed sound absorption. Finally, this paper introduces a new interpretation of the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> in non-diffuse sound fields. According to this interpretation, the time corresponding to the sound to travel a <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> should be assumed as the lower limit of integration of the diffuse sound energy...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a dust {{reverberation}} survey for 17 nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies, which provides the largest homogeneous data collection for the radius of the innermost dust torus. A delayed response of the K-band light curve after the V-band light curve was found for all targets, and 49 measurements of lag times between the flux variation of the dust emission in the K band and that of the optical continuum emission in the V band were obtained. The lag times strongly correlated with the optical luminosity in the luminosity range of M_V=- 16 to - 22 mag, and the regression analysis was performed to obtain the correlation log Δ t (days) = - 2. 11 - 0. 2 M_V assuming Δ t ∝ L^ 0. 5, which was theoretically expected. We discuss the possible origins of the intrinsic scatter of the dust lag-luminosity correlation, which was estimated to be about 0. 13 dex, and we find that the difference of internal extinction and delayed response of changes in lag times to the flux variations could have partly contributed to intrinsic scatter. However, we could not detect any systematic change of the correlation with the subclass of the Seyfert type or the Eddington ratio. Finally, we compare the dust <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> with the near-infrared interferometric radius of the dust torus and the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> of broad Balmer emission lines. The interferometric radius in the K band was found to be systematically larger than the dust <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> in the same band by about a factor of two, which could be interpreted by the difference between the flux-weighted radius and the response-weighted radius of the innermost dust torus. The <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> of the broad Balmer emission lines was found to be systematically smaller than the dust <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> by about a factor of 4 - 5, which strongly supports the unified scheme of the Seyfert type of active galactic nuclei.

40|$|A <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius,</b> {{also called}} a {{critical}} distance, {{is an important}} parameter in sound reproduction. Statistical approach gives a simple formula for its calculation, and some simple methods for its measurement were described in literature. To measure the critical distance in real rooms, a more accurate method is proposed. This paper is concerned with that method. Accuracy of the method was analysed {{and the results of}} critical distance measurement in several rooms of different sizes and acoustical characteristics are presented...|$|E
40|$|Adopting a spherically {{symmetric}} steady-state ballistic inflow as the kinematic {{model for}} the gas distribution responsible for producing the Hα emission line and a central black hole (BH) mass of 1. 7 x 10 ^ 6 M_sun, determined from prior reverberation mapping, leads to the following dimensions for {{the size of the}} broad line region (BLR) in NGC 4051; an inner radius 3 lt-days and a lower limit to the outer radius 475 lt-days. Thus, the previously determined reverberation size for the BLR marks just the inner radius of a much larger volume of ionized gas. The number of ionizing photons required to sustain the Hα emission line luminosity exceeds the number observed to be available from the central AGN by a factor of 3 - 4. Such a large ionizing deficit can be reconciled if the BLR is ionized by a 10 ^ 5 K accretion disk that is hidden from direct view by the high opacity of intervening H gas. A new definition is introduced for the ionization parameter that acknowledges the fact that H opacity significantly attenuates the flux of ionizing photons in the large, partially ionized, nebula surrounding the AGN. Collectively, these results have important implications for BH masses estimated using <b>reverberation</b> <b>radii</b> and the structure of the BLR inferred from velocity-delay maps.

40|$|We present mid-IR {{interferometric}} {{observations of}} 6 type 1 AGNs at multiple baseline lengths of 27 [...] 130 m, reaching high angular resolutions up to lambda/B~ 0. 02 arcseconds. For {{two of the}} targets, we have simultaneous near-IR interferometric measurements as well. The multiple baseline data directly probe the radial distribution of the material on sub-pc scales. Within our sample, which is small but spans over ~ 2. 5 orders of magnitudes in the UV/optical luminosity L of the central engine, the radial distribution clearly and systematically changes with luminosity. First, we show that the brightness distribution at a given mid-IR wavelength seems to be rather well described by a power law, which makes a simple Gaussian or ring size estimation quite inadequate. Here we instead use a half-light radius R_ 1 / 2 as a representative size. We then find that the higher luminosity objects become more compact in normalized half-light radii R_ 1 / 2 /R_in in the mid-IR, where R_in is the dust sublimation radius empirically given by the L^ 1 / 2 fit of the near-IR <b>reverberation</b> <b>radii.</b> This means that, contrary to previous studies, the physical mid-IR emission size (e. g. in pc) is not proportional to L^ 1 / 2, but increases with L much more slowly, or in fact, nearly constant at 13 micron. Combining the size information with the total flux specta, we infer that the radial surface density distribution of the heated dust grains changes from a steep ~r^- 1 structure in high luminosity objects to a shallower ~r^ 0 structure in those of lower luminosity. The inward dust temperature distribution {{does not seem to}} smoothly reach the sublimation temperature [...] on the innermost scale of ~R_in, a relatively low temperature core seems to co-exist with a slightly distinct brightness concentration emitting roughly at the sublimation temperature.

40|$|Unveiling the {{structure}} of the Broad Line Region (BLR) of AGNs is critical to understand the quasar phenomenon. Resolving a few BLRs by optical interferometry will bring decisive information to confront, complement and calibrate the reverberation mapping technique, basis of the mass-luminosity relation in quasars. BLRs are much smaller than the angular resolution of the VLT and Keck interferometers and they can be resolved only by differential interferometry very accurate measurements of differential visibility and phase as a function of wavelength. The latter yields the photocenter variation with wavelength, and constrains the size, position and velocity law of various regions of the BLR. AGNs are below the magnitude limit for spectrally resolved interferometry set by currently available fringe trackers. A new "blind" observation method and a data processing based on the accumulation of 2 D Fourier power and cross spectra permitted us to obtain the first spectrally resolved interferometric observation of a BLR, on the K= 10 quasar 3 C 273. A careful bias analysis is still in progress, but we report strong evidence that, as the baseline increases, the differential visibility decreases in the Pa-alpha line. Combined with a differential phase smaller than 3 degree, this yields an angular equivalent radius of the BLR larger than 0. 4 milliarcseconds, or 1000 light days at the distance of 3 C 273, much larger than the <b>reverberation</b> mapping <b>radius</b> of 300 light days.

40|$|The {{exploration}} of extragalactic objects with long-baseline interferometers in the near-infrared {{has been very}} limited. Here we report successful observations with the Keck interferometer at K-band (2. 2 um) for four Type 1 AGNs, namely NGC 4151, Mrk 231, NGC 4051, and the QSO IRAS 13349 + 2438 at z= 0. 108. For the latter three objects, these are the first long-baseline interferometric measurements in the infrared. We detect high visibilities (V^ 2 ~ 0. 8 - 0. 9) for all the four objects, including NGC 4151 for which we confirm the high V^ 2 level measured by Swain et al. (2003). We marginally detect a decrease of V^ 2 with increasing baseline lengths for NGC 4151, although over a very limited range, where the decrease and absolute V^ 2 are well fitted with a ring model of radius 0. 45 +/- 0. 04 mas (0. 039 +/- 0. 003 pc). Strikingly, this matches independent radius measurements from optical [...] infrared reverberations that {{are thought to be}} probing the dust sublimation radius. We also show that the effective radius of the other objects, obtained from the same ring model, is either roughly equal to or slightly larger than the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> as a function of AGN luminosity. This suggests that we are indeed partially resolving the dust sublimation region. The ratio of the effective ring radius to the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> might also give us an approximate probe for the radial structure of the inner accreting material in each object. This should be scrutinized with further observations. Comment: accepted for publication in A&A Letter...|$|E
40|$|We see no {{signatures}} of dust destruction due to sublimation in our data, since they show {{no increase in}} the hot dust reverberation delay directly correlated with substantial accretion disk flux increases in the observed period. Instead, {{we find that the}} hot dust in NGC 4151 appears to merely heat up, and the hot dust temperature closely tracks the accretion disk luminosity variations. We find indications of a decreased reverberation delay within the observed period from t = 42. 5 +/- 4. 0 days in 2010 to t = 29. 6 +/- 1. 7 days in 2013 - 2014.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} measuring the reciprocity parameter based on the free field. It is able to achieve accurate measurement of the reverberation constant in a narrow band. The method uses the same transmitting and receiving system, and keeps {{the same set of}} parameters to measure the open circuit voltage output under different frequencies in a free field. The open circuit output voltage is measured through average technology in the reverberation control region, then the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> is calculated and the reciprocity constant obtained. This method uses a single frequency signal and the spatial averaging technique. It is simple, convenient and not suitable for complex measuring instruments.

40|$|Recently, Gandhi, Hönig, and Kishimoto {{submitted}} a manuscript to the arXiv e-print {{service on the}} location of the emitting region of the narrow FeKα line that appears in the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) compared with the inner radius of the dust torus (arXiv: 1502. 02661). Prior to their manuscript, a similar discussion had already been presented in a section of Minezaki & Matsushita (2015), which had been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.

40|$|We are now {{exploring}} the inner region of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with the Keck interferometer in the near-infrared. Adding {{to the four}} targets previously studied, we report measurements of the K-band (2. 2 um) visibilities for four more targets, namely AKN 120, IC 4329 A, Mrk 6, and the radio-loud QSO 3 C 273 at z= 0. 158. The observed visibilities are quite high for all the targets, which we interpret {{as an indication of}} the partial resolution of the dust sublimation region. The effective ring radii derived from the observed visibilities scale approximately with L^ 1 / 2, where L is the AGN luminosity. Comparing the radii with those from independent optical-infrared reverberation measurements, these data support our previous claim that the interferometric ring radius is either roughly equal to or slightly larger than the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius.</b> We interpret the ratio of these two radii for a given L as an approximate probe of the radial distribution of the inner accreting material. We show tentative evidence that this inner radial structure might be closely related to the radio-loudness of the central engine. Finally, we re-observed the brightest Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. Its marginally higher visibility at a shorter projected baseline, compared to our previous measurements obtained one year before, further supports the partial resolution of the inner structure. We did not detect any significant change in the implied emission size when the K-band flux was brightened by a factor of 1. 5 over a time interval of one year.

40|$|A {{qualitative}} relation was sought {{between the}} frequency {{region of the}} bridge hill of violins and perceived tonal qualities of violin notes. The prelude of Max Bruch’s Violin Concerto No. 1 was played twice on four violins in a large concert hall. A microphone recording of the music, outside the <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> of the hall, represented {{a picture of the}} violin as experienced by a listener. The violins used for these tests included an 18 th-century Italian violin of soloist quality, a French violin made in first decade of the 20 th century, and two newly made fine violins. Four long notes covering the main range of the violin were copied into sound files and replayed via an equalizer where the levels could independently be adjusted in any octave band while listening. It was found that the 2 - and 4 -kHz octave bands caused the largest changes in note quality, i. e., the bands in which the bridge hill is to be found. In this frequency range the ear also has maximum sensitivity to weak sounds and maximum dynamic working range (difference in sound levels). Level shifts of the octave bands at 250 and 500 Hz showed surprisingly little influence on the notes. Increased levels in higher bands made the note shriller (harsher), and increased level in lower bands made the note rounder (more mellow). This indicates that fine frequency adjustment of the bridge hill is important. As a physical measure of violin frequency response, the so-called bridge hill (BH) was recently suggested as a major quality parameter of the violin. Many acoustical measures of the violin have been introduced, but few have been tested. The experiments reported here—although somewhat informal and restricted—were conducted to obtain a qualitative evaluation {{of the importance of the}} bridge-hill frequency range...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a three years {{monitoring}} campaigns of the z = 0. 024 type- 1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) PGC 50427. Through the use of Photometric Reverberation Mapping with broad and narrow band filters, we determine the size of the broad-line emitting region by measuring the time delay between the variability of the continuum and the Hα emission line. The Hα emission line responds to blue continuum variations with an average rest frame lag of 19. 0 ± 1. 23 days. Using single epoch spectroscopy we determined a broad-line Hα velocity width of 1020 km s^- 1 and in combination with the rest frame lag and adoption a geometric scaling factor f = 5. 5, we calculate a black hole mass of M_BH∼ 17 × 10 ^ 6 M_. Using the flux variation gradient method, we separate the host galaxy contribution from that of the AGN to calculate the rest frame 5100 Å luminosity at the time of our monitoring campaign. The rest frame lag and the host-subtracted luminosity permit us to derive the position of PGC 50427 in the BLR size [...] AGN luminosity diagram, which is remarkably close to the theoretically expected relation of R ∝ L^ 0. 5. The simultaneous optical and NIR (J and K_s) observations allow us to determine the size of the dust torus through the use of dust reverberation mapping method. We find that the hot dust emission (∼ 1800 K) lags the optical variations with an average rest frame lag of 46. 2 ± 2. 60 days. The dust <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> and the nuclear NIR luminosity permit us to derive the position of PGC 50427 on the known τ - MV diagram. The simultaneus observations for the broad-line region and dust thermal emission demonstrate that the innermost dust torus is located outside the BLR in PGC 50427, supporting the unified scheme for AGNs.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{estimating}} {{the mass of}} a supermassive black hole, applicable to obscured AGNs. This method estimates the black hole mass using {{the width of the}} narrow core of the neutral FeKa emission line in X-rays and the distance of its emitting region from the black hole based on the isotropic luminosity indicator via the luminosity scaling relation. We collect the line width data of the neutral FeKa line core for seven type- 1 AGNs and seven type- 2 AGNs obtained by the Chandra HETGS. Assuming the virial relation between the locations and the velocity widths of the neutral FeKa line core and the broad Hb emission line, the luminosity scaling relation of the neutral FeKa line core emitting region is estimated. We find that the FWHM of the neutral FeKa line core falls between that of the broad Balmer emission lines and the corresponding value at the dust <b>reverberation</b> <b>radius</b> for most of the type- 1 AGNs and for all of the type- 2 AGNs. This suggests that significant fraction of photons of the neutral FeKa line core originates between the outer BLR and the inner dust torus in most cases. The black hole mass M_FeKa estimated with this method is then compared with other black hole mass estimates, such as the broad emission-line reverberation mass M_rev for the type- 1 AGNs, the mass M_H 2 O based on the H 2 O maser and the single-epoch mass estimate M_pol based on the polarized broad Balmer lines for the type- 2 AGNs. We find that M_FeKa is consistent with M_rev for the most of the type- 1 AGNs and with M_pol for all of the type- 2 AGNs. We also find that M_FeKa is correlated well with M_H 2 O for the type- 2 AGNs. These results suggest that M_FeKa is a potential indicator of the black hole mass especially for obscured AGNs. In contrast, M_FeKa for which the same virial factor as for M_rev and M_pol is adopted is systematically larger than M_H 2 O by about a factor of about 5.
