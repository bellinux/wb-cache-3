50|$|A tub {{boat lift}} {{is a type}} of boat lift {{designed}} to lift tub boats between different elevations of a canal. Tub boats are small boats used to transport coal and other minerals, sometimes working singly, sometimes in long trains. A tub boat lift (Kahnhebehaus) lifts the boat out of the water. Most other types of boat lift such as locks or inclined planes are designed to move the boat afloat in some kind of water-filled tank, and, apart from maximum dimensions, are not restricted in the type of craft <b>transported.</b> <b>Tub</b> boat lifts and tub boats are designed to work together as a system. A given lift will only be able to lift boats designed for the lift.|$|R

50|$|The {{new company}} {{constructed}} an inclined plane, to <b>transport</b> <b>tub</b> boats from {{the level of}} the Wombridge canal, down to that of the Shrewsbury canal. It was 243 ft long, with a fall of 75 ft. It consisted of twin railway tracks, each with a cradle in which a single tub-boat was carried. Power was provided by an engine supplied by the Coalbrookdale Company. This was replaced in 1842 by a new engine that lasted for 79 years, until the final demise of the incline on 31 August 1921. Most of the working traffic was in the downward direction of the incline, and was counterbalanced by empty tub-boats returning up to the top level. The inclined plane was the last operational canal plane in the country.|$|R

40|$|Structural {{changes in}} the Swedish forest {{products}} sec-tor have resulted in increased round wood consumption per mill. Increased consumption volumes result in in-creased <b>round</b> wood <b>transport</b> distances and transport output (m·km). At the same time, the coordination of trans-port services is being taken over by transport organiza-tions of increasing size. New technological developments combined with organizational innovations have made link-ing between transport service providers easier. This has lead to the opportunity to offer different services through networking and diversify service levels for different cus-tomers (service divergence). This study examines the service divergence potential of <b>round</b> wood <b>transport</b> in Sweden. The goal {{of the study is}} to develop a better understanding of customer demands and service complexity. This study is based on the inter-view results of 20 transport service providers and buyers in the Swedish forest sector. The results presented con-cern three main themes: transport service goals, decisions and decision support processes. The study reports the rankings of responses as well as their correlations in order to group them into a goal-decision-decision support hier-archy. The rankings and correlations are used to suggest a customer service matrix for <b>round</b> wood <b>transport.</b> The interview also included a fourth theme describing current problems with planning and control. The responses of this final theme are related to the different parts of the hierarchy in order to identify impediments to service di-vergence...|$|R

40|$|Title: Process {{description}} of <b>round</b> timber <b>transports</b> – {{a case study}} at Träfrakt Götaland AB Authors: Karl – Johan Tern, Christian Johansson and Andreas Ivarsson Tutor: Anders Jerreling Examiner: Fredrik Karlsson Background: Today the profitability of forest haulers is unsatisfactory. Negotiations on prices are more about the relative strength of the negotiation parties rather than a discussion about actual costs. Adding extensive changes in the forest haulers cost structure has led to insufficient knowledge of whether the negotiated prices really correspond to their costs. Methodology: We decided {{to carry out a}} case study at Träfrakt Götaland AB, a special interest organisation whose members represent the majority of forest haulers in Götaland. Purpose: To describe the processes and underlying activities of <b>round</b> timber <b>transports.</b> This study may serve as the basis {{in the development of a}} new costing model. Conclusions: The resulting model focuses on the significant activities while insignificant activities are ignored. In our conclusion we make recommendations of which steps to take to further develop the costing model...|$|R

2500|$|Wagonways (or tramways) using wooden rails, hauled by horses, started {{appearing}} in 1550s {{to facilitate the}} <b>transport</b> of ore <b>tubs</b> to and from mines, and soon became very popular in Europe.

50|$|Coaling the {{locomotives}} {{could be}} carried out in various ways. Many Betriebswerke ferried the coal from the bunkers using small narrow gauge tub wagons on rails to a rotating crane which then lifted them and tippled their contents into the tender of the locomotive. Large Betriebswerke had coaling stages or large coaling plants that had four filled hopper-like bunkers which were equipped with locking devices. When these were removed, the coal ran down into the locomotive tender. With this type, coal {{was transferred to the}} four small bunkers from the main bunkers using a large crane. Because these two variants needed rather a lot of space, small and medium-sized Betriebswerke had an overhead chute. The coal was <b>transported</b> in <b>tub</b> wagons again; these were then placed in a lift, hoisted up and then tippled down the chute, allowing the coal to run into the tender of the steam locomotive.Next to the coaling station there were often water cranes and works buildings. In addition, there were often store rooms for these facilities nearby.|$|R

40|$|Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) {{has grown}} {{significantly}} {{in recent years}} as a niche market for drilling jobs considered not good candidates for conventional rotary drilling due primarily to high cost associated with them. CTD is normally associated with high angle to horizontal and extended reach wells. It is, however, in these applications that hole problems, due to inefficient cuttings removal, become more troublesome. These problems are enhanced due to the non rotation of the inner string (the CT itself) as opposed to normal (or conventional) drilling where the inner pipe rotation imparts some motion and agitation of the drilled solids thus minimizing hole problems due to cuttings accumulation. Many parameters affect efficient cuttings <b>transport</b> in Coil <b>Tubing</b> Drilling in horizontal and deviated geometries. Among these are pump rates, well dimensions, fluid properties, solids sizes and solids loading. Drilling should be designed and carried out so that all cuttings are maintained in suspension and no cuttings bed is formed. Several {{attempts have been made to}} determine the optimum operating range of these parameters but complete and satisfactory models have yet to be developed. The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of the state of the art of previous approaches to efficient cuttings <b>transport</b> during Coil <b>Tubing</b> Drilling, present the critical parameters involved and establish their range according to what is observed in practice through dimensional and similarity analysis.

TIP 47 recognizes a phenylalanine/tryptophan signal in the tail of the cation-dependent MPR that is essential for its proper sorting within the endosomal pathway. These data suggest that TIP 47 binds MPR cytoplasmic domains and facilitates their collection into transport vesicles destined for the Golgi...|$|R
