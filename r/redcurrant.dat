5|$|For {{their final}} season at Highbury (2005–06) Arsenal ran {{a series of}} {{promotions}} honouring the stadium's legacy. A commemorative logo was designed featuring the club's traditional Art Deco crest from the 1930s, and the club's history at Highbury was celebrated {{through a series of}} themed matchdays. On the field, Arsenal temporarily set aside their traditional red shirts with white sleeves for the season and adopted a solid <b>redcurrant</b> shirt, the colour they wore during their first season at Highbury in 1913–14.|$|E
5|$|Regardless {{of which}} story is true, {{the red and}} white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the {{combination}} ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative <b>redcurrant</b> shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours {{at the start of}} the next season. In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.|$|E
5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though {{this has not}} always been the case. The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was <b>redcurrant,</b> a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E
