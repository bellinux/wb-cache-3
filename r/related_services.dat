40|$|Leisure {{participation}} is influential {{on the quality}} of life of individuals. Individuals with disabilities can face barriers in leisure participation, impacting their quality of life. IDEA (2004) recognizes recreation as a <b>related</b> <b>service</b> as one way to enhance the leisure experiences for students with disabilities. The purpose of this embedded case study was to explore how recreation as a <b>related</b> <b>service</b> contributed to {{the quality of life of}} students with disabilities in a public school setting. The scope of this study included six students and fifteen IEP TEAM members, including parents. Interviews, questionnaires, and document analysis were utilized to collect data on the perspectives of students and IEP Members, student outcomes, and the service delivery model used within a PreK- 12 public school district in Northeastern United States. Findings from the data analysis suggested that students who received recreation as a <b>related</b> <b>service</b> demonstrated quality of life in the area of physical and emotional well being, social participation, and independence. Currently, there is a lack of awareness of recreation as a <b>related</b> <b>service</b> and it is underutilized in the public school setting. Findings that emerged from this study identify the potential outcomes from the utilization of recreation as a <b>related</b> <b>service</b> in the public school setting. Identifying these outcomes can increase the awareness of this <b>related</b> <b>service.</b> More research is needed to identify how recreation as a <b>related</b> <b>service</b> contributes to the interpersonal relations of students with disabilities and their peers.

5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb <b>related</b> <b>services</b> were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

Invitations to participate in the study were disseminated to a randomized selection of members within the Council for Children with Behavioral Disorders. Respondents (N = 199) included teachers (n = 128) and <b>related</b> <b>service</b> personnel (n = 71) who directly and indirectly work with students with emotional and behavioral disorders throughout the United States. A rank order list of the most important knowledge and skills to teachers with regard to demographic characteristics (i. e., types of communities, educational settings, or years of experience) was developed. Additionally, a rank order list was developed to determine which knowledge and skills <b>related</b> <b>service</b> personnel felt should be most important to teachers. Level of agreement was determined between teachers and <b>related</b> <b>service</b> personnel and variances among the rank order lists were examined. Results of the study revealed statistically significant variances in the rank order of knowledge and skills among educational settings of teachers (i. e., self-contained, resource, and general education/inclusion) across the standard of Learning Environments and Social Interactions. Rank orders in two knowledge and skills (i. e., assistive technology and structure) were significant.
