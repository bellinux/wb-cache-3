25|$|The Lynx is a {{multi-purpose}} twin-engine battlefield helicopter, {{of which}} specialized versions {{have been developed}} for both sea and land-based warfare. A distinguishing feature between early and later aircraft is the undercarriage: early Army versions of the Lynx were equipped with skids, while the Naval and later models have been outfitted with wheels, a requirement for easy ground handling on the deck of a warship. Early versions of the Lynx were powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem turboshaft engines, which powered a four-blade rotor. Mounted on a rigid titanium monobloc <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> of the kind pioneered by the MBB BO105 a few years earlier. The innovative blade design comprised a honeycomb sandwich structure and made out of composite material. For shipboard stowage, both the rotor blades and tail can be folded. Lag dampers were incorporated but these are not required in flight (owing to the rigidity of the monobloc <b>rotor</b> <b>head).</b> In flight, the main rotor is kept at a constant speed, simplifying aircraft control; the rotor also features a vibration absorption system.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a {{solution}} for the Skeeter's troublesome resonance issue had been developed, which involved {{the adoption of a}} redesigned undercarriage and the fitting of revised blade friction dampers on the <b>rotor</b> <b>head.</b> These improvements allowed Saunders-Roe to finally demonstrate that the ground resonance problems had been fixed when the Skeeter Mark 5 underwent testing by the A in March 1954. The resolution of the issue served to reignite official interest in the rotorcraft, quickly leading to a smaller order being placed for four Skeeter Mark 6s, each equipped with 200hp (149kW) Gipsy Major 200 engines (designated as AOP.10 and T.11 by the British armed forces), for evaluation purposes.|$|E
25|$|On 2 October 2014, P1 {{achieved}} a milestone {{for the project}} when it conducted its maiden flight from Mollis Airport. This first flight, lasting 20 minutes, was flown by chief test pilot Dwayne Williams. Stucki announced that the first flight had confirmed preliminary flight characteristics of the SH09. Commenting shortly after P1's maiden flight, the company stated that it was on schedule to receive EASA certification within the next 12-16 months. In summer 2015, Marenco halted flight tests after 100 flight hours to focus on producing the second prototype, P2, which incorporated a modified bearingless <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> and new rotor blades to reduce vibrations. By September 2015, it was recognised that the original development timeline had been optimistic and that certification would take longer to achieve than had been originally announced. On 26 February 2016, P2 performed its first flight, piloted by new chief test pilot Richard Trueman. At this point, certification {{was expected to be}} achieved near to the end of 2016 or during early 2017.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the S-76 began in the mid-1970s as the S-74, with the design goal of providing a medium helicopter for corporate transportation and the oil drilling industry; the S-74 was later redesignated the S-76 {{in honor of the}} U.S. Bicentennial. Sikorsky's design work on the S-70 helicopter (which was selected for use by the United States Army as the UH-60 Black Hawk) was utilized in the {{development of}} the S-76, incorporating S-70 design technology in its rotor blades and <b>rotor</b> <b>heads.</b> It was the first Sikorsky helicopter designed purely for commercial rather than military use.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the testing}} at Yuma, {{prototype}} #9 received the improved T64-GE-716 engine producing 4,275shp (3,188kW) and the planned production {{version of the}} ICS system. With these upgrades, the helicopter surpassed its performance requirements. However, under certain conditions stability and control did not completely satisfy the test pilots. Lockheed had studied ways to prevent unstable feedback from the gyro. The solution was to relocate the gyro {{from the top of}} the <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> to below the transmission with flexible connections to the rotor. The pilot's controls were connected to hydraulic servomotors then connected through springs to the gyro. This system prevented rotor vibration forces from transmitting back into the flight controls. It was called the [...] "advanced mechanical control system" [...] (AMCS) and was installed on Cheyenne #7 in 1972 to improve handling and rotor stability.|$|E
