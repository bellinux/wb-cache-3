On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

Selfish programming, Or is there a deeper meaning, with the title, the lyrics?".|$|R
2500|$|After making {{two more}} films of social {{relevance}} (Ningen in 1962 and Mother in 1963), Shindo shifted his focus as a filmmaker to the individuality of a person, specifically a person's sexual nature. He explained: [...] "Political {{things such as}} class consciousness or class struggle or other aspects of social existence <b>really</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the problem of man alone....I have discovered the powerful, very fundamental force in man which sustains his survival and which can be called sexual energy...My idea of sex is nothing but {{the expression of the}} vitality of man, his urge for survival."

Nate Parker also cited the script as the main reason he joined the cast, describing it as 'raw and emotional', but furthermore went on to state that the opportunity to work with the D.P Bradford Young was also a motivating factor.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the thirteenth}} season in 1992, Devane {{resigned}} from {{his role as}} Greg due to the production schedule. Devane said: I resigned. I had had enough. It had gotten so absurd. And I was offered a deal with ABC. I left Knots Landing because I didn't {{want to go in}} the toilet with this shit. The problem <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the writing and {{trying to come up with}} good stories and most of us just said, “ we've done good work and let’s be proud of that and not have the show’s legacy ruined.”". Another reason he resigned was due to the L.A. riots inspired story. [...] "It’s one of the reasons I left. It didn't help, that’s for sure.

At the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, Chris teased that the song would become his third single from the album. [...] On September 13, 2012, Rene previewed a first listen of the single to his fans through his Facebook account. Rene says of the single: [...] "this song is about basically a guy kind of being mischievous and not being truthful at the beginning, but what it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> is {{he wants to be}} passionate about one girl and to have that love in his life. It's all about her. He's only rocking with her. I {{think a lot of people}} are going to feel it." ...|$|E
5000|$|For its VHS release, Borden {{negotiated}} {{the restoration of}} several scenes originally cut from the theatrical release.

[...] "The problems <b>really</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> sex," [...] Borden said. [...] "My vision of what I wanted, of how I wanted to explore the character (played by Sean Young) and her sexual needs and desires just wasn't acceptable or accepted. The sadomasochistic element of the film as I envisioned it was too scary for the people writing the checks. And then I didn't get the final cut." ...|$|R

Dave Freudenthal, {{asked her if she}} would be interested in serving as a federal district judge for Wyoming. Her husband subsequently—without telling her—submitted three possible nominees to the Obama administration for it to consider nominating: his wife, another attorney, Ford Bussart, and a state district court judge, Norman E. Young. [...] "I thought about that long and hard, and the question <b>really</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> (was) should she be penalized for having married me," [...] Dave Freudenthal told a local newspaper. [...] "And the conclusion I <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> is that all three of them are qualified, and fortunately, it's up to the president and not me." ...|$|R
5000|$|And {{the third}} bit, about execution, it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{production}} value. The {{teams that are}} working really well on mobile right now I think {{bring a lot of}} production value but don't necessarily bring a lot of scope, which I think {{makes a lot of sense}} for the device. Because the play pattern on mobile is so much different from other platforms in terms of how people engage with the game. Some people will sit on a couch for a long time, but often they don't. Often they'll be in and out. And you have to keep that in mind, to design to that play pattern. How you treat scope has a big impact on that. Designing big long levels where you have to engage 30 minutes at a time doesn't work so well. Creating scope for production value is good…everyone loves production value, right? Great story, great visuals--bringing that to the platform could be really cool." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} Liv Kristine gave with Brave Words And Bloody Knuckles in 2006, she {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "When it comes to music, doing one thing is not enough. I've got a lot of different sources of musical inspiration, and I know that doing one thing is easy and saves time, but I wouldn't know what I would do with all my ideas and dreams if I went that direction. I have to bring them to life somehow, so doing a solo project is a way of being creative.With me, the creative process is an ongoing thing, so it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the planning. My husband (Atrocity frontman/producer Alex Krull) and I have the same profession, I have a fantastic mother-in-law, and I'm also able to close the door when I leave the studio or tour bus. Time off is time off and work is work, and I enjoy both." ...|$|E
5000|$|In retrospect, the director, Fred Dekker said: [...] "There’s a {{misconception}} about this movie that the studio steamrolled me into doing something I wasn’t comfortable with. The truth is, {{anything wrong with}} it is entirely my fault. I had a great cast, a great crew, the support of my producers and the studio, {{and some of the}} greatest special effects wizards of all time. I think it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the script. It was a story by the brilliant Frank Miller, who wrote the first draft—but in the final analysis, it was the wrong story and the wrong script for what an audience wanted from that character. The PG-13 rating didn’t help, since the character’s first two outings were extremely violent and satirical, and that’s really the arena that character belongs in—not a “family” movie." [...] He also said: [...] "Nonetheless, RoboCop 3 was the most enjoyable movie-making experience I've had and, for me, the most accomplished work I've done as a director. In other words, if the movie blows, there's nobody to blame but me." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} June 15, 2006 in Dallas, Texas {{due to a}} close {{proximity}} of rural and urban settings. Executive producer Matt Olmstead stated that the filming location was changed from Chicago in the first season to Dallas in the second season because the characters were on the run. Many locations were needed to represent various American towns, which Dallas provided, whereas locations within Chicago took several hours to travel between. [...] Olmstead noted, [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a financial thing." [...] Other locations that were considered for filming were New Mexico, Arizona and Louisiana. Dallas was chosen because of its [...] "resourcefulness, cost effectiveness and variety with regard to activities available for the crew", which {{was considered to be}} a major component for the final decision. Filming took place in Dallas for nine to ten months, where 20 of the 22 episodes were shot. The series was expected to bring $50 million into the city of Dallas. For the final three episodes of the second season, filming took place in Pensacola, Florida to represent Panama. Filming for each episode took place over eight days, which contributed approximately $1.4 million to the local economy.|$|R

I {{received}} all my sacraments, never asking any questions about the God that I believe in, the God that I was taught to believe in. It might sound naïve, but up until I reached college, I have had an unchanged image of God in my mind.

5000|$|Dark Horse was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "The {{bad news is that}} there's no [...] "Overnight Sensation"-styled single, {{but the good news is}} there's no shameless effort to re-create the crossover hit. The Dark Horse may damn the corporate music industry for not giving Twista an in, but this rough-and-tumble album filled with standoffish street cuts proves that indie life suits the rapper, so expect more punch and less perfection." [...] Kellan Miller of XXL stated, [...] "The problem with The Dark Horse <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> lacking any sense of direction rather than a display of mediocre talent. Too often Twista is dragged down by the performances of his superfluous guests, or an overall misguided push for imaginative ventures. Recent veterans like Nas and Mobb Deep have cooled their attempts to nestle in the contemporary mix, effectively transitioning to the paths that propelled them past their competition in the first place. On “6 Rings,” Twista reverts to his “Kill Us All” days and ends things on a high-voltage note. One can only hope that Twista follows suit with his next project." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Aborym {{released}} {{their second}} album Fire Walk with Us, with Csihar fulfilling vocal duties {{and the band}} including a cover of Norwegian group Burzum's [...] "Det som en gang var". The album was extremely well received. Terrorizer awarded it album of the month with a maximum score of 10/10, commenting: [...] "Most black-heads will hate it, others will be curiously offended by it, and a fearless few will call it their own {{and use it as}} their very lifeblood. You can almost see the majority snicker at Aborym's psychedelic time-travel-meets-corpse-paint image, but these visuals serve to underline specifically where band and record belong: the outer reaches of the cosmos." [...] The album also made Terrorizers Albums of the Year for 2001, at position 39. Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic highlighted the potentially divisive nature of the record, stating: [...] "Is it any good? Well, it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> how the listener positions himself along the digital divide. Those who prefer their Metal stripped down and straightforward will likely find Aborym too Industrial and chaotic. Yet for fans of truly unique new directions in Metal, Fire Walk With Us is a full-course meal."

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Educação artística, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Belas Artes, 2012 Museums are {{a complex}} social {{institution}} with {{a prominent role}} on our cultural environment and also on contemporary cultural policies. However museums are lately affected by profound and speedy transformations that have been changing not only its internal and external practices, but also changing its relationship with society, the public sphere and its overall discourses. This study aims to identify some of the museum's discourses. For that it uses casestudies, including six museums and four other national cultural facilities: a Theater, a Music Hall and two Theme Parks. It was possible to establish relationships between museums and its discourses on three different levels: the ones it produces, the ones carried out by other players and the outside discourses that takes for its own. From this research we can conclude that museums and other cultural institutions are presently very similar in its core: its concerns, its needs {{and the type of}} strategies are coincident, even amongst different kinds of institutions. It is also possible to conclude that there is an ever expanding spread of topics, narratives and discourses outside the museum field, and sometimes even outside the cultural circuit, that have made some inroads on museums as an object of questioning, reflection and production. Finally we have noticed other "infections", this time internal to the cultural circuit: it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> understanding which discourses are shared with the other cultural institutions, find out its origin and recognize some of its dynamics, direction and meaning...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe stories {{included}} in this MA thesis- set in my native Philippines, may be read as pieces that reflect a struggle {{to come to terms}} with what was lost in the process of migration. Each represents an effort to reconstruct a place- a home - through writing; each attempts to re-engage a world that was, and always will be, mine, but one that I took for granted even as I inhabited it. To do so, the stories borrow strategies from the magical-realist tradition in which readers are given access to a new perspective of reality through its juxtaposition with the fantastic. Rather than attempt to render an accurate or "realistic" depiction of a particular place and time, this project calls attention to the role of narrative in our everyday lives and how our worlds are shaped by stories- true, or not. It explores the notion that much of what we accept as "fact" and much of what we relegate to the category of "fiction" may really just be functions of a particular narrative, and may <b>really</b> just <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> what has been privileged and what has not, what was kept in as part of a story, and what was left out. Taken together, these stories emerge from the condition ofthe migrant writer who is granted a new vision afforded by the great distance from their subject- their place of origin, their homeland - but who also wrestles with the reality that, in the end, they still have only memory, about which there is something inherently fictitious...|$|R
