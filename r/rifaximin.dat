5|$|The {{antibiotic}} <b>rifaximin</b> may be {{recommended in}} addition to lactulose for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to neomycin or metronidazole. Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use, <b>rifaximin</b> is generally only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective. When <b>rifaximin</b> is added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately. <b>Rifaximin</b> is more expensive than lactulose, but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea.

25|$|While the {{avoidance}} of nuts and seeds has historically been recommended, no association between eating these foods and diverticulitis has been found, and therefore, avoiding these foods is no longer recommended. Mesalazine and <b>rifaximin</b> appear useful for preventing attacks in those with diverticulosis. For mild diverticulitis, antibiotics by mouth and a liquid diet is recommended. For severe cases, intravenous antibiotics, hospital admission, and complete bowel rest may be recommended. Probiotics are of unclear use. Complications such as abscess formation, fistula formation, and perforation of the colon may require surgery.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{in vitro}} study from Pakistan found 40% of {{isolates}} {{are resistant to}} common antiprotozoal drugs. A study of isolates from patients diagnosed with IBS found 40% of isolates resistant to metronidazole and 32% resistant to furazolidone. Drugs reported in studies {{to be effective in}} eradicating Blastocystis infection have included metronidazole, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX (only trimethoprim is active with sulphamethoxazole demonstrating no activity), tetracycline, doxycycline, nitazoxanide, pentamidine, paromomycin and iodoquinol. Iodoquinol {{has been found to be}} less effective in practice than in-vitro. Miconazole and quinacrine have been reported as effective agents against Blastocystis growth in-vitro. <b>Rifaximin,</b> and albendazole have shown promise as has ivermectin which demonstrated high effectiveness against blastocystis hominis isolates in an in vitro study. There is also evidence that the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and the plant mallotus oppositifolius may be effective against Blastocystis infections.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen-positive {{patients}} were then given a 10-day course of <b>rifaximin,</b> a non-absorbable antibiotic {{that does not}} leave the digestive tract and therefore does not enter the circulation or reach the skin. [...] 96% of patients experienced a complete remission of rosacea symptoms that lasted beyond 9 months. [...] These {{patients were}} also negative when retested for bacterial overgrowth. [...] In the 4% of patients that experienced relapse, {{it was found that}} bacterial overgrowth had returned. [...] These patients were given a second course of <b>rifaximin</b> which again cleared rosacea symptoms and normalized hydrogen excretion.|$|E
2500|$|In another study, it {{was found}} that some rosacea {{patients}} that tested hydrogen-negative were still positive for bacterial overgrowth when using a methane breath test instead. [...] These patients showed little improvement with <b>rifaximin,</b> as found in the previous study, but experienced clearance of rosacea symptoms and normalization of methane excretion following administration of the antibiotic metronidazole, which is effective at targeting methanogenic intestinal bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial {{overgrowth}} {{is usually}} {{treated with a}} course of antibiotics although whether antibiotics should be a first line treatment {{is a matter of}} debate. Some experts recommend probiotics as first line therapy with antibiotics being reserved as a second line treatment for more severe cases of SIBO.

A variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, [...] metronidazole, neomycin, cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitazoxanide have been used; however, the best evidence is for the use of <b>rifaximin.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the United States, <b>rifaximin</b> has {{orphan drug}} status for the {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy. Although high-quality evidence is still lacking, <b>rifaximin</b> appears to be as effective as or more effective than other available treatments for hepatic encephalopathy (such as lactulose), is better tolerated, and may work faster. <b>Rifaximin</b> is taken by mouth. It has minimal side effects, prevents reoccurring encephalopathy, and is associated with high patient satisfaction. Patients are more compliant and satisfied to take this medication than any other due to minimal side effects, prolong remission, and overall cost.The drawbacks to <b>rifaximin</b> are increased cost and lack of robust clinical trials for HE without combination lactulose therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rifaximin</b> {{may also}} be a useful {{addition}} to vancomycin when treating patients with relapsing C. difficile infection. Although exposure to rifamycins in the past may increase risk for resistance, so <b>rifaximin</b> should be avoided in such cases.|$|E
50|$|Tetracyclines {{have been}} the {{mainstay}} of treatment for BLS, but recent studies have concluded <b>Rifaximin</b> to be very effective {{in the treatment of}} BLS.

50|$|<b>Rifaximin</b> {{may be used}} {{to treat}} and prevent traveler's diarrhea.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, Salix Pharmaceuticals holds a US Patent for <b>rifaximin</b> {{and markets}} the drug {{under the name}} Xifaxan. [...] In {{addition}} to receiving FDA approval for traveler’s diarrhea and (marketing approved for) hepatic encephalopathy, <b>rifaximin</b> received FDA approval for IBS in May 2015. No generic formulation {{is available in the}} US and none has appeared {{due to the fact that}} the FDA approval process was ongoing. If <b>rifaximin</b> receives full FDA approval for hepatic encephalopathy it is likely that Salix will maintain marketing exclusivity and be protected from generic formulations until March 24, 2017.|$|E
50|$|It {{is based}} on rifamycin. <b>Rifaximin</b> was {{approved}} for medical use in the United States in 2004. In the United States it costs 62.13 USD per day for 1100 mg of <b>rifaximin</b> (1,864.00 USD per month) as of January 2017. In Russia as of 2016 a similar dose costs 231.25 RUB (approximately 4 USD).|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{the assessment of}} dehydration and replacement of fluid and electrolytes. Administration of antibiotics {{has been shown to}} shorten the course of illness and duration of excretion of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) in adults in endemic areas and in traveller's diarrhea, though the rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics is increasing and they are generally not recommended. The antibiotic used depends upon susceptibility patterns in the particular geographical region. Currently, the antibiotics of choice are fluoroquinolones or azithromycin, with an emerging role for <b>rifaximin.</b> Oral <b>rifaximin,</b> a semisynthetic rifamycin derivative, is an effective and well-tolerated antibacterial for the management of adults with non-invasive traveller's diarrhea. <b>Rifaximin</b> was significantly more effective than placebo and no less effective than ciprofloxacin in reducing the duration of diarrhea. While <b>rifaximin</b> is effective in patients with E. coli-predominant traveller's diarrhea, it appears ineffective in patients infected with inflammatory or invasive enteropathogens.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rifaximin,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Xifaxan among others, is an {{antibiotic}} {{used to treat}} traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. It has poor absorption when taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rifaximin</b> {{interferes with}} {{transcription}} by binding to the β-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase. This {{results in the}} blockage of the translocation step that normally follows {{the formation of the}} first phosphodiester bond, which occurs in the transcription process.|$|E
50|$|Salix Pharmaceuticals {{was founded}} in 1989, in Sunnyvale, CA. From 1992-2001 the company was {{headquartered}} in Palo Alto, CA. Since 2001 {{the company has been}} headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, with Business Development and Intellectual Property functions in Palo Alto, CA. The founding products (balsalazide disodium and <b>rifaximin)</b> were in-licensed from two European pharmaceutical companies for development and commercialization in the USA. Balsalazide disodium was licensed from Biorex Laboratories Ltd., London in 1990, was approved by FDA in 2000 and launched under the tradename, Colazal, by Salix for the treatment of mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. Before going generic in 2007, Colazal reached peak sales of $120M. <b>Rifaximin,</b> was licensed from Alfa Wassermann SpA of Bologna, Italy in 1996 and approved by FDA for the treatment of travelers diarrhea in 2004 and hepatic encephalopathy in 2010. <b>Rifaximin</b> is sold by Salix as Xifaxan, and generated 2014 sales of $650M. In addition to the two founding products, Salix acquired products from Dr. Falk Pharma, GmBH (Apriso, Uceris Foam), Norgine (Moviprep), Progenics (Relistor),, Willmington Pharma (Metozolv). Salix acquired crofelemer from Napo Pharmaceuticals, completed the Phase III development and gained approval in 2013. Crofelemer, launched as Fulyzaq, is approved for the treatment of secretory diarrhea in HIV patients.|$|E
50|$|A {{treatment}} plan may involve lactulose, enemas, {{and use of}} antibiotics such as <b>rifaximin,</b> neomycin, vancomycin, and the quinolones.
