The diameter range was reduced by uniformity thinning to the point where stands carried almost the same basal areas despite the difference in age of 1 year. After uniformity thinning, growth in basal area was slower for the first 3 years; it then increased to equal that of the conventionally thinned plots.

40|$|The {{effect of}} organic carbon {{amendment}} {{on the fate}} of benazolin was investigated in undisturbed soil columns. The soil columns were obtained from three different soil types located in three different regions with different crop production regimes. All soils were operated in a normal crop production regime, and one of the soils was additionally operated in low and high crop production regimes. Two experimental setups were conducted, one using [(14) C]maize straw and nonlabeled benazolin and one using nonlabeled maize straw and [(14) C]benazolin. The column experiments with [(14) C]maize straw showed that the <b>residual</b> <b>crop</b> residues remained mainly in the top layer. Benazolin and its metabolites showed a higher retention in columns that were amended with maize straw compared to column without amendment. The production regimes of the soils did not influence the behavior of benazolin.

To investigate these pollutants during the MTX 2006 period in June, daily gridded emissions from open <b>crop</b> <b>residual</b> burning were developed {{based on a}} bottom-up methodology and using land cover and hotspot information from satellites. This model system which involves daily emissions from open biomass burning, captured monthly-averaged observed concentrations and day-to-day variations in the patterns of O 3 , CO, BC, and OC with good correlation coefficients between models and observations, ranging from 0. 54 to 0. 66. These results were significantly improved from those using annual emissions. For monthly-averaged O 3 , the simulated concentration of 81. 5 ppbv {{was close to the}} observed concentration (82. 5 ppbv). The period of MTX 2006 was roughly divided into two parts: 1) polluted days with heavy open <b>crop</b> <b>residual</b> burning {{in the first half of}} June; 2) cleaner days with negligible field burning in the latter half of June. Additionally, the first half of June was defined by two high pollution episodes during 5 – 7 and 12 – 13 June, and a relatively cleaner episode during 8 – 10 June between these two high pollution episodes. In the first polluted episode, this model captured high O 3 , CO, BC, and OC concentrations at the summit of Mount Tai which were affected by open <b>crop</b> <b>residual</b> burning in the south of CEC and northward transport. For this episode, the impacts from open <b>crop</b> <b>residual</b> burning were 12 % for O 3 , 35 % for CO, 56 % for BC, and 80 % for OC over CEC. The daily emissions from open <b>crop</b> <b>residual</b> burning were an essential factor to evaluate the pollutants during the MTX 2006. These emissions have a large impact not only on primary pollutants but also on secondly pollutions, such as O 3 , in the first half of June over northeastern Asia. On the other hand, this model did not capture the second polluted episode and underestimated observed CO and BC. Improvements of both anthropogenic and open burning emissions and CO inflow from model boundary are necessary to improve both anthropogenic and open burning emissions and CO inflow to evaluate the pollutants using this model...|$|R
30|$|Second, {{following}} Baland et al. (2010), Cooke (1998), and Mekonnen et al. (2015), {{we measure}} the shadow price of searching grazing and water {{as well as}} collecting crop residue for animal as the time taken to search grazing land and water per animal or to collect crop residue per its amount collected multiplied by the village median adjusted 8 off-farm wage. Cooke (1998) and Mekonnen et al. (2015) use shadow price of fuelwood, leaf fodder, water, and grass to measure scarcity. In this paper, we take the wage rate at the village level, and thus, there is no variation in wages for households {{living in the same}} village. In this way, we produce a household specific shadow price of searching grazing land or water and collecting straw. Table  1 reported that the average shadow price for animal watering is about 147 ETB per day which is equivalent to the average daily rural wage rate in the region. On average, the opportunity cost of searching grazing is 205 ETB per day, which is greater than the opportunity cost of water and straw. This is not surprising, as rural farmers usually spend a huge amount of time in searching grazing than watering. As expected, the shadow price of collecting a <b>residual</b> <b>crop</b> is 12 ETB per trip.|$|E
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Katherine E. Strain, for the Master 2 ̆ 7 s {{degree in}} Zoology, {{presented}} on October 21, 2014, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: FATE AND TRANSPORT OF CRY 1 AB FROM TRANSGENIC BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS CORN IN AN AGRICULTURAL FIELD AND AQUATIC MICROCOSMS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Michael Lydy, Ph. D. Genetically-modified crops expressing insecticidal crystalline proteins {{derived from a}} soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), were commercialized almost two decades ago {{as a means to}} combat agricultural pests. The Bt proteins are highly specific and only lethal upon ingestion, limiting the scope of toxicity to target insects. However, evidence for risk to non-target organisms and negative public perceptions on the use of Bt crops has caused controversy surrounding their use. The objective of this research was to monitor the fate and transport of a Bt protein, Cry 1 Ab, in a large-scale agricultural field and in aquatic microcosms. Quantitative methods were validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and then used to evaluate field and laboratory samples. The highest environmental concentrations of the Cry 1 Ab protein were found in runoff water and sediment, up to 130 ng/L and 143 ng/g dry weight, respectively, with the Cry 1 Ab protein detected in both Bt and non-Bt fields. As surface runoff and <b>residual</b> <b>crop</b> debris can transport Bt proteins to waterways adjacent to agricultural fields, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the potential risk to non-target aquatic organisms. The results showed that sediment type and temperature can influence the degradation of the Cry 1 Ab protein in an aquatic system and that the Cry 1 Ab protein can persist for two months. While Cry 1 Ab protein concentrations measured in the field soil indicate little risk to terrestrial organisms, the consistent input of Bt-contaminated runoff and crop debris into agricultural waterways impart chronic risk to non-target aquatic species...|$|E
40|$|Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) {{generally}} grows as clones {{in which}} stems, ranging from many thousands {{to only a}} few, are interconnected by a common root system. When clones are very large, in one recorded case involving about 47 ␣ 000 stems joined together over a 43 ha area, aspen becomes a candidate for earth’s most massive and oldest organism. Recent analyses suggest that aspen clones, although not individual stems, may be essentially immortal. Management of aspen requires {{an understanding of how}} its clonal nature influences responses to silvicultural steps. For many foresters it is a new experience to work with a species that differs from conifers in several important aspects. For example, aspen regulates its density without silvicultural intervention; if silviculturally thinned, aspen may respond by increased sucker production, which can hamper the intended concentration of increment in <b>residual</b> <b>crop</b> trees. A remarkable feature of clonally regenerated aspen suckers is that, after disturbance by fire or clear-cutting, a typical sequence is an early postdisturbance density of 200 ␣ 000 or more root suckers per hectare, which self-thin to less than 25 ␣ 000 stems per hectare by age 6 and to less than 10 ␣ 000 by age 10. The initial high stem densities and subsequent rapid natural thinning are relevant for the definition of stocking standards for aspen. This article outlines key autecological features of aspen in terms of environmental tolerances, growth and site factors, regeneration requirements, and stand dynamics. The focus is on post- 1991 information, which updates other recent reviews on ecology and management of aspen. The need for management innovation is apparent now that technological progress has provided the opportunity to use aspen commercially. In mixed stands over sixty years old the natural elimination of aspen becomes rapid—in the not distant future the aspen in mixed stands of this age will furnish an appreciable amount of pulpwood that will be used, thus avoiding the present total loss of this species...|$|E

We have little knowledge, however, of the <b>residual</b> impacts of <b>crop</b> residues on soil and crop production. We hypothesized that <b>residual</b> impacts of <b>crop</b> residues {{vary with the}} amount of residues used. A 10 -yr study near Lincoln, NE, evaluated the residual effects of an earlier 8 -yr study of various crop residue amounts on crop growth and selected soil properties. From 1978 through 1985, crop residues were returned at 0, 50, 100, and 150 % of the quantity produced by the previous crop (averaging 0 to = 6 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1). Continuous corn (Zea mays L.) was produced 1986 through 1995 on these plots, except sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] was substituted in several years. To study management effects on residual responses, plots were subdivided with or without tillage, N fertilizer (60 kg N ha- 1), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.) cover <b>crop.</b> <b>Residual</b> effects of the 150 % residue amount increased grain production 16 % compared with the 0 % amount (4900 vs. 4250 kg ha- 1, respectively), and were not affected by time or other management practices.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Oct. 14, 2013 - Apr. 14, 2014 Meadowfoam (Limnanthes alba Hartw. ex Benth) seed meal (MSM), a by-product of meadowfoam oil extraction, has a plant defensive compound known as glucosinolate glucolimnanthin (GLN). Myrosinase enzymes present in soil microbes and meadowfoam seeds can convert GLN to glucosinolate breakdown products (GBPs), which demonstrate herbicidal activity and {{have the potential to}} be used as bioherbicides. The goals of this research were {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} MSM on weed control and to explore the optimal timing, rate, and application method for further use of MSM as a bioherbicide. Adding active myrosinase from freshly ground meadowfoam seeds to MSM increased its phytotoxicity. In a greenhouse study, no lettuce emergence was observed for six days in soil amended with 3 % by weight activated MSM. In a field application, MSM provided a nitrogen source and promoted lettuce growth when lettuce seedlings were transplanted seven days after MSM incorporation. Co-occurrence of herbicide and fertilizer effects was observed with all MSM concentrations. MSM concentrations of 5 % and 7 % provided greater weed emergence suppression than the 3 % concentration but no difference in weed biomass was observed between MSM concentrations. A split MSM application resulted in a significant benefit for weed control, similar to a single MSM application; however for the split application, the concentration and time should be adjusted to prevent <b>residual</b> <b>crop</b> injury. Activated MSM inhibited spiny sowthistle (Sonchus asper (L.) Hill) greater than 95 % for emergence and 80 % for biomass compared to the untreated control. Soil microbes reallocated carbon input from MSM application to biomass and enzyme production. The reallocation occurred quickly, within 7 to 14 days, after MSM application. Microbial biomass increased by at least 85 % for carbon and 95 % for nitrogen with MSM application compared to the untreated control. β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was highly correlated with microbial biomass nitrogen and was involved in the acquisition of nitrogen from organic sources. Isothiocyanate showed potent herbicidal activity and was detected only in activated MSM. 3 -Methoxyphenylacetic acid (MPAA), a previously unidentified GBP with herbicidal activity, was discovered in soil amended with non-activated and activated MSM. A single MSM application at 2. 86 kg m⁻² as a pre-emergent soil amendment benefited crop yield, weed suppression, and soil carbon and nitrogen inputs...|$|E

Four soil phases were obtained designated sediment (SED) phase (> 20 microm), microaggregate (MA) phase (2 microm- 20 microm), colloid (COL) phase (< 2 microm) and electrolyte (EL) phase. The distribution of (14) C-benzo(a) pyrene, (14) C-benazolin and organic carbon between the soil phases was established. Enrichment factors for the two chemicals and organic carbon are higher in the COL and MA phases than in the SED phase. The distribution constant K(d) of chemicals for Merzenhausen topsoil was calculated according to two-phase or three-phase partitioning models.

The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass coming from forest <b>residuals,</b> <b>crop</b> residues, and energy crops present a special interest as it is not actually competing with food applications. In this context the present work focuses on an agricultural by product, the corn stalk which is composed of two main anatomical parts: the pith, the inner part constituted of some vascular bundles dispersed in large parenchyma cells, and the rind, composed of closely spaced vascular bundles embedded in small-diameter parenchyma tissue. The alveolar structure observed in the pith is similar to the structure of expanded polystyrene and could explain the insulating properties observed in composites prepared from crop pith like sunflower and corn [1, 2]. One of the challenges to produce crop bio-based insulating boards at large scale is obtaining the pith by a mechanical and scalable method. Dry fractionation processes, which exhibit strong arguments of sustainability (no water consumption or drying of effluents), allowed dissociating plant structures at the relevant scale (0. 5 - 4 mm). In this work, firstly a dry fractionation diagram was developed at the kilogram scale in order to separate the rind from the pith of corn stem internode while preserving pith alveolated structure. Coarse grinding, based on shear as main mechanical stress, allowed dissociating both anatomical parts of the stem.

Application of particular crop production practices such as the integration of different levels of crop residues, diverse parts of wheat straws, at the field level regulate earthworm diversity and population abundance. Indeed, tillage reduced earthworm population with a 35 % rate also corresponding to changes in soil properties. Agricultural practices had to be adapted to include consideration on macro-invertebrate abundance and diversity to maintain efficient soil fertility and allow sustainable crop productio...|$|R
5000|$|Rural {{areas are}} {{predominant}} in developing countries, and {{the rural areas}} in the countries do not have modern energy infrastructure. They have heavily relied on traditional biomass such as fuelwood, charcoal, <b>crop</b> <b>residual,</b> pellets and the likes. Because lack of modern energy infrastructure like power plants, transmission lines, underground pipelines to deliver energy resources such as natural gas, petroleum that need high or cutting edge technologies and extremely high upfront costs, which are beyond their financial and technological capacity. Although some developing countries like BRICs have reached close to the energy-related technological level of developed countries and have financial power, still most developing countries are dominated by traditional biomass. According to the International Energy Agency IEA, [...] "use of traditional biomass will decrease in many countries, but {{is likely to increase}} in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa alongside population growth." ...|$|R
50|$|Beef {{production}} {{tends to}} be concentrated, with the top six producers—the U.S., the European Union, Brazil, Australia, Argentina, and Russia—accounting for about 60% of global production. Significant shifts among producers have occurred over time. Cattle production worldwide is differentiated by animal genetics and feeding methods, resulting in differing quality types. Cattle are basically <b>residual</b> claimants to <b>crop</b> or land resources. Those countries with excess or low-value land tend to grass-feed their cattle herds, while those countries with excess feed grains, such as the U.S. and Canada, finish cattle with a grain ration. Grain-fed cattle have more internal fat (i.e., marbling) which results in a more tender meat than forage-fed cattle of a similar age. In some Asian countries such as Japan, {{which is not a}} grain surplus country, tastes and preferences have encouraged feeding grain to cattle, but at a high cost since the grain must be imported.|$|R
40|$|The biomass {{of sweet}} sorghum is very high, so, sweet sorghum is called “High Energy Crop”. In this system, sweet sorghum {{is used as}} the cock. Black fungus or another fungus is interplanted in the furrow between rows of sweet sorghum in the field. The seed of sweet sorghum {{can be used as}} food or fodder; the leaves can be used to feed cow or fish. The stem of sweet sorghum can be used as {{material}} for making wine or ethanol fuel. The residue after brewing wine can be used as fodder for cow; the dejecta of cow and <b>residuals</b> of <b>crops</b> can be used as the materials for making biogas. The biogas can be used for cooking dinner or is burnt in greenhouse or plastic shed to increase illumination and heat, {{at the same time the}} CO 2 released can encourage the growth and development of vegetables or ornamental plants in greenhouse or plastic shed. The residual can be used as fertilizer in the field. In this case, a sustainable agro-ecology system is formed for encouraging the development of energy, agriculture, stockbreeding and fishery in the countryside. This system has higher economic benefits. The output value can reach about 180, 000 RMB Yuan/ha and it is 10 - 20 times higher than growing traditional crops such as wheat or corn. This system is a unique innovation with practicability and looking forward. It can be used in the areas where it is suitable to grow sweet sorghum...|$|R
40|$|The <b>residual</b> {{effects of}} <b>crop</b> {{residues}} on N availability and crop growth are largely unknown. A field experiment was conducted from 1986 through 1988 at Lincoln, NE, {{to determine the}} residual effects on no-till corn (Zea mays L.) production and N uptake of 0, 50, 100, and 15092 ̆ 70 {{of the amount of}} crop residues produced by the previous crop during the previous 5 yr. These effects were evaluated with and without tillage (disking), N fertilizer (60 kg N ha- 1), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth ssp. villosa, 2 ̆ 7 Madison 2 ̆ 7) winter cover crop. Increasing the previous crop residue rate increased organic C, total N, and NO 3 -N in the upper 30 cm of soil as much as 10, 12, and 66 V 0, respectively. Growth and N uptake by corn (3 -yr average) generally increased as previous residue rate increased. Corn grain and stover production was 17 and 25...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture is {{not only}} {{appointed}} to produce food but {{has the potential to}} provide a range of ecosystem services (ES) depending on the management options adopted at field scale. Information on the impact of management practices adopted in fruit tree crops on ES is fragmented and often not fully codified. This paper focuses on some Mediterranean fruit tree crops i. e. peach (Prunus persica), apricot (Prunus armeniaca), olive (Olea europaea) groves and vineyards (Vitis vinifera), and links mainly soil processes and functions to the provisioning, regulating and sociocultural ES. The effects of field practices (e. g., tillage/no-tillage, cover crops, retention/burning of pruning residues, mineral/organic fertilization) on manageable soil properties (e. g., porosity, organic carbon content, composition of microbial community) and related functions (e. g., supply of nutrients, water storage, soil stability, above-ground biodiversity) were examined. The analysis draws the attention to the pivotal role of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks on soil aggregates and erodibility, soil water storage, use of fresh water for irrigation, plant nutrition, biodiversity, nutrient storage and absorption of pesticides. Sociocultural services delivered by tree crops are also discussed. This paper highlights the dependence of ES on the sustainable field practices adopted, particularly those aimed at increasing SOC stocks (e. g., no tillage, increased carbon input, recycling of pruning <b>residuals,</b> cover <b>crops).</b> The outcomes presented may strengthen the significance of increasing SOC management practices for fruit tree crops and be supportive of the implementation of environmentally friendly policies assisting in the conservation or the improvement of the soil natural capital...|$|R
40|$|Corn growth {{conditions}} and yield are closely dependent on climate variability. Leaf growth, measured as the leaf area index, {{can be used}} to identify changes in crop growth in response to climate stress. This research was conducted to capture patterns of spatial and temporal corn leaf growth under climate stress for the St. Joseph River watershed, in northeastern Indiana. Leaf growth is represented by the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) retrieved from multiple years (2000 – 2010) of Landsat 5 TM images. By comparing NDVI values for individual image dates with the derived normal curve, the response of crop growth to environmental factors is quantified as NDVI residuals. Regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between yield and NDVI residual during the pre-silking period, indicating that NDVI <b>residuals</b> reflect <b>crop</b> stress in the early growing period that impacts yield. Both the mean NDVI residuals and the percentage of image pixels where corn was under stress (risky pixel rate) are significantly correlated with water stress. Dry weather is prone to hamper potential crop growth, with stress affecting most of the observed corn pixels in the area. Oversupply of rainfall {{at the end of the}} growing season was not found to have a measurable effect on crop growth, while above normal precipitation earlier in the growing season reduces the risk of yield loss at the watershed scale. The spatial extent of stress is much lower when precipitation is above normal than under dry conditions, masking the impact of small areas of yield loss at the watershed scale...|$|R
