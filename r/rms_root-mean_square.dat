40|$|A new {{technique}} is presented for {{the incorporation of}} ionosonde observations into GPS ionospheric tomography. This approach greatly improves the vertical resolution of the images when using independent incoherent scatter radar observations as ground truth, addressing a traditional weakness of tomographic techniques. Ionosonde observations are used to set vertical basis functions adaptively within the inversion {{as well as providing}} electron density information for direct assimilation. The technique also improves slant total electron content (TEC) accuracy {{in the vicinity of the}} ionosonde. An experiment was performed in the equatorial region of South America as a 6 -day case study due to the availability of incoherent scatter and ionosonde data during this period. Preliminary results were validated with the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar and independent GPS slant TEC observations. Using the incoherent scatter radar as ground truth for the vertical profile, the {{new technique}} reduces mean NmF 2 error to - 0. 07 × 10 11 electrons/m 3 compared with 0. 27 × 10 11 electrons/m 3 in a control run with no ionosonde data, while <b>root-mean</b> <b>square</b> error is now 0. 5 × 10 11 electrons/m 3 compared with 1. 0 × 10 11 electrons/m 3 in the control.

40|$|Medical {{record linkage}} is {{becoming}} increasingly important as clinical data is distributed across independent sources. To improve linkage accuracy we studied different name comparison methods that establish agreement or disagreement between corresponding names. In addition to exact raw name matching and exact phonetic name matching, we tested three approximate string comparators. The approximate comparators included the modified Jaro-Winkler method, the longest common substring, and the Levenshtein edit distance. We also calculated the combined <b>root-mean</b> <b>square</b> of all three. We tested each name comparison method using a deterministic record linkage algorithm. Results were consistent across both hospitals. At a threshold comparator score of 0. 8, the Jaro-Winkler comparator achieved the highest linkage sensitivities of 97. 4 % and 97. 7 %. The combined <b>root-mean</b> <b>square</b> method achieved sensitivities higher than the Levenshtein edit distance or longest common substring while sustaining high linkage specificity.

40|$|Primary {{production}} (PP) {{was determined}} using 14 C uptake at 117 {{stations in the}} Atlantic Ocean to validate three PP satellite algorithms of varying complexity. An empirical satellite algorithm based on log chlorophyll-a had the highest bias and <b>root-mean</b> <b>square</b> error compared with measured 14 C PP and tended to under-estimate PP. The vertical generalised production model improved PP estimates and was the most accurate algorithm in the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETRA) and Western Tropical Atlantic (WTRA), but tended to over-estimate PP in eutrophic provinces. A photosynthesis-light wavelength-resolved model was the most accurate over the Atlantic basin, having the lowest mean log-difference error, <b>root-mean</b> <b>square</b> error and bias, and exhibited a superior performance in six out of the nine ecological provinces surveyed. Using this algorithm and mean monthly SeaWiFS fields, a PP time series was generated for the Atlantic Ocean from 1998 to 2005 which was compared with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea-surface temperature (SST) data. There was a significant negative correlation between SST and PP in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre Province (NAST), North Atlantic Tropical Gyre (NATR), and WTRA suggesting that recent warming trends in these provinces are coupled with a decrease in phytoplankton production. ...|$|R

40|$|Bodyweight (BW) is an {{essential}} outcome measure for weight management and is also a major predictor in the estimation of daily energy expenditure (EE). Many individuals, particularly those who are overweight, tend to underreport their BW, posing a challenge for monitors that track physical activity and estimate EE. The ability to automatically estimate BW can potentially increase the practicality and accuracy of these monitoring systems. This paper investigates the feasibility of automatically estimating BW and using this BW to estimate energy expenditure with a footwear-based, multisensor activity monitor. The SmartShoe device uses small pressure sensors embedded in key weight support locations of the insole and a heel-mounted 3 D accelerometer. Bodyweight estimates for 9 subjects are computed from pressure sensor measurements when an automatic classification algorithm recognizes a standing posture. We compared the accuracy of EE prediction using estimated BW {{compared to that of}} using the measured BW. The results show that point pressure measurement is capable of providing rough estimates of body weight (<b>root-mean</b> <b>squared</b> error of 10. 52 kg) which in turn provide a sufficient replacement of manually-entered bodyweight for the purpose of EE prediction (<b>root-mean</b> <b>squared</b> error of 0. 7456 METs vs. 0. 6972 METs).
