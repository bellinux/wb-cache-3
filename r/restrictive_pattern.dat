40|$|Objective : To {{determine}} whether a <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> on spirometry {{is associated with the}} level of physical activity in daily life (PADL), as well as with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, in asymptomatic adults. Methods : A total of 374 participants (mean age, 41 ± 14 years) underwent spirometry, which included the determination of FVC and FEV 1. A <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> on spirometry was defined as an FEV 1 /FVC ratio > 0. 7 and an FVC < 80 % of the predicted value. After conducting demographic, anthropometric, and CVD risk assessments, we evaluated body composition, muscle function, and postural balance, as well as performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing and administering the six-minute walk test. The PADL was quantified with a triaxial accelerometer. Results : A <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> on spirometry was found in 10 % of the subjects. After multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for confounders (PADL and cardiorespiratory fitness), the following variables retained significance (OR; 95 % CI) as predictors of a restrictive pattern: systemic arterial hypertension (17. 5; 1. 65 - 184. 8), smoking (11. 6; 1. 56 - 87. 5), physical inactivity (8. 1; 1. 43 - 46. 4), larger center-of-pressure area while standing on a force platform (1. 34; 1. 05 - 1. 71); and dyslipidemia (1. 89; 1. 12 - 1. 98). Conclusions : A <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> on spirometry appears to be common in asymptomatic adults.

One effective approach for this challenge is to use Logic-in-Memory (LiM) blocks, whereby custom application-specific logic is embedded within the memory block to significantly improve the system’s energy, performance, and area efficiency. Recent studies on technology scaling below the 20 nm node demonstrate that extremely <b>restrictive</b> <b>patterning</b> enables the automated synthesis of LiM systems {{by the use of}} compatible logic and memory patterns. While in-memory processing architectures have been proposed and successfully built for various applications, this dissertation aims to exploit the extremely <b>restrictive</b> <b>patterning</b> to create an end-to-end design methodology for automated synthesis of application-specific LiM blocks. The LiM synthesis methodology eliminates all the full-custom design effort that is inherently needed to build a LiM block, thereby enabling the co-design of algorithms and hardware at an affordable design cost that would be otherwise impractical. Silicon results for two data-intensive applications demonstrate that systems based on synthesized LiM designs can provide dramatic improvements of one to two orders of magnitude of energy and performance efficiency. This methodology further enables rapid design-space exploration for the overall LiM based system by making customization efficient and robust with no extra design-cost.

40|$|Background Current {{guidelines}} {{for the use of}} implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are broad and significantly increase the cost of caring for patients with heart failure. In an effort to identify the specific subset of patients who benefit from this therapy, the predictive value of numerous echocardiographic parameters have been studied. Severe diastolic dysfunction has been shown to predict adverse events in a group of patients who received an ICD for secondary prevention, but has not been tested in those who receive ICDs for primary prevention. Hypothesis We tested the hypothesis that a restrictive mitral inflow pattern on echocardiography will predict the risk of appropriate therapy in this patient population. Methods This retrospective study identified 145 consecutive patients who met primary prevention criteria for ICD implantation and had an echo performed no more than 1 year prior to receiving the ICD. A <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> was defined as a mitral inflow E/A > 2 or a deceleration time < 150 ms. Results A <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> was present in 69 patients (40. 7 % of the group). Appropriate ICD therapy occurred in 8 (11. 5 %) subjects with a <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> and 14 (18. 4 %) with a nonrestrictive pattern over 680 days of average follow-up (P = not significant). Cox regression analysis showed the presence of a <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> was not helpful in predicting time to first ICD therapy. Conclusions In a population of patients who received ICDs for primary prevention, echocardiographic findings of severe diastolic dysfunction were not helpful in targeting the use of ICDs to those at highest risk.

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} a complex {{syndrome}} characterized by impaired emptying and/or impaired filling of the heart chambers. The use of parameters of diastolic function has provided novel tools for risk stratification and management of patients with heart failure. This study evaluated the potential correlation between apoptosis at time of death and left ventricular (LV) diastolic function after acute myocardial infarction. We selected, at routine postmortem examination, 14 subjects who died 10 to 62 days after an acute myocardial infarction and had an available echocardiographic report from the most recent hospital admission. The apoptotic rate was calculated at the region bordering the infarct, using co-localization of in situ end-labeling for deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation and immunohistochemistry for caspase- 3. Transthoracic echocardiographic studies were retrospectively reevaluated and pulse-wave Doppler spectra of mitral inflow were analyzed. LV diastolic function was assessed by measuring the ratio of E peak velocity to A peak velocity and E-wave deceleration time; a ratio of E peak velocity to A peak velocity >or= 2 and deceleration time < 115 ms were considered a restrictive filling pattern. A <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> was found in 4 cases (29 %). All subjects with a <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> were symptomatic for New York Heart Association class IV heart failure (100 % vs 20 %, p = 0. 015) and had larger transverse heart diameters at pathology (p = 0. 014). The apoptotic rate in the peri-infarct region was significantly higher in patients with a restrictive versus nonrestrictive diastolic pattern (13 %, 10 to 14, vs 3 %, 1 to 6, p = 0. 014). At multivariable analysis that included the <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern,</b> class IV heart failure, and cardiac diameters, the <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> remained an independent predictor of increased apoptosis (p = 0. 030).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate echocardiographic characteristics among patients with severe AS and AF and to identify factors associated with the development of new-onset AF after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods 125 patients with severe AS and ejection fraction > 40 % scheduled for AVR were evaluated preoperatively and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postoperatively with electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography, and Holter-ECG analysis was performed after 3 and 12 months. The primary endpoint was new-onset AF defined as an episode of AF exceeding 30 s, on the ECG or Holter-ECG and/or patients hospitalized due to AF. ResultsAF was present in 19 patients prior to AVR, compared to patients in sinus rhythm AF patients had increased NT-proBNP, increased left atrial (LA) volume (61 ± 21 vs. 47 ± 17 ml/m 2, p = 0. 002), reduced global longitudinal left ventricular strain (− 13. 1 ± 3. 7 vs. − 16. 0 ± 3. 5, p = 0. 002) and presented more often with a <b>restrictive</b> filling <b>pattern</b> (37 % vs. 10 %, p = 0. 002).

It was hypothesized that normal reference values were inappropriate to interpret data collected in such patients. To substantiate this hypothesis, DlCO and DlCO/VA were measured in four groups: (1) normal volunteers in whom both indices were measured at five different VA; (2) patients with high VA; (3) emphysematous patients; and (4) patients with diffuse interstitial lung diseases (DILD). In normal subjects, DlCO increased and DlCO/VA decreased with VA. In patients with overinflated lungs, the percentage of DlCO was more increased than DlCO/VA. In the emphysematous patients, both indices were equally decreased. In patients with DILD, DlCO was significantly more decreased than DlCO/VA in those suffering from a <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern.</b> Theoretical values were re-calculated taking into account their true VA and using the relationships observed between DlCO, DlCO/VA and VA.

However, improvement in patients with <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> is occasionally seen. We aim to determine the clinical significance of a bronchodilator responsive restrictive defect. Methods. Patients with restrictive spirometry and a bronchodilator study were identified at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City VAMC between September 2003 and December 2009. Restriction {{was defined as a}} decreased FVC and FEV 1, with normal FEV 1 /FVC. Responsiveness to bronchodilators was defined as an improvement in FEV 1 and/or FVC of at least 12 % and 200 [*]mL. Patients with lung volume measurements had their clinical and radiographic records reviewed. Results. Twenty-one patients were included in the study. Most were current or ex-smokers, with most being on bronchodilators. The average FVC and FEV 1 were 65 ± 11 % and 62 ± 10 % of the predicted, respectively. Most patients (66 %) had a normal TLC, averaging 90 ± 16 % of the predicted. RV, RV/TLC, and the TLC-VA values strongly suggested an obstructive defect. Conclusions.

Biopsy specimen from lungs obtained through bronchoscopy was suggestive of extensive interstitial fibrosis with honey combing.|$|E

Methods: This descriptive study included 25 children with {{chronic kidney disease}} on regular hemodialysis. They were selected from a pediatric hemodialysis unit {{during the period from}} June 2015 to January 2016. Spirometry was done, and those with abnormal values were assessed by HRCT of the chest and echocardiography. Results: Among 25 children with abnormal spirometry on regular hemodialysis, there was a decrease in spirometric indices in patients on hemodialysis with a tendency to the <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> (19 patients; 76...|$|E
40|$|The {{restrictive}} spirometric {{pattern is}} associated with a substantial morbidity and mortality burden. We sought to determine to what extent spirometric restriction {{is associated with}} impaired quality of life. We used data from two large population-based European cohorts: 6698 European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) and 6069 Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) adult participants. The <b>restrictive</b> <b>pattern</b> was defined as forced expiratory volume in 1  s (FEV 1) /forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥lower limit of normal (LLN) and FV...|$|E
40|$|One crucial {{aspect of}} privacy {{preserving}} frequent itemset mining {{is the fact}} that the mining process deals with a trade-o#: privacy and accuracy, which are typically contradictory, and improving one usually incurs a cost in the other. One alternative to address this particular problem is to look for a balance between hiding <b>restrictive</b> <b>patterns</b> and disclosing nonrestrictive ones. In this paper, we propose a new framework for enforcing privacy in mining frequent itemsets. We combine, in a single framework, techniques for e#ciently hiding restrictive patterns: a transaction retrieval engine relying on an inverted file and Boolean queries; and a set of algorithms to "sanitize" a database. In addition, we introduce performance measures for mining frequent itemsets that quantify the fraction of mining patterns which are preserved after sanitizing a database. We also report the results of a performance evaluation of our research prototype and an analysis of the results...|$|R

Lung function tests are often performed using spirometry. Approach: The present study aims at detecting obstructive and restrictive pulmonary abnormalities. Lung function tests are often performed using spirometry. In this study, the data were obtained from 250 volunteers with standard recording protocol in order to detect and classify pulmonary diseases into normal, obstructive and restrictive. Firstly, spirometric data was statistically analyzed concerning its significance for neural networks. Then, such parameters were presented as input to MLP and recurrent networks. Results: These two networks detected normal and abnormal disorders as well as obstructive and <b>restrictive</b> <b>patterns,</b> respectively. Moreover, the output data was confirmed by measuring accuracy and sensitivity. Conclusion: The results show that the proposed method could be useful for detecting the function of respiratory system...|$|R
