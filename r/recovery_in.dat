5|$|After {{the closure}} of the uranium mines in Elliot Lake, in 1990, the revenue {{prospects}} of the mall dropped sharply, with no <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> sight. This prompted the Algoma Central Company to write off over $5 million in lost property value, despite 98% occupancy.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{given that}} both {{population}} and prosperity increased substantially in this period, economic <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> Byzantium {{appears to have}} been strengthening the economic basis of the state. This helps to explain how the Komnenian emperors, Manuel Komnenos in particular, were able to project their power and influence so widely at this time.|$|E
40|$|Job {{polarization}} {{refers to}} the recent disappearance of employment in occupations {{in the middle of}} the skill distribution. Jobless recoveries {{refers to the}} slow rebound in aggregate employment following recent recessions, despite <b>recoveries</b> <b>in</b> aggregate output. We show how these two phenomena are related. First, job polarization is not a gradual process; essentially all of the job loss in middle-skill occupations occurs in economic downturns. Second, jobless <b>recoveries</b> <b>in</b> the aggregate are accounted for by jobless <b>recoveries</b> <b>in</b> the middle-skill occupations that are disappearing...|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} clue to {{its nature}} {{is provided by}} {{an account of the}} Stone's <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava or a stony meteorite, though it would be compatible with it being glass or pumice.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 1950 Census showed {{growth in}} Teaneck (33.6%) pacing Bergen County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a {{substantial}} {{decline in the}} rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached the limits of developable land, and the township neared its peak population. Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) was smaller than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).|$|E

The velocities increased a few tenths of a percent immediately after the SSE began and did not change after that.

5|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, their {{population}} was feared to have declined {{past the point}} of <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos, and possibly no males, survived. Conservationists debated whether or not the Vietnamese rhinoceros had any chance of survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others arguing that the population could recover.|$|E
5|$|Edward did {{not have}} much to do with any of this; after around 1375 he played a limited role in the {{government}} of the realm. Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large abscess. After a brief period of <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21 June. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, King Richard II, son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8 June 1376.|$|E

The syndrome is named after the French neurologists Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who described it with André Strohl in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{species of}} benthic foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, presumably because {{they depend on}} organic debris for nutrients, since the biomass in the ocean {{is thought to have}} decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, however, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. Phytoplankton <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene.|$|E

5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete <b>recovery.</b> <b>In</b> cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Rockies {{ecoregion}} supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} stable lesions (stageI and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. <b>Recovery</b> <b>in</b> juveniles {{can be attributed to}} the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stageIII and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{protected}} in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended {{to all of}} North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' <b>recovery,</b> <b>in</b> 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States {{due to the fact}} that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|There {{was still}} fog on the plateau on 1 September, but by 15:00 CEST it was {{possible}} to fly a team there by helicopter. Because the fog stayed, the team retained work until 03:00 CEST in the night. In the following days, the fog lifted, making work and transport easier. By 5 September, all bodies had been recovered and the work at the plateau could be terminated. The <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> the valley was completed two days later. The accident resulted in about 40 journalists staying in Svalbard to cover the story. The Norwegian authority's costs related to the investigation and other activities related to the accident were estimated at 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK).|$|E
