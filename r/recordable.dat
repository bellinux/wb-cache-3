5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing the murals {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style {{similar to those used}} when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new <b>recordable</b> digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E
25|$|The SD card added Content Protection for <b>Recordable</b> Media (CPRM) {{security}} circuitry {{for digital}} rights management (DRM) content-protection.|$|E
25|$|Video CDs {{were unable}} to gain {{acceptance}} as a mainstream format in North America, chiefly because the established VHS format was less expensive, offered comparable video quality, and could be recorded over. The advent of <b>recordable</b> CDs, inexpensive recorders, and compatible DVD players spurred VCD acceptance in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, DVD burners and DVD-Video recorders were available by that time, and equipment and media costs for making DVD-Video fell rapidly. DVD-Video, with its longer run time and much higher quality, quickly overshadowed VCD in areas that could afford it. In addition many early DVD players could not read <b>recordable</b> (CD-R) media, and this limited the compatibility of home-made VCDs. Almost every modern stand-alone DVD-Video player can play VCDs burned on <b>recordable</b> media.|$|E
25|$|The <b>recordable</b> audio CD is {{designed}} to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder. These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS (Serial Copy Management System), an early form of digital rights management (DRM), to conform to the AHRA (Audio Home Recording Act). The <b>Recordable</b> Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-R due to lower production volume and a 3% AHRA royalty used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.|$|E
25|$|Only the {{contents}} of an Audio CD may be ripped to the HDD. Copying to the HDD from other <b>recordable</b> media or storage devices is not supported.|$|E
25|$|Diffraction {{patterns}} {{can have}} a large dynamic range, and for crystalline samples, may have intensities greater than those <b>recordable</b> by CCD. As such, TEMs may still be equipped with film cartridges {{for the purpose of}} obtaining these images, as the film is a single use detector.|$|E
25|$|After AutoRun completes, AutoPlay initiates {{by doing}} an {{examination}} of the volume for content. This is called content sniffing. AutoPlay decides whether the volume is an Audio CD, movie DVD, a blank <b>recordable</b> medium (a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+R etc.) or a generic volume which contains files.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the DVDs, {{and all of the}} CDs mailed by the project, were recorded on <b>recordable</b> media by volunteers. However, the new dual layer DVDs were manufactured, as it proved more economical than having volunteers burn them. , the project has mailed approximately 40,000 discs.|$|E
25|$|On 26 September 2008, the Walmart Music Team {{notified}} {{its customers}} via email {{they would be}} shutting down their DRM servers 9 October 2008, and any DRM-encumbered music acquired from them {{would no longer be}} accessible unless backed up to a <b>recordable</b> CDs (a non-DRM format) before that date.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{production}} of blank (<b>recordable)</b> Compact Cassettes began in 1964 in Hanover, Germany. Prerecorded music cassettes (also known as Music-Cassettes, and later just Musicassettes; M.C. for short) were launched in Europe in late 1965. The Mercury Record Company, a US affiliate of Philips, introduced M.C. to the US in July 1966. The initial offering consisted of 49 titles.|$|E
25|$|In January 2006, Smith began {{circulating}} a {{draft of}} the Digital Content Protection Act of 2006. The legislation would grant the Federal Communications Commission the authority to authorize a technology known as the broadcast flag. This technology would enable the producers of television programming to ensure the programs cannot be recorded by viewers in their homes, for instance using a digital video recorder or onto <b>recordable</b> DVDs.|$|E
25|$|Windows Live OneCare Backup and Restore is the {{component}} that aids in backing up important files. Files can be backed up to various <b>recordable</b> media, such as external hard disks, CDs, and DVDs. When restoring files, the entirety or {{a subset of}} them can also be restored to a networked computer, as long as it's running OneCare as well. The Backup and Restore component supports backup software features such as incremental backups and scheduling.|$|E
25|$|The program area is 86.05cm2 and {{the length}} of the <b>recordable</b> spiral is (86.05cm2/1.6µm)=5.38km. With a {{scanning}} speed of 1.2m/s, the playing time is 74 minutes, or 650MiB of data on a CD-ROM. A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players (though some old ones fail). Using a linear velocity of 1.2m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5µm increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700MiB.|$|E
25|$|Projects {{attempting}} to establish new consumer electronics products lost money. An RCA Studio II home video game console, introduced in 1977, was canceled just under {{two years later}} due to poor sales. A capacitance electronic (CED) videodisc, marketed under the SelectaVision name, was launched in 1981, but never developed the manufacturing volumes needed to substantially bring down its price, {{and was unable to}} compete against cheaper, <b>recordable</b> videotape technology. It was abandoned in 1985 for a write-off of several hundred million dollars.|$|E
25|$|Sandbags 0-Till-10: Some players use {{the last}} digit {{of the score}} to count sandbags, but do not regard that digit as {{being part of the}} score. For example, as score of 54 points {{translates}} to 50 <b>recordable</b> points with 4 sandbags. In this manner, sandbags are in effect worth nothing until a player accumulates 10 of them, at which point they trigger a 100-point deduction. Bags are thus kept separate from the score and cannot be used as a tiebreaker.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{storage devices}} {{are among the}} {{cheapest}} methods of mass data storage after the hard drive. They are slower than their flash-based counterparts. Standard 12cm optical discs are larger than flash drives and more subject to damage. Smaller optical media do exist, such as business card CD-Rs which have the same dimensions as a credit card, and the slightly less convenient but higher capacity 8cm <b>recordable</b> MiniCD and MiniDVD. The small discs are {{more expensive than the}} standard size, and do not work in all drives.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt to}} enhance the {{existing}} 3½-inch designs was the SuperDisk in the late 1990s, utilizing very narrow data tracks and a high precision head guidance mechanism with a capacity of 120 MB and backward-compatibility with standard 3½-inch floppies; a format war briefly occurred between SuperDisk and other high-density floppy-disk products, although ultimately <b>recordable</b> CDs/DVDs, solid-state flash storage, and eventually online storage would render all these removable disk formats obsolete. External USB-based floppy disk drives are still available, and many modern systems provide firmware support for booting from such drives.|$|E
25|$|From the {{population}} abstracts from 1811 until its evolution into a parish the settlement was a rural one large enough {{in size to}} be official classed as a statistically <b>recordable</b> hamlet. Tongham's now dismantled railway with a station here was important for transporting materials to build the new military camp of Aldershot from 1856 until 1870 and the row of shops developed from this line. Its Church was completed in 1865 and Tongham (which had previously {{been part of the}} parish of Seale) was made into a separate parish the following year.|$|E
25|$|A further radical {{step was}} to abandon the 3½-inch floppy disk drive which had been present in every Macintosh since the first in 1984. Apple argued that <b>recordable</b> CDs, the Internet, and office {{networks}} were quickly making diskettes obsolete, however, Apple's omission generated controversy. At the time of iMac's introduction, third-party manufacturers offered external USB floppy disk drives, often in translucent plastic to match the iMac's enclosure. Apple had initially announced the internal modem in the iMac would operate at only 33.6 kbit/s rather than the new 56 kbit/s speed, but was forced by consumer pressure to adopt the faster standard.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{development}} of the cassette effectively ceased when digital <b>recordable</b> media, such as DAT and MiniDisc, were introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Anticipating the switch from analog to digital format, major companies, such as Sony, shifted their focus to new media. In 1992, Philips introduced the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), a DAT-like tape in almost the same shell as a Compact Cassette. It was aimed primarily at the consumer market. A DCC deck could play back both types of cassettes. Unlike DAT, which was accepted in professional usage because it could record without lossy compression effects, DCC failed in both home and mobile environments, and was discontinued in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The CD {{was planned}} to be the {{successor}} of the vinyl record for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention. In June 1985, the computer-readable CD-ROM (read-only memory) and, in 1990, CD-Recordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips. <b>Recordable</b> CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD.|$|E
25|$|Because DVD-Video's content-scrambling system (CSS) {{was quickly}} broken, DVD-Audio's {{developers}} sought a better method of blocking unauthorized duplications. They developed CPPM, {{which uses a}} media key block (MKB) to authenticate DVD-Audio players. In order to decrypt the audio, players must obtain a media key from the MKB, which also is encrypted. The player must use its own unique key to decrypt the MKB. If a DVD-Audio player's decryption key is compromised, that key can be rendered useless for decrypting future DVD-Audio discs. DVD-Audio discs can also utilize digital watermarking technology developed by the Verance Corporation, typically embedded into the audio once every thirty seconds. If a DVD-Audio player encounters a watermark on a disc without a valid MKB, it will halt playback. The 4C Entity also developed a similar specification, Content Protection for <b>Recordable</b> Media (CPRM), which is used on Secure Digital cards.|$|E
25|$|Image Mastering API (IMAPI v2) enables DVD burning {{support for}} applications, in {{addition}} to CD burning. IMAPI v2 supports multiple optical drives, even recording to multiple drives simultaneously, unlike IMAPI in Windows XP which only supported recording with one optical drive at a time. In addition, multiple filesystems are supported. Applications using IMAPI v2 can create, and burn disc images—it is extensible {{in the sense that}} developers can write their own specific media formats and create their own file systems for its programming interfaces. IMAPI v2 is implemented as a DLL rather than as a service {{as was the case in}} Windows XP, and is also scriptable using VBScript. IMAPI v2 is also available for Windows XP. With the Windows Feature Pack for Storage installed, IMAPI 2.0 supports <b>Recordable</b> Blu-ray Disc (BD-R) and Rewritable Blu-ray Disc (BD-RE) media as well. Windows DVD Maker can burn DVD-Video discs, while Windows Explorer can burn data on DVDs (DVD±R, DVD±R DL, DVD±R RW) {{in addition to}} DVD-RAM and CDs.|$|E
500|$|The {{apparition}} of 87BC {{was recorded}} in Babylonian tablets which state that the comet was seen [...] "day beyond day" [...] for a month. This appearance may be recalled in the representation of Tigranes the Great, an Armenian king who is depicted on coins with a crown that features, according to Vahe Gurzadyan and R. Vardanyan, [...] "a star with a curved tail [...] may represent the passage of Halley's Comet in 87BC." [...] Gurzadyan and Vardanyan argue that [...] "Tigranes could have seen Halley's Comet when it passed closest to the Sun on August 6 in 87BC" [...] as the comet {{would have been a}} [...] "most <b>recordable</b> event"; for ancient Armenians it could have heralded the New Era of the brilliant King of Kings.|$|E
2500|$|The AHRA's {{definition}} of [...] "digital audio recording media" [...] explicitly excludes pre-recorded but <b>recordable</b> media, and storage media used primarily to store information other than musical works.|$|E
2500|$|The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 (AHRA) {{amended the}} United States {{copyright}} law by adding Chapter 10, [...] "Digital Audio Recording Devices and Media". The act enabled {{the release of}} <b>recordable</b> digital formats such as Sony and Philips' Digital Audio Tape without fear of contributory infringement lawsuits.|$|E
2500|$|High-capacity <b>recordable</b> CD is a higher-density {{recording}} format that can hold 90 or 99 minutes of audio on a [...] disc (compared to about 80 minutes for Red Book audio) or 30 minutes of audio on an [...] disc (compared to about 24 minutes for Red Book audio). The higher capacity {{is incompatible with}} some recorders and recording software.|$|E
2500|$|The Compact Cassette or Musicassette (MC), also {{commonly}} called cassette tape, audio cassette, or simply tape or cassette, is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio recording and playback. It {{was released by}} Philips in 1962, having been developed in Hasselt, Belgium. Compact cassettes come in two forms, either already containing content as a pre-recorded cassette, or as a fully <b>recordable</b> [...] "blank" [...] cassette. Both forms are reversible by the user.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Recordable</b> Compact Discs, CD-Rs, are injection-molded with a [...] "blank" [...] data spiral. A {{photosensitive}} dye is then applied, {{after which}} the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the CD recorder changes the colour of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard CD player to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the Orange Book standard.|$|E
2500|$|Snowfall in South Carolina is {{somewhat}} uncommon {{in most of}} the state, while coastal areas receive less than an inch (2.5cm) annually on average. It is not uncommon for areas along the coast (especially the southern coast) to receive no <b>recordable</b> snowfall in a given year. The interior receives a little more snow, although nowhere in the state averages more than [...] of snow annually. The mountains of extreme northwestern South Carolina tend to have the most substantial snow accumulation. Freezing rain and ice tend to be more common than snow {{in many areas of the}} state. Road bridges in South Carolina are commonly marked, [...] "Bridge ices before road." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Recordable</b> CDs {{with even}} greater capacity, {{compatible}} with existing infrastructure of CD-ROM drives, made the expensive new high-capacity floppy technologies obsolete. The floppy disk's remaining reusability advantage was then eliminated by re-writeable CDs. However, writing and rewriting CDs was never as fast or convenient as writing on floppy disks, when the data fits {{on one or}} two floppy disks. Networking, advancements in flash-based devices, and widespread adoption of USB provided another alternative that in turn made both floppy disks and optical storage obsolete for some purposes. The rise of file sharing and multi-megapixel digital photography encouraged the use of files larger than most 3½-inch disks, the largest-capacity standard disks, could hold. Floppy disks were commonly used as sneakernet carriers for file transfer, but the broad availability of LANs and fast Internet connections provided a simpler and faster method of transferring such files, where the air-gapping of a sneakernet is not an important benefit. Other removable storage devices have advantages in both capacity and performance when network connections are unavailable or when networks are inadequate.|$|E
2500|$|In alien hand syndrome, {{the afflicted}} individual's limb will produce unintentional {{movements}} without {{the will of}} the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The sense of agency does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) <b>recordable</b> on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed. The sense of agency thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using functional magnetic resonance imaging, alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the concomitant activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process. The clinical definition requires [...] "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a will of its own, together with observable involuntary motor activity" [...] (emphasis in original). This syndrome is often a result of damage to the corpus callosum, either when it is severed to treat intractable epilepsy or due to a stroke. The standard neurological explanation is that the felt will reported by the speaking left hemisphere does not correspond with the actions performed by the non-speaking right hemisphere, thus suggesting that the two hemispheres may have independent senses of will.|$|E
60|$|Then the winch stopped suddenly, and Jefferson came {{backwards}} {{down the}} ladder. He alighted knee deep in water among the rotten bags, {{and all his}} observations were not <b>recordable.</b> He had put off conventionality, and was once more the reckless sailor and the optimistic American, so {{he spoke of the}} lower regions, and called the men who had stowed the Cumbria's cargo condemned loafers in barbarous Castilian and good American, while the olive-faced Canarios gasped and grinned at him.|$|E
60|$|The ball {{proceeded}} pleasantly. The anxious cares, {{the incessant}} attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed happy; and the praise {{of being a}} delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given {{in the very beginning}} of the existence of this. Of very important, very <b>recordable</b> events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.|$|E
6000|$|In April, Prince Lichtenstein {{arrives on}} Embassy with three {{requests}} or demands from Vienna: [...] "1. That, besides the Ten Thousand due by Treaty, his Majesty would send his Reich's Contingent," [...] NOT comprehended in those Ten Thousand, thinks the Kaiser. [...] "2. That {{he would have}} the goodness to dismiss Marquis de la Chetardie the French Ambassador, as a plainly superfluous person at a well-affected German Court in present circumstances;"--person excessively dangerous, should the present Majesty die, Crown-Prince being so fond of that Chetardie. [...] "3. That his Prussian Majesty do give up the false Polish Majesty Stanislaus, and no longer harbor him in East Preussen or elsewhere." [...] The whole of which demands his Prussian Majesty refuses; the latter two especially, as something notably high on the Kaiser's part, or on any mortal's, to a free Sovereign and Gentleman. Prince Lichtenstein is eloquent, conciliatory; but it avails not. He has to go home empty-handed; manages to leave with Herr von Suhm, who took care of it for us, that Anecdote of the Crown-Prince's behavior under cannon-shot from Philipsburg last year; and does nothing else <b>recordable,</b> in Berlin.|$|E
