40|$|In China, {{cooling water}} {{entering}} cooling towers still retains surplus pressure between 39, 240 and 147, 150 [*]Pa. In order to utilize this wasted energy, {{it is suggested}} that the surplus water energy can be harnessed to drive a type of hydroturbine installed in the inner platform of cooling tower and make the fan rotate via its coupled shafts. However, conventional hydroturbines are not suited for this job because of their low efficiency or unmatched rotating speed with that of the fan under the operating conditions of cooling towers. In this article, according to the requirements of turbine work environment in cooling towers, a new type of hydroturbine, Francis turbine with ultra-low specific speed (ns [*]=[*] 50 [*]m. kW), was designed to replace the fan motor in a cooling tower. Primarily, the shape, position, and number of runner blades were designed and optimized through theoretical analyses and computational fluid dynamics simulations. Additionally, metal elliptical volute and single-row <b>ring</b> <b>guide</b> vanes were applied to scale down the structural dimensions. Finally, the optimal scheme of the new Francis turbine was proven to have a high efficiency of 88 % and good operation stability through testing of a physical model and can achieve the goal of harvesting renewable energy in the cooling tower...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} triple channel double <b>ring</b> <b>guided</b> {{treatment of}} lacrimal obstruction and its clinical therapeutic effect. METHODS: Fifty cases(54 eyes) of lacrimal obstruction were treated by laser or micro-drill under triple channel lacrimal endoscope with double <b>ring</b> <b>guided</b> intubation created by our department. The silicone tube was extracted at 3 ～ 6 mo of postoperation. All cases were followed up 3 ～ 6 mo. RESULTS:Of total 54 eyes, 47 eyes were cured, and lacrimal passage was clearly flushed without epiphora; 5 eyes were improved, but lacrimal passage was clearly flushed with slight epiphora; 2 eyes were recurred, and lacrimal passage was not clearly flushed with epiphora. Total effective rate was 96 %. CONCLUSION:Triple channel double <b>ring</b> <b>guided</b> treatment of lacrimal obstruction has greatly improved traditional operation. It has dramatically increased {{success rate of}} lacrimal obstruction operation with little invasion, avoiding formation of false lacrimal passage, quick recovery and less complications...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial cell {{division}} in many organisms involves a constricting cytokinetic ring that is orchestrated by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ. FtsZ forms dynamic filaments {{close to the}} membrane {{at the site of}} division that have recently been shown to treadmill around the division <b>ring,</b> <b>guiding</b> septal wall synthesis. Here, using X-ray crystallography of Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ (SaFtsZ), we reveal how an FtsZ can adopt two functionally distinct conformations, open and closed. The open form is found in SaFtsZ filaments formed in crystals and also in soluble filaments of Escherichia coli FtsZ as deduced by electron cryomicroscopy. The closed form is found within several crystal forms of two nonpolymerizing SaFtsZ mutants and corresponds to many previous FtsZ structures from other organisms. We argue that FtsZ’s conformational switch is polymerization-associated, driven by the formation of the longitudinal intersubunit interfaces along the filament. We show that such a switch provides explanations for both how treadmilling may occur within a single-stranded filament and why filament assembly is cooperative...|$|R
