50|$|Certain {{exceptions}} do {{not require}} remuneration to the author: the reproduction of current news articles or broadcasts, where the original source is indicated (Art. 65); the reproduction or communication of public speeches on matters of political or government interest (Art. 66); the use of fragments or quotations for criticism, discussion, or non-commercial teaching or research (with source indicated) (Art. 70); reproduction and communication for persons with disabilities (Art 71-bis); and the communication of low-resolution images and music over the Internet for educational or scientific purposes (Art. 70). Loans by state libraries made for cultural promotion or personal study {{do not require}} authorization or remuneration (Art. 69). Users may make <b>reprographic</b> <b>reproduction</b> of 15% of a work (excluding sheet music) for private use; remuneration is paid to the authors by the library or copy centre where the reproduction is made (Art. 68). Lawful users may also reproduce music and videos for personal, non-commercial use (Art. 71-sexies). Authors and phonograph producers are entitled to remuneration for these activities via levies on recording devices and blank media (Art. 71-septies).|$|E
50|$|Regarding {{fair dealing}} under Crown {{copyright}} the Australian Copyright Act 1968, ss.176-178. Section 182A (inserted by Act 154 of 1980, s.23) provides that the copyright, including any prerogative right or privilege of the Crown {{in the nature}} of copyright, in Acts, Ordinances, regulations etc., and judgments of Federal or State courts and certain other tribunals, is not infringed by the making, by <b>reprographic</b> <b>reproduction,</b> of one copy of the whole or part of that work for a particular purpose (this does not apply where charge for copy exceeds cost).Regarding the re-use of copyrighted images or drawings, the Australian Copyright Act does not impose a 10%-limit under its fair dealing provisions for the purpose of research and study. Instead, each and every such use for research or study must be evaluated individually to determine whether it is fair, similar to the notion of fair use in U.S. copyright law. Among the criteria used to determine the fairness of a use are the purpose and character of the dealing, the nature of the work, the possibility of obtaining the work commercially within a reasonable time, the effect of the use on the potential market for the work or on its value, and how much of a work is copied.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{the regulation of}} copyright user contracts by contract and consumer protection law in South Africa. The normative regulation of copyright contracts {{was identified as a}} significant research gap by Kretschmer et al., who specifically list the following questions as being worthy of investigation 1 : •How should ‘fairness’ be defined for the context of copyright contracts? •Are existing contracts really ‘unfair’? •Do alternative contracts, within the current copyright law, exist that can be perceived as being ‘fairer’? If they do exist, do those contracts sacrifice efficiency? •To what extent does any perceived ‘unfairness’ depend upon copyright law? •Can copyright law be altered in order that the balance of bargaining positions be changed and the resulting contracts are ‘fair’? This chapter engages with some of these questions, which will be posed with regard to user contracts for the <b>reprographic</b> <b>reproduction</b> of copyright-protected works concluded between copyright-holders (represented by a reprographic rights organisation) and higher educational institutions. Here, the main concern is whether such blanket or transactional licenses override statutory exceptions and limitations. If so, is this fair? If it is not fair, how may copyright law be amended to ensure fairness...|$|E
