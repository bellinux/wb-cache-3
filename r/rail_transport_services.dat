40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of the study is to present and discuss an {{accounting}} innovation in the cost measurement system of <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> companies. Methodology: We identify the distinctive features that cost accounting systems should have in order to capture the particular structure of the production process of <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> companies and develop an innovative accounting practice that addresses the specific features of railway services, particularly the high fixed costs associated with the infrastructure. This accounting innovation is applied to Trentino Trasporti, a medium-sized, privately owned passenger railway company operating in the Trentino Alto Adige region of Italy. Results: Evidence suggests that the new accounting practice facilitates the operational connection between the company’s resources and their consumption during the provision of <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Practical implication: This connection enables companies to identify new opportunities for improvement and cost optimisation by finding the real origins of cost consumption in the provision of <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R

The Coimbatore International Airport is the second busiest airport in Tamil Nadu after Chennai International Airport, in terms of {{passenger}} traffic, cargo traffic as well as aircraft movement. The Coimbatore International Airport serves as the city's airport for both domestic and international flights. The airport consists of separate International terminal and the Domestic terminal, and handles domestic as well as international flights. The city is connected to major hubs in South Asia, South East Asia and Middle East through over eight international carriers.

5000|$|The Chennai International Airport {{serves as}} the city's airport for both {{domestic}} and international flights. The airport consists of the Anna International terminal and the Kamaraj Domestic terminal, and handles domestic as well as international flights. It is the third busiest airport in India and handled a staggering 12 million passengers in 2007-08 with international passenger traffic alone growing at 20 percent - higher than any other metro airport in the country [...] The city is connected to major hubs in South Asia, South East Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America through over fifteen international carriers. The airport is also the second busiest cargo terminus {{in the country with}} its large integrated cargo terminal. The Airport lies around 25 km from the city centre and is accessible by road and <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
50|$|Currently, about 80% {{of cargo}} is {{deemed to be}} transshipment, while 20% is gateway (such as fuel, {{construction}} materials, agriculture products and so on). This percentage split is likely to change with the start of FTZ, envisioned {{to be similar to}} the Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza), UAE. With it, the new Port of Baku will act as a major logistics hub in Central Eurasia, serving both European and Asian markets, as well as being part of an extensive international logistics network linking Europe and Asia. In particular, Port of Baku will trade & become the major centre for consolidation, concentration and distribution, providing a wide range of value-added services in the region to the markets of the South Caucasus, Central Asia, Iran, southern Russia and Turkey. There are a significant number of activities that can be classified as value-added services in the field of logistics. Generally, they fall into two categories:• General Logistics Services, including storage, loading and unloading, stripping, unstuffing, groupage, consolidation and distribution.• Value-Added Logistics (VAL), including repackaging, customizing, assembly, quality control, testing, repair, on-terminal, auto-accessorizing, grain storage and fumigating, news print storage, storage of commodities and transfer and in-container garment assembly.General value-added services include services such as the maintenance, renting and leasing of equipment, cleaning facilities, tanking, safety, security services, offices and information and communication services of various kinds. VAL activities, in particular, are growing in importance as producers concentrate on meeting the demands of customers for high quality specialized products. New players in this field of third party logistics services providers will be attracted to the Port of Baku at Alat to take over parts of the production chain (assembly, quality control, customizing, packaging and others) and of the after-sales services (including repair and re-use).FTZ would be in a natural position to participate in this logistics niche. It will be linked to other Caspian ports via high quality maritime connections through the New Port of Baku at Alat, and intermodal road and <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> from Alat to Georgia, Iran, Turkey, Russia and southeast Europe, while also providing air freight services from Baku International Airport.The activity in FTZ will create an additional volume of cargo aimed at exports. The majority of these cargoes is likely to be transported in containers via the various intermodal forms of transport.|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{evidence shows that}} travel time is crucial for <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> to be a competitor to air transport. However, there are no papers testing whether travel time has a direct effect on airline pricing. This paper is a step towards filling this gap. We test and quantify the effect of rail travel time on airline fares, using unique data at flight-level. We find that airlines design pricing strategies taking into consideration the travel time of competing <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> <b>service.</b> Airlines are found to set, on average, higher fares as rail travel time increases. However, the competitive pressure induced by rail travel time is perceived by airlines only as the day of departure gets closer: from the 40 th to the day before departure it increases while it gradually decreases as the departure date gets further away...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse user satisfaction with road, maritime, air, and <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> in Turkey using four distinctive ordered response models.

In addition, ordered logit and generalized ordered logit are the convenient models for air and <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> respectively. Results also indicate that current residence (urban), gender (male), occupational sector (private), and education level (low educated) were the statistically significant variables that are more likely to increase user satisfaction. This paper is probably the first attempt to analyse user satisfaction with all transport services using comparative ordered response models. As a social indicator, the results of this study may provide a valuable evidence for future sustainable transport policies in Turkey...|$|E

In addition, the specific events can be traffic incidents/accidents and industrial actions of the railway staff.
