5|$|Research on {{leisure and}} {{hospitality}} situates Omaha {{in the same}} tier for tourists as the neighboring cities of Des Moines, Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 {{in state and local}} taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.|$|E
5|$|About 118tonnes of {{germanium}} {{was produced}} in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). Germanium is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite zinc ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0.3%, especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive Zn–Pb–Cu(–Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> at least 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density {{was found to be}} highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E

25|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> lying {{takes longer}} than telling the truth, {{and thus the}} time to answer a {{question}} may be used as a method of lie detection. However, it has also been shown that instant-answers can be proof of a prepared lie. The only compromise is to try to surprise the victim and find a midway answer, not too quick, nor too long.|$|E
25|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the five-planet Nice {{model has}} a {{statistically}} small likelihood of reproducing {{the orbits of}} the terrestrial planets. Although this implies that the instability occurred before {{the formation of the}} terrestrial planets and could not be the source of the Late Heavy Bombardment, the advantage of an early instability is reduced by the sizable jumps in the semi-major axis of Jupiter and Saturn required to preserve the asteroid belt.|$|E
25|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> an {{especially}} massive tropical volcanic eruption in 1257, possibly of the now-extinct Mount Samalas near Mount Rinjani, both in Lombok, Indonesia, followed by three smaller eruptions in 1268, 1275, and 1284 {{did not allow}} the climate to recover. This may have caused the initial cooling, and the 1452–53 eruption of Kuwae in Vanuatu triggered a second pulse of cooling. The cold summers can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long after volcanic aerosols are removed.|$|E

25|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> adult rats with {{amblyopia}} improved {{visual acuity}} {{two weeks after}} being placed into an enriched environment. The same study showed that another two weeks after ending environmental enrichment, the rats retained their visual acuity improvement. Conversely, rats in a standard environment showed no improvement in visual acuity. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment reduces GABA inhibition and increases BDNF expression in the visual cortex. As a result, the growth and development of neurons and synapses in the visual cortex were much improved due to the enriched environment.|$|E
25|$|Interracial {{marriage}} in the United States has been fully legal in all U.S. states since the 1967 Supreme Court decision that deemed anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, with many states choosing to legalize interracial marriage at earlier dates. Multiracial Americans numbered 9.0 million in 2010, or 2.9% of the total population, but 5.6% of the population under age 18. The actual number is likely much higher, for example a study of college students identifying as white found that 30% had less than 90% European ancestry, and one <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> African Americans have an average of 21% European ancestry.|$|E
25|$|All {{combined}} hormonal {{birth control}} products {{have a very}} small increased risk of serious or fatal thromboembolic events. There is ongoing research into the thromboembolic risks of Ortho Evra as compared to combined oral contraceptive pills. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> users of the contraceptive patch may have a twofold increased risk for non-fatal venous thromboembolic events compared with women who took a norgestimate-containing oral contraceptive with 35µg of estrogen. However, a different study concluded {{that the risk of}} nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for oral contraceptives containing 35µg of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate. The contradiction in findings between the two studies is not easily resolved, because the confidence intervals for the studies are overlapping.|$|E

25|$|Estimates for {{the number}} of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population, to as much as 90%. The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are {{practicing}} regularly or weekly at a church service. The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003. Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni. Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.|$|E

500|$|Shark lifespans vary by species. Most live 20 to 30 years. The spiny dogfish {{has one of}} {{the longest}} lifespans at more than 100 years. Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) may also live over 100 years. Earlier {{estimates}} suggested the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) could reach about 200 years, but a <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a [...] specimen was 392 ± 120 years old (i.e., at least 272 years old), making it the longest-lived vertebrate known.|$|E

30|$|Obtaining of cell biomechanical {{data was}} another {{strength}} of AFM. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> mechanical properties {{of a cell}} {{may be used as}} phenotypic biomarkers[23]. Therefore, we inferred that the functional change of cells caused by late stage dedifferentiation may also be observed through the cellular mechanics. To test this, we measured adhesion force and Young’s modulus across the whole differentiation process to further support the changes in function and cell surface ultrastructure.|$|R

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that biofilm bacterial infections {{may account for}} many cases of antibiotic-refractory chronic sinusitis. Biofilms are complex aggregates of extracellular matrix and inter-dependent microorganisms from multiple species, many {{of which may be}} difficult or impossible to isolate using standard clinical laboratory techniques. Bacteria found in biofilms have their [...] antibiotic resistance increased up to 1000 times when compared to free-living bacteria of the same species.
