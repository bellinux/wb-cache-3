40|$|In {{addition}} to detecting novel transcripts and higher dynamic range, a principal claim for RNA-sequencing has been greater replicability, typically measured in sample-sample correlations of gene expression levels. Through a re-analysis of ENCODE data, {{we show that}} <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> transcript abundances will provide misleading estimates <b>of</b> the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> conditional variation in transcript abundances (i. e., most expression experiments). Heuristics which implicitly address this problem have emerged in quality control measures to obtain 'good' differential expression results. However, these methods involve strict filters such as discarding low expressing genes or using technical replicates to remove discordant transcripts, and are costly or simply ad hoc. As an alternative, we model gene-level <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> differential activity using co-expressing genes. We find that sets of housekeeping interactions provide a sensitive means <b>of</b> estimating the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> expression changes, where the co-expressing pair {{can be regarded as}} pseudo-replicates of one another. We model the effects of noise that perturbs a gene's expression within its usual distribution of values and show that perturbing expression by only 5 % within that range is readily detectable (AUROC~ 0. 73).

Recent findings warn that {{the context in which the}} software is run, that is the infrastructure and the third party dependencies, can have a crucial impact on the final results delivered by a computational experiment. This implies that in order to replicate the same result, not only the same data must be used, but also it must be run on an equivalent software stack. In this paper we present the VFramework that enables assessing <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> workflows. It identifies whether any differences in software dependencies among two executions of the same workflow exist and whether they have impact on the produced results. We also conduct a case study in which we investigate the impact of software dependencies on <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> Taverna workflows used in biomedical research of Huntington’s disease. We re-execute analysed workflows in environments differing in operating system distribution and configuration. The results show that the VFramework can be used to identify the impact of software dependencies on the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> biomedical workflows. Furthermore, we observe that despite the fact that the workflows are executed in a controlled environment, they still depend on specific tools installed in the environment. The context model used by the VFramework improves the deficiencies of provenance traces and documents also such tools.

Factor structures, presumably Big-Five structures, within these languages, based on ratings from about 400 - 800 subjects on approximately 500 trait variables per language, are used for comparison.

To enable these comparisons, the best one-to-one translations of trait terms between the languages are used These translations yielded subsets of the data for direct comparisons. Congruence coefficients were calculated for the corresponding factors in the different languages, based on their independent positions, on their positions after target rotations, and on their positions after simultaneous rotations.

40|$|This paper explores Robert Grosseteste’s {{doctrine}} of matter, {{with a focus}} on how it involves the issue <b>of</b> infinite <b>replicability.</b> In Grosseteste’s treatise De luce, prime matter is a dimensionless entity capable of expansion induced by the infinite multiplication of light, which is the first corporeal form. Consequently, the union of matter and form is intended as the first substantial change that happened at the beginning of time, namely the generation of the physical body of the universe. In the Notes on the Physics, Grosseteste develops this notion by introducing the idea of an infinite passive <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> matter and an infinite active <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> form as something that explains the difference between the Pythagorean and the Platonic views of physical bodies. The principle of infinite multiplication, therefore, works as source of every substantial change and justifies Grosseteste’s typical shifts from mathematics to natural philosophy. Moreover, it allows him to respond to the criticism that Aristotle addressed to the theories of body as made of indivisible entities...|$|R

The factors are of technical, economic, regulatory and social acceptance nature, and they describe requirements for scalability and replicability. Data was collected from ongoing European smart grid demonstration projects through the use of an elaborated questionnaire on the identified factors.

Dew to their nature the derived factors can be categorized in technical, economic and regulatory & stakeholder related factor areas The obtained results allowed the identification of barriers, i. e. limitations regarding the scalability and <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> smart grid projects.

40|$|Background: Thiamine {{availability}} {{is involved}} in glycolytic flux and fermentation efficiency. A deficiency of this vitamin {{may be responsible for}} sluggish fermentations in wine making. Therefore, both thiamine uptake and de novo synthesis could have key roles in fermentation processes. Thiamine biosynthesis is regulated in response to thiamine availability and is coordinated by the thiamine sensor Thi 3 p, which activates Pdc 2 p and Thi 2 p. We used a genetic approach to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in wine yeast and we discovered that a set of thiamine genes displayed expression-QTL on a common locus, which contains the thiamine regulator THI 3. Results: We deciphered here the source of these regulatory variations <b>of</b> the <b>THI</b> and PDC genes. We showed that alteration <b>of</b> <b>THI</b> 3 results in reduced expression of the genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis (THI 11 / 12 / 13 and THI 74) and increased expression of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene PDC 1. Functional analysis of the allelic effect <b>of</b> <b>THI</b> 3 confirmed the control <b>of</b> the <b>THI</b> and PDC 1 genes. We observed, however, only a small effect <b>of</b> the <b>THI</b> 3 on fermentation kinetics. We demonstrated that the expression levels <b>of</b> several <b>THI</b> genes are correlated with fermentation rate, suggesting that decarboxylation activity could drive gene expression through a modulation of thiamine content. Our data also reveals a new role <b>of</b> <b>Thi</b> 3 p in the regulation of the main pyruvate decarboxylase gene, PDC 1. Conclusions: This highlights a switch from PDC 1 to PDC 5 gene expression during thiamine deficiency, which may improve the thiamine affinity or conservation during the enzymatic reaction. In addition, we observed that the lab allele <b>of</b> <b>THI</b> 3 and <b>of</b> the thiamin transporter THI 7 have diverged from the original alleles, consistent with an adaptation of lab strains to rich media containing an excess of thiamine...|$|R
