40|$|Results from a {{four-year}} audit of a Doppler quality assurance (QA) program using a commercially available Doppler string phantom are presented. The suitability of the phantom was firstly determined and modifications {{were made to}} improve the reliability {{and quality of the}} measurements. QA of Doppler ultrasound equipment is very important as data obtained from these systems is used in patient management. It was found that if the braided-silk filament of the Doppler phantom was exchanged with an O-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>filament</b> and the velocity range below 50 cm/s was avoided for Doppler quality control (QC) measurements, then the Maximum Velocity Accuracy (MVA) error and Intrinsic Spectral Broadening (ISB) results obtained using this device had a repeatability of 18 ± 3. 3 % and 19 ± 3. 5 %, respectively. A consistent overestimation of the MVA of between 12 % and 56 % was found for each of the tested ultrasound systems. Of more concern was the variation of the overestimation within each respective transducer category: MVA errors of the linear, curvilinear and phased array probes were in the range 12. 3 – 20. 8 %, 32. 3 – 53. 8 % and 27 – 40. 7 %, respectively. There is a dearth of QA data for Doppler Ultrasound; it would be beneficial if a multicentre longitudinal study was carried out using the same Doppler ultrasound test object to evaluate sensitivity to deterioration in performance measurement...|$|E
50|$|The Koosh ball is a toy ball made of <b>rubber</b> <b>filaments</b> (strings) {{attached}} to a soft rubber core, first patented in 1988. The company later expanded their product line to include 50 other Koosh-related products, including keyrings, baseball sets, and yo-yos.|$|R
50|$|The ball {{consists}} of about 2,000 natural <b>rubber</b> <b>filaments,</b> {{and has been}} released {{in a variety of}} color combinations. A variation was the Koosh Kins line, of Koosh balls with cartoon faces and hands. Koosh Kins was made into a comic book mini-series by Archie Comics, where they kept their cartoon-like appearance.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 Venezuela was {{the eighth}} most {{important}} largest trading partner in Latin America for Taiwan. Taiwan exports to Venezuela {{parts and accessories}} of the motor vehicles of headings, baler machinery, electrical machinery and equipment and parts, sound recorders, television imagers, reproducers, vehicles other than railway or tramway rolling stock, plastics and plastics articles, rubber and <b>rubber</b> articles, man-made <b>filaments,</b> iron and steel, cotton, furniture, optical instruments and toys.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a flexible high-pressure rubber hose with separate reinforcing cylinders which each consist of one family of spiralized fibres. The straight tube is radially and axially loaded by an internal pressure. This paper gives an approximative {{analysis of the}} stresses and strains occurring in the <b>rubber</b> and the <b>filaments.</b> Some numerical values could be compared with experimental findings obtained by Trelleborg B. V., Hoogezand. It appeared possible to estimate some unknown parameters, introduced in the approximate calculation model beforehand, so that a reasonable agreement between the theoretical and empirical findings could be attained...|$|R
