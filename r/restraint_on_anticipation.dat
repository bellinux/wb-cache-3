40|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, {{authoritative}} treatise writers such as James Kent and Joseph Story represented Anglo-American trust law as a seamless web. But the transplantation of trust law from England to America was not a simple process of adherence. Rather, American courts and legislatures came to discard fundamental English trust doctrines. <b>Restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>anticipation</b> and <b>on</b> alienation were embraced, and in key state jurisdictions bare trusts were abolished, or else displaced from the core of trust law. Irreducible settlor power over beneficiaries and the strong protection of beneficiaries from creditors under spendthrift trusts were two strikingly original American creations, which flowed from these basic doctrinal choices. The changes made to American trust doctrine yield a paradox for the legal, social and economic historian, namely that republican America {{ended up with a}} more dynastic property law, more wedded to dead hand control and more hostile to commercial creditors, than did aristocratic England with its unreformed system of common law and equity rooted in the feudal property system. The American abandonment of free alienability of beneficial interests and the corresponding reduction of the beneficiary's powers over trust assets may have been rooted in the volatility of credit in America and the desire of the wealthy to escape from the pressures of the market, though disparities between jurisdictions remain to be explained. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent a husband from co-ercing his wife into {{transferring}} her separate estate to him, {{in the late eighteenth}} century Lord Thurlow created an exception to the general rule that equity declares void any attempt to impose a direct restraint upon a disponee's powers of alienation. Henceforth a practice developed whereby property transferred for the separate use of a married woman was given "without power of anticipation", although a similarly worded limitation would suffice. The married woman was thereby disabled during coverture from alienating the property or anticipating its future income. Just as the restraint protected the wife against a predatory husband, it also operated against her creditors. While she could devise or bequeath the property in question, she could neither sell nor mortgage it, not could her creditors claim it in satisfaction of any debts she might have owed them. Courts of equity had no jurisdiction to override or modify a particular <b>restraint</b> <b>on</b> alienation in the interests of the married woman who was subject to it. Because of the basic economic changes caused by the Industrial Revolution with its attendant specialisation of the labour and concentration of production in factories, society also changed. It became more mobile and more urbanized and many wives gained employment in the new factories. Very little production was now carried out in the home and the husband, away-at work for long periods, found that his power position in the family was weakened. Since changes in the family had economic causes, these were most likely to be reflected in that field of the law most closely tied to the economy, that is, property. As the wife began to receive income (and in some cases, accumulate property), reform of the common law doctrine of coverture was imperative. Well-to-do women could enjoy the benefits of property drafted marriage settlements incorporating the equitable notions of separate estate and <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>anticipation,</b> but poorer women lacked these advantages and, to the extent that they had assets, they suffered the full rigours of the common law...|$|R

40|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of Joseph Schumpeter in the 1940 s and later {{elaborated}} by Robert W. Solow 2 ̆ 7 s work on the neoclassical growth model, economics has produced a strong consensus that the economic gains from innovation dwarf those to be had from capital accumulation and increased price competition. An important but sometimes overlooked corollary is that <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> innovation can do far more harm to the economy than <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> traditional output or pricing. Many practices that violate the antitrust laws are best understood as <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> innovation rather than <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> pricing. While antitrust models for assessing losses that result from reduced output and higher prices are fairly conventional, the losses that accrue from innovation restraints are very difficult to predict. In general, as an innovation project progresses further along and the resulting product or process comes closer to marketability, the effects of an innovation restraint become easier to assess. But many <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> innovation occur long before we can make a reliable prediction about whether a viable product or process will result, and whether it will be a market success. In these situations one cannot rely on private antitrust enforcement, given the strict antitrust requirements for proof of harm, causation and damages. By contrast, the federal government agencies acting as enforcers have authority to restrain antitrust violations even if relevant private harm and damages cannot be proven. As a result, antitrust challenges to innovation restraints should be of greater government concern...|$|R
