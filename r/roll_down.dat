5|$|After a short gain {{on first}} down, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to fullback Brian Edmonds. The play {{resulted in a}} first down at the Tech 34-yard line. Two short plays resulted in six yards, setting up a third down and four yards. Rather than attempt a conversion prior {{to the end of}} the quarter, the Hokies let the clock <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> with the Longhorns in the lead, 70.|$|E
5|$|Stone's tears first <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> {{her face}} in micro-gravity, and are later seen {{floating}} off her face. After being pushed from her eye by her eyelid, the surface tension is not sufficient for the tears to continue adhering to her jawline. However, the movie correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro-gravity environment.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before 10.00am as the Duke of Wellington arrived, a {{band played}} See, the Conquering Hero Comes in his honour, {{beginning}} {{a tradition of}} the song being played at almost every British railway station opening from then on. The Duke's party entered their carriage; a gun was then fired to mark {{the opening of the}} railway. The Duke's carriages had their brakes released and were allowed to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> the incline under the force of gravity to be coupled to the waiting Northumbrian.|$|E

5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed. Double D then confesses that he {{recently}} found his magnifying glass as well, proving that there never actually was a serial toucher. Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E

25|$|In 1627 the Spaniard Luis Bravo de Acuña wrote a {{treatise}} on the fortifications of Gibraltar for King Philip IV of Spain. He noted {{the use of}} strategically placed boulders that a single man could <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> on attackers, and of hoardings above the city gates holding large rocks that could also be dropped down on attackers.|$|E
25|$|Pangolins, {{a type of}} mammal {{covered in}} thick scales, roll into a tight ball when threatened. Pangolins have been {{reported}} to roll away from danger, by both gravity and self-powered methods. A pangolin in hill country in Sumatra, to flee from the researcher, ran {{to the edge of a}} slope and curled into a ball to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> the slope, crashing through the vegetation, and covering an estimated 30 metres or more in 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Namib {{wheeling}} spiders (Carparachne spp.), {{found in}} the Namib desert, will actively <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> sand dunes. This action {{can be used to}} successfully escape predators such as the Pompilidae tarantula wasps, which lay their eggs in a paralyzed spider for their larvae to feed on when they hatch. The spiders flip their body sideways and then cartwheel over their bent legs. The rotation is fast, the golden wheel spider (Carparachne aureoflava) moving up to 20 revolutions per second, moving the spider at 1 metre per second.|$|E

25|$|In August 1882, Jacob Philippi (c. 1835–1892) {{purchased}} a {{tract of land}} on Fort Moore Hill and built a beer garden. He had started the New York Brewery, the first brewery in Los Angeles, and had owned a saloon in the Temple Block {{in the center of}} town. On the summit of the hill he had a rambling structure erected, covering much of the ground with wide galleries, and for many years following, as the story went, local inhabitants of Los Angeles would climb the hill sober and <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> drunk.|$|E
25|$|Black Kettle's {{village was}} several {{miles west of}} the rest of the camps and {{consisted}} of around 50 Cheyenne lodges, plus one or two lodges of visiting Arapaho and two of visiting Lakota, for a total of about 250 inhabitants. Little Rock, the only council chief who had remained with Black Kettle since the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864, lived with his family in the village. It also included the families of Big Man, Wolf Looking Back, Clown, Cranky Man, Scabby Man, Half Leg, Bear Tongue, and <b>Roll</b> <b>Down.</b>|$|E
25|$|An off {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket {{ball in the}} palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the fingers <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> {{the right side of the}} ball (for a {{right-handed}} bowler), giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler's perspective, this is to the left from the batsman's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the off side.|$|E

25|$|On June 26, 1957, Margaret Harold and her boyfriend—a U.S. Army {{sergeant}} {{on weekend}} leave—were traveling near Annapolis, Maryland when Rees, driving his green Chrysler, forced {{them off the}} road. After exiting the vehicle, Rees gestured at the couple to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> their car window, displaying a gun. After being refused demands for cigarettes and money, an angered Rees shot Harold point-blank in the face. The horrified soldier fled the scene and ran across several rural fields before reaching a farmhouse, where he called the police. As the soldier was being {{picked up at the}} farmhouse, other officers arrived at the crime scene, where they found that Rees had removed the deceased Harold's clothing and sexually assaulted her.|$|E
25|$|As Bryant {{drove down}} to Seascape, he shot at a red Ford Falcon coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen. Upon {{arriving}} at Seascape, {{he got out of}} his car. A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable. He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was going downhill so it was able to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> the road out of sight around a corner. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels serve only to support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> the mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, so this is not the disadvantage it might seem.) The two driving axle pinions on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|E

25|$|In cricket, {{a slider}} {{is a type}} of {{delivery}} bowled by a wrist spin bowler. Whereas a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batsman, a slider is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> the back of the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and backspin. Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery, a slider does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batsman with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning {{in the direction of the}} seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of leg spin may deceive the batsman. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and backspin. This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batsmen without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the backspin. This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount.|$|E
25|$|PFC. Jose Ramon Sanchez born in Brooklyn, NY was {{assigned}} to Company D, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. On June 6, 1968, he was {{among a group of}} fellow Marines who comprised a patrol operating in the rugged jungle covered mountains southwest of Khe Sanh, Quảng Trị Province, South Vietnam. Their mission was to block NVA troops and supplies from infiltrating toward Khe Sanh. The Marines engaged a communist force of unknown size in heavy combat. As the fierce firefight raged around them, the Marines, who were out numbered and rapidly running low on ammunition, requested an emergency extraction. A CH46A Sea Knight helicopter was sent for Sanchez {{and the rest of the}} patrol who were on Hill 672. As the helicopter gained altitude, it was immediately struck by intense and accurate enemy ground fire causing it to enter into a nose-low attitude and crash onto an east/west mountain ridgeline, <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> to the bottom of the hill and burst into flames. Within an hour and a half, a search and recovery (SAR) team was inserted into the crash site. The team members pulled the charred bodies of the aircrew and passengers from what was left of the burned out helicopter and placed them in body bags. Of the 12 of the 23 Marines aboard who were killed, 4 were reported as MIA/KIA, besides Sanchez the other three were L/Cpl. LaPlant, L/Cpl. Palacios and L/Cpl. Harper. Various attempts to recover the bodies of the four were made to no avail.|$|E
