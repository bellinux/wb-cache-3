40|$|The {{red shrimp}} (Aristeus antennatus) is a target species {{of a deep}} trawl fishery in the Gulf of Alicante. This paper {{describes}} the fishery by following the activity of this trawl fleet between 1992 and 1999. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of specific catch compositions identified five main components that explained 92 % of the variability, and the catches were grouped into three main species: <b>red</b> shrimp, <b>hake</b> and blue whiting. Hierarchical Clustering Grouping of the percentage species catch composition allowed the fleet to be considered as two main groups, according to monthly landings and by differentiating {{the origin of the}} catches (slope or shelf). The species composition of the catch and the red shrimp catch rates (CPUE) differed between the two fleet groups. The application of Generalised Linear Modelling (GLM) to the CPUE series gave consistent indices of abundance. The fleet group, year and season had significant effects on shrimp catch rates, with the fleet group being the most important, and these models explained up to 62 % of the total deviance. The abundance indices showed little variation from 1992, although 1994 had the highest value and 1997 - 1998 the lowest. Comparison with survey indices showed similar trends, while mean uncorrected CPUE differed. Monthly variations of shrimp indices showed a lower abundance in summer, which was attributed to the reproductive patterns of the species. As a result, the use of some fleet grouping techniques is recommended before standardising CPUEs to obtain trends or to calibrate assessment in a fishery...|$|R

40|$|Alginate, carrageenan, {{soy protein}} {{concentrate}} (SPC), sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), and sorbitol were chosen as potential cryoprotectants. Their effects on physicochemical and sensory properties of frozen <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophycis chuss) and Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) mince at − 20 °C for 17 weeks were investigated. The mince was mixed with 0. 3 % STPP, 4 % sorbitol and either 0. 2 – 0. 4 % alginate, 0. 2 – 0. 4 % iota-carrageenan, or 4 % SPC. Changes in texture, microstructure, and profiles of proteins, {{free amino acids}} and lipids of fresh and frozen mince were evaluated. The addition of alginate, STPP, and sorbitol significantly improved the dispersibility of uncooked <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> mince with reduced penetration and shear forces. They reduced cooking loss and controlled protein denaturation {{as evidenced by the}} higher water-, salt-, SDS-soluble proteins, and sulfhydryl group contents compared to the control sample. Sorbitol and STPP with or without SPC and ι-carrageenan did not improve the dispersibility. Polymerization of myosin heavy chain via disulfide bond formation was one of the causes of the textural deterioration in the <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> mince. The difference in freeze-induced textural changes between <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> and Alaska pollock may be attributed to the inherent chemical composition and properties, such as calcium which may cause membrane aggregation and protein cross-linking responsible for texture hardening. Inhibition of calcium activity by alginate and STPP may have prevented the development of texture hardness. The stereomicrograph revealed that the control formed more compact structure compared to that with alginate. Such structural difference was confirmed by the SEM micrographs where muscle fibers were less interweaved together with alginate added. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that a combination of 0. 4 % alginate + 4 % sorbitol + 0. 3 % STPP can effectively control muscle fiber interaction and myofibrillar protein denaturation and aggregation of fish mince during frozen storage. ...|$|E

[...] In 1936, the Jewish Agency established the Department of Fisheries headed by Bar-Kochba Meirovitch. In 1937, Captain Gustav Fitch was sent on behalf of [...] "Gordonia" [...] to Israel to survey the possibilities for a fishing industry on the coasts of Nahariya and Atlit. Kibbutz Neve Yam engaged in coastal fishing from boats they built themselves. Kibbutz Mishmar Krayot near Haifa Bay engaged in trawl fishing.

PCBs 118, 138, and 153 were the dominant congeners in all the species examined.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in cod end mesh size from 55 to 60 and 70 mm and a change of mesh configuration from 55 mm diamond to 55 turn square mesh on the size selectivity of four by-catch species (the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, the horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus and the blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou) commonly captured in the crustacean fishery off the Portuguese south coast, were evaluated. Selectivity parameters for blue whiting, the most abundant species in the catches, were estimated taking into account between-haul variation, while for the remaining species, captured in much lower quantities, the selectivity estimates were based on pooled data by length class for all hauls within the same cod end. Length at 50 % retention, L- 50, was found to increase with mesh size and with the change in mesh configuration for all the studied species. For blue whiting trawling depth and cod end catch were found {{to play a role in}} between-haul variation by increasing L- 50 as well. The results suggest that an increase in the current minimum mesh size of 55 - 70 mm would be advisable to be compatible with the minimum landing sizes (MLSs) of 29 mm carapace length and 27 cm total length for <b>red</b> shrimp and <b>hake,</b> respectively, while it would greatly reduce the amount of discards, particularly those for blue whiting, that accounted for approximately 50 % of the total catch weight.

40|$|Discarding is {{considered}} globally {{among the most}} important issues for fisheries management. The recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy establishes a landing obligation for the species which are subject to catch limits and, in the Mediterranean, for species which are subject to Minimum Conservation Reference Size (MCRS) as defined in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1967 / 2006. Additionally, several other initiatives aim to reduce unwanted catches of target and bycatch species, including species of conservation concern. This raises the need to study discarding patterns of (mainly) these species. In this work we collated a considerable amount of historical published information on discard ratios and lengths at discarding for species caught in EU Mediterranean bottom trawl fisheries. The main aim was to summarize the available historical records and make them more accessible for scientific and managerial needs, as well as to try identifying patterns in discarding. We show discard ratios and lengths at which 50 % of the individuals were discarded (L 50) for 15 species (9 bony fishes, three crustacean decapods, and three elasmobranchs). Discard ratios were usually low for target species such as <b>hake,</b> <b>red</b> mullets and highly commercial shrimps and exemptions from the landing obligation under the de minimis rules could be sought in several cases. Discard ratios were usually higher for commercial bycatch species. Discarding is affected by a combination of factors and for a given species, especially for non-target ones, discards are likely to fluctuate within a fishery, across seasons, years, and regions. For most species considered, L 50 s were lower than the MCRS (when in place) and length at first maturity. L 50 s of target species, such as hake, were very small due to the existence of market demands for small sized individuals. However, for species of low demand, like horse mackerels, a higher retention size was observed, often exceeding MCRS. Lengths at discarding are affected by legal provisions, market demands but also by biological, population, and ecological traits. Understanding the factors that affect discarding constitutes the starting point for designing mitigation measures and management plans to reduce discards and improve the sustainability of the stocksVersión del edito...|$|R
40|$|The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is {{designed}} to represent an appropriate response to the uncertainties and challenges facing the fisheries sector. It also adopts a holistic approach to fisheries management, considering all factors driving fishers' behavior, and ultimately, the long-term maintenance of living resources. The most reliable way to pursue these aims could be represented by {{a change in the}} exploitation pattern, in order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries without compromising their socioeconomic viability. In this paper, the demersal fisheries of the Ionian Sea [Geographic Sub-area (GSA) 19] were analyzed with respect to their spatial, temporal, economic, and biological characteristics in terms of four key species for fisheries, namely European <b>hake,</b> <b>red</b> mullet, giant red shrimp, and deep-water rose shrimp. Specifically, (1) a quantitative procedure was applied to break down the whole system (including small-scale fleet components) into a series of fishing grounds using input data about fishing efforts; (2) the different fleet segments were defined as a combination of main gear and fishing grounds; (3) the effort and production by fleet segment were derived according to biological samplings of commercial data (Data Collection Framework for the collection and management of fisheries data, DCF), information on localization of nursery and spawning grounds, and expert knowledge; and (4) all this information was used to feed a bioeconomic modeling tool (BEMTOOL), and to explore alternative exploitation patterns. A series of scenarios including the status quo were defined, starting from the actual management approach based on temporal fishing closure. The results showed that significant improvements in the exploitation pattern could be achieved by setting up spatial and/or temporal gear-specific bans of the fishing activity. More specifically, scenarios based on a 3 -month fishing ban for trawlers are expected to provide high rebuilding of the spawning stock biomass (SSB) for all target stocks, and at the same time, result in a remarkable reduction of discards. When combined with a seasonal fishing ban for small-scale fleets equipped with nets and longlines, this approach could lead to a significant improvement in all indicators, but especially the SSB of the exploited species...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to utilize ocean pout (Macrozoarces americanus) for the product ion of surimi, a washed fish mince made stable for frozen storage by incorporation of cryoprotectants. Principal factors affecting gel forming properties, freeze-thaw stability and sensory quality of ocean pout surimi were examined alone, as well as, in combination with either <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> or turkey meat under various conditions. Parameters studied were: i) moisture and salt levels, ii) thermal gelation in a single {{as well as a}} two-stage heating process, iii) optimization of gel formimg properties and freeze-thaw stability of blended surimi, iv) texture-modifying effect of different nonfish proteins in the ocean pout surimi and its applicability as a binder in formed products, and v) use of ocean pout in the turkey as an extender. Compressive force (cohesiveness) and penetration force (rigidity) were measured for the evaluation of gel forming properties of surimi, and expressible moisture for water binding ability as well as freeze-thaw stability of surimi gel. Sensory quality of ocean pout incorporated turkey roll was also evaluated. The 74 % moisture level produced the most cohesive gel while NaCl progressively increased cohesiveness and rigidity, accompanied by a general decrease in expressible moisture. Thermal gelation was best demonstrated on a single-stage heating at 90 C by maintaining the integrity of the gel; regardless of the length of time of heating as compared to a two-stage heating, heat~setting at different temperatures and subsequent cooking at 90 C. Blending ocean pout surimi with <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> surimi resulted in increases in all measured physical characteristics as the <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> surimi level increased.

Depth {{distribution}} of white hake varies {{by age and}} season; juveniles typically occupy shallower areas than adults, but individuals of all ages tend to move inshore or shoalward in summer, dispersing to deeper areas in winter (Musick 1974; Markel et al. 1982). Small white hake are difficult to distinguish from <b>red</b> <b>hake,</b> Urophycis chuss, resulting in a small degree of bias in reported nominal catches (NEFSC 2005). Larval distributions indicate the presence of two spawning groups in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank and Scotian Shelf region, one which spawns in deep water on the continental slope in late winter and early spring, and a second which spawns on the Scotian Shelf in the summer (Fahay and Able 1989; Lang et al. 1994).

A statistical catch-at-age model (Age-Structured Production Model (ASPM)) {{was used to}} assess the status of the stock relative to reference points developed at the same meeting. Landings and discards of fish at age were used in the model as well as spring and autumn survey indices of biomass and age composition. Fishing mortality in 2007 was estimated to be above Fmsy and biomass estimates were less than 1 / 2 Bmsy. The assessment for this stock has evolved over time from index-based in the early 1990 s, to Collie-Sissenwine in 1994, finally to VPA in 1998. However, the addition of years to the VPA model created a significant retrospective pattern in the assessment in 2001. The assessment then became a surplus production model which was itself unstable and rejected in 2002. An Index Method (AIM) was used in 2002 and 2005 using only fish> 60 cm in the model to eliminate any contamination from the congener <b>red</b> <b>hake.</b> The ASPM method accepted by GARM III cannot be updated at this time so this document is a summary of the catch and survey data through 2010...|$|E
40|$|The ASPM (SCAA) {{methodology}} {{presented in}} Butterworth and Rademeyer (2008), with an adjustment {{to be able}} to incorporate data on proportions at length, is applied to white hake. In a preliminary and (for reasons of time) restricted analysis, four scenarios are consider for the period from 1963 when abundance indices first become available. These reflect the assumptions that spawning biomass in 1963 was at 25 % and 50 % of its pristine level, and that the catch of hake of length less than 60 cm was either all white hake or all <b>red</b> <b>hake,</b> with the latter assumption leading to somewhat more optimistic appraisals of the current status of white hake. Model fits to survey index trends are broadly reasonable, though there are some difficulties with proportions at length data which would likely be better addressed in future analyses by adopting a length-specific rather than an age-specific selectivity framework. All four scenarios considered suggest an increase in spawning biomass over the last decade, and that the current fishing mortality is less than FMSY. Nevertheless the preliminary nature of all results must be stressed, particularly as time has thus far allowed only a very limited number of variants of the assessment to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{interest}} in the effects of fishing on habitat and non-target species, {{as well as in}} protecting certain areas of the seabed from these effects (e. g. Jennings and Kaiser, 1998; Benaka, 1999; Langton and Auster, 1999; Kaiser and de Groot, 2000). As {{part of an effort to}} determine the effectiveness of marine closed areas in promoting recovery of commercial species (e. g. haddock, Melanogrammus aegelfinus; sea scallops, Placopecten magellanicus; yellowtail flounder, Limanda ferruginea; cod, Gadus morhua), nontarget species, and habitat, a multidisciplinary research cruise was conducted by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service. The cruise was conducted in closed area II (CA-II) of the eastern portion of Georges Bank during 19 – 29 June 2000 (Fig. 1). The area has historically produced high landings of scallops but was closed in 1994 principally for groundfish recovery (Fogarty and Murawski, 1998). The southern portion of the area was reopened to scallop fishing from 15 June to 12 November 1999, and again from 15 June to 15 August 2000. While conducting our planned sampling, we observed scallop viscera (the noncalcareous remains from scallops that have been shucked by commercial fishermen at sea) in the stomachs of several fish species at some of these locations, namely little skate (Raja erinacea), winter skate (R. ocellata), <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophycis chuss), and longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus). We examined the stomach contents of a known scavenger, the longhorn sculpin, to evaluate and document the extent of this phenomenon. ...|$|E
40|$|Hypoxic {{conditions}} {{can occur in}} many aquatic environments {{as a result of}} the combined effects of geomorphology, physical processes in the water and organic and nutrient loading. In some cases, hypoxic regions are permanent and extensive, while in others they occur sporadically and locally. In either case, only fish that tolerate hypoxia will survive. Because hypoxic regions are lethal to most fish, it would be advantageous for the fish if they could be detected and avoided. The present paper describes a distinctive avoidance reaction that occurs when larval fish encounter a hypoxic environment. In previous attempts to study the responses of adult fish to hypoxic environments, horizontal gradients of oxygen have usually been used. In one of the first studies on fish responses to hypoxia, Shelford and Alle (1913) concluded that fishes are clearly affected by a lack of oxygen. Høglund (1951) showed that roach (Leuciscus rutilus) and minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) tended to avoid low oxygen concentrations. Jones (1952) exposed sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), minnows (P. phoxinus) and trout fry (Salmo trutta) to low oxygen levels and concluded that: ‘fish do not have any instinctive ability to recognise immediately and avoid water of abnormal low oxygen content’. However, Petersen and Petersen (1990) studied the behaviour of the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus) in a hypoxic environment and showed that at oxygen saturations below 40 % the fish became restless and performed random activity that would eventually lead them to normoxic water. Young <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> (Urophycis chuss) were shown to move upwards in the water if the oxygen concentration fell below 4. 2 mg O 2 l− 1 (Bejda et al., 1987), and walleyes (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum) lost their innate negative phototactic response under conditions of oxyge...|$|E
40|$|Fishermen and {{scientists}} {{have noted that}} fish species distributions are changing along the Northeast Continental Shelf in response to local climate variability and large scale warming trends. NEFSC semiannual trawl survey data have been modeled to demonstrate these distributional and poleward shifts in species assemblages, but New England groundfishermen argue that management structures are slow to reflect these changes and that species distribution modeling of trawl survey data has failed to accurately characterize them. Fishermen have requested an outlet to submit information to scientists regarding where they are encountering shifting species while fishing. Data collected by fishermen themselves may be suitable for gaining {{a deeper understanding of}} moving fish populations. In response, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and Island Institute have proposed to create a phone application that would allow fishermen to take photographs of species they encounter and log the location {{at the time of the}} photograph. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether data submitted though such an application would be useful to scientists in modeling distributional shifts of commercially important species. I created a proxy for data submitted by commercial fishermen on <b>red</b> <b>hake</b> and used it as input data in maximum entropy models to determine whether such data would be comprehensive enough or spatially distributed in a manner that would make it suitable for species distribution modeling. All “citizen science” datasets of varying sample size and spatial distribution produced models with AUC values greater than 0. 75, while the baseline models using presence data from the trawl survey had lower AUC values around 0. 7. Our results indicate that concentrated data from fishing areas can lead to underestimation of species presence probability in regions where no fishing occurred. This happened because the fishing data used to generate random points from fishermen only covered part of the study region. Findings of this study suggest that presence data from fishermen are suitable for presence-only maximum entropy species distribution models, but actual Citizen science data collection and further modeling should include data from fishermen in the Mid-Atlantic to produce more robust and reliable models...|$|E
