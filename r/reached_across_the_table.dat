2500|$|In another {{significant}} moment in his officiating career, Strom was saved from an angry mob by legendary center Wilt Chamberlain {{during a game}} played in Memphis, Tennessee in the mid-1960s. Strom had made a call that went against the St. Louis Hawks and at halftime was called a [...] "gutless bastard" [...] by Hawks general manager Irv Gack at the scorer's table. The fiery official asked Gack to repeat the comment as he <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and grabbed Gack by the shirt. Fans started {{coming down from the}} seats while Chamberlain, playing for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, saw what was going on. He stepped across the table, picked Strom up and said, [...] "C'mon Earl. Let's {{get the hell out of}} here." ...|$|E
60|$|John <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and seized}} the secretary's hand.|$|E
6000|$|The actor {{rose and}} <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for the sugar. [...] "That's a capital notion. That's new. That {{would make a}} hit--the speech would." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{waited a}} moment, {{turned her face}} full on me, and <b>reaching</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> laid her hand firmly on my arm.|$|R
5000|$|Reachin' Richard- A boy has a {{bad habit}} of <b>reaching</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> instead of asking politely for the food that he wants.|$|R
6000|$|... "Marry me!" [...] said Wally, <b>reaching</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and putting}} {{his hand on}} hers. The light in his eyes lit up his homely face like a lantern.|$|R
6000|$|... "’I am sorry,’ said I, as I <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and gripped}} his hand, ’that I am such a fool; {{but it was}} only in the dark that you startled me.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Therewith {{he drew a}} silk purse full of gold {{pieces from}} his pocket, which he hung over the ferrule of his cane and <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to the bridegroom. That gentleman, upon his part (having {{expected}} some such episode as this), arose, and with a most polite and elaborate bow accepted the same and thrust it into his pocket.|$|E
60|$|He <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and secured}} his glass of wine. Before it was {{possible}} to interfere, he had emptied the contents of the phial into it, and had raised it to his lips. At that moment, Schwartz's restraining hand found its way to his wrist. The deputy watchman had far too sincere a regard for good wine to permit it to be drunk, in combination with physic, at his own table.|$|E
60|$|LOUIS. I dont think Dr Schutzmacher {{is pleased}} with his portrait. I'll tear it up. [He <b>reaches</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for Schutzmacher's menu card, {{and is about to}} tear it. Schutzmacher makes no sign].|$|R
6000|$|Harry might <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and take}} what he wanted; Judy might point and get what she wanted. Punch was {{forbidden}} to do either. The gray man was his great hope and stand-by {{for many months}} after Mamma and Papa left, and he had forgotten to tell Judy to [...] "bemember Mamma." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{tried to}} <b>reach</b> her <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and his {{movements}} were lazy and slow, like his smile. His tone was coaxing.|$|R
6000|$|No one spoke, but {{the smile}} of patronising superiority and chivalrous toleration was {{exchanged}} by all the gentlemen except Poinsett. Mr. Dumphy added to his smile his short characteristic bark. At the reference to the writer's sister, Mrs. Sepulvida shrugged her pretty shoulders and looked doubtingly at Poinsett. But to her great astonishment that gentleman <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> took the letter, and having glanced over it, said positively, [...] "You are right, Miss Rosey, it is genuine." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon this I made {{an effort}} to get up, in order to put my threat into execution; but the ruffian just <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> very deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the {{forehead}} with the neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the arm-chair from which I had half arisen. I was utterly astounded; and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do. In the meantime, he continued his talk.|$|E
60|$|He {{sank down}} on the chair {{opposite}} to her, his head bowed into his hands, {{his elbows on the}} table among the cards. At length I went and laid my hands upon his shoulder, and at my touch he started. Then he did a singular thing, an impulsive thing, characteristic of the old Nick I had known. He <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and seized the hand of Madame la Vicomtesse. She did not resist, and her smile I shall always remember. It was the smile of a woman who has suffered, and understands.|$|E
6000|$|Maud {{looked at}} the photograph. It was unmistakably Geoffrey. And it had evidently been taken recently, for it showed the later Geoffrey, the man of substance. It was a {{full-length}} photograph and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> stout legs was written in a flowing hand the legend, [...] "To Babe from her little Pootles". Maud gave a shudder and handed {{it back to the}} young man, just as Geoffrey, <b>reaching</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> made a grab for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "So you shall," [...] said Jacob Stuck; [...] "here it is," [...] said he; and he <b>reached</b> it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to <b>the</b> prime-minister {{to give it}} to the king.|$|R
5000|$|She preached in January 2007 to an {{audience}} in Ebenezer Baptist Church to be an oasis for peace and love, {{as well as to}} use her father's holiday as starting ground for their own interpretations of prejudice. She spoke on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 2007 to attendants at the Ebenezer Baptist Church and stated: [...] "We must keep <b>reaching</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and, in <b>the</b> tradition of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, feed each other,". After her hour-long presentation, she joined her sister and her aunt, Christine King Farris, in signing books. On May 12, 2007, days before her death, she spoke at St. Mary Medical Center, {{on the part of the}} American Stroke Association. It would be the last time she would speak on behalf of the association.|$|R
6000|$|The {{effect on}} Valentine of this hospitable action {{proved to be}} {{singularly}} soothing and beneficial. He had been getting gradually more and more disputatious {{for the last ten}} minutes; but the moment the steaming glass touched his hand, it seemed to change his mood with the most magical celerity. As he looked down at it, and felt the fragrant rum steaming softy into his nostrils, his face expanded, and while his left hand unsteadily conveyed the tumbler to his lips, his right <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and fraternally extended itself to Mat. [...] "My dear friend," [...] said Mr. Blyth affectionately, [...] "how kind you are! Pray how do you make the Squaw's mixture?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jake, who {{had taken}} no part in the recent talk, and leaned languidly back in his chair, turned {{his head as he}} heard {{footsteps}} in the patio. They were quick and decided, as if somebody was coming straight towards the table, but they stopped suddenly. This seemed strange and Jake, who had caught a glimpse of a man in white clothes, looked round to see if Kenwardine had made him a sign. The latter, however, was lighting his pipe, but the Spaniard leaned forward a little, as if trying to see across the patio. Jake thought he would find this difficult with the light of the lamp in his eyes, but Richter, who sat opposite, got up and <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|Facing {{her was the}} agent, the genius, the Man who had {{snatched}} {{her from}} that existence, who had at his command these delights to bestow. She loved him, she belonged to him, {{he was to be}} her husband--yet there were moments when the glamour of this oddly tended to dissolve, when an objective vision intruded and she beheld herself, as though removed from the body, lunching with a strange man in a strange place. And once it crossed her mind--what would she think of another woman who did this? What would she think if it were Lise? She could not then achieve a sense of identity; it was as though she had partaken of some philtre lulling her, inhibiting her power to grasp the fact in its enormity. And little by little grew on her the realization of what all along she had known, that the spell of these surroundings to which she had surrendered was an expression of the man himself. He was the source of it. More and more, as he talked, his eyes troubled and stirred her; the touch of his hand, as he <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and laid it on hers, burned her. When the waiters had left them alone she could stand the strain no longer, and she rose and strayed about the room, examining the furniture, the curtains, the crystal pendants, faintly pink, that softened and diffused the light; and she paused before the grand piano in the corner.|$|E
60|$|It was Everett {{who drank}} first. He drank {{it with his}} little {{twinkling}} eyes fixed hungrily on the proud handsome face of Mrs. Camelford; and then handed the glass to his wife. It was she perhaps who drank from it most eagerly. Her life with Everett, from the day when she had risen from a bed of sickness stripped of all her beauty, had been one bitter wrong. She drank with the wild hope that the thing might possibly be not a dream; and thrilled to the touch of the man she loved, as <b>reaching</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> he took <b>the</b> glass from her hand. Mrs. Armitage was the fourth to drink. She took the cup from her husband, drank with a quiet smile, and {{passed it on to}} Camelford. And Camelford drank, looking at nobody, and replaced the glass upon <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a brief}} silence, but the intentness in the men’s {{eyes and}} the {{hardening}} of their lips were significant. Then Harding, <b>reaching</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> grasped Appleby’s hand. “I am in your debt, and it’s {{not going to hurt}} me to remember it,” he said. “There are not many men who could have taken up my hand, and played it out for me as you have done, but I’m not astonished. I had my notions about you when I left you in charge at San Cristoval. Well, that leads up to something. My affairs in this country are ’most getting too big for me, and I’m open to take a partner and deal with him liberally. It’s not money I want, but daring conception, and the nerve to hold on and worry through a risky plan. I guess you know the man who would suit me, Mr. Appleby.” ...|$|R
25|$|Intention to touch: A nonverbal {{communication}} haptic code or cue is {{the intention}} behind it. <b>Reaching</b> your hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to a somewhat unknown person {{is used as}} a way to show readiness to touch.|$|R
50|$|The town {{consists}} of an elementary school, post office, store with gas pumps, two homes and a few small outbuildings. The town was founded by Charlie M. Allen and is named for his first wife Theoline (Tillie) Volborg Osmenson Allen. Family tradition has it that Charlie Allen had submitted a listing of names to the US Post Office {{for the name of}} the town. That original list was rejected. Trying to find a name that the US Post Office would accept, pondering a good choice while at the dinner table, Tillie <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> took the pencil and form from her husband and wrote in her middle name, Volborg. The US Post Office accepted the name.|$|E
5000|$|In another {{significant}} moment in his officiating career, Strom was saved from an angry mob by legendary center Wilt Chamberlain {{during a game}} played in Memphis, Tennessee in the mid-1960s. Strom had made a call that went against the St. Louis Hawks and at halftime was called a [...] "gutless bastard" [...] by Hawks general manager Irv Gack at the scorer's table. The fiery official asked Gack to repeat the comment as he <b>reached</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and grabbed Gack by the shirt. Fans started {{coming down from the}} seats while Chamberlain, playing for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, saw what was going on. He stepped across the table, picked Strom up and said, [...] "C'mon Earl. Let's {{get the hell out of}} here." ...|$|E
60|$|The general, too, has waxed very zealous in his devotions {{within the}} last few days, {{as the time of}} her ladyship's {{departure}} approaches. I observed him casting many a tender look at her during the wedding dinner, while the courses were changing; though he was always liable to be interrupted in his adoration by the appearance of any new delicacy. The general, in fact, has arrived at that time of life when the heart and the stomach maintain a kind of balance of power, and when a man is apt to be perplexed in his affections between a fine woman and a truffled turkey. Her ladyship was certainly rivalled, through the whole of the first course, by a dish of stewed carp; and there was one glance, which was evidently intended to be a point-blank shot at her heart, and could scarcely have failed to effect a practicable breach, had it not unluckily been directed away to a tempting breast of lamb, in which it immediately produced a formidable incision. Thus did this faithless general go on, coquetting during the whole dinner, and committing an infidelity with every new dish; until, in the end, he was so overpowered by the attentions he had paid to fish, flesh, and fowl; to pastry, jelly, cream, and blanc-mange, that he seemed to sink within himself: his eyes swam beneath their lids, and their fire was so much slackened, that he could no longer discharge a single glance that would <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Upon <b>the</b> whole, I fear the general ate himself into as much disgrace, at this memorable dinner, as I have seen him sleep himself into on a former occasion.|$|R
6000|$|He dined in {{an evening}} {{waistcoat}} and a [...] "smoking" [...] (he called it so) {{with a black}} tie. All this of very good cut, not new--just as these things should be. He was, morning or evening, very correct in his dress. I {{have no doubt that}} his whole existence had been correct, well ordered and conventional, undisturbed by startling events. His white hair brushed upwards off a lofty forehead gave him the air of an idealist, of an imaginative man. His white moustache, heavy but carefully trimmed and arranged, was not unpleasantly tinted a golden yellow in the middle. The faint scent of some very good perfume, and of good cigars (that last an odour quite remarkable to come upon in Italy) <b>reached</b> me <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> It was in his eyes that his age showed most. They were a little weary with creased eyelids. He must have been sixty or a couple of years more. And he was communicative. I would not {{go so far as to}} call it garrulous--but distinctly communicative.|$|R
50|$|In cue sports, {{players can}} <b>reach</b> farther <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{if they are}} able to play with either hand, since the cue must either be placed on the left or {{the right side of the}} body. English snooker player Ronnie O'Sullivan is a rarity amongst the current ranks of top snooker professionals, in that he is able to play to world {{standard}} with either hand. While he lacks power in his left arm, his ability to alternate hands allows him to take shots that would otherwise require awkward cueing or the use of a rest. When he first displayed this ability in the 1996 World Championship against the Canadian player Alain Robidoux, Robidoux accused him of disrespect. O'Sullivan responded that he played better with his left hand than Robidoux could with his right. O'Sullivan was summoned to a disciplinary hearing in response to Robidoux's formal complaint, where he had to prove that he could play to a high level with his left hand. Many people think O'Sullivan had to play a match against former professional Rex Williams, but this never took place. On Eurosport's coverage of the 2014 International Championships, commentator David Hendon confirmed that O'Sullivan never played the match against Rex Williams.|$|R
50|$|When Elias {{returned}} in disgrace to New York, he composed Cosmopolis, a descriptive piece which somewhat resembles Ottorino Respighi’s The Fountains of Rome. At this time, Elias {{found himself in}} the intensive care unit of a hospital, having suffered a ruptured appendix. Peritonitis had set in, and he was not expected to live. After considerable medical intervention, his life was saved, and he was due to be discharged from the hospital. He said goodbye to everyone, including Anna, the nurses’ orderly on the ward; he asked her in his typically dramatic way, “How can I possibly thank you for giving me back my life?” Anna looked him straight in the eye, and said, “You can marry me.” When Elias told his son John this story, the night before John's marriage, he <b>reached</b> his hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> in <b>the</b> bar on Broadway, tousled John's hair, and said, “It’s a good thing too, because you were three months along the way.” Anna gave birth to Elias' two sons, John first and Eugene (Gene) two years later.|$|R
60|$|Dante stared <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{her cheeks}} shaking. Mr Casey {{struggled}} {{up from his}} chair and bent <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> towards her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb.|$|R
60|$|Penelope, who overheard, laughed {{softly and}} leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R

60|$|Brightman, who had {{scarcely}} spoken a word, leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
