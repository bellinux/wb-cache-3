40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a high-speed, {{scalable}} on-chip {{serial communication}} interface design is proposed. The serial communication clock frequency {{is designed to}} work correctly at 2. 54 GHz to provide 2 Gb/s transmission bandwidth for SoC applications. By using the dynamic control technology, we can generate a fast and reliable control signal to activate and stop the oscillation of ring oscillator. By using the single-phase pulse-triggered TSPC shift <b>register</b> <b>design,</b> we can provide wider timing constraint tolerant range to achieve high-speed on-chip serial transmission. Moreover, the shift <b>register</b> <b>design</b> is a scalable design. By using the proposed method, we can provide 3 times wider bandwidth {{as compared to the}} prior art design [6]...|$|R

The judgment mirrored the decision made earlier in the US by a jury.

The order required Apple to publicise that it had lost the case on its website and in the media. The Court of Appeal said, [...] "because this case (and parallel cases in other countries) has generated much publicity, it will avoid confusion to say what this case is about and not about. It is not about whether Samsung copied Apple's iPad.
