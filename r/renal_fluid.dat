50|$|Temperature {{and body}} size {{directly}} affect the oxygen consumption of Octopus vulgaris which will alter {{the rate of}} metabolism. Katsanevakis et al. found that when oxygen consumption decreases the amount of ammonia excretion also decreases due to the slowed metabolic rate. Octopus vulgaris has four different fluids found within its body: blood, pericardial fluid, urine and <b>renal</b> <b>fluid.</b> The urine and <b>renal</b> <b>fluid</b> have high concentrations of potassium and sulphate, but low concentrations of chlorine. The urine has low calcium concentrations which suggests it has been actively removed. The <b>renal</b> <b>fluid</b> has similar calcium concentrations to the blood. Chlorine concentrations are high in the blood, while sodium varies. The pericardial fluid has concentrations of sodium, potassium, chlorine and calcium {{similar to that of}} the salt water supporting the idea that Octopus vulgaris does not osmoregulate, but conforms. However, it has lower sulphate concentrations. The pericardial duct contains an ultrafiltrate of the blood known as the pericardial fluid and the rate of filtration is partly controlled by the muscle and nerve rich brachial hearts. The renal appendages move nitrogenous and other waste products from the blood to the renal sacs, but do not add volume. The <b>renal</b> <b>fluid</b> has a higher concentration of ammonia than the urine or the blood thus the renal sacs are kept acidic in order to help draw the ammonia from the renal appendages. The ammonia will diffuse down its concentration gradient into the urine or into the blood where it gets pumped through the brachial hearts and diffuses out the gills. The excretion of ammonia by Octopus vulgaris makes them ammonotelic organisms. Aside from ammonia, there are a few other nitrogenous waste products that have been found to be excreted by Octopus vulgaris such as urea, uric acid, purines and some free amino acids but in smaller amounts.|$|E

Methods Sixty females (mean age, 32 years) undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery were randomized to control group and received only the conventional anesthetic drugs and 20 ml/kg of lactated Ringer's over 30 mins. The others were also given an infusion of 50 μg/kg/min of esmolol (beta 1 -receptor blocker) or 0. 01 μg/kg/min of phenylephrine (alpha 1 -adrenergic agonist) over 3 hours. The distribution and elimination of infused fluid were studied by volume kinetic analysis based on urinary excretion and blood hemoglobin level. Results Both drugs significantly increased urinary excretion while heart rate and arterial pressure remained largely unaffected. The urine flows during non-surgery were 43, 147, and 176 ml in the control, esmolol, and phenylephrine groups, respectively (medians, P < 0. 03). When surgery had started the corresponding values were 34, 65 and 61 ml (P < 0. 04). At 3 hours, averages of 9 %, 20 %, and 25 % of the infused volume had been excreted in the three groups (P < 0. 01).

BackgroundThe development of diabetic nephropathy {{has been linked to}} the release of vasoactive hormones and growth factors. Currently the role of inflammatory cytokines in this pathogenic process is not clear. MethodsWe utilized the microdialysis technique to monitor early changes in tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α) levels in the <b>renal</b> interstitial <b>fluid</b> and urine of conscious Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 8) before and after induction of diabetes with streptozotocin (STZ). Measurement of the urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was utilized to monitor the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. ResultsUAE increased from 0. 56 ± 0. 20 μg/min to 8. 14 ± 2. 98 μg/min 17 days after induction of diabetes (P = 0. 01). <b>Renal</b> interstitial <b>fluid</b> TNF-α increased from 11. 96 ± 5. 32 pg/mL at baseline to 45. 02 ± 11. 69 pg/mL 5 days after induction of diabetes (P = 0. 03). <b>Renal</b> interstitial <b>fluid</b> TNF-α levels remained elevated throughout the remainder of the study period. Urinary TNF-α also increased significantly compared to baseline 3 days after induction of diabetes (294. 18 ± 36. 94 pg/mL vs. 16. 05 ± 6. 07 pg/mL, P < 0. 002). There was a second significant rise in urinary TNF-α concentration to 638. 16 ± 36. 94 pg/mL 21 days after induction of diabetes (P < 0. 001).

5000|$|The {{angiotensin}} II-stimulated aldosterone {{released from}} the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal glands {{has an effect on}} particularly the epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys.

The reabsorption of sodium ions from the <b>renal</b> tubular <b>fluid</b> halts further sodium ion losses from the body, and therefore preventing the worsening of hyponatremia.

40|$|Hyaluronan (HA) is a {{negatively}} charged extracellular matrix (ECM) component with water-attracting properties. It is the dominating ECM {{component in the}} renal medullary interstitium, where the amount changes in relation to hydration status: it increases during hydration and decreases during dehydration. It has, therefore, been suggested that HA participates in the regulation of <b>renal</b> <b>fluid</b> handling by changing the permeability properties of the interstitial space. This thesis investigates potential mechanisms for such a role in <b>renal</b> <b>fluid</b> regulation. The results demonstrate that the high renal HA content of late nephrogenesis decreases during the completion of kidney development in the rat, which {{takes place in the}} neonatal period. The heterogenous distribution of HA is mainly established during the first three weeks after birth. On day 21, the HA content is similar to that in the adult rat. The process is dependent on normal Ang II function. It primarily involves a reduction of HA synthase 2 expression and an increase of medullary hyaluronidase 1.   The cortical accumulation of HA that results from neonatal ACE inhibition can partly explain the pathological condition of the adult kidney, which causes reduced urinary concentration ability and tubulointerstitial inflammation. It is possible to reduce renomedullary HA with the HA synthesis inhibitor 4 -MU, and the kidney’s ability to respond to a hydration challenge will then be suppressed, without affecting GFR.   The investigation of renomedullary interstitial cells (RMIC) in culture, shows that media osmolality and hormones of central importance for body fluid homeostasis, such as angiotensin II, ADH and endothelin, affect HA turnover through their effect on the RMICs, in a manner comparable to that found in vivo during changes in hydration status.   In established streptozotocin-induced diabetes, HA is regionally accumulated in the kidney, proteinuria and polyuria, reduced urine osmolality, and reduced response to ADH V 2 activation will occur. As opposed to the proteinuria, the HA accumulation is not sensitive to mTOR inhibition, suggesting an alternate pathway compared to other ECM components  Taken together, the data suggest that during normal physiological conditions, renomedullary interstitial HA participates in <b>renal</b> <b>fluid</b> handling by affecting the interstitial prerequisites for fluid flux across the interstitial space. This is possible due to the water-attracting and physicochemical properties of this glycosaminoglycan. During pathological conditions, such as diabetes, the elevated interstitial HA can contribute to the defective kidney function, due to the proinflammatory and water-attracting properties of HA...|$|E

LIL- 6 males and IL- 6 females showed decreased urinary flow rate and urinary sodium and potassium excretion. Dopamine excretion was decreased IL- 6 females. In adult renal cortex, renin expression was increased in all IL- 6 females, but angiotensinogen mRNA was increased only in LIL- 6 females; AT 1 receptor (AT 1 -R) mRNA and protein levels were increased in LIL- 6 females, whereas AT 2 receptor (AT 2 -R) levels were decreased in LIL- 6 females and EIL- 6 males.
