5000|$|During the 1988-89 {{basketball}} season, Pearl, then {{an assistant}} coach at Iowa, {{was at the center}} of a recruiting scandal involving Illinois. Both Illinois and Iowa were recruiting Deon Thomas, a top high school player from Chicago. Pearl lost this recruiting battle when Thomas committed to Illinois. Thereafter, Pearl called the high school student and recorded a phone conversation with Thomas, which may have been illegal depending on where Pearl originated the call. (Illinois requires prior consent of all participants to monitor or record a phone conversation according to Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, Sec. 14-2; however, Iowa, where Pearl was coaching at the time, only requires one party's consent to record a phone conversation.) During the conversation, Pearl asked Thomas if he had been offered an SUV and cash by Illinois assistant coach Jimmy Collins, and Thomas seemed to indicate that he had. Pearl then turned over copies of the tapes to the NCAA, accompanied by a memo describing the events. During the subsequent NCAA investigation, Thomas denied the allegations and said the story was false, that he was agreeing with Pearl only to try to get rid of him. Thomas later passed a polygraph test in which he denied Pearl's accusation of Illinois's offering cash and a car. The NCAA did not find Illinois guilty of any wrongdoing relating to Thomas's recruitment, finding that the purported evidence provided was not [...] "credible, persuasive and of a kind on which <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>persons</b> rely in the conduct of serious affairs." [...] However, since the investigation uncovered other violations, including Illinois's third major violation in six years, the NCAA cited Illinois with a [...] "lack of institutional control" [...] charge and implemented several recruiting restrictions and a one-year post-season ban.|$|R

40|$|Thanks to Richard Posner 2 ̆ 7 s classic 1972 article, A Theory of Negligence Law, the Hand {{formula of}} United States. v. Carroll Towing Co. {{is perhaps the}} most central idea of many first-year torts classes today. Students learn that the meaning of {{negligence}} should be understood in terms of Judge Learned Hand 2 ̆ 7 s formula comparing the costs of taking precautions with the product of the likelihood of injury without those precautions and the magnitude of such injury. There is more than a little irony, however, in the superstar status of the Hand formula in negligence law. Carroll Towing is not a negligence case at all; indeed, it is not even a tort case, but an admiralty case. Beyond that, even the very general idea of a negligent injurer being held liable for the injuries it caused is not implicated in Carroll Towing, because it is about plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s fault, not defendant 2 ̆ 7 s fault. Posner 2 ̆ 7 s elevation of this formula to the apex of negligence doctrine is, though utterly sincere, nevertheless a sleight of Hand. This article puts aside the moral and evaluative arguments that frequently divide tort theorists, and instead gathers overwhelming evidence within negligence law that the Hand formula - in both its economic and its non-economic versions - simply misses the meaning of negligence within negligence doctrine. Negligence is a failure to use ordinary care. Ordinary care is that which a <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> would use under the circumstances. While hardly self-evident or precise, concepts of ordinary care and the <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> connote a standard of conduct that our negligence doctrine requires jurors and judges to apply as well as they can. There is every reason to believe this meaning is something quite different from the Hand formula (even if the two ideas should sometimes overlap). An accurate account of the meaning of negligence is a necessary starting point for questions or interpretation, criticism, and revision of tort doctrine. Finally, the article canvasses and rejects rights-based, conventionalistic, and virtue-based theories of the meaning of negligence, and begins to sketch an account according to which the <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> is conceived in terms of a special kind of competency in civil life...|$|E

40|$|Horizontal {{drilling}} and modern completion techniques have transformed the energy industry. As these techniques {{continue to evolve}} and improve, the Texas courts have already recognized that they must remain vigilant {{to ensure that the}} common law achieves sound public policy outcomes and does not frustrate oil production now made possible only through horizontal drilling. This judicial recognition is important because the dominant mineral estate common law, which was developed in the context of vertical wells, needs to be reformulated for the horizontal drilling practices of today. To better achieve sound public policy outcomes {{while at the same time}} providing equitable outcomes to surface owners, this paper argues that the Texas Supreme Court should adopt the following common law rule for horizontal wells: Proposed Common Law Reform: The <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> operator of a lease on a particular tract should have the same rights to drill a horizontal well on that tract as it would have to drill a vertical well on that tract regardless of whether production comes from beneath that tract, but if the horizontal well that is drilled extends off-tract, then the <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> operator must compensate the surface owner for any surface damages arising as a result of the drilling, development, and production activities related to this horizontal well. The above proposed common law rule seeks to protect the development rights of the <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> operator in the context of today’s horizontal drilling in unconventional shale formations. However, this common law rule also seeks to provide an equitable outcome for surface owners who find themselves burdened by the surface location of a horizontal well. The doctrine of the dominant mineral estate has not been a static doctrine. As detailed in the article, the Texas Supreme Court has reformulated the dominant mineral estate doctrine when that doctrine created a substantial and uncompensated interference of the surface estate. Consistent with this historical evolution, this article argues that the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Moser v. U. S. Steel Corp. provides authority for the proposed common law reform set forth above. Given the importance of horizontal drilling, the Texas Supreme Court should now act to clarify the doctrine of the dominant mineral estate in the horizontal well context to promote the development activities of the <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> operator and to provide more equitable outcomes for surface owners...|$|R

40|$|Social life is {{inherently}} risky. Who should bear {{the costs of}} accidental harm? That issue has been traditionally addressed in tort legal doctrine under the concept of breach of the negligence standard of care. Trial courts provide juries with instructions that, put roughly, direct the jury {{to decide whether the}} defendant’s conduct fell below what a <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> would have done if in the defendant’s circumstances. Without further judicial direction on that issue, the jury effectively has excessive discretion in rendering a verdict. Such discretion, opens the door for at least two kinds of potential injustice. Juries could treat like cases differently, and juries can easily ignore or fail to give due consideration to a society’s diverse, irreconcilable, and competing conceptions of the good as to what constitutes reasonable prudence. To mitigate such, I have created “democratic standard theory. ” I claim that a theory based on the overarching moral and political commitments of the Kantian tradition can only specify what constitutes negligent breach if it incorporates, as facts, the actual values of the individuals subject to the risk at issue. Since individuals’ comprehensive conceptions of the good conflict, majority rule, constrained by constitutional essentials, should determine what constitutes breach of the negligence standard of care. Thus, in each dispute over negligence in tort, democratic standard theory sets the stakes of negligent risk, especially the costs of accidental harm, in accordance with the values of as many as possible of the individuals locally affected by the particular kind of act at issue. ...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{seeks to}} {{determine}} if the CFTC needs new tools to combat disruptive, manipulative, or otherwise harmful trading practices that originate solely from the “minds” of ATSs. Part I of this Article provides a brief regulatory background of the derivatives markets, then examines the increased automation in those markets today, and concludes by looking at the CFTC’s initial responses to the issues raised by automation. Part II briefly looks at the law concerning different mental states for causes of action. Part III examines the CFTC’s pre and post-Dodd–Frank Act tools to police disruptive and manipulative trading practices, which are causes of action that, generally speaking, have scienter or culpable mental state requirements. This makes these tools ineffective in situations where none of the prospective defendants acted with the requisite mental state. Part IV analyzes the failure-to-supervise cause of action under CFTC Regulation 166. 3. It determines that this regulation potentially could be an effective weapon against ATS-initiated behavior that disrupts or manipulates derivative markets because: (1) a Regulation 166. 3 claim does not require proof of an underlying violation of the CEA or CFTC Regulations, and (2) decisions analyzing Regulation 166. 3 appear to apply a reasonableness standard (as opposed to a scienter requirement) in scrutinizing whether a firm diligently supervised its employees and agents in connection with its business as a CFTC registrant. More specifically, although never explicitly stated, Regulation 166. 3 violation decisions appear to apply a reasonableness standard that analyzes whether a reasonably prudent registrant—as opposed to a reasonably prudent person—would have acted the same in similar circumstances. Part IV also suggests that, to ensure that Regulation 166. 3 will effectively deter disruptive and manipulative trading practices by registrants’ ATSs, the CFTC could promulgate a rule making clear that a registrant’s duty to diligently supervise its employees in connection with its business as a registrant includes making sure that employees monitor ATSs for improper trading practices. This Article is the first to: (1) suggest that Regulation 166. 3 is most likely the best tool for combatting improper trading practices by ATSs where no human connected to the activities had the requisite scienter; (2) contend that Regulation 166. 3 uses a reasonableness standard that is best viewed as a reasonably prudent registrant (as opposed to a <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>person)</b> standard for diligence in connection with supervisory duties; and (3) point out that this standard establishes, as a baseline, mandatory awareness of requirements in the CEA and applicable CFTC and self-regulatory organization (SRO) rules and guidelines...|$|E
