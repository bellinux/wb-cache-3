5|$|The {{official}} chess <b>rules</b> <b>do</b> {{not include}} a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural <b>rules,</b> <b>do</b> not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E
5000|$|Further the posting <b>rule</b> <b>does</b> {{not apply}} to {{instantaneous}} forms of communications. For example, in Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation 1955 2 QB 327, the Court held that the posting <b>rule</b> <b>did</b> {{not apply to}} an acceptance by telex as the Court regarded it as an instantaneous form of communication. The general principle that acceptance takes place when communicated applies to instantaneous forms of communication. Courts have similarly held that the posting <b>rule</b> <b>does</b> not apply to acceptances by telephone or fax.|$|R
