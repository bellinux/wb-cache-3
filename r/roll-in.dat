25|$|Amtrak's Superliner Economy Bedrooms (now called Superliner Roomettes, {{although}} they are structurally closer to open sections) accommodate two passengers in facing seats that fold out into a lower berth, with an upper berth that folds down from above, a small closet, and no in-room washbasin or toilet, {{on both sides of}} both the upper and lower levels of the car. Effectively, they are open sections with walls, a door, and a built-in access ladder for the upper berth (which doubles as a nightstand for the lower berth passenger). Superliner Deluxe Bedrooms are essentially the same as historic Compartments and Double Bedrooms, with the toilet cubicle doubling as a private shower cubicle. In addition, each Superliner sleeping car has two special lower-level accommodations, each taking up the full width of the car: the Accessible Bedroom, at the restroom/shower end of the car (below the Deluxe Bedrooms), is a fully wheelchair-accessible accommodation for two, with a <b>roll-in</b> cubicle for the toilet and shower; the Family Bedroom, at the Economy Bedroom end of the car, accommodates two adults and up to three small children, without private toilet or shower facilities.|$|E
50|$|The type of <b>roll-in</b> fat used is {{typically}} butter or margarine. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil emulsions, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil. While butter is appealing {{due to its}} high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, 32 °C, actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as <b>roll-in</b> fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting {{the integrity of the}} layers. On the other hand, margarines are commonly used as <b>roll-in</b> fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, <b>roll-in</b> margarine should have a melting point between 40 °C and 44 °C, at least 3 °C higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the <b>roll-in</b> fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift. At the same time, the <b>roll-in</b> fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding. If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an iterative process based on Distributed Constraint Optimization (I-DCOP), to solve train classification problems. The input of the I-DCOP is the train classification problem modelled as a DCOP, named Optimization Model for Train Classification (OMTC). OMTC generates a feasible schedule for a train classification problem {{defined by the}} inbound trains, the total of outbound trains and the cars assigned to them. The expected result, named feasible schedule, leads to the correct formation of the outbound trains, based on the order criteria defined. The OMTC also minimizes the schedule execution time and {{the total number of}} <b>roll-ins</b> (operation executed on cars, sometimes charged by the yards). I-DCOP extends the OMTC including the constraints of limited amount of classification tracks ant their capacity. However, these constraints are included iteratively by adding domain restrictions on the OMTC. Both OMTC and I-DCOP have been measured using scenarios based on real yard data. OMTC has generated optimal and feasible schedules to the scenarios, optimizing the total number of <b>roll-ins.</b> I-DCOP solved more complex scenarios, providing sub-optimal solutions. The experiments have shown that distributed constraint optimization problems can include additional constraints based on interactively defined domain...|$|R

50|$|<b>Roll-in</b> fat {{affects the}} flakiness and {{flavor of the}} croissant. In {{laminated}} dough, fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of <b>roll-in</b> fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding. As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the planning of}} railway freight classification at hump yards, where the problem involves the formation of departing freight train blocks from arriving trains subject to scheduling and capacity constraints. The hump yard layout considered consists of arrival tracks of sufficient length at an arrival yard, a hump, classification tracks of non-uniform and possibly non-sufficient length at a classification yard, and departure tracks of sufficient length. To increase yard capacity, freight cars arriving early can be stored temporarily on specific mixed-usage tracks. The entire hump yard planning process is covered in this paper, and heuristics for arrival and departure track assignment, as well as hump scheduling, have been included to provide the neccessary input data. However, the central problem considered is the classification track allocation problem. This problem has previously been modeled using direct mixed integer programming models, but this approach did not yield lower bounds of sufficient quality to prove optimality. Later attempts focused on a column generation approach based on branch-and-price that could solve problem instances of industrial size. Building upon the column generation approach we introduce a direct arc-based integer programming model, where the arcs are precedence relations between blocks on the same classification track. Further, the most promising models are adapted for rolling-horizon planning. We evaluate the methods on historical data from the Hallsberg shunting yard in Sweden. The {{results show that the}} new arc-based model performs as well as the column generation approach. It returns an optimal schedule within the execution time limit for all instances but from one, and executes as fast as the column generation approach. Further, the short execution times of the column generation approach and the arc-indexed model make them suitable for rolling-horizon planning, while the direct mixed integer program proved to be too slow for this. Extended analysis of the results shows that mixing was only required if the maximum number of concurrent trains on the classification yard exceeds 29 (there are 32 available tracks), and that after this point the number of extra car <b>roll-ins</b> increases heavily...|$|R

50|$|<b>Roll-in</b> fat {{gradually}} melts as {{the temperature}} in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking. The fat phase also contributes to dough lift through gas inflation, which will be described next.|$|E
50|$|The {{second step}} is the {{lamination}} process. Lamination {{is necessary to}} produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers. After spreading out predough, <b>roll-in</b> fat is ﬂattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of {{the surface of the}} laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the <b>roll-in</b> fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of <b>roll-in</b> fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16-50 fat layers are obtained. The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with speciﬁc volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large speciﬁc heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.|$|E
