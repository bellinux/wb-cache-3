25|$|By 1924 many {{additional}} specially licensed amateurs {{were routinely}} making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6000 miles (~9600km) and more. On 21 September several amateurs in California completed two way contacts with an amateur in New Zealand. On 19 October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90-minute two-way contact nearly {{halfway around the}} world. On October 10, the Third National <b>Radio</b> <b>Conference</b> made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs at 80 meters (3.75MHz), 40 meters (7MHz) and 20 meters (14MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the 10-meter band (28MHz) {{was created by the}} Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference on 25 November 1927. The 15-meter band (21MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1 May 1952.|$|E

A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications below 150 meters completed hundreds of long distance two way contacts on 100 meters (3MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two way contacts in November 1923, on 110 meters (2.72MHz) ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Batzaria took to {{the applied}} study of philology. He {{reportedly}} consulted researcher Șerban Cioculescu about the Balkan origins of classical Romanian dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale. His interest in Oriental themes also touched his reviews of works by other writers, such as his 1932 essay on the Arabic and Persian motifs reused by Caragiale in the Kir Ianulea story. Caragiale's acquaintance with Ottoman sources was also the subject of Batzaria's last known <b>radio</b> <b>conference,</b> aired in August 1935. A few months later, Batzaria was appointed Commissioner of the [...] "Bucharest Month" [...] Exhibit, organized with official support and attended by Romanian King Carol II.|$|E
