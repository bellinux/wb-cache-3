40|$|Ganaxolone {{is a new}} potencional {{antiepileptic}} drug, synthetic analog of allopregnanolone {{which is}} a metabolite of progesterone. Preclinical and clinical studies point out its anticonvulsive effect {{in the treatment of}} both partial and generalized seizures including refractory epilepsy. The aim of our research was to investigate changes in the motor performance of the immature rats after administration of ganaxolone. We also focused on the relation between motoric impairment and the age of the rats which correlates with the age of children. 90 immature rats of age 12, 18 and 25 days were tested. Rats were divided in three groups injected with doses of 20 mgGNX/kg or 40 mgGNX/kg and the control group. The tests for assessing motor performance were chosen with respect to the maturation of sensorimotor reflexes from the following batery of tests: <b>righting</b> <b>test,</b> bar holding test, wire mesh test, negative geotaxis test and open field test. There were no significant differences before and after injection of the drug and in comparison with the control group not even in comparison of classes of age. We have demonstrated that the dose of ganaxolone effective against epileptic seizures does not markedly affect the motoric performance of the immature rats. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|In F, Faith {{asked for}} what rings R does the Dual Baer Criterion hold in Mod-R, that is, when does R-{{projectivity}} imply projectivity for all right R-modules? Such rings R were called <b>right</b> <b>testing.</b> Sandomierski proved that if R is right perfect, then R is <b>right</b> <b>testing.</b> Puninski et al. AIPY have recently shown {{for a number}} of non-right perfect rings that they are not <b>right</b> <b>testing,</b> and noticed that T 2 proved consistency with ZFC of the statement each <b>right</b> <b>testing</b> ring is <b>right</b> perfect (the proof used Shelah's uniformization). Here, we prove the complementing consistency result: the existence of a <b>right</b> <b>testing,</b> but not <b>right</b> perfect ring is also consistent with ZFC (our proof uses Jensen-functions). Thus the answer to the Faith's question above is undecidable in ZFC. We also provide examples of non-right perfect rings such that the Dual Baer Criterion holds for small modules (where small means countably generated, or ≤ 2 ^ℵ_ 0 -presented of projective dimension ≤ 1) ...|$|R

Therefore, evaluating the quality of test techniques and test suites may help improving test results. Benchmarking has been successfully applied to various domains such as database performance. However, the difficulty in benchmarking test case quality is to find suitable measures. In this paper, a multidimensional measuring of test case quality is proposed. It has been shown that not only the number of detected faults but also other aspects such as development artefacts like source code or usage profiles are important. Consequences of this multi-dimensional measure on creating a test benchmark are described. ...|$|R
