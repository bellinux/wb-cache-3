40|$|The Rhodes Computer Music Network (RHOCMN) is {{a network}} which allows main studio {{resources}} to be shared. RHOCMN is growing into a multi-workstation environment and additional devices are being {{incorporated into the}} system. A star configuration is used for transmitting MIDI from a MIDI patch bay to the workstations and MIDI devices. This imposes several disadvantages {{on the use of}} the studio, such as wiring problems. In a quest to avoid problems related to MIDI in RHOCMN, the MIDINet system was developed. The idea was to acquire a viable solution to MIDI's main problems which does not involve a <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the MIDI <b>specification.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|According {{to a fair}} {{spectrum}} of international scientists and metrologists, the current proposed <b>redefinitions</b> <b>of</b> the mole, the kilogram, and other SI units by the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU) to the Comite ´ International des Poids et Mesures [1] contain serious flaws. Among the basic criticisms are the following: 1. The proposed <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the mole is confusing, unteachable, and/or just wrong [2 – 6]. 2. The proposed <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the mole violates a basic compatibility condition relating it to the kilogram and the dalton [4]. 3. The proposed <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the kilogram relies on both special relativity and quantum mechanics and thus is not “comprehensible to students in all disciplines”(see p. 228 in [7]), nor even readily understandable {{to the majority of}} scientists and metrologists [3, 6]. 4. The proposed <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the kilogram requires the introduction of a new quantum–mechanical current standard [8]. 5. The proposed <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the kilogram entails a numerical constant of the order of 1041, which is unrealistic physically [3]. 6. The proposed <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the kilogram is based on an artificially created complex electromechanical device (the Watt balance), which is not “a comparatively easy-to-use apparatus that can enable the experimental realization of the new definition of the kilogram with the appropriate uncertainty at any place at any time by anyone ” (see p. 238 in [7]) and is not proportional to a real physical mass [2 – 4, 6, 9, 10]...|$|R
