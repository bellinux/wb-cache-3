Especially, a three-phase dual-active bridge DC-DC (3 DAB) Converter is highly suitable for high-power DC systems.

The transformer provides galvanic isolation from low voltage level to medium level or high voltage level and provides stepping up or down of the output (secondary) voltage.

There are a limited number of in-terconnections between the subsystems. We will try to be clear as to what the inputs and outputs are for each subsystem. 1 Power Supply Initially, I used a circuit without a step-up transformer. I could then apply up to ± 170 V to the inverter. This allowed for testing of many concepts, but the voltage was not high enough to make significant sparks. I then decided to use a step-up transformer ahead of the inverter. It appeared that a factor of ten (10 (± 170) = ± 1700 V) would give me enough range. So I bought a 240 / 2400 transformer from T&R Electric. This is an oil filled transformer, sometimes called a pole pig. Some older distribution systems used a 2400 V delta three phase configuration.

The spatiotemporally resolved characteristics of the gliding {{arc discharge}}, including glow-type discharges, spark-type discharges, short-cutting events and transitions among {{the different types of}} discharges, were investigated using simultaneously optical and electrical diagnostics. The glow-type discharge shows sinusoidal-like voltage and current waveforms with a peak current of hundreds of milliamperes. The frequency of the emission intensity variation of the glow-type discharge is {{the same as that of}} the electronic power dissipated in the plasma column. The glow-type discharge can transfer into a spark discharge characterized by a sharp peak current of several amperes and a sudden increase of the brightness in the plasma column. Transitions can also be found to take place from spark-type discharges to glow-type discharges. Short-cutting events were often observed as the intermediate states formed during the spark-glow transition. Three different types of short-cutting events have been observed to generate new current paths between two plasma channel segments, and between two electrodes, as well as between the channel segment and the electrodes, respectively. The short-cut upper part of the plasma column that was found to have no current passing through can be detected several hundreds of microseconds after the short-cutting event.

Active three-phase converters shape the three-phase input current to be sinusoidal and to be in-phase with the input voltage, {{as well as to}} provide a steady DC output voltage. This thesis investigates various active three-phase rectifier and control topologies and identifies a rectifier and control topology most suitable for use in converting a variable voltage variable frequency generator output to a DC voltage. In this dissertation, design relations are derived for determining the plant transfer response (for the suitable topology/controller), design equations are derived for designing/choosing the filter components, and guidelines are derived that will assist in choosing the right semi-conductor components and to give an estimation of expected system efficiency. The dissertation investigates the implementation of both analogue and digital control and provides implementation methodologies for both controllers. Expected results are verified by simulation and a build-up prototype. It was shown that the VIENNA rectifier is able to convert a generator type input, with variable input voltage amplitude and variable frequency, to a constant DC-bus voltage whilst controlling the input current to be sinusoidal and in phase with the input voltage. The rectifier was able to maintain a constant DC voltage at the output for input voltages as low as half the <b>rated</b> <b>input</b> voltage and for an equivalent output power of half the rated output power. This suggests that the VIENNA rectifier, controlled as a dual-boost rectifier, is suitable for applications that require power factor corrections and simultaneously operate from a wide input voltage range.

40|$|The Nuna 6 is a solar racing {{vehicle that}} solely relies on solar {{energy from the}} sun. Every year, the team seeks {{ways to improve the}} {{performance}} of their car. One way to improve the performance is to maximize the power output of the solar panels on top of the car. Maximizing the power output can be done with a 'Maximum Power Point Tracker'. The aim of this thesis was to develop an improved, distributed 'Maximum Power Point Tracking'-system which optimizes the power efficiency of the solar panel array of the Nuna 6 solar racing vehicle. To prove that the proposed distributed topology is more power effificient when compared to a central tracking topology, simulations of the total Nuna 6 electrical system were performed. Based on the simulation results, together with Nuna 6 specifications, a DC-DC boost converter was designed. Validation of the design was done by simulation with the Nuna 6 model. After validation, a breadboard proof-of-concept was built. The proof-of-concept was successfully tested and compared with earlier simulations. The system design process was evaluated and recommendations for further study and future real-life implementations were formulated. The simulation results prove that the proposed distributed tracking system is as much as 40 % more efficient in large insolation differences and 10 % in small insolation differences. The system excels when insolation differs, however it is slightly less efficient when used with equal insolation on every panel. The developed proof of concept demonstrates a functioning maximum power point tracker and DC-DC boost converter.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the previous section, we have demonstrated {{the possibility of a}} PZT sensor with a CVA within a specific range. From the perspective of practical use, the response speed of the CVA should be faster; therefore, digital electronics to measure the time duration of the pulse signal of the stress wave should be considered. Ultra-high-speed comparators are commercially available, such as the AD-CMP 582 manufactured by Analog Devices, which has an equivalent input rise time bandwidth of 8 GHz. Thus, the time duration of the pulse signal can be measured with a precision of 0.5 ns, even in space. Considering elastic approximation, a dust particle with a radius of approximately 0.5 μm generates a pulse duration of approximately 0.5 ns in current signal. From the perspective of hardware design, the lower limit of dust size measured by a PZT sensor with a CVA can be 0.5 μm. According to Grün et al. (1985), the flux of interplanetary dust greater than 0.5 μm at 1 AU heliocentric distance is approximately 10 − 4 m− 1 s− 1; therefore, it is expected that approximately 1700 dust impacts would be obtained by a sensor with a detector area of 0.54 m 2, which is the same area as that of ALADDIN. The detection area of a PZT sensor is limited by the input load capacitance of the amplifier for signal readout. Given a <b>rated</b> <b>input</b> load capacitance of 100 nF is affordable for a CVA, the CVA can read out the signal output from a PZT sensor with dimensions of 120 mm × 120 mm × 2 mm. In such a case, approximately 37 plates of PZT sensors are necessary to cover 0.54 m 2. Thus, the larger the detection area of each PZT sensor, the smaller the number of PZT sensors. We have considered the resource requirement of this new method in comparison with other methods. An impact ionization detector is an instrument to measure the masses and the speeds of microparticles, as well as a PZT sensor with a CVA. As a part of the DuneXpress mission, an impact ionization detector with a large detection area, called Dust Camera 3 or DC 3, was proposed. Actually, DC 3 will be used with a trajectory detector of DuneXpress, DT 1, but an impact ionization detector such as DC 3 can obtain the masses and the speeds of hypervelocity microparticles by itself. DC 3 comprises 25 sensing modules, each 9 × 9 cm 2, mounted in a 5 × 5 array, thereby it has a detection area of 0.2 m 2, a weight of 9 kg, a volume of 50 × 50 × 23 cm 3, and a power consumption of 9 W (Grün et al., 2009). On the other hand, drawing on the practical design of Bepi-Colombo MDM (Nogami et al., 2010), the dust monitor using the new method with the same detection area of 0.2 m 2, will require less resources, a weight of 8 kg, a power consumption of 6 W and a volume of 50 × 50 × 1 cm 3 : the occupied volume is significantly reduced.|$|E
