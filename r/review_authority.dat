2500|$|A {{criminal}} investigation also began {{weeks after the}} shooting, when the Independent Police <b>Review</b> <b>Authority</b> (IPRA) forwarded {{the case to the}} state's attorney's office and the FBI. The U.S. attorney's office confirmed on April 13, 2015, that they had been conducting a federal {{criminal investigation}} of the McDonald case in conjunction with the state attorney's office, after contradictions were found between the initial police report and the dash-cam video. The police report said that McDonald had lunged at an officer, but the video footage showed that McDonald made no lunges. [...] The video does show that McDonald was swinging the knife in his right hand in a wide, but aimless manner as he walked down the street, and also appears to show that McDonald turns slightly to look briefly at Van Dyke and another officer who are pointing guns at him, but that he continues to walk away from both officers at the moment Van Dyke opens fire on him.|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} of defining {{the criteria for}} determining judicial investigation situations are studied. Situations occurring during the prejudicial inquiry and legal proceedings have same epistemological nature, which allows to successfully apply the existing classification base to systematize and order the situations of judicial investigation. The author distinguishes the judicial problem-searching situations, occurring in the courts of original jurisdiction, of appellate jurisdiction, of review and of <b>reviewing</b> <b>authority,</b> differing {{in the character of}} problem raised and solved by the court. The typical situation in the courts of original jurisdiction is collecting evidence sufficient for making judicial decision. The typical situation in the courts of appellate jurisdiction, of review and of <b>reviewing</b> <b>authority</b> is validating decisions made by the court of original jurisdiction. The difference in the line of development of typical judicial investigation situations and search and cognitive activity’s character is shown. The author distinguishes typical problem-searching judicial situations, occurring in the court of original jurisdiction, connected with: 1) saving the evidence seized during prejudicial inquiry; 2) filling the gaps in prejudicial inquiry materials; 3) providing judicial assessment of evidence; 4) making judicial decision. The court of original jurisdiction adjudicates in a case, courts of appellate jurisdiction, of review and of <b>reviewing</b> <b>authority</b> <b>review</b> the judicial decision (their revision activity is provided with search and cognitive means to a lesser extent). The most widespread problem-searching judicial situations in the court of appellate jurisdiction are distinguished.

2500|$|Prior to the 1920s, Kingman Park was {{a largely}} uninhabited, wooded area {{located near the}} D.C. city dump. The area was {{originally}} {{on the shores of}} the Anacostia River. Between 1860 and the late 1880s, large mudflats ("the Anacostia flats") formed on both banks of the Anacostia River due to deforestation and the heavy erosion it caused. At this time, the city allowed its sewage to pour untreated into the Anacostia. Marsh grass began growing in the flats, trapping the sewage and leading public health experts to conclude that the flats were unsanitary. Health officials also feared that the flats were a prime breeding ground of malaria- and yellow fever-carrying mosquitoes. By 1876, a large mudflat had formed just south of where Benning Bridge is today, and another, [...] wide, had developed just south of the former flat. By 1883, a stream named [...] "Succabel's Gut" [...] traversed the upper flat and another dubbed [...] "Turtle Gut" [...] the lower, and both flats hosted substantial populations of American lotus, lily pads, and wild rice. In 1898, officials with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the District of Columbia convinced the United States Congress that the Anacostia River should be dredged to create a more commercially viable channel that would enhance the local economy as well as provide land where factories or warehouses might be built. The material dredged from the river would be used to build up the flats and turn them into dry land, eliminating the public health dangers they caused. In 1901, the McMillan Commission (a body established by the United States Senate to advise the Congress and District of Columbia on ways to improve the parks, monuments, memorials, and infrastructure of the city as well as plan for urban renewal, economic growth, and expansion of the federal government) concluded that commercial land was not needed and proposed turning the reclaimed flats into parkland. The D.C. government agreed in 1905, the United States Commission of Fine Arts (a federal advisory agency with <b>review</b> <b>authority</b> over the design and aesthetics of projects within Washington, D.C.) and the Army Corps of Engineers concurred in 1914, and the National Capital Park and Planning Commission signed on (belatedly) to the park plan in 1928. Most of the reclaimed mudflats were subsequently declared to be parkland and named Anacostia Water Park (now Anacostia Park) in 1919. This left the Kingman Park neighborhood cut off from the Anacostia River.|$|E

We remove an existing model—the Emissions Dispersion Modeling System (EDMS) — from appendix A. We also make various editorial changes to update and reorganize information. DATES: This rule is effective December 9, 2005. As proposed, beginning November 9, 2006, the new model—AERMOD— {{should be used for}} appropriate application as replacement for ISC 3.
