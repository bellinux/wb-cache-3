40|$|<b>Restocking</b> is a favoured {{option in}} {{supporting}} livelihoods after a disaster. With {{the depletion of}} local livestock populations, {{the introduction of new}} species and breeds will clearly affect biodiversity. Nevertheless, the impact of <b>restocking</b> on Animal Genetic Resources has been largely ignored. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to examine the consequences of <b>restocking</b> on biodiversity via a simple model. Utilising a hypothetical project based on cattle, the model demonstrates that {{more than one-third of the}} population was related to the original <b>restocked</b> animals after three generations. Under conditions of random breed selection, the figure declined to 20 per cent. The tool was then applied to a donor-led <b>restocking</b> project implemented in Bosnia-Herzegovina. By <b>restocking</b> primarily with Simmental cattle, the model demonstrated that the implementation of a single <b>restocking</b> project is likely to have accelerated the decline of the indigenous Busa breed by a further nine per cent. Thus, greater awareness of the long-term implications of <b>restocking</b> on biodiversity is required...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the results of}} a long‐term investigation into the biological performance and genetics of <b>restocked</b> and wild black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) in the Blackwood River Estuary in south‐western Australia.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{replenish}} a heavily depleted population of Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri, in 2002 - 03, 220, 000 4 - 8 month old juveniles of this species, cultured using broodstock from the Blackwood River Estuary, were released into this system. During subsequent monitoring by Potter et al. (2008) over the next 3. 5 years, <b>restocked</b> fish were readily able to be distinguished from wild A. butcheri because their otoliths contained a purple stain (alizarin complexone) {{that had been used}} to mark all cultured fish before release. The results of that monitoring program showed that the <b>restocking</b> had led to a substantial increase in the abundance of A. butcheri in the estuary. Their biological comparisons, using data for <b>restocked</b> and wild fish collected in 2002 - 05 and also data for wild fish collected in the two years leading up to the <b>restocking,</b> appeared to indicate that cultured individuals did not grow as well, or mature as rapidly, as wild fish. As the monitoring of the study of Potter et al. (2008) ended in 2005 when the oldest of the <b>restocked</b> A. butcheri were still young (about 4 yrs), the extent to which <b>restocked</b> and wild fish would differ in their growth and reproductive performance as they became older could not be determined by that study. Furthermore, as the <b>restocked</b> fish were only beginning to become large enough to be legally caught and retained by fishers, it was also not known whether <b>restocked</b> fish would substantially contribute to catches of A. butcheri in the Blackwood River Estuary. Moreover, the genetic consequences of the <b>restocking</b> program, and their implications for the ongoing conservation of A. butcheri in the estuary, had not been investigated. In this study, additional samples of A. butcheri from the Blackwood River Estuary have been obtained from the catches of a commercial gillnet fisher in 2006, 2007 and 2009, resulting in a full data set for fish spanning 2000 - 09. Analyses of biological data revealed that, since the <b>restocking,</b> the growth of wild A. butcheri has changed, with the lengths at a given age of fish hatched in more recent years typically being least. A comparison of the data for the 2001 and 2002 cohorts of <b>restocked</b> fish with corresponding data for wild individuals hatched in 2001 and 2002 showed that the <b>restocked</b> fish grew more similarly to wild fish than previously thought, with the difference becoming less than 5...|$|R

40|$|Acanthopagrus butcheri was <b>restocked</b> in an estuary {{in which}} it had become depleted. The <b>restocked</b> fish were cultured in 2001 and 2002 using {{broodstock}} from that estuary. These fish, whose otoliths had been stained with alizarin complexone, were released into the estuary and their biological performance tracked for seven to eight years. The 2002 cohort, introduced at circa four months old in autumn, survived far better than the 2001 cohort, introduced at circa seven months old in winter, when freshwater discharge peaks and temperatures are low. While <b>restocked</b> fish matured and grew nearly as fast as wild fish, the increase in density {{was accompanied by a}} reduced growth of wild fish. Genetic comparisons, using seven microsatellite loci, demonstrated that the expected heterozygosity and relatedness of <b>restocked</b> and wild A. butcheri, which is naturally characterized by low levels of genetic polymorphism, were similar. Although culturing did not demonstrably increase the level of inbreeding, it did result in the loss of some rare alleles. The biological and genetic results, together with the contribution of <b>restocked</b> A. butcheri to the commercial catch for this species in the estuary rising to 62 - 74 % by 2007 - 2010, demonstrates the efficacy of using <b>restocking</b> to replenish depleted A. butcheri stocks...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{explored}} whether <b>restocked</b> fish {{of a species}} perform {{as well as its}} wild stock, and has estimated their contribution to the fishery and egg production. Approximately 220, 000 juvenile Acanthopagrus butcheri, whose otoliths were stained purple with alizarin complexone, were released into the Blackwood River Estuary in 2002 / 03. The purple stain in their otoliths was still clearly visible in 2014. Data on the biological characteristics and annual contributions to the small commercial fishery of <b>restocked</b> and wild stock A. butcheri were analysed. The growth of <b>restocked</b> fish was only slightly less than that of the wild stock and the differences between their maturity schedules were relatively small. As increasing numbers of <b>restocked</b> A. butcheri attained the MLL of 250 mm for retention by the commercial fisher, their contribution to the fishery increased progressively from 6 % in 2005 to 74 % in 2010. That contribution subsequently declined to 39 % in 2012 and to 10 % in 2014, due predominantly to the introduction of the very strong 2008 year class in the commercial catches, the first substantial recruitment of wild stock fish into the population since 1999. <b>Restocked</b> fish were estimated as contributing ~ 55 % to the eggs produced in 2008, suggesting that substantial numbers of the 2008 year class were derived from spawning by <b>restocked</b> fish.

40|$|End-consumer {{choices in}} {{relation}} to type of retail outlet impact upon shopping travel frequency and mode, and hence on freight distribution flows for <b>restocking</b> shops. The characteristics of the <b>restocking</b> process, in terms of delivery size, delivery frequency, freight vehicle type and so on, are strictly related {{to the size of}} commercial activities to be <b>restocked.</b> Since end-consumer choices depend on end-consumer characteristics, such as age, gender and occupation, which change over time in an urban area, changes in such characteristics impact upon the nature of freight <b>restocking.</b> In city logistics analysis, in order to forecast the future characteristics of freight distribution in an urban area, a system of models is required that allows shopping mobility and freight <b>restocking</b> distribution to be considered in an integrated approach, with shopping demand models that take end-consumer characteristics into account. This paper discusses a number of issues related to the transportation impacts of shopping attitudes on urban freight distribution. It focuses on the factors that mainly influence freight distribution: quantity and choices of retail type (including e-shopping). After an analysis of state-of-the-art shopping mobility demand modelling, a new system of models for simulating shopping choices is presented. The models were obtained by using surveys carried out in Rome where more than 300 families were interviewed. Jointly with urban <b>restocking</b> models, they were used to assess the effects on freight <b>restocking</b> under a future scenario when demographic changes occur in a medium-size urban area. The results indicate that effects of demographic changes on shop <b>restocking</b> flows can be significant. For example, the shifting of middle aged adults into later age could result in an increase in shopping trips to nearby shops, mainly to small and medium-size retail outlets. This could lead to a consequent increase in car-kms. Further, expectation of an increase in e-shopping could reduce consumer trips.

In order to determine the general applicability of rabbit <b>restocking</b> for predator conservation, we performed three experimental restockings and evaluated their success in relation to season, habitat quality and the number of animals introduced. Rabbits were released either in large or small numbers in all four seasons of the year, and in habitat types defined as 'poor' or 'rich' according to the food availability for rabbits. For each <b>restocking</b> we evaluated rabbit survival, degree of residency and expected population increase.
