2500|$|Books of hadith {{terminology}} {{passed through}} two developmental phases. The {{first was the}} compilation of the statements of earlier scholars, quoting the expressions they had used without evaluating those terms or suggesting terms applicable to those expressions. This was the methodology adopted by earlier scholars such as Yaḥyā ibn Ma`īn, `Alī ibn al-Madīnī, Muslim ibn al-Ḥajjāj, al-Tirmidhī in their works. The second phase consisted of books based upon and evaluating those of the first phase. Their authors cited the quoted statements of the earlier works [...] and began the arrangement and codification of <b>relevant</b> <b>terms.</b> Principles were established and, for the most part, accepted, with individualized terms exclusive to particular scholars explained in context. Examples of books authored in this manner are: Ma`rifah `Ulūm al-Ḥadīth by al-Ḥākim, Al-Kifāyah by al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī and the Introduction of Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ.|$|E

40|$|In low dimensions, {{conformal}} anomaly has profound {{influence on}} the critical behavior of random surfaces with extrinsic curvature rigidity 1 /α. We illustrate this by making a small D expansion of rigid random surfaces, where a non-trivial infra-red fixed point is shown to exist. We speculate on the renormalization group flow diagram in the (α, D) plane. We argue that the qualitative behavior of numerical simulations in D = 3, 4 could be understood {{on the basis of}} the phase diagram. Random surfaces are being studied in many branches of physics [1, 2, 3]. It is thus important to understand their phase structure better. Typically one starts from Nambu-Goto action. Since it contains smallest number of derivative, it is supposed to be the most <b>relevant</b> <b>term</b> in infrared region. The Nambu-Goto model describes physics well as long as one treats it as a effective theory with a cutoff. The continuum limit, corresponding to a collapsed or branching phase, does not seem to be interesting. Such a collapsed phase is avoided in condensed mattering physics by adding non-local interactions [3]. There are other situations where the surface tension becomes small (by fine tuning), and higher derivative terms should be considered.
