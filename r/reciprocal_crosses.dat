Alaska and cv. Progress No. 9. The F 1 hybrids were grown in greenhouses maintained at either 350 or 650 ppm CO 2, and the growth, flowering, and dry matter accumulation were compared. The objective was to assess the significance of the alternative respiratory pathway to whole-plant carbon budgets and further to test the hypothesis that the alternative pathway is important in oxidizing excess carbohydrates such as might accumulate under conditions of CO 2 enrichment. More carbohydrates were available in the F 1 hybrid lacking the pathway, as evidenced by greater plant height, leaf area, specific leaf weight, and total dry matter compared with the reciprocal hybrid, especially at 650 ppm CO 2. Specific leaf weight increased markedly under CO 2 enrichment in the hybrid lacking the pathway, while it was the same at 350 and 650 ppm in the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>cross.</b> The hybrid lacking the alternative pathway also outperformed the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>cross</b> in terms of total dry matter and seed production.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The {{results of}} wide- or interploidy crosses in {{angiosperms}} are unpredictable and {{often lead to}} seed abortion. The consequences of <b>reciprocal</b> interploidy <b>crosses</b> have been explored in maize in detail, focusing on alterations to tissue domains in the maize endosperm, and changes in endosperm-specific gene expression. METHODS: Following <b>reciprocal</b> interploidy <b>crosses</b> between diploid and tetraploid maize lines, development of endosperm domains was studied using GUS reporter lines, and gene expression in resulting kernels was investigated using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on endosperms isolated {{at different stages of}} development. KEY RESULTS: <b>Reciprocal</b> interploidy <b>crosses</b> result in very small, largely infertile seeds with defective endosperms. Seeds with maternal genomic excess are smaller than those with paternal genomic excess, their endosperms cellularize earlier and they accumulate significant quantities of starch. Endosperms from the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>cross</b> undergo an extended period of cell proliferation, and accumulate little starch. Analysis of reporter lines and gene expression studies confirm that functional domains of the endosperm are severely disrupted, and are modified differently according to the direction of the interploidy cross. CONCLUSIONS: Interploidy crosses affect factors which regulate the balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation within the endosperm. In particular, unbalanced crosses in maize affect transfer cell differentiation, and lead to the temporal deregulation of the ontogenic programme of endosperm development...|$|R

60|$|The facts {{which are}} of the {{greatest}} importance to a comprehension of this very difficult subject are those which show the extreme susceptibility of the reproductive system both in plants and animals. We have seen how both these classes of organisms may be rendered infertile, by a change of conditions which does not affect their general health, by captivity, or by too close interbreeding. We have seen, also, that infertility is frequently correlated with a difference of colour, or with other characters; {{that it is not}} proportionate to divergence of structure; that it varies in <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> between pairs of the same species; while in the cases of dimorphic and trimorphic plants the different crosses between the same pair of individuals may be fertile or sterile at the same time. It appears as if fertility depended on such a delicate adjustment of the male and female elements to each other, that, unless constantly kept up by the preservation of the most fertile individuals, sterility is always liable to arise. This preservation always occurs within the limits of each species, both because fertility is of the highest importance to the continuance of the race, and also because sterility (and to a less extent infertility) is self-destructive as well as injurious to the species.|$|E

60|$|Even if {{it should}} {{hereafter}} be proved that all the races of men were perfectly fertile together, he who was inclined from other reasons to rank them as distinct species, might with justice argue that fertility and sterility are not safe criterions of specific distinctness. We know that these qualities are easily affected by changed conditions of life or by close inter-breeding, {{and that they are}} governed by highly complex laws, for instance that of the unequal fertility of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> between the same two species. With forms which must be ranked as undoubted species, a perfect series exists from those which are absolutely sterile when crossed, to those which are almost or quite fertile. The degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly with the degrees of difference in external structure or habits of life. Man in many respects may be compared with those animals which have long been domesticated, and a large body of evidence can be advanced in favour of the Pallasian doctrine[294] that domestication tends to eliminate the sterility which is so general a result of the crossing of species in a state of nature. From these several considerations, it may be justly urged that the perfect fertility of the intercrossed races of man, if established, would not absolutely preclude us from ranking them as distinct species.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} it {{appeared}} to me probable, as it has to others, that the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly acquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of fertility, which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared in certain individuals of one variety when crossed with those of another variety. For it would clearly be advantageous to two varieties or incipient species {{if they could be}} kept from blending, on the same principle that, when man is selecting at the same time two varieties, it is necessary that he should keep them separate. In the first place, it may be remarked that species inhabiting distinct regions are often sterile when crossed; now it could clearly have been of no advantage to such separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile, and consequently this could not have been effected through natural selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species was rendered sterile with some one compatriot, sterility with other species would follow as a necessary contingency. In the second place, it is almost as much opposed to the theory of natural selection as to that of special creation, that in <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> the male element of one form should have been rendered utterly impotent on a second form, {{while at the same time}} the male element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise the first form; for this peculiar state of the reproductive system could hardly have been advantageous to either species.|$|E
60|$|The {{infertility}} {{which may}} be observed in various dimorphic and trimorphic plants, when illegitimately fertilised, that is, by pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil, differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just {{in the same manner}} as occurs in crossing distinct species. As the degree of sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the conditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have found it with illegitimate unions. It is well known that if pollen of a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be afterwards, even after a considerable interval of time, placed on the same stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen of the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on the same stigma. I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately, with pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate pollen, though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen. Again, as, in making <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> between the same two species, there is occasionally a great difference in the result, so the same thing occurs with trimorphic plants; for instance, the mid-styled form of Lythrum salicaria could be illegitimately fertilised with the greatest ease by pollen from the longer stamens of the short-styled form, and yielded many seeds; but the short-styled form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by the longer stamens of the mid-styled form.|$|E

Under the conditions prevailing in the characteristically zoned algal flora of an undisturbed region of a rocky coast, descriptions of the three species can be applied which fairly effectively distinguish one from the others. The chief characters used for this purpose are shown in Table I. Other characters also help in separating the three species, as, for example, methods of branching and texture of the frond, and the numbers and positions of cryptostomata; but these characters can be greatly modified by variations in environmental conditions and are difficult to estimate objectively. HYBRIDSBETWEENFucus SPECIES Hybrid sporelings between pairs of these species have been produced experimentally a number of times. Thuret (1854) obtained hybrid sporelings by fertilizing eggs of F. vesiculosus by antherozoids of F. serratus, but failed to make the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>cross.</b> Kniep (1925) carried out the crossing in both directions and obtained 4 % development from eggs of F. vesiculosus and antherozoids of F. serratus and 2 % for the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>cross.</b> He obtained much higher percentages of sporelings by crossing F. spiralis L.
