25|$|The party opposes a government-run single-payer {{health care}} system, {{claiming}} {{such a system}} constitutes socialized medicine. While opposed to the Affordable Care Act and its requirement to buy insurance, some Republicans support some of its provisions, such as laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. The <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> a mixed record of supporting the historically popular Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs.|$|E
25|$|It {{would be}} no {{exaggeration to say that}} the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> been in a state of panic since the defeat of Mitt Romney, not least because the {{election}} highlighted American demographic shifts and, relatedly, the party's failure to appeal to Hispanics, Asians, single women and young voters. Hence the Republican leadership's new willingness to pursue immigration reform, even if it angers the conservative base.|$|E
25|$|The Senate {{majority}} {{lasted until}} 2001, when the Senate became split evenly but was regained in the 2002 elections. Both Republican majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats regained {{control in the}} mid-term elections of 2006. The <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> since been defined by social conservatism, a preemptive war foreign policy intended to defeat terrorism and promote global democracy, a more powerful executive branch, supply side economics, support for gun ownership, and deregulation.|$|E

25|$|By 1960 African Americans {{comprised}} 16.45% of the state's population. It was {{not until}} after the mid-1960s and passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 {{that they were able}} to vote in full again, but new devices, such as at-large commission city governments, had been adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation. Former Gov. Winfield Dunn and former U.S. Sen. Bill Brock wins in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among whites for the statewide victory. Tennessee has selected governors from different parties since 1970. Increasingly the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> become the party of white conservatives.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> been {{historically}} {{dominant in}} county-level politics. For statewide and national-level candidates, Pike County has {{leaned toward the}} Republican Party. In 2000 Republican George W. Bush won 53% to Democrat Al Gore's 42%. In 2004 Republican George W. Bush won 58% to Democrat John Kerry's 40%. In 2008 Republican John McCain won 51% to Democrat Barack Obama's 47%. But, due to population growth, new residents have led an increase in Democratic voting. In 2006, Democratic Governor Ed Rendell won Pike with 53%. Of the four statewide Democratic candidates in the 2008 election, {{the only one to}} carry Pike was Jack Wagner.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> {{included}} a liberal wing {{made up of}} individuals who, like members of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, believe {{in the power of}} government to improve people's lives. Before 1932 leading progressive Republicans included Theodore Roosevelt, Robert M. La Follette Sr., Charles Evan Hughes, Hiram Johnson, William Borah, George W. Norris, Hiram Johnson, and Fiorello La Guardia. Prominent liberal Republicans, 1936 to the 1970s, included Alf Landon, Wendell Willkie, Earl Warren, Thomas Dewey, Prescott Bush, Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., George W. Romney, William Scranton, Charles Mathias, Lowell Weicker, and Jacob Javits. Since 1976, liberalism has virtually faded out of the Republican Party, apart from a few Northeastern holdouts.|$|E

25|$|Since statehood, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> {{usually been}} the {{dominant}} party in Idaho. At one time, Idaho had two Democratic parties, one being the mainstream {{and the other}} called the Anti-Mormon Democrats, lasting into the early 20th century. In the 1890s and early 1900s, the Populist Party enjoyed prominence while the Democratic Party maintained a brief dominance in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Since World War II, most statewide elected officials have been Republicans. The last time the Democratic Party held a majority in either house of the state legislature was the House of Representatives in 1958 by one seat. However, Democrats did hold the governorship from 1971 to 1995, despite the state's Republican tilt.|$|E
25|$|Republicans had a stronghold in the Fox Valley, but {{elected a}} Democrat, Steve Kagen, of Appleton, for the 8th Congressional District in 2006. However, Kagen survived only two terms and was {{replaced}} by Republican Reid Ribble in the Republican Party's sweep of Wisconsin in November 2010, the first time the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> taken back both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship in the same election. Republicans have held Waukesha County. The City of Milwaukee heads the list of Wisconsin's Democratic strongholds, which also includes Madison and the state's Native American reservations. Wisconsin's largest Congressional district, the 7th, had voted Democratic since 1969. Its representative, David Obey, chaired the powerful House Appropriations Committee. However, Obey retired and the once Democratic seat was overtaken by Republican Sean Duffy in November 2010.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 Pew Center {{survey on}} Religion and Public Life {{indicates}} that 74 percent of U.S. Latter-day Saints church members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal members {{have stated that}} {{they feel that they}} have to defend their worthiness due to political differences. In recent decades, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> consistently won a majority of the LDS vote in most national and state-level elections. As a result, Utah, a state with a majority LDS population, {{is also one of the}} most heavily Republican states in the country. However, Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2014, became an LDS Church convert as a college student. James E. Faust (1920–2007), an apostle and member of the First Presidency, also identified himself as a Democrat prior to his full-time church service as a general authority (1972–2007).|$|E

25|$|All five statewide winners {{carried it}} in November 2004. Although the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> {{historically}} been dominant in county-level politics, the Democratic Party has made substantial inroads this decade. In 2005, Bethlehem Mayor Don Cunningham unseated incumbent County Executive Jane Ervin {{to become the}} first Democrat to be elected to the office. Four of the nine commissioner seats and all row offices except for the District Attorney have held by Democrats since winning two at-large seats in November 2007. Lehigh County has a home-rule charter with four at-large and five district commissioners. In 2006 Lehigh County voters approved a county-charter amendment to combine the offices of Clerk of Courts, Register of Wills, and Recorder of Deeds into the office of the Clerk of Judicial Records. Clerk of Courts Andrea Naugle won the new office in November 2007.|$|E
25|$|Owing {{largely to}} the {{prominence}} {{of the religious right}} in conservative politics in the United States, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> taken positions regarded by many as outwardly hostile to the gay rights movement. Republicans have historically strongly opposed same-sex marriage (the party's overall attitude on civil unions is much more divided, with some in favor and others opposed), with the issue a galvanizing one that many believe helped George W. Bush win re-election in 2004. In both 2004 and 2006, congressional Republican leaders promoted the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment which would legally restrict the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples. In both attempts, the amendment failed to secure enough votes to invoke cloture, and thus, ultimately was never passed. As more states legalized same-sex marriage in the 2010s, Republicans increasingly supported allowing each state to decide its own marriage policy.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> been {{historically}} {{dominant in}} Schuylkill County politics, Democrats became dominant {{at the county}} level after the 2007 elections. John McCain received 53.6% of the vote to 44.9% for Barack Obama in November 2008. In the state row offices of the same election, each statewide winner carried the county. In 2006 Democrat Tim Seip won the heavily Republican 125th House district and Bob Casey Jr. carried Schuylkill when he unseated incumbent Republican US Senator Rick Santorum. Former State Representative Dave Argall won the special election of March 3 to succeed the late State Senator Jim Rhoades and was sworn in on March 17. Jerry Knowles won the special election for Argall's seat in the 124th House district on May 19. In 2010, the GOP regained ground when Seip was defeated for reelection by Republican Mike Tobash. In 2011, the GOP reclaimed the county government.|$|E

500|$|Gilmore {{participated in}} his second debate on May 15 in South Carolina {{broadcast}} by Fox News. His first question concerned the perceived growing threat of a nuclear armed Iran.

He stated that as president he would join with American allies to put [...] "serious mandatory sanctions" [...] on the regime to let them know [...] "that it is better for them to give up this sort of plan (Nuclear proliferation)." [...] After receiving a question about Social Security, Gilmore changed the subject to address his record of cutting taxes as Governor of Virginia. He would later attack fellow candidates: Rudy Giuliani for his pro-choice positions, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for his record on taxes, and Mitt Romney for his position on health care. When asked about potential terrorist attacks, Gilmore reminded the audience that he was governor when The Pentagon was attacked on 9/11 and that he has [...] "the experience to deal with these issues." [...] At the end of the debate, Gilmore addressed the issue of race when asked why no minorities where present on the stage running for the presidency, he reacted to this question by declaring that the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> [...] "people that are prepared to [...] in the immediate future". He also cited his own credentials on race stating that as attorney general of Virginia he faced the issue when he {{had to deal with the}} burning of African-American churches, which gave him a good standing with the African-American community in his own judgment.|$|E

[...] The next day, Trump formally joined the Reform Party, changing his voter registration from Republican to Independence Party, the New York affiliate of the Reform Party. [...] On the same day, Buchanan announced that he too would leave the Republican Party to join with the Reform Party and attempt to obtain its presidential nomination. Buchanan said he refused to engage in a [...] "name-calling" [...] contest with Trump but made a thinly veiled attack against Trump's wealth, arguing, [...] "I don't believe the Reform Party nomination can be bought, and I don't believe the Presidency can be bought." [...] On Face the Nation, Pat Choate, the Reform Party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, said Trump would [...] "make a good candidate," [...] but argued that Buchanan could challenge Trump [...] "on the merits" [...] and that Trump and the media were misrepresenting Buchanan's views through [...] "hate politics." [...] Other party members expressed reservations about Trump's comments and personal life. [...] Verney wondered [...] "what the compelling reason is for him to seek the presidency." [...] Trump acknowledged himself as [...] "certainly controversial" [...] but labeled himself as [...] "a great businessman," [...] who would [...] "make the greatest treaties that this country's seen in a long time." [...] On Fox News Sunday, he criticized U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and said that as president he himself would fill the position and negotiate trade deals with other countries. [...] He identified France, Japan, Germany, and Saudi Arabia as nations taking advantage of badly negotiated trade deals with the United States.|$|E
