40|$|Background/Aim. Unstable intertrochanteric (IT) fractures, {{especially}} fractures with {{a reverse}} or transverse fracture line, have tendencies to make significant impaction on shortening of the femoral neck and lower extremity. The biomechanical {{complexity of the}} fracture, the type and {{the position of the}} implant are known to influence postoperative outcome. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare characteristics of two versions of dynamic hip implants in controlling the dynamization of unstable IT fractures of the femur. Methods. In the prospective study that included 1, 115 patients with fractures of the proximal femur, 61 patients had IT fractures with a reverse or transverse fracture line. All the patients were treated surgically with the same implant in two versions: Dynamic Hip Screw - DHS-MB-S implant with a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of standard length (40 mm) and DHS-MB-I implant, with a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of the implant individualized for each patient depending on the transverse diameter of the proximal femur. The patients were under gradual radiographic and clinical control. Six months postoperatively we measured the length of the extremity and the degree of the medialization of the distal part of the femur. Results. All the fractures healed six months after the operation. Medialization and shortening of the extremity were significantly less in the group with fractures fixed by the DHSMB- I implant, in which length of the <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of the implant was preoperatively measured individually for each patient. Conclusion. In order to achieve a desired functional result, the control of dynamisation in unstable IT fractures is significant in the fixation of these fractures of the femur. We presented possible methods to realize it by the contact of the <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of our implant with medial cortex of the proximal fragment of the femur...|$|R

The most straightforward approach to planar manipulation is to use a rigid grasp and a robot with at least three joints, corresponding to the three motion freedoms of a planar <b>rigid</b> <b>part,</b> but three joints are not really necessary to manipulate a part in the plane.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} human posture {{tracking}} by deploying accelerometers {{on a human}} body. One fundamental issue in such scenarios is how to calculate the gravity. This is very challenging especially when the human body parts keep on moving. Fortunately, {{it is likely that}} there is a point of the body that touches the ground in most cases. This allows sensors to collaboratively calculate the gravity vector. Assuming multiple accelerometers being deployed on a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of a human body, a recent work proposes a data fusion method to estimate the gravity vector on that <b>rigid</b> <b>part.</b> However, finding the optimal deployment of sensors that minimizes the estimation error of the gravity vector is not addressed. In this paper, we formulate the deployment optimization problem and propose two heuristics, called Metropolis-based method and largest-inter-distance-based method. Simulation and real experimental results show that our schemes are quite effective in finding near-optimal solutions for a variety of rigid body geometries.

40|$|Abstract — We {{model the}} full {{dynamics}} of a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> in three-point frictional sliding {{contact with a}} flat rigid 6 -degree-offreedom plate. Given a periodic plate motion and the geometric, inertial, and frictional properties of the part, we define an asymptotic twist field mapping each part configuration to a unique part twist (linear and angular velocity). Asymptotic twist vectors in the field approximate the part’s cycle-averaged twist at each configuration and are independent of time or the system’s initial state. Simulations and experiments show that the trajectory of the part’s configuration as it slides on the plate is well described by the field. With the ability to program arbitrary plate motions, part manipulation reduces to finding plate motions that generate asymptotic twist fields to accomplish desired tasks. Several simple fields useful for manipulation tasks (e. g., sensorless part alignment) are verified in simulation and experiment. For the special case of a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> with infinitesimal thickness, we show that the part’s cycle-averaged twist for any configuration asymptotically converges to a unique asymptotic twist vector.

The Zigzag wingbox consists of a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> and a morphing <b>part.</b> The <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> is a semi-monocoque construction that houses the fuel tank and transfers the aerodynamic loads from the morphing part to the fuselage. The morphing part consists of various morphing partitions where in each partition there are two spars each consisting of two beams hinged together. Each morphing partition is covered by flexible skin and is bounded by two ribs through which the spars are connected. The ribs transfer the loads between the spars of adjacent morphing partitions and serves as the main structure to which the flexible skins are to be attached. The Zigzag wingbox concept is then incorporated in the rectangular wing of a medium altitude long endurance (MALE) UAV to enhance its operational performance and provide roll control. Equivalent modelling and preliminary sizing of the concept are performed to assess its feasibility and quantify its potential benefits...|$|R

5000|$|In arthropods, the integument, the {{external}} [...] "skin", or [...] "shell", {{is the product}} of a single layer of ectodermal epithelium. That layer is attached to {{the external}} or distal surface of the deepest layer, the non-cellular internal membrane of the integument. That non-cellular membrane is called the basement membrane. The layer of epithelium on the basement membrane produces the cuticle, which begins as a tough, flexible layer of chitin. Such thin, flexible chitin is the major structural part of the integument where flexibility is necessary, such as in bodily parts that must stretch to contain accumulated liquids, or that form joints between <b>rigid</b> <b>parts</b> of the exoskeleton. In other parts of the cuticle the function of the integument demands more rigid materials, such as armoured regions or the biting parts of the jaws, or where the exoskeleton forms the tubular limbs of most Arthropoda. To achieve such rigidity the outer chitin layer of the cuticle is impregnated, thickened, and reinforced with harder, more brittle materials such as sclerotinised proteins or calcite. This main chitinous layer of the cuticle is called the procuticle.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research and testing done by NHTSA, other governments, research organizations {{as well as}} automobile manufacturers to find solutions that improve safety in the small cars when colliding with larger vehicles. In the United States, a group of experts proposed major steps to improve compatibility and these have been accepted as a voluntary regulation by American automotive manufacturers {{as well as by}} most other companies selling vehicles in the U.S. The Canadian government has also accepted these recommendations. The recommendations require all manufacturers to either (a) lower the height of the primary structure (also called frame rail) of all SUV and pickup trucks so that they overlap the primary structure of the cars; or (b) add another structure (called Secondary Energy Absorbing Structure) to the SUVs and pickup truck that cannot meet the first option. Latest studies have shown that these have improved the safety in cars when struck by SUVs. However, no such benefit has been observed in pickup truck to car crashes. It is unclear whether or not certain aftermarket modifications are taken into account, such as [...] "lift kits" [...] which raise the frame or suspension of a vehicle for increased ground clearance. Such modifications would likely greatly reduce the effectiveness of modern auto-safety advances due to causing the <b>rigid</b> <b>parts</b> of a pickup or SUV to strike the weaker parts of lower vehicles, rather than the reinforced regions in an accident.
