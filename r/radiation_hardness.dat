40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} mid-infrared PAH bands, continuum and emission lines as probes of star-formation and AGN activity {{in a sample of}} 100 `normal' and local (z~ 0. 1) galaxies. The MIR spectra were obtained with the Spitzer IRS as part of the Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey (SSGSS) which includes multi-wavelength photometry from the UV to the FIR and optical spectroscopy. The spectra were decomposed using PAHFIT (Smith et al. 2007), which we find to yield PAH equivalent widths (EW) up to ~ 30 times larger than the commonly used spline methods. Based on correlations between PAH, continuum and emission line properties and optically derived physical properties (gas phase metallicity, <b>radiation</b> field <b>hardness),</b> we revisit the diagnostic diagram relating PAH EWs and [NeII]/[OIV] and find it more efficient as distinguishing weak AGNs from star-forming galaxies than when spline decompositions are used.

The spectra show a vast range in starburst SEDs. The silicate absorption ranges from essentially no absorption to heavily obscured systems with an optical depth of τ 9. 8 µm ∼ 5. The spectral slopes {{can be used to}} discriminate between starburst and AGN powered sources. The monochromatic continuum fluxes at 15 µm and 30 µm enable a remarkably accurate estimate of the total infrared luminosity of the starburst. We find that the PAH equivalent width is independent of the total starburst luminosity LIR as both continuum and PAH feature scale proportionally. However, the luminosity of the 6. 2 µm feature scales with LIR and can be used to approximate the total infrared luminosity of the starburst. Although our starburst sample covers about a factor of ten difference in the [Ne III] / [Ne II] ratio, we found no systematic correlation between the <b>radiation</b> field <b>hardness</b> and the PAH equivalent width or the 7. 7 µm/ 11. 3 µm PAH ratio.

40|$|We present BOND, a Bayesian code to {{simultaneously}} derive oxygen and nitrogen abundances in giant H II regions. It compares observed emission lines to {{a grid of}} photoionization models without assuming any relation between O/H and N/O. Our grid spans a wide range in O/H, N/O and ionization parameter U, and covers different starburst ages and nebular geometries. Varying starburst ages accounts for variations in the ionizing <b>radiation</b> field <b>hardness,</b> which arise due to the ageing of H II regions or the stochastic sampling of the initial mass function. All previous approaches assume a strict relation between the ionizing field and metallicity. The other novelty is extracting information on the nebular physics from semi-strong emission lines. While strong lines ratios alone ([O III]/Hbeta, [O II]/Hbeta and [N II]/Hbeta) lead to multiple O/H solutions, the simultaneous use of [Ar III]/[Ne III] allows one to decide whether an H II region is of high or low metallicity. Adding He I/Hbeta pins down the <b>hardness</b> of the <b>radiation</b> field. We apply our method to H II regions and blue compact dwarf galaxies, and find that the resulting N/O vs O/H relation is as scattered as the one obtained from the temperature-based method. As in previous strong-line methods calibrated on photoionization models, the BOND O/H values are generally higher than temperature-based ones, which might indicate the presence of temperature fluctuations or kappa distributions in real nebulae, or a too soft ionizing radiation field in the models.

50|$|All {{optical fibers}} undergo some darkening {{depending}} {{on a number}} of factors that include: ionization type, optical fiber core glass composition, operating wavelength, dose rate, total accumulated dose, temperature and power propagating through the core. Since attenuation is composition dependent, it is observed that fibers having pure silica cores and fluorine down doped claddings are amongst the most radiation hard fibers. The presence of dopants in the core such as germanium, phosphorus, boron, aluminum, erbium, ytterbium, thulium, holmium etc. compromises the <b>radiation</b> <b>hardness</b> of optical fibers. To minimize damage consequences, it is better to use a pure silica core fiber at higher operating wavelength, lower dose rate, lower total accumulated dose, higher temperature (accelerated recovery) and higher signal power (photo-bleaching). In addition to these intrinsic steps, external engineering may be required to shield the fiber from the effects of radiation.|$|E

50|$|When silicon {{is grown}} by the Czochralski method, the melt is {{contained}} in a silica (quartz) crucible. During growth, {{the walls of the}} crucible dissolve into the melt and Czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 cm. Oxygen impurities can have beneficial or detrimental effects. Carefully chosen annealing conditions can give rise to the formation of oxygen precipitates. These have the effect of trapping unwanted transition metal impurities in a process known as gettering, improving the purity of surrounding silicon. However, formation of oxygen precipitates at unintended locations can also destroy electrical structures. Additionally, oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing. It was experimentally shown in the 1990s that the high oxygen concentration is also beneficial for the <b>radiation</b> <b>hardness</b> of silicon particle detectors used in harsh radiation environment (such as CERN's LHC/HL-LHC projects). Therefore, radiation detectors made of Czochralski- and Magnetic Czochralski-silicon are considered to be promising candidates for many future high-energy physics experiments.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} Aromatic Infrared Band (AIB) {{profiles}} observed by ISO-SWS towards {{a number of}} bright interstellar regions where dense molecular gas is illuminated by stellar radiation. Our sample spans {{a broad range of}} excitation conditions (exciting radiation fields with effective temperature, Teff, ranging from 23, 000 to 45, 000 K). The SWS spectra are decomposed coherently in our sample into Lorentz profiles and a broadband continuum. We find that the individual profiles of the main AIBs at 3. 3, 6. 2, 8. 6 and 11. 3 microns are well represented with at most two lorentzians. Furthermore, we show that the positions and widths of these AIBs are remarkably stable (within a few cm- 1). We then extract the profiles of individual AIBs from the data and compare them to a model of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) cation emission which includes the temperature dependence of the AIB profiles. The present similarity of the AIB profiles requires that the PAH temperature distribution remains roughly the same whatever the <b>radiation</b> field <b>hardness.</b> Deriving the temperature distribution of interstellar PAHs, we show that its hot tail, which controls the AIB spectrum, sensitively depends on Nmin (the number of C-atoms in the smallest PAH) and Teff. Comparing the observed profiles of the individual AIBs to our model results, we can match most of the AIB profiles if Nmin is increased with Teff. We then discuss our results in the broader context of ISO observations of fainter interstellar regions where PAHs are expected to be in neutral form.

Spectra obtained with the 6 -m telescope of SAO RAS are used along with archival data from Spitzer and several ground-based telescopes to infer a strength of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, age, properties of the UV radiation field, and metallicity of studied H II complexes. Physical properties (age, radiation field parameters, metallicity) {{are related to the}} F_ 8 /F_ 24 ratio used as a proxy for the PAH abundance in order to reveal factors that may influence the PAH evolution in H II complexes. The well-known correlation between the F_ 8 /F_ 24 ratio and metallicity is confirmed in the studied complexes. The infrared flux ratio also correlates with the [O III]λ 5007 /Hβ ratio which is often considered as an indicator of the <b>radiation</b> field <b>hardness,</b> but this correlation seems to be a mere reflection of a correlation between [O III]λ 5007 /Hβ and metallicity. In separate metallicity bins, the F_ 8 /F_ 24 ratio is found to correlate with an age of an H II complex, which is estimated from the equivalent width of Hβ line. The correlation is positive for low metallicity complexes and negative for high metallicity complexes. Analysing various mechanisms of PAH formation and destruction in the context of found correlations, we suggest that PAH abundance is likely altered by the UV radiation within H II complexes, but this is not necessarily due to their destruction. If PAHs can also form in H II complexes due to some processes like aromatisation, photodestruction, shattering and sputtering of very small grains, the net F_ 8 /F_ 24 ratio is determined by a balance between all these processes that can be different at different metallicities.
