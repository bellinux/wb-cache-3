40|$|The {{development}} of new antiviral agents has gained increasing momentum. It has kept pace with the identification of specific sites ("targets") in the virus replicative cycle at which potential antiviral drug can interact. The current armamentarium of available antiviral drugs consists of amantadine and rimantadine (against influenza A), ribavirin (against respiratory syncytial virus infection), idoxuridine and trifluridine (against herpetic keratitis), vidarabine and acyclovir (against herpes simplex virus infections), ganciclovir (against cytomegalovirus infections) and <b>Retrovir</b> (against AIDS). Various new compounds have been found which selectively inhibit those viruses [i. e. adenovirus, varicella-zoster virus, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) herpes simplex virus strains, and rhinoviruses] that are insensitive or poorly sensitive to the presently available antivirals. Several new compounds have also proven active against human immunodeficiency virus, the causative agent of AIDS; and, as a spin-off {{of the search for}} anti-AIDS drugs, new agents may also be expected that are effective against other retrovirus infections as well as hepadnavirus (i. e. hepatitis B virus) infections. status: publishe...|$|E

All types of infection caused by herpes simplex virus are potentially treatable by acyclovir, but treatment has to start to be effective.

40|$|Drug-drug {{interaction}} (DDI) is {{a challenging}} problem {{for treatment of}} HIV-infected patients. Zidovudine (AZT), prescribed under the names <b>Retrovir</b> and Retrovis, is the first U. S. government-approved antiretroviral drug used for the successful treatment of HIV/AIDS infectiousness. Given that ginseng is frequently utilized in combination with AZT and AZT is mainly eliminated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2 B 7, the aim of present study is to investigate the inhibition of UGT 2 B 7 -catalyzed AZT glucuronidation by 20 (S) -protopanaxatriol type (Ppt) which is the main ginsenoside absorbed into the plasma.

40|$|The {{anti-human}} {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) activity and hemopoietic toxicity of zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (dideoxyinosine; ddl), alone and in combination, were assessed {{in a variety}} of cell types. AZT was more potent than ddl as an inhibitor of HIV in vitro. Synergistic inhibition of HIV by the combination of these agents was observed in MT 4 cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and macrophages. Toxicity assessment in vitro by using progenitor (erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage) colony-forming assays with normal human bone marrow showed ddI to be less toxic than AZT. Addition of inhibitory concentrations of ddI to AZT resulted in additive inhibition of progenitor CFUs. These in vitro findings suggest that combinations of ddl and AZT at appropriately modified doses may provide an enhanced degree of selectivity in anti-HIV chemotherapy. <b>Retrovir</b> (zidovudine; 3 '-azidothymidine; AZT) provides significant clinical benefit to patients at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease (16, 17, 51, 55).

Over the 7 -day study, 12 adult male subjects received 12 administrations each of the capsule, solution, and syrup formulations every 4 h (six times daily) in a randomized sequence. Frequent blood samples were collected over the 4 -h period after dose 12 was administered. Zidovudine concentrations in plasma were determined by a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay. Results from statistical analyses indicated that all three formulations were bioequivalent with respect to systemic availability (area under the time-concentration curve) and that the syrup was also equivalent to the solution {{with respect to the}} maximum peak concentration in serum. The lower relative maximum peak concentration in serum (approximately 81 %) and small delays in time to peak concentration (less than 30 min) of the capsule formulation as compared with the liquid formulations are thought to be due to the additional processes of disintegration and dissolution associated with capsule administration. All three preparations were well tolerated during the 7 -day study...|$|E

The results from four patients who were on long-term (> or = 6 months) combination therapy with zidovudine and rifampin are presented. In all cases of combined use of zidovudine and rifampin, a lower area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and, consequently, a higher apparent clearance of zidovudine were found, compared with a reference population of zidovudine users. Patients had a low to normal maximum concentration of zidovudine in plasma. Elimination half-lives were normal {{in all but one}} patient. Zidovudine glucuronide concentrations were determined in three patients and three control subjects. The patients all had relatively higher peak plasma concentrations and higher AUCs of zidovudine glucuronide than the control subjects. In one patient, zidovudine and zidovudine glucuronide were also measured 2. 5 months after discontinuation of rifampin. The AUC of zidovudine increased by a factor of 2. These data are in agreement with an enzyme-inducing effect of rifampin on the glucuronidation of zidovudine. They indicate that long-term combination therapy of rifampin and zidovudine leads to increased clearance of zidovudine, which may have therapeutic consequences...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{fluorescence}} polarization immunoassay (FPIA) for zidovudine (azidothymidine; <b>Retrovir).</b> This assay is accurate and specific over the clinically relevant range of zidovudine concentrations in serum (from 1 to 1, 250 ng/ml; from 0. 004 to 4. 8 microM) and is unaffected by potentially interfering compounds in the sera {{of patients with}} renal or hepatic failure. Cross-reactivity with structural analogs of zidovudine (including zidovudine glucuronide) is less than 0. 05 %, except for cross-reactivities of 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4 % with 3 -methylthymidine, 3 ', 5 '-dideoxythymidine, and A 22 U (the optical isomer of zidovudine), respectively. The FPIA for zidovudine is more sensitive and more specific than high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); it requires 50 to 60 or 200 versus 500 microliters of serum and is faster to perform (45 specimens per h with the FPIA versus 3 specimens per h with HPLC). The zidovudine FPIA compares well with the radioimmunoassay. A correlation coefficient of 0. 992 was observed with 31 serum specimens examined by both methods. All three assays (FPIA, radioimmunoassay, and HPLC) are unaffected by the heat treatment used to inactivate human immunodeficiency virus.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} potential of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) to develop drug resistance, especially as 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (<b>Retrovir)</b> is now in widespread clinical use to treat people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). To address this possibility, mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase [deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed), EC 2. 7. 7. 49] gene have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned constructs in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the recombinant mutant reverse transcriptase {{from a number of}} these constructs revealed enzymes that maintained enzyme activity but had a reduced ability to recognize inhibitors such as azidothymidine triphosphate. To assess the infectivity of these mutants, several constructs of proviral HIV clones with mutant reverse transcriptase genes have been made and used to transfect T cells. All five mutants tested have lower infectious potential, suggesting considerable levels of reverse transcriptase activity are required for efficient virus replication. Viable virus recovered from two clones showed decreased sensitivity to the antiviral compound phosphonoformate, thus demonstrating the potential for drug-resistant HIV to replicate. However, although the reverse transcriptase from these mutant viruses showed decreased sensitivity to azidothymidine triphosphate, paradoxically these viruses were hypersensitive to azidothymidine when tested in culture...|$|E
40|$|Zidovudine (<b>Retrovir,</b> AZT) {{was first}} used in {{clinical}} trials in 1986. The article from St Stephen's Hospital which appears in this issue summarizes the experience of routine use of the drug by a single centre. It seems {{a good time to}} take stock of the present state of knowledge of the drug and to summarize what has been learnt over the last two years. Experience gained from developing zidovudine will help us to predict the difficulties of future assessment of any new anti-HIV drugs. In the original trial [1, 2] (of 282 patients) zidovudine showed great efficacy when it was given for 16 weeks to HIV-positive patients. Entry criteria included patients who either had a single episode of proved Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or who had symptoms of classical ARC (weight loss or oral candidiasis and either fever, night sweats, herpes zoster, oral hairy leukoplakia or unexplained diarrhoea). That original trial was stopped prematurely because of the great reduction in mortality of the treated group (19 vs. 1 death). Follow up data on that trial, however, show that patients on long-term treatment do still die from the results of opportunistic infections [1]. It is therefore a great pity that no placebo-controlled trial on other patient groups has yet been published which would help to define, more precisely, th...|$|E
40|$|It is {{recognized}} that high-level resistance to 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine, or <b>Retrovir)</b> is conferred {{by the presence}} of four mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase [RT; deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed), EC 2. 7. 7. 49] coding sequence. However, a number of clinical isolates have been observed that exhibit high-level resistance but contain only three of the four identified mutations (Asn- 67, Arg- 70, and Tyr- 215). Construction of a molecular clone with this genotype gave rise to only a partially resistant virus, raising the possibility that an additional mutation existed in some clinical isolates. Using an HIV marker rescue system, we have mapped and identified a fifth mutation conferring resistance to zidovudine, namely, methionine to leucine at codon 41 of HIV RT. An infectious molecular clone containing this mutation together with three previously identified mutations in the RT coding sequence yielded highly resistant HIV after transfection of T cells. Direct detection of the fifth mutation in DNA samples from cocultured peripheral blood lymphocytes by the PCR revealed that it occurred relatively early in the development of zidovudine resistance. However, this mutation was only detected after the appearance of the codon 215 change in the RT coding sequence. Identification of this mutation in addition to the other known mutations conferring resistance enables rapid and direct correlation between an RT genotype and sensitivity of the virus...|$|E

The addition of 3 TC to AZT delays AZT resistance in therapy-naive patients and can restore viral AZT susceptibility in patients who previously received AZT alone. In some AZT-experienced patients, the virological response to AZT- 3 TC therapy is not sustained and virus resistant to both drugs can be identified. To gain insight into the possible mechanism of dual resistance, we studied a recently described variant resistant to both AZT and 3 TC and obtained by simultaneous passage of an AZT-resistant clinical isolate in cell culture with AZT and 3 TC. Genetic mapping and site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that a polymorphism at codon 333 (Gly to Glu) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) was critical in facilitating dual resistance in a complex background of AZT and 3 TC resistance mutations. To assess the potential clinical relevance of RT codon 333 changes, we studied dually resistant viruses from patients taking AZT and 3 TC. Genetic mapping of RT molecular clones derived from patients’ plasma samples demonstrated {{that in some cases}} polymorphism at codon 333 was responsible for facilitating dual resistance...|$|E
40|$|Two {{important}} {{studies were}} presented back to back. David Nolan's study was presented immediately after Michael Dubé's A 5005 s substudy of ACTG 384. Using {{a different approach}} from the ACTG study (a longitudinal, non-randomized trial), this group from western Australia looked at {{what happened to the}} peripheral fat of treatment-naive patients who were started on a regimen containing either stavudine (d 4 T, Zerit) or zidovudine (AZT, <b>Retrovir).</b> The number of patients in this study was smaller than in the A 5005 s substudy. There were only 53 patients in Dr. Nolan's study, 27 of whom had received stavudine, and 26 zidovudine. Both groups of patients were comparable at baseline, with a slightly lower body mass index (BMI) for the group that received stavudine (remember, this was not a randomized trial). Patients were followed {{for two and a half}} years on average, and if they changed their medication, they were censored at that point. Patients had three to six dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans during the follow up. With the longitudinal data captured, they were able to model fat loss over time for each group of patients. They were also able to create mathematical equations that would predict the rate of fat loss depending on the nucleoside (stavudine or zidovudine) that was selected to originally treat the patients. The choice of stavudine or zidovudine was a strong predictor of the rate of fat loss in the extremities of these patients. Whether the patient was or was not on a PI- or an NNRTI-based regimen did not matter at all. Age and an AIDS diagnosis were also predictors of the fat loss. The study has the beauty of longitudinal studies. Cross-sectional studies, no matter how well done or large they are, cannot tell us more of what they have told us already. This study confirms A 5005 s, which proved that patients receiving stavudine lose peripheral fat faster than patients receiving zidovudine. Not a big surprise for anybody, but it is nice to see data that supports conventional wisdom...|$|E

Some (similar to 8) generic formulations of zidovudine {{are available in}} Brazil; however, based on a literature search, information concerning their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties in the Brazilian population has not been reported. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties of 2 capsule formulations of zidovudine 100 mg in healthy Brazilian volunteers. Methods: This open-label, randomized, 2 -way crossover study utilized a 1 -week washout period between doses. Blood samples were collected for 8 hours after a single dose of zidovudine 100 -mg test (Zidovudina, Fundaqdo para o Remedio Popular, Sao Paulo, Brazil) or reference formulation (<b>Retrovir</b> (R), GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Plasma zidovudine concentrations were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with ultraviolet detection at 265 nm. C-max, T-max, AUC(0 -t), AUC(0 -infinity), t(1 / 2), and the elimination constant (k(e)) were determined using noncompartmental analysis. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the 90 % CIS for C-max, AUC(0 -t), and AUC(0 -infinity) fell within the interval of 80 % to 125 %, the regulatory definition set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Results: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 males, 12 females; mean age, 27 years; weight, 60 kg; height, 167 cm) were enrolled and completed the study. The 90 % CIs of the treatment ratios for the logarithmic-transformed values of C-max, AUC(0 -t), and AUC(0 -infinity) were 80. 0 % to 113. 6 %, 93. 9 % to 109. 7 %, and 93. 6 % to 110. 1 %, respectively. The values for the test and reference formulations were within the FDA bioequivalence definition intervals of 80 % to 125 %. Conclusions: In this small study in healthy subjects, no statistically significant differences in C-max, AUC(0 -t), and AUC(0 -) infinity were found between the test and reference formulations of zidovudine 100 -mg capsules. The 90 % CIs for the mean ratio values for the test and reference formulations of AUC(0 -t), AUC(0 -infinity), and C-max indicated that the reported data were entirely within the bioequivalence acceptance range proposed by the FDA of 80 % to 125 % (using log-transformed data) ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of drug-induced reduction of viral burden in the thymus on virus-mediated thymic involution and peripheral blood CD 4 decline using FIV-infected cats as a model for pediatric HIV- 1 infection. Eight-week-old cats were randomly assigned to uninfected, saline-treated; uninfected, ZDV-treated; FIV-infected, saline-treated; and FIV-infected, ZDV-treated groups. Parameters measured included blood lymphocyte numbers, viral load in blood and thymic tissue, and thymic histopathology. While the viral burden was significantly reduced by ZDV monotherapy in peripheral blood lymphocytes, plasma, and thymus, thymic lesions were similar for the treated and untreated FIV-infected cats. Further, markedly lowering the viral burden did not increase blood CD 4 lymphocyte numbers or prevent their decline.

The goal of HIV- 1 treatment {{is to reduce}} the number of virions in the body of infected individuals and to prevent rapid destruction of CD 4 + T-lymphocyte cells, thus protecting the immune system. Most of the anti-HIV- 1 drugs in practice are designed using viral reverse transcriptase (HIV- 1 RT), protease, and integrase as targets. These drugs that inhibit the activities of HIV- 1 RT, viral protease, and integrase are therefore known as anti-HIV- 1 RT, antiprotease, and anti-integrase molecules, respectively. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved 22 anti-HIV- 1 /acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) drugs for clinical use by HIV- 1 -infected individuals and AIDS patients. Among the drugs, most of the nucleoside analogs (excluding two isomers of 3 TC, (-) 3 TC and (+) 3 TC, which are shown to be less toxic in cell culture) exhibit clinical complications that pose a threat to chemotherapy. The toxicity of these molecules arises due to their negative impact on the activities of human mitochondrial chromosomal DNA polymerases (a, d, &szlig;, and e) in general and DNA polymerase &gamma; in particular. Other anti-HIV- 1 regimens are also reported to cause toxicity. The range of toxicity extends from mild to life-threatening levels. The prolonged use of zidovudine (3 &prime;-azido- 3 &prime;-deoxythymidine [AZT] or <b>Retrovir),</b> which was first approved in 1987 as a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has been reported to cause severe hematologic toxicity, including severe anemia, granulocytopenia, and symptomatic myopathy. Many other drugs that are often used in combination with AZT have similar toxicities. The newer antiretrovirals (ARVs), such as 2 &prime;, 3 &prime;-dideoxycytidine, 2 &prime;, 3 &prime;-dideoxyinosine, and 2 &prime;, 3 &prime;-dideoxy- 2 &prime;, 3 &prime;-didehydrothymidine, which exhibit analogous mechanisms of action and similar toxicities to AZT, have not been studied extensively. Acyclovir and gancyclovir can cause severe nausea and vomiting. Some of these ARVs when taken during pregnancy may generate teratogenic effects. Similarly, use of antiproteases in highly active ARV therapy causes hepatotoxicity, which poses a severe risk to the patients. In addition, application of fusion inhibitors and anti-integrases induces strong side effects in HIV- 1 -infected or AIDS patients. The present review illustrates a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on the toxicity of anti-HIV- 1 /AIDS drugs, their mechanisms of action, and possible management strategies to combat this problem.
