50|$|The <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona pretrei) is {{a species}} of parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is found in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.|$|E
5000|$|The Ecological Station is a [...] "strict nature reserve" [...] under IUCN {{protected}} area category Ia.The {{purpose is to}} preserve the environment and support scientific research.Protected species include the <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona pretrei).|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of molecular markers for population studies {{is an important}} tool for biodiversity conservation. The family Psittacidae contains many endangered and vulnerable species and we tested three kinds of molecular markers for their potential use in population studies of five psitacid species: 43 hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), 42 blue-and-yellow macaws (Ara ararauna), 23 red-and-green macaws (Ara chloroptera), 19 <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazons</b> (Amazona pretrei); and 18 red-tailed amazons (Amazona brasiliensis). We tested 21 clones from a genomic library of golden conure (Guarouba guarouba) minisatellites and 12 pairs of microsatellite primers developed for the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) and A. hyacinthinus. We also tested seven tetranucleotide repeat primers {{for their ability to}} amplify regions between microsatellite loci (inter simple sequence repeats, ISSRs). We were able to select seven markers that were variable in different degrees for three species (A. hyacinthinus, A. chloroptera and A. ararauna). The mini and microsatellites produced more polymorphic patterns than the ISSRs. The genetic variability of the species studied seems to be correlated with their endangered status...|$|R
50|$|Endangered fauna on the {{plateaus}} of {{the park}} include the <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> parrot, the maned wolf, and the cougar. On the slopes, the neotropical otter, ocelot and the brown howling monkey can be found.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} {{a refuge for}} wild animals such as pacas, robust {{capuchin}} monkeys, pygmy brocket (Mazama nana) and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), as well as species of birds such as the vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea), <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona pretrei), scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and azure jay (Cyanocorax caeruleus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> is 32 cm long. It {{is mostly}} green with some sparse red spots on head, {{variable}} extent of red on forehead, lores and around eyes, white eyerings, red on the {{bend of the}} wings with blue tips to secondaries and primaries, yellowish bill. Females have less red on the bend of the wing.|$|E
50|$|The white-fronted amazon (Amazona albifrons) {{also known}} as the white-fronted parrot, or by the adopted slang term spectacled amazon parrot, is a Central American species of parrot. Not to be {{confused}} with the <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon.</b> They can imitate a range from 30 to 40 different sounds. Like other large parrots, the white-fronted parrot has a long potential life span, usually around 40 years.|$|E
50|$|The park is {{classified}} as IUCN protected area category II (national park). It has the objectives of preserving natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty, enabling scientific research, environmental education, outdoors recreation and eco-tourism.The park is intended to preserve the Araucária Forest, alpine meadows and cloud forests.Protected species in the park include maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), cougar (Puma concolor), <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona pretrei) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus).|$|E

5000|$|... 346 {{bird species}} have been recorded, {{although}} some are dubious.Species include bare-faced curassow (Crax fasciolata), blue-winged macaw (Primolius maracana), blue-bellied parrot (Triclaria malachitacea), <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona pretrei), purple-winged ground dove (Claravis geoffroyi), Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris), Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus), grey-bellied hawk (Accipiter poliogaster), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and canebrake groundcreeper (Clibanornis dendrocolaptoides).The park is an important site for conserving the black-fronted piping guan (Pipile jacutinga) in Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The Quarta Colônia State Park {{was created}} by {{governor}} Germano Antônio Rigotto by state decree 44.186 of 19 December 2005.The park was created as environmental compensation for the Dona Francisca Hydroelectric Plant on the Jacuí River.The main objective {{is to protect the}} forest remnants and species listed as endangered in Brazil such as <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona pretrei), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), brocket deer (Mazama species), Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi) and oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus).As of 2016 land ownership had not been regularized, there was no management plan and no facilities for visiting the park.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} part of the core area of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve.It is within the Sinos River {{ecological}} corridor between the Caí River and Tainhas River ecological corridors.The various existing or planned protected areas form an important arc and biodiversity corridor along the slopes of the plateau.Protected species in the forest include the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), cougar (Puma concolor), red myotis (Myotis ruber) bat, black-capped piprites (Piprites pileata), vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea), <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona pretrei) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus).|$|E
5000|$|The white-fronted amazon, {{at about}} 25 cm long, is the {{smallest}} of the amazon parrots. This species is named for the bright white patch of feathers on its forehead, although the amount of white varies from individual to individual. They have mostly green plumage with some blue colouring on their outspread wings. They have bright red colouring around their eyes (in some individuals almost like spectacles) and blue colouring behind the patch of white on their foreheads. Together with the <b>red-spectacled</b> <b>amazon</b> and the yellow-lored amazon, it is the only amazon species in which adult males and females easily can be distinguished by external appearance (sexual dimorphism): Males have bright red feathers on their [...] "shoulders" [...] (alula), while females have green [...] "shoulders". Juveniles have pale grey irises and less red on their face and the white area is replaced with a smaller yellowish area.|$|E
