The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the <b>regularisation</b> of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E
5|$|The first {{organised}} {{postal service}} was established between Madras and Calcutta by Governor Edward Harrison in 1712. After reform and <b>regularisation,</b> a new postal system {{was started by}} Sir Archibald Campbell and was introduced on 1 June 1786. The Presidency was divided into three postal divisions: Madras North up to Ganjam, Madras South-West to Anjengo (erstwhile Travancore) and Madras West, up to Vellore. In the same year, a link with Bombay was established then in 1837, the Madras, Bombay and Calcutta mail services were integrated to form the All-India Service. On 1 October 1854, the first stamps were issued by the Imperial Postal Service. The General Post Office (GPO), Madras, was established by Sir Archibald Campbell in 1786. In 1872–73, a bimonthly sea-mail service began between Madras and Rangoon. This {{was followed by the}} commencement of a fortnightly sea-mail service between Madras and ports on the eastern coast.|$|E

40|$|Our goal is {{to develop}} a more general scheme for {{constructing}} integrable lattice <b>regularisations</b> of integrable quantum field theories. Considering the affine Toda theories as examples, we show how to construct such lattice <b>regularisations</b> using the representation theory of quantum affine algebras. This requires us to clarify in particular the relations between the light-cone approach to integrable lattice models and the representation theory of quantum affine algebras. Both are found to be related in a very natural way, suggesting a general scheme for the construction of generalised Baxter Q-operators. One of the main difficulties we need to deal with is coming from the infinite-dimensionality of the relevant families of representations. It is handled by means of suitable renormalisation prescriptions defining what may be called the modular double of quantum affine algebras. This framework allows us to give a representation-theoretic proof of finite-difference equations generalising the Baxter equation. Comment: 155 pages; v 2 : Refs. adde...|$|R

This formation memorandum {{formed the basis}} for the real negotiations. It contained 80 pages and nine chapters about various issues; however, it did not contain a separate chapter on constitutional reform and devolution. In his memorandum, Leterme proposed lowering income taxes for those with low and median incomes, changing the unemployment benefits system, and expanding parental leave. He also wanted to keep several nuclear power stations open longer, build 1,500 additional prison cells, and establish an emergency budget for the FPS Justice to hire more people. The formateur did not want a collective <b>regularisation</b> of illegal immigrants, but proposed the establishment criteria to allow <b>regularisation</b> in individual cases.|$|E

A single‐component staggered quark field is used on lattices of size (L/a) 3 ×(L/a± 1).

These safeguards include the right to guardianship, legal assistance and representation, safety and protection, support for physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration, <b>regularisation</b> of immigration status, the right to compensation, {{and the right to}} act as a party, or plaintiff, in criminal proceedings. An important safeguard for trafficked children who have been exploited in illegal or criminal activities is the ‘non-punishment clause’. It means that child victims of criminal offences, including human trafficking, are to be protected from sanctions or prosecution for acts that they committed in relation to their situation as victims.|$|E
25|$|Within the EU, Spain had the 2nd highest {{immigration}} rate in percentage terms after Cyprus, {{but by a}} great margin, the highest in absolute numbers, up to 2008. The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2million in 2008 {{out of a total}} population of 46million. In 2005 alone, a <b>regularisation</b> programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people. There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce.|$|E

Via twisted mass QCD (tmQCD), these operators provide the matrix elements relevant for the B 0 − ¯B 0 mixing amplitude. The layout of a non-perturbative renormalisation programme for the operator basis, using Schrödinger Functional techniques, is described. Finally, we report our results for a one-loop perturbative study of various renormalisation schemes with Wilson-type lattice <b>regularisations,</b> which allows, in particular, to compute the NLO anomalous dimensions of the operators in the SF schemes of interest.

(Earlier English did not use the word [...] "do" [...] as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions where it was not obligatory. Now, do-support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in -ing, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common. <b>Regularisation</b> of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. more polite instead of politer). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power.|$|E

30|$|To sum up, we {{can argue}} {{that the history of}} Indian {{immigration}} in Italy and Spain fits the so-called Southern European model of immigration. In particular, the main characteristics of this model are (a) the timing and the size of inflows, (b) the reasons for and the modes of entry (a lack of selective immigration policies and the use of ex post instruments to provide a legal status to immigrants, such as <b>regularisations,</b> quota systems and flow decrees) and (c) the distinctive way of integration into the local labour market (a large underground economy attracting undocumented immigrants and a strong segmentation of the labour market) (Peixoto et al. 2012; Di Bartolomeo et al. 2016).|$|R

Indeed so far as I could get at her, she regarded sexual passion as being hardly more legitimate in a civilised person than--let us say--homicidal mania. She must have forgotten--and Bailey too. I suspect she forgot before she married him. I don't suppose either of them had the slightest intimation of the dimensions sexual love can take in the thoughts of {{the great majority of}} people with whom they come in contact. They loved in their way--an intellectual way it was and a fond way--but it had no relation to beauty and physical sensation--except that there seemed a decree of exile against these things. They got their glow in high moments of altruistic ambition--and in moments of vivid worldly success. They sat at opposite ends of their dinner table with so and so [...] "captured," [...] and so and so, flushed with a mutual approval. They saw people in love forgetful and distraught about them, and just put it down to forgetfulness and distraction.

40|$|Through {{detection}} by low {{gravitational wave}} space interferometers, {{the capture of}} stars by supermassive black holes will constitute a giant step forward {{in the understanding of}} gravitation in strong field. The impact of the perturbations on the motion of the star is computed via the tail, the back-scattered part of the perturbations, or via a radiative Green function. In the former approach, the self-force acts upon the background geodesic, while in the latter, the geodesic is conceived in the total (background plus perturbations) field. <b>Regularisations</b> (mode-sum and Riemann-Hurwitz ζ function) intervene to cancel divergencies coming from the infinitesimal size of the particle.

We describe the practical implementation of this method, and study its performance for high-energy physics collision events for QCD 2 → 2 processes.
