2500|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} church {{goes back to the}} 7thcentury. The present church is believed to be built on the site where Plegmund, later Archbishop of Canterbury, lived as a hermit in the 9th century. The surrounding land used to be a marsh and the church stands in a slightly elevated area which was known as [...] "The Isle of Chester". [...] The original church was built in the 12thcentury but the present building dates mostly from the 15thcentury. [...] This was financed by the Trafford family who lived locally. [...] A tower was added at the west end in 1826. [...] Inscriptions in the church show that there were restorations in 1684, 1711, 1802–03 and 1819. [...] Death watch beetle was found in some <b>roof</b> <b>rafters</b> and the church was re-roofed in 1958. [...] Electric light was installed in the church in 1966 and central hearing was installed in 1968. [...] Since then a toilet and an entrance for disabled people have been built on to the vestry on the north side. [...] In 2006 new lighting was fitted in the church. [...] The pews were removed from the Barnston Chapel and replaced by modern chairs.|$|E

I had to pump it out; I think I took out a {{thousand}} gallons before I got clear down to the rock. Then I took my solid steel beams in fifty-foot lengths," [...] here Mr. Newberry imitated with his arms the action of a man setting up a steel beam, [...] "and set them upright and bolted them on the rock. After that I threw my steel girders across, clapped on my <b>roof</b> <b>rafters,</b> all steel, in sixty-foot pieces, and then just held it easily, just supported it a bit, and let it sink gradually to its place." ...|$|E

Typical of Craftsman style, it features a low-pitched, shingled (originally wood-shingled) roof, wide eaves with large braces beneath, exposed <b>roof</b> <b>rafter</b> tails, and a centered gabled dormer.

50|$|A single movable pulley has an MA of 2 (assuming {{frictionless}} bearings in the pulley). Consider {{a pulley}} {{attached to a}} weight being lifted. A rope passes around it, with one end attached to a fixed point above, e.g. a barn <b>roof</b> <b>rafter,</b> and a pulling force is applied upward {{to the other end}} with the two lengths parallel. In this situation the distance the lifter must pull the rope becomes twice the distance the weight travels, allowing the force applied to be halved. Note: if an additional pulley is used to change the direction of the rope, e.g. the person doing the work wants to stand on the ground instead of on a rafter, the mechanical advantage is not increased.|$|R

5000|$|In light frame construction, a {{birdsmouth}} joint or bird's beak cut is a woodworking joint that {{is generally}} used to connect a <b>roof</b> <b>rafter</b> {{to the top}} plate of a supporting wall. It is an indentation cut into the rafter which consists of a [...] "seat cut" [...] (the face of which rests on the top plate) and a [...] "heel cut" [...] or [...] "plumb cut" [...] (the face of which lies parallel to the supporting wall), forming a shape resembling a bird's mouth. The indentation should not extend unsupported on the interior {{in order to maintain}} the structural integrity of the rafter because the unsupported section can split along the grain of the wood. The joint is generally fastened with nails by toenailing the rafter from the side into the top plate below.|$|R
