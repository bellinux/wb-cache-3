50|$|Shihmen Dam is a <b>rolled</b> <b>rockfill</b> {{embankment}} dam 133.1 m high and 360 m long, constructed over a 70 m high concrete core. The {{main body of}} the dam contains some 7.06 million cubic metres (9.23 million yd3) of material. At the crest, the dam is 11.5 m wide, with an elevation of 252.1 m above sea level. The normal water level is 245 m, with a maximum flood level of 249.7 m.|$|E

The reservoir {{was to be}} 1300 acre, impounding [...] The project was completed in 1981 as Jennings Randolph Lake with a <b>rolled</b> earth and <b>rockfill</b> dam, 296 ft high. The reservoir area is 952 acre. The cost-benefit ratio for the project was projected at 1.7.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concrete}} faced rockfill {{embankment dam}} was built {{due to a}} rising demand for water from the expanding population on the Central Coast. The dam was built to boost water supply storage and to help provide a more reliable water supply. Mangrove Creek Dam was built using <b>rolled,</b> soft <b>rockfill</b> of sandstones and siltstones. This material was obtained from a quarry located within the storage area. These sandstones and siltstones were crushed and compacted to form the dam embankment. The embankment also contains approximately [...] of processed basalt. This material was incorporated into various filters and drains within the embankment to cope with seepage within the embankment and foundations. The concrete face which tapers from 600 mm at the base to 300 mm at the crest acts as a seal between {{the water and the}} dam embankment. Provision was made to increase the height of the dam wall by 25 m to a total capacity of [...] if the need arose in the future.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{construction}} of one large <b>rolled</b> earthfill and <b>rockfill</b> embankment {{to serve as the}} Cardinia Dam wall, and some other saddle dams in nearby hills, the large water storage facility of the Cardinia Reservoir was created. The dam was built by Fluor Construction, and engineered by Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, under contract to the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW). The dam wall height is 86 m and the main embankment is 1542 m long. The two saddle dams are 10 m high and 323 m long; and 16 m high and 1219 m long respectively. At 100% capacity the dam wall was designed to hold back [...] of water. The surface area of Cardinia Reservoir is 1295 ha and the catchment area is 2800 ha. The ungated uncontrolled spillway is capable of discharging [...]|$|R
