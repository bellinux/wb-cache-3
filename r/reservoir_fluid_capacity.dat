30|$|Petroleum reservoirs’ fluids {{composition}} undergoes considerable changes {{through the}} field exploitation (Danesh et al. 1992; Kuntadi et al. 2012; Rastegar and Jessen 2009). This composition modification, resulted from different oil and gas velocities in porous medium for regular production scenarios. <b>Reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> type and its thermodynamic condition may enhance the composition change. For example, volatile oil and gas condensate <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids</b> experience larger composition changes for the same production scenarios than dry gas and black oil <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids.</b> This phenomenon is accelerated {{in the case of}} gas injection processes wherein hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons with different compositions are mixed with in-place <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids.</b> There are many components in petroleum <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids.</b> These components are usually grouped due to computational resource limitations and calculation performance. In a typical grouping technique, grouped <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids</b> are prepared in two steps. In the first step, components should be classified into different groups and in the second step, the pseudo-components (groups) critical and thermo-physical properties are calculated (Briesen and Marquardt 2004). <b>Reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> composition {{plays a key role in}} properties’ calculations. Therefore, oil and gas fields compositional simulation with grouped <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> descriptions lose their validity after a period (as pseudo-components properties are changing with composition change). Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a grouped fluid description for which composition changes have minimal impact to pseudo-components’ properties. Besides this, detailed composition changes must be controlled to check the accuracy of the compositional simulation with a lumped fluid description. In addition, there are several cases in which it is required to retrieve the detailed fluid composition from equilibrium calculations performed on lumped fluid description (Kuntadi et al. 2012). For example, to simulate a surface facility, for which the inputs are the compositions of the reservoir outputs provided by the reservoir simulation, those must usually be known with precision. Surface facility simulations can be performed for a larger number of components (Nichita et al. 2007; Nichita and Graciaa 2011). The detailed equilibrium ratios’ estimation from the results of a lumped system flash calculation is referred to as delumping or inverse lumping process (Schlijper and Drohm 1988). Several delumping methods are reported in the literature for cubic equations of state like Peng–Robinson (PR) (Peng and Robinson 1976).|$|R

In previous work, the friction theory (f-theory) models have already been shown capable of providing simple but accurate viscosity modeling results of petroleum <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids</b> with molar masses up to around 200 g-mol- 1. As a base, the f-theory approach requires a compositional characterization procedure {{to be used in}} conjunction with a van der Waals type of equation of state (EOS).

The slope of the MMP versus CO 2 percent graph was steeper for C 3 compared to C 2.

In Eq. (8), c 1 and c 2 are non-Darcy parameters which reflect the effect of fluid properties and the interaction between the fluid and solid. The coefficient c 1 illustrates that the <b>fluids</b> of low-permeability <b>reservoir</b> flow mainly have to overcome the yield stress, and the coefficient c 2 indicates the influence of the absorption of the boundary layer on the <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid.</b> Moreover, because the size of pore throat in tight sandstone is tiny, belonging to the micron level, the microscale effects must be considered. Because of the small size of the <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids,</b> the small factors (mainly including the scale effect and surface effect) affecting macroscopic flow turn to be the main factors that control the fluid process in low-permeability reservoir. Yield stress, adsorption of the boundary layer and microscale effects are not alone, but they are mutually affected and coupled. Because of microscale effect, the influence of surface force is much larger than the volume force and needs to be regarded as a dominant force. The larger the surface force is, the stronger the <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> is adsorbed by the boundary constraints. All these nonlinear factors lead the <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids,</b> show stronger nonlinear fluid flow characteristics and deviate from the Darcy’s laws. In addition, the displacement force decreases as the strength the binding force increases and thus the <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> is absorbed more easily by the boundary layer, which can increase the thickness of the boundary layer and exacerbate the microscale effect. All of these indicate that the coefficient c 3 reflects the coupling and interaction effect very well.|$|R

ABSTRACT: Fluid classification is {{a critical factor in}} decision of reservoir and production problems. <b>Reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> can be classified into five types according to laboratory and production data as black oil, volatile oil, gas condensate, wet gas and dry gas. In this work a novel application of Neural Networks (ANN) is presented. Based on production and laboratory data neural networks model is developed for automatic classification of <b>reservoir</b> <b>FLUID.</b> More than 450 samples of five types of <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids</b> are used to develop the neural network model. About 70 % of data are accepted for neural network training, 15 % for validation and 15 % are used as test set. The importance of different input fluid properties in classification was studied. The different types of architectures for different groups of input data were tested to select the optimal neural network architecture by fitness criteria. The optimized neural network model was capable of classifying the <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids</b> with high accuracy. The performance of ANNs models was determined by classification quality index and network error. The model has been applied successfully to classification of Yemeni fluids using different range of parameters. The results show that the proposed novel ANN model can achieve high accuracy...|$|R

30|$|Typically, {{compositional}} simulators {{are used}} for simulating gas condensate and volatile oil reservoirs due {{to the importance of}} changes in composition of these <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids</b> (Jamal et al. 2006). However, in many cases, simulation of compositional model for these types of reservoirs is not necessary. For an optimal performance, an intermediate simulator between standard black-oil and compositional, called modified black-oil, can be used. In this way, the volume of calculations decreases remarkably (El-Banbi et al. 2006). Hence, after simulating thermodynamic behavior of <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid,</b> compositional as well as modified black-oil model were exported from WINPROP to import to GEM and IMEX and results were compared.|$|R

40|$|This Ph. D. {{research}} project targets Cooper Basin oil reservoirs of very low permeability (approximately 1 mD) where injectivities required for water flooding are not achievable. However, {{the use of}} injection gases such as CO₂ would not have injectivity problems. CO₂ is abundant {{in the region and}} available for EOR use. CO₂ was compared to other CO₂-rich injection gases with a hydrocarbon content including pentane plus components. While the effect of hydrocarbon components up to butane have been investigated in the past, the effect of n-pentane has on impure CO₂ gas streams has not. One particular field of the Cooper Basin was investigated in detail (Field A). However, since similar <b>reservoir</b> and <b>fluid</b> characteristics of Field A are common to the region it is expected that the data measured and developed has applications to many other oil reservoirs of the region and similar reservoirs elsewhere. The aim of this Ph.

The summarised goals of this research are to: • Determine the compatibility of Field A <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> with CO₂ as an injection gas. • Compare CO₂ to other injection gas options for Field A. • Development of a correlation to predict the effect of nC₅ on MMP for a CO₂- rich injection gas stream. These goals were achieved through the following work: • Extensive experimental studies of the reservoir properties and the effects of interaction between CO₂-rich injection gas streams and Field A <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> measuring properties related to: •	Miscibility of the injection gas with Field A <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> •	Solubility and swelling properties of the injection gas with Field A <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> •	Change in viscosity-pressure relationship of Field A <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> due to addition of injection gas • A reservoir condition core flood experiment • Compositional simulation of the reservoir condition core flood to compare expected recoveries from different injection gases • Development of a set of Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) measurements targeted at correlating the effect of nC₅ on CO₂ MMP. The key findings of this research are as follows: • Miscibility is achievable at practical pressures for Field A and similar <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluids</b> with pure CO₂ or CO₂-rich injection gases. • For Field A <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid,</b> viscosity of the remaining flashed liquid will increase at pressures below ~ 2500 psi due to mixing the <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> with a CO₂-rich injection gas stream. • Comparison of injection gases showed that methane rich gases are miscible with Field A so long as a significant quantity of C₃+ components is also present in the gas stream. • There is a defined trend for effect of nC₅ on MMP of impure CO₂. This trend was correlated with an error of less than 4 %. • Even though oil composition is taken into account with the base gas MMP, it still affects the trend for effect of nC₅ on MMP of a CO₂-rich gas stream. • An oil characterisation factor was developed to account for this effect, significantly improving the results, reducing the error of the correlation to only 1. 6 %. The significance of these findings is as follows: • An injection pressure above ~ 3000 psi should be targeted. At these pressures miscibility is achieved and the viscosity of the <b>reservoir</b> <b>fluid</b> injection gas mix is reduced. • CO₂ should be compared to gases such as Tim Gas should after considering the cost of compression, pipeline costs and distance from source to destination will need to be considered. • The addition of nC₅ will reduce the MMP and increase the recovery factor, however the cost of the nC₅ used would be more than the value of increased oil recovered. • The developed correlation for the effect of nC₅ on impure CO₂ MMP can be used broadly within the limits of the correlation. • Further research using more oils is necessary to validate the developed oil characterisation factor and if successful, using the same or similar method used to improve other correlations.
