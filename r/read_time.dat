40|$|Powerize Server 1. 0, {{developed}} by Powerize. com, is a content-based information filtering and retrieval system that presently uses a manually constructed user model {{known as a}} search profile. User modeling captures a user's information needs. A user model can be constructed explicitly by the user or implicitly by exploiting feedback from the user about which documents are relevant. Implicit feedback can be inferred from user behavior without any additional work {{on the part of}} the user. The study reported in this paper investigates a way of implementing the implicit feedback technique of user modeling for the Powerize Server 1. 0. Previous studies on Internet discussion groups (USENET news) have shown <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> to be a useful source of implicit feedback for predicting a user's preferences. In this study, we examined: 1) whether <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> is useful for predicting a user's preferences for academic or professional journal articles, and 2) whether printing behavior adds anything to what we already know from <b>reading</b> <b>time.</b> Two experiments were conducted with undergraduate students using professional articles from the telecommunications and pharmaceutical industries. The results of the experiments showed that <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> could be used to predict the relevancy of documents, although the threshold on <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> required to detect relevant documents would be higher than for USENET news articles. The experiments also showed that printing behavior adds to what can be inferred from <b>reading</b> <b>time.</b> All the documents that were printed in the experiments were relevant, but the <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> for many of these documents was below the mean <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> for all documents read.

However, anti-locality theory predicts that the greater the distance, the easier it is. This study examined whether it was the position of the verbs that made the differences. Three kinds of structures, simple SVO, relative clauses, and BA constructions, were manipulated. If the locality theory is correct, increasing <b>reading</b> <b>times</b> at the critical words should be observed.

40|$|The results {{presented}} in the article are based on first-pass <b>reading</b> <b>times,</b> defined as the sum of fixation durations on a word until the first fixation on any other word. The first-pass <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> on word wt is zero if a later word from the same sentence was fixated before the first fixation on wt. To investigate if our conclusions hold for other reading-time measures, we repeated the analysis using two alternatives: right-bounded and go-past <b>reading</b> <b>time.</b> Right-bounded time is identical to first-pass time except that it includes the durations of fixations on wt that occur after a regression. That is, it equals the total duration of fixations on wt until the first fixation on any later word of the sentence. The go-past <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> {{is defined as the}} total duration of fixations on all words from w 1 (the first word of the sentence) up to wt, starting from the first fixation on wt until the first fixation on any later word of the sentence. 1 As was the case for first-pass, the right-bounded and go-past <b>reading</b> <b>times</b> on wt are zero if a later word from the same sentence was fixated before the first fixation on wt.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of a pair of user studies that can provide a {{practical}} basis for designing an information filtering system that employs implicit feedback for user modeling. In information filtering systems, user modeling can be used to improve the representation of a user's information needs. User models can be constructed by hand, or learned automatically based on feedback provided by the user about the relevance of documents that they have examined. By observing user behavior, it is possible to infer implicit feedback without requiring explicit relevance judgments. Previous studies based on Internet discussion groups (USENET news) have shown <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> to be a useful source of implicit feedback for predicting a user's preferences. Our study extends that work by examining whether <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> is useful for predicting a user's preferences for academic and professional journal articles and by exploring whether printing behavior can usefully augment the information that <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> provides.
