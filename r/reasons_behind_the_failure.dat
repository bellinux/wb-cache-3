Reviewing the published papers in this context revealed that both citizens and employees do not understand the current status of this program. The majority of these papers measure the quality of e-services presented by e-government. However, according to the minister of Communication and Information Technologies (MOCIT), only three e-services are provided by this program up to writing this paper. Moreover, he decided to freeze the current working on e-government programme. These facts drove the authors to conduct this research. General review of the existing literature concerning e-government implementation in Jordan was applied, then a qualitative research was utilised to uncover the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the e-government program in Jordan. The collected data then was analysed using Strauss and Corbin's method of grounded theory. This paper illustrates that Jordanian government need to exert strenuous efforts to move from the first stage of e-government implementation into an interactive one after fourteen years of launching the program, considering that only three e-services are presented up to October 2013. <b>Reasons</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of e-government in Jordan have also been identified.

The novelty of our proof is that it illustrates <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of <b>the</b> preservation in higher dimensional case.

It is further argued that on close examination the nature of Labour's support for decentralisation is, in some cases, conditional and pragmatic, and in others, it is riddled with contradictions and tensions. In short, Labour's failure reflects an under lying uncertainty about whether it wants a full-blooded decentralisation...|$|E
