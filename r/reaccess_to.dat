40|$|Background Most alcoholics {{experience}} {{periods of}} voluntary alcohol abstinence or imposed alcohol deprivation {{followed by a}} return to alcohol drinking. This study examined whether varenicline (VAR) reduces alcohol intake during a return to drinking after periods of alcohol deprivation in rats selectively bred for high alcohol drinking (the alcohol preferring or “P” rats). Methods Alcohol-experienced P rats were given 24 -hour access to food and water and scheduled access to alcohol (15 % and 30 % v/v) for 2 h/d. After 4 weeks, rats were deprived of alcohol for 2 weeks, followed by <b>reaccess</b> <b>to</b> alcohol for 2 weeks, and this pattern was repeated {{for a total of}} 3 cycles. Rats were fed either vehicle (VEH) or VAR, in doses of 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 mg/kg BW, at 1 hour prior to onset of the daily alcohol reaccess period for the first 5 days of each of the 3 alcohol reaccess cycles. Results Low-dose VAR (0. 5 mg/kg BW) reduced alcohol intake during the 5 days of drug treatment in alcohol reaccess cycles 1 and 2. Higher doses of VAR (1. 0 mg/kg BW and 2. 0 mg/kg BW) reduced alcohol intake during the 5 days of treatment in all 3 alcohol reaccess cycles. The decrease in alcohol intake disappeared with termination of VAR treatment in all alcohol reaccess cycles. Conclusions The results demonstrate that VAR decreases alcohol intake during multiple cycles of alcohol reaccess following alcohol deprivation in rats and suggests that it may prevent a return to heavy alcohol drinking during a lapse from alcohol abstinence in humans with alcohol use disorder...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many alcoholics {{and heavy}} {{drinkers}} undergo repeated cycles of alcohol abstinence followed by relapse to alcohol drinking; {{a pattern that}} contributes to escalated alcohol intake over time. In rodents, alcohol drinking that is interspersed with periods of alcohol deprivation (imposed abstinence) increases alcohol intake during <b>reaccess</b> <b>to</b> alcohol. This is termed the "alcohol deprivation effect" or "ADE" and {{is a model of}} alcohol relapse in humans. We have previously reported that prazosin reduces alcohol drinking during both brief and prolonged treatment in rats selectively bred for alcohol preference ("P" rats). This study explores whether prazosin prevents alcohol "relapse" in P rats, as reflected by a reduced or abolished ADE. METHODS: Adult male P rats were given 24 -hour access to food and water and scheduled access to alcohol (15 and 30 % v/v solutions presented concurrently) for 2 h/d. After 5 weeks, rats underwent imposed alcohol deprivation for 2 weeks, followed by alcohol reaccess for 2 weeks, and this pattern was repeated for a total of 3 cycles. Rats were injected with prazosin (0, 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) once a day for the first 5 days of each alcohol reaccess cycle. RESULTS: Alcohol intake increased {{on the first day of}} each alcohol reaccess cycle, demonstrating the formation of an ADE. The ADE was short-lived, lasting only 1 day, during each of the 3 cycles. Prazosin, in all doses tested, prevented the expression of an ADE in all 3 alcohol reaccess cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Prazosin decreases alcohol intake in P rats even in a situation that would be expected to increase alcohol drinking, namely following periods of alcohol deprivation. This suggests that prazosin may be effective in reducing alcohol relapse that often occurs during attempts to achieve permanent alcohol abstinence in treatment-seeking alcoholics and heavy drinkers...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 91, based on 26 reviews; it was the year's best-reviewed hip hop album and fourth best-reviewed album overall, according to the website. Ray Rahman from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the record [...] "vividly demonstrates the group's unassailable greatness and continued relevance", while Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone believed that [...] "in both delivery and content", A Tribe Called Quest [...] "maintain {{the attitude of the}} Bohemian everydude funkonauts that inspired Kanye West, Andre 3000 and Kendrick Lamar (who all appear here)". Robert Christgau hailed it as a [...] "triumph" [...] in his review for Vice, writing that the record [...] "represents both their bond and the conscious black humanism they felt sure the nation was ready for ... urging us to love each other {{as much as we can}} as we achieve a happiness it's our duty <b>to</b> <b>reaccess</b> if we're <b>to</b> battle as all we can be." [...] In Spin, Brian Josephs praised how the group [...] "worked with the understanding that black music at its finest conversed with ancestry while pointing toward future possibilities in resistance against the racist forces that run parallel." [...] According to Michael Madden from Consequence of Sound, the album exhibits [...] "the classic Tribe sound: a warm and crisp confluence of East Coast hip-hop, jazz, and more, all mixed and mastered impeccably", while Clayton Purdom of The A.V. Club believed the music had more in common with Q-Tip's 2008 solo album The Renaissance than with the group's previous work; he called We got it from Here... "a sinuous sound collage pulling much more from ’90s and ’00s R than it does Native Tongues boom-bap".

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 enzymes are monooxygenases {{that contain}} a {{functional}} heme b group {{linked to a}} conserved cysteine with a thiolate bond. In the native state, the central iron atom is hexacoordinated with a covalently bound water molecule. The exclusion of solvent molecules from the active site is essential for efficient enzymatic function. Upon substrate binding, water has to be displaced from the active site to prevent electron uncoupling that results in hydrogen peroxide or water. In contrast to typical hemoproteins, the protein surface is not directly accessible from the heme of cytochromes P 450. We postulate a two-state model in which a conserved arginine, stabilizing the heme propionate in all known cytochrome P 450 crystal structures, changes from the initial, stable side-chain conformation to another rotamer (metastable). In this new state, a functional water channel (aqueduct) is formed from the active site to a water cluster located on the thiolate side of the heme, close to the protein surface. This water cluster communicates with the surface in the closed state and is partly replaced by the flipping arginine side chain in the open state, allowing water molecules to exit to the surface or <b>to</b> <b>reaccess</b> the active site. This two-state model suggests {{the presence of an}} exit pathway for water between the active site and the protein surface...|$|R
40|$|The Italian {{energy system}} is characterised {{by a high}} level of import dependency, {{especially}} regarding natural gas supply. A dominant role in the NG imports is played by Russia, that in 2013 accounted for 43. 6 % of the total. As a consequence, the political and institutional crisis between Russia and Ukraine could have significant effects on the energy supply to Italy. In order to analyse these effects, a forecasting scenario analysis was performed by using the TIMES-based optimization model developed under the 7 th Framework Programme <b>REACCESS,</b> able <b>to</b> fully represent the energy corridors (both captive and open sea) supplying the European Union and to evaluate, in a quantitative manner, the risk related to each supply. The analysis was focused on the consequences of a disruption in the supply through the Dolina physical natural gas hub (located in Ukraine) by means of two scenarios: one considering the closure of the hub from 2015 and the other describing a 50 % NG flow reduction through it in 2015. The assumed time horizon was 2010 - 2040, and the effects on the supply composition, on the total system costs, on the marginal costs of natural gas and on the CO 2 emissions level were investigated. The results show that the unavailability of the Dolina physical hub causes more significant effects on the mid-long term supply composition than the reduction of the NG flows through it in 2015. In particular, a strong reduction of the Russian contribution in comparison with the baseline one, a simultaneous increase of the import of LNG from Qatar and a decrease in the total amount of the NG supply by corridors, due to a fuel shift phenomenon, can be noticed. In the same way, the Dolina closure scenario leads to major negative effects also from the economical and environmental point of view. This study highlights the main problems of a high import dependency from a major supplier (as in the case of natural gas imports from Russia to Italy, but the modelling tool allows for the assessment of any EU country security of supply) and underlines the need of a strong diversification in the supply compositio...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Obtaining {{safe and}} {{effective}} closure of the femoral access site follow-ing neurointerventional procedures can sometimes be challenging, especially in patients on anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel percutaneous closure device that employs a nitinol clip–mediated extravascular closure strategy following neurointerventional procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent neurointerventional procedures at our institution between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the StarClose device in patients undergoing first and repeat procedures. Groin complications were classified as self-limited hematoma, hematoma requiring trans-fusion, other/minor (pseudoaneurysm, infection), and other/major (vascular complication). RESULTS: StarClose device use was attempted in 281 of 352 cases (79. 8 %) with success reported in 269 cases (95. 7 %). Minor and major complications occurred in 0. 7 % and 0. 4 % of patients, respec-tively. There was one major vascular complication. Repeat use was performed in 84 patients with 100 % success and a 2. 3 % minor complication rate. Time <b>to</b> <b>reaccess</b> ranged from 1 to 1036 days (mean, 105 days). CONCLUSIONS: The StarClose device achieves rapid and safe femoral arterial closure in patients, both for primary closure and after reaccess. Femoral arterial access is common and the number of cath-eter-based neurointerventional procedures is increasing. Althoughmanual compression of the femoral artery access site is standard, it is limited by additional operator time and pro-longed patient immobilization following the procedure. Ad-ditionally, hemostasis following placement of larger sheaths, especially in patients who are anticoagulated, can be difficult. Finally, our patient population often requires multiple proce-dures for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, and therefore repeat access is the norm. Several percutaneous closure devices are available and rely on either 1) passive closure with enhanced manual compres-sion by using external patches with prothrombotic coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} activity {{presented in this}} paper has the objective of developing models for the evaluation of technological risk and loss of production due to failures, which are among the criterions that enable the choice of optimal scenarios for energy supply. This activity is based on the European Project "Risk of Energy Availability: Common Corridors for Europe Supply Security" (<b>REACCESS),</b> which aims <b>to</b> develop an analytical tool to analyse scenarios for future secure European Union (EU) energy supply. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes an innovative approach, since nowadays a generalised analytic model for risk assessment in large-scale energetic systems does not exist. In particular, the methodology adopted includes models to assess risk for people safety, risk for the environment and availability for corridors and the related infrastructures. As regards technological risk, accidents producing loss of lives in the population and environmental damage are taken into account; while for the loss of production primary attention is paid to technical failures and maintenance. Findings - Since the analytic models developed perform a large-scale assessment, they must be flexible and simplified to adapt to different situations and to be easily updated when different future scenarios are investigated. Details of the analysis depend on the precision of data collected and inserted in the models. The damage assessment is affected by deficiency and uncertainties related to territorial and statistical data. Nevertheless, the outcomes obtained for each energy commodity are reasonable and often comparable to literature data. Originality/value - Based on this study output, technological risk can be considered, more systematically than in the past, in the selection of EU strategies for future energy supply. The corridors social cost is included in future strategies selection, in addition to purely economical and environmental evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} ample {{evidence}} that high-level linguistic factors such as discourse information and sentence semantics influence the ease with which pronouns are processed (e. g., Garnham, 2002), it is much less clear whether and how low-level, lexical factors influence the processing of pronouns. We report an eye- movement reading study which showed that one low-level factor, the lexical frequency of an antecedent, affects the processing of a subsequent pronoun. When readers process a pronoun, they need <b>to</b> <b>reaccess</b> at least some information about the antecedent in order to establish a coreference link. There are three accounts of how antecedent frequency information affects the processing of a pronoun. On one account, reaccessing the antecedent involves the same processes as initial lexical access. According to this, pronouns with a high frequency antecedent should be easier to process than pronouns with a low frequency antecedent. Secondly, Simner & Smith (1999) argued that processing of pronouns does not involve reaccessing frequency information, and therefore, there should be no effect of antecedent frequency at a pronoun. Finally, a third account predicts that frequency has an effect on pronoun resolution through saliency. When a noun is infrequent, reading times are long, and therefore an infrequent noun may be more salient and accessible than a frequent noun (Pynte & Colonna, 2000). Given that pronouns are easier to process when they refer to a salient antecedent, this leads to the interesting prediction that pronouns that refer to infrequent antecedents should be EASIER to process than pronouns that refer to frequent antecedents. In order to test these predictions, we used stimuli such as below. Unambiguous pronouns (his) that referred to a high- frequent antecedent (actor) were contrasted with those that referred to a low-frequent antecedent (tenor). The crowd thrilled the actor/tenor with a standing ovation. They responded to his performance in an emotional way. Our results supported the saliency hypothesis. First fixation and first-pass times for the antecedent were longer when the antecedent was infrequent than when it was frequent, but this pattern was reversed in both measures for the region following the pronoun (performance). We conclude that low-level, lexical factors influence the processing of pronouns: The less frequent the antecedent, the more salient it is, and the easier it is to process a subsequent pronoun. Furthermore, our data shows that reaccessing antecedents is different from initial lexical access. Finally, we will discuss why previous studies (e. g., Simner & Smith, 1999) failed to observe frequency effects at the pronoun...|$|R
