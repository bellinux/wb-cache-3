40|$|AbstractObjectivesConventional {{approaches}} for removal <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> base tumors, including transmandibular, infratemporal fossa, preauricular transzygmatic subtemporal approaches, are major invasive procedures that often sacrifice hearing and cause abnormal occlusion and cosmetic defects. Reports of the transcervical approach for resection of skull base tumors are rare, {{although it was}} described for resection of clival chordomas in as early as 1966. The {{purpose of this study}} is to review our experiences in management <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> base tumors using the transcervical approach. Study DesignRetrospective chart review. MethodsSix <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> base tumor cases treated with transcervical approach procedures were reviewed, including the medical records. Results There were 4 males and 2 females. Age ranged from 12 through 52 years. Histopathological diagnoses included malignant schwannoma(n = 1), malignant carotid body tumor(n = 1), heamangioma(n= 1), schwannoma (n= 2) and pleomorphic adenoma (n= 1). Transcervical techniques were used in all cases with the use of microscope in the <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> base area. Complete tumor removal was achieved in all cases. Postoperative radiotherapy was implemented in 1 case of malignant schwannoma and 1 case of malignant carotid body tumor. Jugular foramen syndrome occurred as a surgical complication in 1 case of malignant Schwannoma of the vagus nerve. There was no tumor recurrence during the 10 - 42 month follow-up period.

We performed a retrospective, single-institution case series in an academic tertiary care hospital. Seventy-nine patients with combined temporal bone resection and parotidectomy for advanced <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> base malignancy were included. Main outcome measures were overall survival and disease-free survival. The mean follow-up time was 18. 3 months, with an overall survival of 64. 5 months and disease-free survival of 42. 6 months. Disease-free survival was 36. 2 months for skin tumors, 42. 7 months for salivary glands tumors, and 8. 5 months for tumors of mesenchymal origin. Log-rank tests for prognostic indicators demonstrated that temporal bone erosion on computed tomography (CT) scan (p[*]=[*] 0. 009) and histology (p[*]=[*] 0. 045) were statistically significant predictors of poor outcome.

40|$|Summary. A {{study was}} made of the {{relationship}} between changes in dentofacial or alveolar structures and soft tissue profile in 113 successfully treated orthodontic patients. Linear and angular measurements were made <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> radiographs and profile photographs of 90 Class II Division 1 cases and 23 Class III cases. Similar measurements were carried out on records of 17 non-treated male patients who served as a control. There was a considerable change in soft tissue profile in all the groups studied, primarily due to nasal growth and forward growth of the soft tissue chin. The changes in lip position resulting from orthodontic treatment were relatively insignificant. Muscle tonicity has a considerable influence on lip form and position {{and it is difficult to}} predict changes that would occur in the lip but, generally, variation in lip position occurred only when supporting alveolar bone and tooth position changed beyond a certain level. Lip posture and tonicity and the position of the soft tissue chin are of considerable importance in the aesthetics of the facial profile. Research into the effect of changes in position of the teeth on the soft tissues have been largely concentrated on changes in the lip profile because it seems that most changes in tooth position during treatment alter lip position. Brodie (1938) found that successful treatment of malocclusion is not always associated with ideal profile changes. Twee...|$|R

The main objectives {{of this study are}} two fold: 1) to provide a new technique to define the outline of skull profile and 2) to find the common factors defining the ultimate skull configuration in adult population. The secondary objective was to explore the effect of age and sex on skull shape formation. Materials & Methods Ninety-three <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> x-ray from the CT scan films were selected and digitized. The <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> surface was divided into 3 regions based on the presumed location of coronal and lambdoid sutures. A software program (Canvas 7) was used to match the outer surface <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>skull</b> with circular curves. Three main curvatures (frontal, parietal, occipital) were consistently identified to overlap the skull periphery. The radius, cord length and inclination of each curvature were measured [...] Factor analysis technique was also used {{to reduce the number of}} variables explaining the overall shape of skull. Student t-test and regression analysis was also used to explore the effect of sex and age on skull shape. Results There were total of 93 patients in this study (54 % male). The average values for three defined curvatures of the skull profile were recorded. Factor analysis produced 3 factors. The first factor explained 32 % of total variance and was related to the overall size of the head as represented by total length and the radius of the curvature in vertex and back of the head. The second factor covered 26 % of the variance representing the inverse correlation between the angle of the frontal and parietal curves. The third factor revealed the direct correlation of occipital and parietal angle. In all of these factors, the frontal zone variation was independent or opposite of the parieto-occipital zone. A strong direct association between the total length of skull, occipital curve radius and length with the sex was shown. No age related variable was identified. Conclusions There is a large variation in the values of different part of the skull. The skull profile topography can be defined mathematically by two distinct territories: frontal and parieto-occipital zones. These territories hinge on the coronal suture. Therefore, coronal suture may play a dominant role in final skull configuration...|$|R
