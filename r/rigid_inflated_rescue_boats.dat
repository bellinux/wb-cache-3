[...] Three life rafts were deployed by the crew and passengers who had been previously been assigned to help. One raft failed to <b>inflate</b> properly, but <b>rescue</b> <b>boats</b> from the cutter were able promptly to transfer the passengers from that raft. All were rescued by the Coast Guard before the last pieces of wreckage sank at 6:35a.m.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} fiberglass <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> by using waste plastic bottles. Fiberglass layer of <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> has tendency to crack when hit by a heavy wave or involves in accident. As an alternative of this problem, waste plastic disposal has been reuse to fill the displaced volume of the designed <b>rescue</b> <b>boat.</b> The main objective of this thesis is to design a fiberglass <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> that has arrangement of bottles under the waterline section of the designed <b>rescue</b> <b>boat.</b> Lines plan of the <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> and general arrangement {{has been designed to}} visualize the design. Several analyses on the design have been made to show the compatible of the design. This thesis described methodology utilized, design software and final lines plan and general arrangement of the designed <b>rescue</b> <b>boat.</b> From the results, it is observed that the <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> use 303 waste plastic bottles to fit the displaced volume of the fiber glass <b>rescue</b> <b>boat.</b> The displaced volume of the <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> is 1156 kg. The design rescue compatible for 6 persons on an average weight of 100 kg, 12. 0261 kg for the total weight of waste plastic bottles arrangement, boat’s engine and storage tanker of the <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> on the <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> at one time...|$|R
