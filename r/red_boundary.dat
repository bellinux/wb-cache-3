40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} for {{the recognition}} of Japanese road sign symbols with <b>red</b> annular <b>boundaries</b> is proposed. After detecting a red annular object using HSV color coordinates, a biologically inspired opponent-color filter is applied to extract the symbol parts of road signs. By applying discriminant analysis to the filter output, the inside region circumscribed by <b>red</b> annular <b>boundary</b> can be extracted. By applying the discriminant analysis again to the inside region, the symbol part of road sign can be segmented. The extracted symbol is classified by a decision tree and recognition rate of about 96 % was achieved for real road video images. It is shown that the opponent-color filter can lead to accurate recognition even for small and degraded road signs in video images...|$|R

Males and females of this species look similar except during the breeding season, when males display a much brighter green color than females. Nuptial tubercles in this species are absent.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} investigation on periods and amplitudes of RR Lyrae pulsators by adopting stellar parameters which cover {{the range of}} theoretical evolutionary expectations. Extensive grids of nonlinear, nonlocal and time-dependent convective RR Lyrae envelope models have been computed to investigate the pulsational behavior in both fundamental and first overtone modes at selected luminosity levels and over an effective temperature range which covers the whole instability region. Blue and <b>red</b> <b>boundaries</b> for pulsational instability into the HR diagram are presented for three different mass values M= 0. 75, 0. 65 and 0. 58 solar masses, together with an atlas of full amplitude theoretical light curves for both fundamental and first overtone pulsators. Theoretical periods have been combined with theoretical amplitudes in order to predict {{the location of the}} pulsators in the amplitude-period diagram. Comparison with observational data brings to light what we regard as a clear indication that the region where both fundamental and first overtone show a stable limit cycle, is populated by fundamental or first overtone pulsators in Oosterhoff I and Oosterhoff II clusters respectively. Some evident mismatches between theory and observation have also been found, and they are presented and discussed.
