2500|$|Multiply {{connected}} domains. For {{regions with}} {{a higher degree of}} connectivity k + 1, the result is essentially Bers' generalization of the retrosection theorem. [...] There is a smooth diffeomorphism F of the [...] region [...] Ω1, given by the unit disk with k open disks removed, onto the closure of Ω. [...] It can be assumed that 0 lies in the interior of the domain. Again after a modification of the diffeomorphism and conformal change near the boundary, the metric can be assumed to be compatible with reflection. Let G be the group generated by reflections in the boundary circles of Ω1. The interior of Ω1 iz a fundamental domain for G. Moreover, the index two normal subgroup G0 consisting of orientation-preserving mappings is a classical Schottky group. Its fundamental domain consists of the original fundamental domain with its reflection in the unit circle added. If the reflection is R1, it is a free group with generators R'i∘R0 where R'i are the reflections in the interior circles in the original domain. The images of the original domain by the G, or equivalently the reflected domain by the Schottky group, fill out the regular set for the Schottky group. It acts properly discontinuously there. The complement is the limit set of G0. It has measure zero. The induced metric on Ω1 extends by reflection to the regular set. The corresponding Beltrami coefficient is invariant for the <b>reflection</b> <b>group</b> generated by the reflections R'i for i ≥ 0. Since the limit set has measure zero, the Beltrami coefficient extends uniquely to a bounded measurable function on C. smooth [...] on the regular set. The normalised solution of the Beltrami equation h is a smooth diffeomorphism of the closure of [...] Ω1 onto itself preserving the unit circle, its exterior and interior. Necessarily h ∘ R'i = S'i ∘ h. where S'i is the reflection in another circle in the unit disk. Looking at fixed points, the circles arising this way for different i must be disjoint. It follows that F ∘ h−1 defines a smooth diffeomorphism of the unit disc with the interior of these circles removed onto the closure of Ω, which is holomorphic in the interior.|$|E

A construction of Drinfeld produces an analogue of a graded Hecke algebra for any finite subgroup of GL(V).
