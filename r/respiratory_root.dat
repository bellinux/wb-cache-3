50|$|Pukatea grows {{slowly to}} {{a height of}} 130 feet (40 m), usually 115 feet (35 m), {{and is the only}} New Zealand native tree {{developing}} large plank buttresses to support the tree's growth in swamp or shallow-soil areas. L. novae-zelandiae has specialized <b>respiratory</b> <b>root</b> structures called pneumatophores in certain waterlogged ground or mud. These fragrant trees are characteristic of the lower strata of the tropical rainforest. The tree has thin bark and a pale brownish-grey trunk that becomes attractively buttressed at the base. Its dark green, glossy, elliptical leaves are 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) long and have coarsely serrated edges and paler undersides. The odorous opposite leaves have oil cells in the parenchyma, and brochidodromous venations. Juvenile leaves and stems can be difficult to distinguish from another native tree hutu, to which it is only distantly related. Pukatea is a mostly dioecious species, male and female flowers are on separate individuals. Some specimens had a ratio as high as 100 male flowers to every female or hermaphrodite one. These results suggest that the species is not truly dioecious. The female and hermaphrodite flowers are very similar. The flowers are tiny, inconspicuous, and in small racemes. The star-shaped flowers are whitish with yellow glistening glands and scarlet anther flaps. The glands {{at the base of the}} stamens in L. novae-zelandiae secrete nectar that accumulates at the base of the flower. This attracts a large number of bees, blowflies, small flightless animals, and Bombyliidae to the flowers. The nectar is visible as a colourless liquid which has a glistening appearance to the outer faces of the glands. Nectar runs down from the glands and accumulates on the floor of the flower as a result of continuing secretion. The fruit are little pear-shaped capsules which contain numerous achenes attached to fine feathery strands which aid their dispersal by the wind. Often, only a few seeds are viable.|$|E

40|$|Oryctes agamemnon (Burmeister 1847) (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) was accidentally {{introduced}} in the southwestern oases of Tunisia (Tozeur) around 1980 and spread to the Rjim Maatoug region. In these areas O. agamemnon was specific to date palm trees causing severe damage that can result in potential danger due to collapse of the tree. This study was conducted from April 2004 to March 2006 in 4 sites {{in the region of}} Rjim Maatoug. Different levels of palm tree attack were determined, ovioposition sites were identified, and pest damage was described in detail to specify their relative importance and to indicate factors governing palm tree attack. Eggs were individually oviposited in the attacked parts. Dead parts of palm trees were the main target of O. agamemnon including the <b>respiratory</b> <b>roots,</b> tough, trunk bark, dry petiole and the periphery of the crown. The crown itself was not attacked. Feeding by larvae caused significant damage. The biggest danger occurred when heavy attacks of larvae invaded the <b>respiratory</b> <b>roots</b> {{at the level of the}} soil, and secondarily on the periphery of the crown, which can result in fungal diseases. Several cases of Deglet Nour date palm tree collapse were caused by this pest in Rjim Maatoug. Attacks on other parts of the tree were without danger for the palm tree. In the absence of pest management, application of a quarantine program combined with field cultivation techniques could help farmers significantly decrease attack of O. agamemnon on palm trees...|$|R
40|$|Oryctes agamemnon arabicus was an {{exogenous}} species accidentally {{introduced in}} the oases of Mrah Lahouar from Tozeur on 1980 ’s and officially reported in southwest Tunisia on 1995. This pest closely associated to date palm was spread in some oases of southwest Tunisia, covering actually 3310 ha. The preferred development sites are standing living palm trees. Different parts of the plant are subject of the attack of this pest such as <b>respiratory</b> <b>roots,</b> external components of the stem and the oldest basal green palms of the crown. The attacked site contains often different stages of the cycle of the insect like mating, oviposition, larval feeding, pupation and adult emergence. In some cases, beetles are attracted to heap manure, when it exists inside oases, buried on the soil as compost. The life cycle of immature stages, from egg to adult emergence, under natural conditions still on average 319 days and is dominated by larval development which represent 89. 6 % of the total cycle. Consequently, larvae constituted the harmful stages of the species. Females prefer to deposit their eggs in friable material inside hidden sites of the palm tree. The mean registered fecundity of 43 females is 26. 62 eggs/female. The female lies eggs separately leaving a space between each other and prefers to change the oviposition site often before finishing egg stock. The threat of O. agamemnon arabicus consists on the attack of <b>respiratory</b> <b>roots.</b> In fact, {{after many years of}} successive attacks of these roots by several generations, the larval tunnels interpenetrate and evolve on a large hole which weaken the basal support of the plant and lead to its sudden collapse by winds...|$|R
40|$|The root borer, Oryctes agamemnon Burmeister (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), {{has become}} a serious pest of date palm trees in {{southwest}} Tunisia. Under natural conditions, mated females lay eggs {{in different parts of}} palm tree: between the hairy roots, all along the stem at the leaf axils and at the base of cut branches. Larvae bore into targeted places of the plant and were never seen outside. Pupation takes place in the plant and emergence of the adults begins in June. Larval feeding causes extensive damage to the <b>respiratory</b> <b>roots.</b> To examine the life cycle more closely, the O. agamemnon life cycle was studied under laboratory conditions. Different larval stages were collected from infested oases in Tozeur and placed in plastic boxes with natural food that was collected from the oases. After emergence, adults were paired in opaque plastic boxes for mating with the same food substrate which also served as an oviposition site. Eggs were collected daily and isolated in new boxes. Hatched eggs were recorded. The number of larval instars was determined by measuring the width of cephalic capsules. Under laboratory conditions (23 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 6 % RH) embryogenesis took 14. 3 ± 1. 42 days and the first, second and third larval instars were 33. 1 ± 2. 69, 63. 88 ± 6. 6 and 118. 3 ± 13. 38 days respectively.

40|$|Two main {{species of}} dynastid or {{rhinoceros}} beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae: Tribe Oryctini) Oryctes elegans, and subspecies of Oryctes agamemnon, attack date palms causing significant and documented damage. Adults of O. elegans bore into the stalks of inflorescences and fruit bunches to feed, and oviposit in leaf axils where the larvae develop and may invade the trunk. Oryctes agamemnon larvae bore into frond bases, the trunk, and <b>respiratory</b> <b>roots</b> where their tunnelling may cause the palm to fall. It {{is difficult to}} distinguish the larvae of the two species in regions where both coexist. For control, annual servicing of palms includes cutting off old fronds at their bases using the correct technique which enables removal of larvae and their breeding places, {{and this may be}} integrated with light trapping for catching adults. Quarantine measures may hinder the spread of these pests to uninfested areas. In India, adults of a third species, O. rhinoceros, have been noted boring into the soft tissue of the growing point, and this species has also been reported from Yemen. Pheromone trapping is available for O. elegans but for effectiveness it requires the addition of fresh date palm tissue to the traps as a synergist. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae and the nematode Rhabditis sp. may have potential in integrated pest management but their possible natural occurrence in an area should be determined, prior to propagation and release. The pathogenic Oryctes Nudivirus, was successful against Oryctes rhinoceros in lowering its populations and damage to coconut palms when introduced into areas where this virus did not previously exist, and should be tested against date palm dynastids. Oryctes agamemnon and O. elegans adults attacking date palms do not appear to bore into the heart or meristem causing V-cuts to unfurling fronds or the death of the palm, in contrast to attacks by O. rhinoceros on coconut and young oil palms.

40|$|The {{adaptation}} of the <b>respiratory</b> metabolism in <b>roots</b> of soybean (Glycine max L.

A new gas phase dual-inlet mass spectrometry system for simultaneous measurement of 34 O 2 to 32 O 2 and O 2 to N 2 ratios has been developed. This system is more accurate than previously described systems, allows measurements of much smaller oxygen gradients, and, as a consequence, works with tissues that have lower respiration rates. ALS inhibition caused an increase of the alternative oxidase (AOX) protein and an accumulation of pyruvate. The combination of these two effects is likely to induce the activation of the alternative pathway and its participation in the total respiration.

40|$|The poor {{response}} of some plant species, e. g. wheat, to ammonium nutrition has {{been attributed to}} a diversion of carbon allocation from structural material for root extension to functions associated with the assimilation and translocation of ammonium in the root. The aim of this research was to investigate carbon allocation in response to ammonium or nitrate nutrition in wheat, an ammonium intolerant species, and maize, which exhibits ammonium tolerance. Experiments were carried out at 4 mM and 12 mM nitrogen feeding levels in sand and hydroponic culture respectively. pH of growth media was maintained at 6. 0 to 6. 5. Measurements made included shoot : root ratios, photosynthetic and <b>root</b> <b>respiratory</b> rates, plant water content, xylem sap analysis, and ¹⁴C and ¹⁵N allocation to soluble and bound nitrogen compounds, and soluble, storage and structural carbohydrates. Stunted root growth occurred in ammonium-fed wheat, which was exacerbated by increasing the NH 4 concentration. No difference in growth response was evident between ammonium- and nitrate-fed maize. Photosynthetic rates of ammonium- and nitrate-fed plants within both species were similar but maize showed a 3 -fold higher photosynthetic rate than wheat. Root respiration of ammonium- and nitrate-fed wheat was similar, while nitrate-fed maize appeared to have a higher <b>root</b> <b>respiratory</b> rate than ammonium-fed maize. Xylem sap analysis showed that for both species, ammonium-fed plants translocated more amino compounds and more carbon to the shoots than nitrate-fed plants, although maize appeared to have a more rapid translocation-rate than wheat. ¹⁴C allocation to nitrogenous compounds in roots of ammonium-fed plants was greater than that in nitrate-fed counterparts for both species. In wheat this increase appeared to be accommodated by a larger initial diversion of ¹⁴C to the root. In maize, reserve carbon in the root appeared to accommodate this increase. A reduction in ¹⁴C allocation to structural material in ammonium-fed plants compared to nitrate-fed counterparts was not evident in either species. ¹⁵N tracing in maize showed that significantly more nitrogen was taken up by ammonium-fed plants in comparison to nitrate-fed plants. The difference in total N between plants fed ammonium or nitrate was, however, not nearly as pronounced, suggesting that ammonium may be cycled out of the plant again. The {{response of}} wheat and maize to ammonium or nitrate nutrition is discussed independently, and suggestions for further research are made...|$|R
40|$|Because {{volcanic}} soils store {{large amounts of}} soil organic carbon (SOC), they play a far more {{important role in the}} carbon (C) cycle than their limited global coverage suggests. We analysed the C released as CO 2 from a range of {{volcanic soils}} under natural conditions and analysed the influence of environmental variables (moisture and temperature), substrate availability (as assessed from the contents of various SOC fractions and the inputs of plant residues from litterfall), <b>respiratory</b> agents (<b>roots,</b> microorganisms and decomposing enzymes) and other pedological features of the topsoils (0 - 30 cm depth) on the CO 2 efflux rates over a 2 -year experimental period. High CO 2 efflux rates (419 g C-CO 2 m(- 2) y(- 1) as the average for Andisols) were obtained that were related to significant decreases in the amount of SOC stored. CO 2 release was strongly controlled by soil moisture, although it was inhibited in the Andisols with the highest moisture levels (above 50 kg m- 2 in topsoil). It was not responsive to the availability of decomposing microorganisms or enzymes and appeared more related to the inputs of easily decomposable plant residues than to the amount of either labile or recalcitrant SOC. Among the SOC pools, only the water-soluble C in saturated paste extracts (WSCse) of air-dried soil samples was consistently correlated with the CO 2 efflux rates. The desiccation of Andisols appeared to induce the release of previously stabilised SOC, which was readily mineralised when the moisture conditions became favourable. The results {{of this study indicate that}} SOC storage in Andisols is highly vulnerable to drying-wetting processes even in unmanaged natural ecosystems and that microclimate conditions can be critical for successful C sequestration in these soils...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the partitioning of autotrophic from heterotrophic respiration processes in soils in conjunction with new high temporal resolution soil respiration data sets offer insights into biotic and environmental controls of respiration. Besides temperature, many emerging controlling factors {{have not yet been}} incorporated into ecosystem-scale models. We synthesize recent research that has partitioned soil respiration into its process components to evaluate effects of nitrogen, temperature and photosynthesis on autotrophic flux from soils at the ecosystem level. Despite the widely used temperature dependence of root respiration, gross primary productivity (GPP) can explain most patterns of ecosystem root respiration (and to some extent heterotrophic respiration) at within-season time-scales. Specifically, heterotrophic respiration is influenced by a seasonally variable supply of recent photosynthetic products in the rhizosphere. The contribution of stored root carbon (C) to <b>root</b> <b>respiratory</b> fluxes also varied seasonally, partially decoupling the proportion of photosynthetic C driving root respiration. In order to reflect recent insights, new hierarchical models, which incorporate root respiration as a primary function of GPP and which respond to environmental variables by modifying C allocation belowground, are needed for better prediction of future ecosystem C sequestration...|$|R

Root hydraulic conductivity, aerial biomass and leaf of roses for cut-flower production grown in two kinds of perlite (fine-grade and coarse-grade) were assessed.

Roots of both species were exposed to 17, 27, or 37 °C. Root RGR declined with increasing temperatures from 17 °C to 37 °C in both species; however, root growth of A. scabra maintained a significantly higher RGR than A. stolonifera at 27 °C or 37 °C. A. scabra exhibited a significantly higher respiration acclimation potential to elevated temperatures, both in the short term (60 min) and in the long term (7 – 28 d) as compared with A. stolonifera, when temperatures increased from 17 °C to 27 °C or from 27 °C to 37 °C. Thermal A. scabra also maintained a significantly lower maintenance cost than A. stolonifera as temperatures increased to 27 °C or 37 °C. The results suggested that root thermotolerance of thermal A. scabra was associated with both short-term and long-term respiratory acclimation to changes in temperatures. The superior ability of adjusting the rate of root respiration to compensate for increases in carbon demand during short- or long-term temperature increases in the heat-tolerant A. scabra may result in the reduction in carbon expenditure or costs for maintenance, leading to extended root survivability in high temperature soils...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRoot {{respiration}} is a {{major contributor}} to soil CO 2 efflux, and thus an important component of ecosystem respiration. But its metabolic origin, in relation to the carbon isotope composition (delta 13 C), remains poorly understood. Here, 13 C analysis was conducted on CO 2 and metabolites under typical conditions or under continuous darkness in French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) roots. 13 C contents were measured either under natural abundance or following pulse-chase labeling with 13 C-enriched glucose or pyruvate, using isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. In contrast to leaves, no relationship was found between the respiratory quotient and the delta 13 C of respired CO 2, which stayed constant at a low value (c. - 27. 5 per thousand) under continuous darkness. With labeling experiments, it is shown that such a pattern is explained by the 13 C-depleting effect of the pentose phosphate pathway; and the involvement of the Krebs cycle fueled by either the glycolytic input or the lipid/protein recycling. The anaplerotic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) activity sustained glutamic acid (Glu) synthesis, with no net effect on respired CO 2. These results indicate that the root delta 13 C signal does not depend on the availability of <b>root</b> <b>respiratory</b> substrates and it is thus plausible that, unless the 13 C photosynthetic fractionation varies at the leaf level, the root delta 13 C signal hardly changes under a range of natural environmental conditions...|$|R

Warm-grown (25 : 20 °C, day:night) plants differing in root N concentration were shifted to 13 : 8 °C for 7 d to cold-acclimate. • Log–log plots of root R vs root N concentration both showed that R increased with increasing tissue N concentration, {{irrespective of the}} growth temperature. Although the regression slopes of the log–log plots did not differ between the warm-grown and cold-acclimated plants, cold-acclimated plants did exhibit a higher y-axis intercept than their warm-grown counterparts. This suggests that cold acclimation of root R is not entirely dependent on cold-induced increases in tissue N concentration and that scaling relationships (i. e. regression equations fitted to the log–log plots) between root R and N concentration are not fixed. • No systematic {{differences were found in}} the short-term Q 10 (proportional change in R per 10 °C change in temperature), or degree of cold acclimation (as measured by the proportional difference between warm- and cold-acclimated roots) among roots differing in root N concentration. The temperature response of root R is therefore insensitive to tissue N concentration. • The insensitivity of Q 10 values and acclimation to tissue N concentration raises the possibility that root R and its temperature sensitivity can be predicted for a range of N supply scenarios. ...|$|R
40|$|When soil is flooded, the {{rhizosphere}} quickly reaches oxygen shortage conditions {{because of}} oxygen consumption {{during the early}} stages of flooding, not only by plant roots but also by soil micro-organisms. Although this environment is generally disadvantageous to plant growth, hygrophytes and some mesophytes can adapt to these conditions. In these plants, aerenchyma (tissue with much enlarged gas space) develops in the petioles, stems and roots, and enhances transport of atmospheric and photosynthetic oxygen to flooded tissues, thereby preventing serious damage to root organs (Armstrong, 1979; Dacey, 1980; Drew et al., 1985; Drew, 1997). On the other hand, many mesophytes have little ability to develop aerenchyma so, if the soil becomes flooded, their roots may become oxygen starved and damaged (Smirnoff and Crawford, 1983; Justin and Armstrong, 1987; Laan et al., 1989). Therefore, aerenchyma formation is thought {{to be one of the}} important morphological adaptations to hypoxic stress. Two main types of cortical aerenchyma in stems and roots can be distinguished by their process of formation: lysigenous and schizogenous aerenchyma (Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Evans, 2003; Visser and Voesenek, 2004; Seago et al., 2005). The former is created through cell disintegration (death) in the primary cortex of adventitious roots, as in rice (Justin and Armstrong, 1991), maize (Drew et al., 1979, 1981) and wheat (Huang et al., 1997), whereas the latter is formed by the separation of cells from each other, often accompanied by cell divisions and normal expansion as in Rumex species (Laan et al., 1989; Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Colmer et al., 2004). The anatomical and morphological formation of both types has been reported in detail. In particular, much research has been done on the regulation of lysigenous aerenchyma formation using the roots of maize (Drew, 1997; Gunawardena et al., 2001) and rice (Kawai et al., 1998). However, another type of cortical aerenchyma was described in roots of Jussiaea (now Ludwigia) species by Martins (1866) and Schenck (1889). 100 years ago. Some Ludwigia species have pneumatophores (<b>respiratory</b> <b>roots)</b> that grow vertically upward and emerge above the water surface as in mangrove plants (Hartsema, 1927; Sculthorpe, 1967). The intercellular gas spaces are produced by radial elongation of living, thin-walled primary cortical cells. These aerenchymatous tissues are composed of a regular meshwork of rectangular spaces, and are produced in concentric layers in transverse sections of the roots (Martins, 1866; Schenck, 1889; Ellmore, 1981). The elongated cells appear T-shaped in longitudinal sections (Haberlandt, 1914). Although the variation is different from that of Ludwigia, recently intercellular gas space shave been shown to be produced by primary cortical cell elongation in adventitious roots of the wetland plant Pontederia cordata (Seago et al., 2000) and is termed ‘expansigenous aerenchyma’ by Seago et al. (2005). Sponge gourd (Luffa cylindrica, Cucurbitaceae) is an annual vegetable upland crop that originates in India and southern Asia, and is distributed mainly in tropical to warm-temperate areas. Compared with bitter melon (Momordica charantia), this species is flood tolerant, but its morphological changes in response to flooding stress have not been examined (Liao and Lin, 1996). In Taiwan, yield of bitter melon is increased by grafting with Luffa spp., which allows bitter melon to survive in flooded soils (Palada and Chang, 2003). In sponge gourd, it was found that the primary cortical tissues of newly formed adventitious roots under flooding created an aerenchyma that was neither schizogenous nor lysigenous, but took the form of elongated cortical aerenchyma. This aerenchyma is composed of cells that appear T-shaped in longitudinal sections. According to Jost (1887), intercellular gas spaces are created by T-shaped cells in roots of Luffa amara (now L. acutangulus). T-shaped cells that are secondary tissues derived from a phellogen are also observed in flooded stems of Ludwigia (Schenck, 1889, see the English text in Arber, 1920), and the lacunate tissues seem to be similar to elongated primary cortical aerenchyma. However, the origin of the lacunate tissues in the stem of Ludwigia is strikingly different from that of aerenchyma observed in sponge gourd. Recently, morphological observations of T-shaped cells derived from a phellogen were reported in the root and stem of Decodon species (Little and Stockey, 2003, 2006) and Lythrum salicaria (Stevens et al., 1997), but there was no detailed observation of T-shaped cells derived from primary cortical cells. Ellmore (1981) described elongated cortical aerenchyma in mature pneumatophores of Ludwigia, but did not report how lacunae were created at an early stage; therefore, an investigation has been carried out to determine the developmental processes of this type of aerenchyma. In addition, it was found that such tissues were composed of radially elongated primary cortical cells in flooded hypocotyl of sponge gourd, but not of T-shaped cells. Here, the morphological changes in flooded tissues and the pattern of cortical aerenchyma formation are described for sponge gourd, and the relative amount of aerenchyma is analysed...|$|R

As análises microbiológicas foram {{realizadas}} no dia do processamento e após 10 dias de conservação. Raízes intactas apresentaram a menor taxa respiratória (5 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1), enquanto beterrabas raladas e descascadas obtiveram taxa respiratória de 30 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1 após quatro horas do processamento. Beterrabas minimamente processadas apresentaram um pico respiratório no segundo dia de armazenamento (80 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1), estabilizando em 30 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1 no quarto dia. Não foi detectado etileno em beterrabas intactas e descascadas ao passo que em beterrabas minimamente processadas, a produção de etileno nas primeiras horas após o corte atingiu 0, 90 µL kg- 1 h- 1, registrando-se pouca variação ao longo das quatro horas de avaliação e durante o período de armazenamento a 5 ºC. As contagens de bactérias psicrotróficas e coliformes totais mantiveram-se dentro dos limites aceitáveis, e não foi detectada presença de coliformes fecais e Salmonella. The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate physiological and microbiological aspects of fresh cut beet <b>roots.</b> <b>Respiratory</b> activity and ethylene evolution were evaluated during four hours after processing and during the storage period of ten days at 5 ºC. Microbiological analysis was carried out right after processing and after ten days of storage. Intact roots showed the lower respiratory activity (5 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1), whereas shredded and peeled beet roots presented a respiration rate of 30 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1 four hours after processing. Fresh cut beet roots showed a peak during the second storage day (80 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1), reducing to 30 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1 at the fourth day. No ethylene evolution was detected in intact and peeled beet roots whereas in the fresh cut material it was observed in the first hours after processing, reaching 0. 90 µL kg- 1 h- 1. Few variations were observed during the four-hour period after processing and during the refrigerated storage. Psychotrophic bacteria and total coliforms counts were within acceptable limits, and no Salmonella or fecal coliforms were detected...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the 13 C {{discrimination}} {{of current}} leaf photosynthesis might have profound impacts on <b>root</b> <b>respiratory</b> substrates. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was (1) to refine a method for the isolation of root and leaf starch and soluble sugars (neutral fraction) for stable carbon isotope analysis and (2) to assess the short-term temporal variability of the C isotope composition (delta C- 13) of starch and of the neutral fraction of beech roots and leaves at different canopy heights. An existing method for isolating starch for stable C isotope analysis based on enzymatic hydrolysis was modified to account for the low starch content of the samples. This was achieved by removing the enzyme (alpha-amylase) by ultrafiltration after the hydrolysis, resulting in very low carbon blanks. The neutral fraction was separated from organic acids and cations by ion-exchange chromatography. An anion-exchange resin in the [HCO 3](-) -form was chosen that ensured high precision of C blanks. Beech leaves at 5, 10 and 20 m above the forest floor as well as roots were sampled six times during a day/night cycle in July 2003. delta C- 13 values of bulk material, starch and the neutral fraction increased from the lower to the higher canopy with mean differences between 5 and 20 m of 3. 8, 3. 4 and 2. 7 parts per thousand for the delta C- 13 values of starch, neutral fraction and bulk foliage, respectively. The delta C- 13 value of foliar starch increased from the morning to the afternoon and decreased during the night, but diurnal differences (up to 3. 1 parts per thousand) were only statistically significant for leaves sampled at 5 and 10 m height. In roots, no diurnal variation in the delta C- 13 of starch was observed during the short time frame of one day and the delta C- 13 of the neutral fraction did not differ between samples taken at 16 : 30 and 22 : 00. Calculated delta C- 13 values of starch, which was mobilised during the night, were more positive than the total starch (all sampling times pooled) in leaves. Furthermore, the delta C- 13 values of mobilised starch were approximately 5 parts per thousand more positive than that of the mobilised neutral fraction. Hence, the delta C- 13 of potential sources for export from canopy leaves to roots varied considerably in their C isotope composition. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Four {{dimensional}} (4 D) {{computed tomography}} (CT) image sorting {{is currently a}} retrospective procedure. Mismatches in displacement and∕or phase of a patient’s respiratory signal, corresponding with two dimensional images taken at subsequent couch positions, become visible as artifacts in reconstructed 4 D CT images. These artifacts appear as undefined or irregular boundaries in the 4 D CT images and cause systematic errors in patient contouring and dose calculations. In addition, the substantially higher dose required for 4 D CT, compared with 3 D CT, is of concern. To minimize these problems, we developed a prospective respiratory displacement and velocity based cine 4 D CT (PDV CT) method to trigger image acquisition if the displacement and velocity of the respiratory signal occurred within predetermined tolerances simultaneously. The use of velocity avoids real-time phase estimation. Real-time image acquisition ensures data sufficiency, while avoiding the need for redundant data. This may potentially result in a lower dose to the patient. PDV CT was compared with retrospective 4 D CT acquisition methods, using respiratory signals of 24 lung cancer patients (103 sessions) under free breathing conditions. Image acquisition was simulated {{for each of these}} sessions from the <b>respiratory</b> signal. The <b>root</b> mean square (RMS) of differences between displacements and velocities of the respiratory signal corresponding to subsequent images was calculated in order to evaluate the image-sorting accuracy of each method. Patient dose reductions of 22 to 50 % were achieved during image acquisition depending on the model parameters chosen. The mean RMS differences over all sessions and image bins show that PDV CT produces similar results to retrospective displacement sorting overall, although improvements of the RMS difference up to 20 % were achieved depending on the model parameters chosen. Velocity RMS differences improved between 30 and 45 % when compared with retrospective phase sorting. The efficiency in acquisition compared with retrospective phase sorting varied from ∼ 10 % for displacement and velocity tolerances of 1 mm and 4 mm∕s, respectively, to 80 to 93 % for 4 mm and 4 mm∕s. The lower variation in the displacement and velocity of the respiratory signal in each image bin indicates that PDV CT could be a valuable tool for reducing artifacts in 4 D CT images and lowering patient dose, although the cost may be increased acquisition time...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{physiological}} {{condition of}} tree seedlings {{at the time}} they are planted can have a profound impact on their subsequent field performance. Damaged or low vigor seedlings have a much greater chance of dying in the field, or at best, of growing slowly during their initial establishment period. Several methods of evaluating the physiological quality of seedlings are currently used to try to predict how seedlings will perform after outplanting. The root growth potential (RGP) approach measures the ability of seedlings to initiate and elongate roots when placed in an environment favorable to root growth. The vigor method, or test, monitors the survival and bud burst of potted seedlings in a growthstimulating environment. While both methods reportedly provide a general indication of seedling health or vigor, the effectiveness of these techniques in actually predicting field survival and height growth of Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuqa menziesii (Mirb.) Franca] seedlings has either not been sufficiently documented, or there have been inconsistent results. A primary goal of this research was to evaluate and compare how well these methods predict growth and survival of Douglasfir seedlings. Another goal was to examine two new, more rapid, methods of evaluating seedling quality and determine how effective they are. The first of these, called the PMS method, monitors changes in plant moisture stress (PMS) of potted seedlings during a one-week interval in the growth room. The second method measures the root respiration rate of seedlings to determine if changes in seedling quality are reflected in altered <b>root</b> <b>respiratory</b> activities. Results from these studies indicated that measurements from both the RGP and vigor method were significantly correlated with first- and second-year survival and height growth for two Douglas-fir seed sources planted on a variety of sites. For RGP, the best predictor of field performance was the number of new roots greater than 0. 5 cm produced during 28 days in the growth room. For the vigor method, the survival of both stressed and unstressed seedlings after 6 weeks in the growth room were the best predictors. Seedlings from lots that produced more new roots, or had higher growth room survival, also had higher field survival and greater growth. The RGP procedure was the best predictor of seedling terminal height growth, while the vigor method was the best predictor of field survival. When these procedures were used in conjunction, correlations with field performance variables improved slightly, but not enough to justify the time and expense of using both. Measurements of plant moisture stress were found to reliably predict damage to seedlings caused by accidental freezing. In addition, this pressure chamber method predicted reductions in field survival and growth caused from several other types of injury. In contrast, root respiration measurements were not consistently related to growth-room survival or growth and this approach does not appear promising as an effective evaluation procedure...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{identify}} pathways and rates of C allocation in tall forest trees, and to identify effects of elevated CO 2 on <b>respiratory</b> processes and <b>root</b> growth. Correspondingly, this thesis {{is divided into three}} separate parts: Chapter 2) Long-term 13 C labeling provides evidence for temporal and spatial carbon allocation patterns in mature Picea abies (published in Oecologia) Chapter 3) Respiratory fluxes and fine root responses in mature Picea abies trees exposed to elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (published in Biogeochemistry) Chapter 4) Photosynthetic enhancement and diurnal stem and soil carbon fluxes in a mature Norway spruce stand under elevated CO 2 (published in Environmental and Experimental Botany) The work was conducted at the Swiss canopy crane (SCC) research site in Hofstetten near Basel, Switzerland, and explored signals produced by free air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) in 110 -year-old, ca. 37 m tall P. abies trees. Chapter 2 capitalizes on the isotopic signal carried by the CO 2 gas used for CO 2 enrichment, yet does not address effects of elevated CO 2 as such, but rather deals with basic questions of C transfer in tall trees. Chapter 3 explores the longer-term CO 2 effects on mature P. abies (i. e. 2. 5 years), whereas chapter 4 reports short-term (diurnal) responses to elevated CO 2. In the following, I will provide a summary {{of the results of the}} three chapters of my thesis, extended by a conclusion that links these chapters. Chapter 2) Long-term 13 C labeling of Picea abies As a side effect, the FACE technique provided the unique opportunity to study C translocation within the tree body using the stable isotope 13 C signal the FACE gas carries. Since control trees are not (can not) be similarly labeled with 13 C the tree responses to elevated CO 2 were not the subject of this chapter. Yet, FACE resembles a continuous 13 C labeling of new assimilates. Tracking the fate of these assimilates over a period of 2. 5 years in tall trees offers new insights in tree C relations under steady state conditions. We tracked 13 C signals in mature P. abies trees at a high spatial and temporal resolution, i. e. from the canopy (needles and branchlets), down to the tree trunk (year rings and stem CO 2 efflux), and into the soil compartment (fine roots, fungi, soil CO 2 efflux). The following key questions were answered: 1. 	How long does it take for new C to arrive at a certain tissue type or respiratory flux? 2. 	What is the proportional contribution of newly assimilated C to concurrent tree tissue production and maintenance? 3. 	How long does it take until old C is replaced by new C in various tissues? Generally, we observed a reduction of new assimilate investment with distance from the canopy, which can be explained by a progressive dilution of new C into the existing C storage pools in the tree. New sunlit needles (and adjacent branchlets) exhibited a nearly 100...|$|R
