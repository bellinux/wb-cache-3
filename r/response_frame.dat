50|$|Short Interframe Space (SIFS), is {{the amount}} of time in microseconds {{required}} for a wireless interface to process a received frame and to respond with a <b>response</b> <b>frame.</b> It is the difference in time between the first symbol of the <b>response</b> <b>frame</b> in the air and the last symbol of the received frame in the air. A SIFS time consists of the delay in receiver RF, PLCP delay and the MAC processing delay, which depends on the physical layer used. In IEEE 802.11 networks, SIFS is the interframe spacing prior to transmission of an acknowledgment, a Clear To Send (CTS) frame, a block ack frame that is an immediate response to either a block ack request frame or an A-MPDU, the second or subsequent MPDU of a fragment burst, a station responding to any polling a by point coordination function and during contention free periods of point coordination function.|$|E

50|$|Asynchronous {{balanced}} mode {{added the}} concept of a combined terminal which can act as both a primary and a secondary. There are some subtleties about this mode of operation; while many features of the protocol do not care whether they are in a command or <b>response</b> <b>frame,</b> some do, and the address field of a received frame must be examined to determine whether it contains a command (the address received is ours) or a response (the address received is that of the other terminal).|$|E

It is also used to trigger an acknowledgment of outstanding I-frames.|$|E

The user’s name, address, telephone number, and date could be added automatically to the message when the IP set up the <b>response</b> <b>frame</b> by means of codes which triggered extraction of key data from the users account held on the IRC computer. Initially response frames were ingathered by an IP from each IRC individually, but later the facility to collect messages from all IRCs at the UDC from where they could be ingathered centrally was implemented, and with the introduction of Mailbox, they could be retrieved from any IRC.|$|E

40|$|For a {{long time}} systems have complained {{that they have no}} way of knowing how long a logical unit will stay busy either because the logical unit is not ready or the queue is full. Many factors come into play in a logical unit when allocating {{resources}} among an unknown number of initiators. Also the amount of resources available to the target side of a large subsystem can fluctuate based on the workload. So in many cases it is impossible for a logical unit to guarantee a fixed amount of queue slots for an initiator without having to tie-up resources (and as a result reduce performance) for commands that may never happen. This proposal defines a reporting mechanism that will give an indication to initiators as to how long the logical unit current resources will be tied-up and a upper limit as to the amount of time should be spent retrying before declaring the logical unit dead.

40|$|This {{final report}} reviews {{three years of}} {{research}} focused on the coordination of perception and action. Human performance has been evaluated {{within the framework of}} a closed-loop system where perception and action are intimately coupled. Four problems have been studied: the control of locomotion, dynamic occlusion, depth perception, and minimally invasive surgery. Studies of the control of locomotion have shown that for control of altitude there was an interaction between the flow structure (splay or depression angle) and the event dynamic (hover or forward flight). Results showed that in hover conditions, depression angle specifies altitude changes most reliably; but in forward flight conditions, splay angle specifies altitude changes most reliably. These results are explained as a function of singal-to-noise ratios within the optical flow field. Initial work to evaluate control of collision is also discussed. The dynamic occlusion task was used to evaluate effects of mode of observation (active versus passive) on performance. This task was chosen because of the ability to control for information differences. Results showed that the observation mode had little effect. Previous research that has shown an advantage for active observers appears to be due to information differences, not to the observation mode. Research on depth perception showed that difference that had previously been found for response mode (walking versus matching) could be attributed to the <b>response</b> <b>frame</b> (egocentric versus exocentric). Subjects were generally accurate (little effects due to foreshortening) when using an egocentric <b>response</b> <b>frame.</b> Finally, preliminary work to evaluate performance in minimally invasive surgery is outlined. This work included field observations of surgery as well as laboratory studies...|$|E

40|$|Criteria and {{recommended}} practices {{for the design}} of the spaceborne elements of electronic imaging systems are presented. A spaceborne electronic imaging system is defined as a device that collects energy in some portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with detector(s) whose direct output is an electrical signal that can be processed (using direct transmission or delayed transmission after recording) to form a pictorial image.
