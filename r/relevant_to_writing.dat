40|$|The writing program {{administration}} {{literature in}} rhetoric and composition has long advocated {{the use of}} local data to determine the direction each writing program should take. Using a mixed-method design employing a standard survey and in-depth interviews, this dissertation describes how writing programs across institutional and programmatic contexts use empirical data derived from outcomes-based assessment and from other sources to make improvements {{in the design of}} their programs. It also begins to define a rhetorical relationship between writing program administrators and students and asks how and whether students act as an audience for writing program administrators. Findings suggest that participants in the study confine their exploration of their student audiences to data directly <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> or specific learning outcomes, limiting the scope of their analysis of student audiences. The final chapter posits three methods WPAs can use to expand their perspective student audiences and on the kinds of data that might be useful in program design and revision. ...|$|E

Thus, Study 1 investigated automatic production of the ordered alphabet from memory for manuscript (unjoined), cursive (joined), and keyboard letter modes (alphabet 15 sec) and their relationships {{with each other and}} spelling and composing in typically developing writers in grades 4 to 7 (N = 113). Study 2 compared students with dysgraphia (impaired handwriting, n= 27), dyslexia (impaired word spelling, n= 40), or oral and written language learning disability (OWL LD) (impaired syntax composing, n= 11) or controls without specific writing disabilities (n= 10) in grades 4 to 9 (N= 88) on the same alphabet 15 modes, manner of copying (best or fast), spelling, and sentence composing. In Study 1, sequential multilevel model regressions of predictor alphabet 15 letter production/selection modes on spelling and composition outcomes, measured annually from grade 4 to grade 7 (ages 9 to 13 years), showed that only the cursive mode uniquely, positively, and consistently predicted both spelling and composing in each grade. For composing, in grade 4 manuscript mode was positively predictive and in grades 5 - 7 keyboard selection was. In Study 2 all letter production modes correlated with each other and one’s best and fast sentence copying, spelling, and timed sentence composing. The groups with specific writing disabilities differed from control group on alphabet 15 manuscript mode, copy fast, and timed sentence composing. The dysgraphia and dyslexia groups differed on copying sentences in one’s best handwriting, with the dysgraphia group scoring lower. The educational and theoretical significance of the findings are discussed for multiple modes and manners of letter production/selection of the alphabet that support spelling and composing beyond the early grades in students with and without specific writing disabilities...|$|E

40|$|My master thesis {{looks at}} the role of {{advertising}} as {{a specific type of}} media texts in everyday life of teenagers. I perceive adolescence as an unusually dynamic stage of cognitive and social development, so it seems inappropriate to assume that adolescents' cognitive processes, believes and attitudes are the same as either adults or younger children. I tried to prove my hypothesis that teenagers behave as an active audience of advertising media texts and so that they are not pure victims of contemporary consumer society. After summarizing the research on media public with a special accent on an active audiences, I tried to do a review of socialization theories, particularly theories of consumer socialization. One of the outcomes connected with the process of consumer socialization should be a certain degree of skepticism to advertising. I intend to show how young people from thirteen to seventeen years of age, who are moving through adolescence, perceive, think and feel about omnipresence of advertising in contemporary consumer society. I was interested not only in how they see the role of advertising in their lives, but also how they describe the possible effects on themselves and on other people; style and arguments that they use; which topics they find <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about, and last but not least, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the long}} eighteenth century {{there was an}} ongoing shift in {{masculine}} ideals which ultimately created the stereotypical Victorian man.

To explore the trade-off between extra time and quality, we also measured the quality of the written text.

40|$|Abstract—Flash-based SSDs are {{becoming}} increasingly pop-ular in modern storage systems, especially in high-performance computing infrastructures. However, several inherent technical limitations still remain to prevent their widespread deployment. One of the critical concerns is their limited lifetime, which is directly <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the total <b>writes</b> experienced by SSDs. In this paper, we present a Content and Semantics Aware File System (CSA-FS) which is able <b>to</b> reduce <b>write</b> traffic <b>to</b> SSDs. It employs deduplication and delta-encoding techniques to file system data blocks and semantic blocks, respectively. It is motivated by two important observations: (1) there exists {{a huge amount of}} content redundancy within primary storage systems, and (2) semantic blocks are visited much more frequently than data blocks, with each update bringing very minimal changes. By separately deduplicating redundant data blocks and delta-encoding similar semantic blocks, CSA-FS can significantly reduce the total <b>write</b> traffic <b>to</b> SSDs and greatly improve their lifetime correspondingly, at an acceptable cost of at most 7 % performance degradation across a variety of workloads...|$|R

The books examined were written by students in grades K through 5 in a rural elementary school. They had been in the United States for a short period of time.

Because each author 2 ̆ 7 s book was written in English and translated into his native language, there was a validation of the primary language as fundamental to achievement, and the links between languages and cultures were maintained.

Implications of these findings would serve teachers of ESL students looking for ways to better prepare themselves for in structing a population of diverse learners.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Research {{has become}} an {{integral}} part of all health care practitioners. Finding effective ways of sharing the valuable work that is being done in the clinical setting is essential. A case report is a form of communicating information to other health care practitioners regarding exceptional cases.

METHOD: A literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Medline using terms such as case reports, publishing, and guidelines to determine successful literature that highlights how <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a case report. Case reports will contribute to the body of evidence needed for professions and could stimulate debate around controversial issues.
