The campaign estimates {{the cost of the}} program at $60 billion annually. The plan requires that parents cover their children, but does not require adults to buy insurance.|$|E

40|$|A line {{plotting}} {{program has}} been developed using the DI- 3000 graphics libraries and incorporates Grafmaker subroutines. The program allows multiple lines on a frame and multiple frames per <b>run.</b> <b>Options</b> such as automatic scaling, linear or single-cycle log graphs, and plot text such as titles, legends and axis labels are incorporated in the program. Greek and other fonts {{can be used in}} the plot text as well as upper and lower case text. Plot inputs are specified through a control file.

Only one Company operative is there, but it is Marco, the only Enforcer other than Budu to remain free once the Enforcers original mission was completed.

50|$|The Black Knights have {{traditionally}} <b>run</b> an <b>option</b> offense that emphasizes running, including by the quarterbacks. However, Army ran a pro-style {{offense in the}} 1970s and the early 2000s, and passing and receiving records tend to belong to players from those eras.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of all option offenses is the <b>option</b> <b>run.</b> This {{relatively}} complicated running play may take on many forms. All <b>option</b> <b>runs,</b> however, rely on two common principles: Whereas the traditional running play typically designates the ballcarrier prior to the snap, the ballcarrier in a true option running play is determined by reading the defensive alignment or the actions of defensive players. This may occur {{at the line of}} scrimmage or after the ball is snapped. The second principle of the <b>option</b> <b>run</b> is that it must include two or more potential ballcarriers. These individuals each perform a predetermined route, or [...] "track" [...] that poses a unique threat to a defense. By threatening to attack the defense in multiple ways during the play based on the defense's own actions/alignment, the <b>option</b> <b>run</b> forces the opponent to maintain extraordinary discipline. Defenders must focus on their assignments, which stresses the defense and often mitigates its speed, size and aggressiveness. Consequently, option offenses are excellent for undersized teams.|$|R
5000|$|Until recently, {{the option}} has made rare {{appearances}} in the NFL. An article on the option play in the ESPN College Football Encyclopedia discussed why the option was not used {{as much in the}} pros. While coaches agreed the option would work, the problem was the impact it would have on the quarterback. The quarterback would need to run more which means taking more hits, causing greater risk of injury. Starting in 2004, Michael Vick, Warrick Dunn and T. J. Duckett <b>ran</b> the <b>option</b> with a degree of success not seen in the NFL before. [...] In a December 2007 game against the New England Patriots, the New York Jets <b>ran</b> the <b>option</b> with quarterback Brad Smith, substituting Smith for starter Chad Pennington.|$|R
50|$|In December 2004 Mumme {{was named}} the head coach at Division I-A New Mexico State University, {{replacing}} Tony Samuel. Samuel had <b>run</b> an <b>option</b> offense at {{the school and the}} transition to Mumme's passing offense was difficult. New Mexico State finished 0-12 in Mumme's first season (2005).|$|R
50|$|On October 9, 2011, the Carolina Panthers {{effectively}} <b>ran</b> the <b>option</b> twice {{against the}} New Orleans Saints. The first play was an option pitch from QB Cam Newton to RB DeAngelo Williams for a 67-yard touchdown. The second time, Cam Newton kept {{the ball and}} ran for 13 yards.|$|R
5000|$|Hargiss also <b>ran</b> the <b>option</b> pass play (possibly {{the first}} of all time) at the College of Emporia in 1910. The [...] "option pass" [...] play was a sweep to the end with halfbacks that would either pass or run {{depending}} on how the defensive play would develop.|$|R

50|$|During {{much of its}} history, the Eagles have <b>run</b> an <b>option</b> offense, {{focused on}} running over passing. Therefore, the Eagles' passing records tend to be lower than at most other schools. An {{exception}} to this trend is the years 2006 through 2009, when the Eagles scrapped the option offense under head coaches Brian VanGorder and Chris Hatcher.|$|R
5000|$|Head coach Mike Sherman commended {{the running}} backs, {{especially}} Mike Goodson, {{calling him a}} [...] "very dangerous weapon". Though the Aggies didn't <b>run</b> any <b>option</b> plays in the game, the play-calling was run-heavy, as was planned. Sherman stated {{that they had a}} running game because they [...] "wanted to show some toughness, not just throw it around".|$|R
50|$|SECEDIT USERID {{was also}} used to confine a user's {{operational}} authority to a specific menu. By entering a Y for Mandatory Menu and specifying a default sign-on menu, the security officer could prevent the user from any program access not found on that sign-on menu. A user so confined could only <b>run</b> menu <b>options,</b> send messages, and sign off the system.|$|R
