25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{categories}} of diving mask: The half <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> the eyes and nose, and the full face <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> eyes, nose and mouth, and therefore includes {{a part of the}} breathing apparatus. The half mask is described here.|$|R
50|$|Black <b>Mask's</b> <b>covers</b> {{were usually}} painted by Fred Craft or J. W. Schlaikjer. Shaw gave Arthur Rodman Bowker a {{monopoly}} on creating illustrations for {{the interior of the}} magazine.|$|R

30|$|We {{sample the}} central lines in {{addition}} to the upper half of k- space. The resulting <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> 62.5 % of all lines. According to the MRI techniques, 5 / 8 or 62.5 % of all lines is a standard fraction for half scan.|$|R
30|$|However, the {{detection}} and the false positive rates of PFMPF are insufficient because the probability table P(x, y, GreyValue) is inaccurate when a <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> the face. Therefore, JEER {{is applied to}} PFMPF to obtain a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than that of PFMPF alone.|$|R
50|$|A contact printer, the {{simplest}} exposure system, puts a photomask in {{direct contact with}} the wafer and exposes it to a uniform light. A proximity printer puts a small gap between the photomask and wafer. In both cases, the <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> the entire wafer, and simultaneously patterns every die.|$|R
5000|$|This {{phenomenon}} can be {{used when}} focusing a telescope. The Hartmann mask is a simple opaque mask containing two or three holes. (This device is called a Hartmann mask if it has multiple holes, or a Scheiner disk if it has two holes.) The <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> the aperture of the telescope.|$|R

A steel <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> the lower half of his face. Tattoo serves Kane as a chief enforcer and assassin. He bears a slight resemblance to Blanka of Street Fighter II fame.|$|R
50|$|Wolfson's 2014 work, Female Figure is an animatronic {{sculpture}} of a woman dressed in a negligee, thigh high vinyl boots and a green half witch <b>mask,</b> <b>covered</b> in dirt marks and scuffs. The figure dances seductively, speaking in a male voice. Using facial recognition technology, she locks eyes with viewers through a mirror. The work addresses the violence of objectification.|$|R
50|$|The horse head mask is a latex mask {{representing}} a horse head originally manufactured by novelty purveyor Archie McPhee, and now widely available from other manufacturers. The <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> the entire head and is typically {{part of a}} Halloween costume, or at other times to be funny, shocking, incongruous, or hip, or to disguise one's identity. It has also become an internet meme.|$|R
5000|$|The station <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> a {{very large}} area {{stretching}} from Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada down to northern South America in the south.

2500|$|A mask is {{an object}} {{normally}} worn on the face, typically for protection, disguise, performance, or entertainment. Masks {{have been used}} since antiquity for both ceremonial and practical purposes. [...] They are usually worn on the face, although {{they may also be}} positioned for effect elsewhere on the wearer's body. In parts of Australia, giant totem <b>masks</b> <b>cover</b> the body, whilst Inuit women use finger masks during storytelling and dancing.|$|R

Her <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> all of her head {{with the exception of}} the eyes, which are darkened, and symbolic stitches surround the mouth of the mask.

5|$|Necrid's {{alternate}} appearance differs heavily, {{and features}} scaly, reddish–orange skin. Additional differences include teal eyes, black pants, {{and a blue}} jewel. The protruding bones are isolated and bigger on his left shoulder and arm, and appear crystalline. A pauldron covering his right shoulder is fastened to the jewel's support harness, and the armor on his legs incorporate a pair of greaves. He wears a fauld on his abdomen, and bandages wrap around his stomach. A <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> his face and is {{held in place by}} two straps around his head.|$|R
25|$|Most {{recreational}} {{scuba diving}} is done using a half <b>mask</b> which <b>covers</b> the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece {{to supply the}} breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face <b>mask</b> which <b>covers</b> the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers {{are more likely to}} use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.|$|R
30|$|In particular, with a Fresnel lens array around, each PIR sensor {{can detect}} sensitively the thermal {{fluctuation}} induced by human motion within its {{field of view}} (FOV). Each PIR sensor {{can be considered as}} a single pixel. The opaque <b>mask</b> <b>covers</b> part of the surface of the Fresnel lens array, acting as the geometric reference structure [13]. As a result, the PIR sensor could only sense part of its original FOV. Several PIR sensors with their own masks are multiplexing in one sensor node to modulate the visibility pattern of the object space.|$|R

50|$|There were visual {{differences}} as well. Promotional artwork for the radio {{program and the}} comic books of the day depicted the Hornet wearing a <b>mask</b> that <b>covered</b> all of his face below the eyes (the two Universal Studios Saturday matinee serials contained a full face mask with eye holes) while Kato wore goggles. Here, both men wear <b>masks</b> that <b>cover</b> only the upper portions of their faces. These masks initially had a stylized angularity that soon proved problematic: neither man could see much. They were soon replaced with masks molded to the performers' faces.|$|R
