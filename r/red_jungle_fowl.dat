2500|$|Cock{{fighting}}: Cockfighting was a pastime in the Indus Valley Civilization in {{what today}} is Pakistan by 2000 BCE {{and one of}} the uses of the fighting cock. [...] The Encyclopædia Britannica (2008)—on the origins of cockfighting—holds: [...] "The game fowl is probably the nearest to the Indian <b>red</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> (Gallus gallus), from which all domestic chickens are believed to be descended...The sport was popular in ancient times in the Indian subcontinent, China, the Persian Empire, and other Eastern countries and was introduced into Greece in the time of Themistocles (c. 524–460 BCE). The sport spread throughout Asia Minor and Sicily. For a long time the Romans affected to despise this [...] "Greek diversion," [...] but they ended up adopting it so enthusiastically that the agricultural writer Columella (1st century CE) complained that its devotees often spent their whole patrimony in betting {{at the side of the}} pit." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDomestic {{chickens}} {{have long}} been important to human societies for food, religion, entertainment, and decorative uses, yet the origins and phylogeography of chickens through Eurasia remain uncertain. Here, we assessed their origins and phylogeographic history by analyzing the mitochondrial DNA hypervariable segment I (HVS-I) for 834 domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) across Eurasia as well as 66 wild <b>red</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> (Gallus gallus) from Southeast Asia and China. Phylogenetic analyses revealed nine highly divergent mtDNA clades (A-I) in which seven clades contained both the <b>red</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> and domestic chickens. There was no breed-specific clade in the chickens. The clades A, B, and E are distributed ubiquitously in Eurasia, while the other clades were restricted to South and Southeast Asia. Clade C was mainly distributed in Japan and Southeast China, while clades F and G were exclusive to Yunnan, China. The geographic distribution of clade D was {{closely related to the}} distribution of the pastime of cock fighting. Statistical tests detect population expansion within each subclade. These distinct distribution patterns and expansion signatures suggest that different clades may originate from different regions, such as Yunnan, South and Southwest China and/or surrounding areas (i. e., Vietnam, Burma, and Thailand), and the Indian subcontinent, respectively, which support the theory of multiple origins in South and Southeast Asia.

40|$|Chicken {{taxonomy}} and pedigree investigation {{are important}} parts {{to understand the}} domesticationprocess occurred on chicken in Indonesia. The Indonesian native chickens have very different clade with thechickens from other Asian countries and others. This {{study was conducted to}} construct phylogeny junglefowls (<b>red</b> and green <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls)</b> and Indonesian native chickens, in order to know their relationship. Among the available DNA marker, the region D-loop on DNA mitochondria is the most effective markerused in the investigation. Mitochondrial DNA D-loop (hypervariable- 1 segment) was PCR amplified andsubsequently sequenced for a total 33 individuals of green <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> (Gallus varius), 9 individuals of redjungle fowls (Gallus g. gallus) from Indonesia, and 30 individuals of Indonesian native chickens (Lombok,Cemani, Kedu, Kedu Putih, Nunukan, Kate, Pelung, Gaok, Merawang, dan Sentul). Seventy two (72) sequences were used for analysis. Seven (7) published reference D-loop sequences of genus Gallus fromGenBank were also included in the analysis: Gallus varius (GenBank accession number D 64163 danD 82912), Gallus gallus (GenBank accession number AB 098668), G. gallus spadiceus (GenBank accessionnumber AB 007721), Gallus gallus bankiva (GenBank accession number AB 007718), Gallus lafayetti(GenBank accession number D 66893), and Gallus sonneratii (GenBank accession number D 66892).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to characterize the genetic variability of village chickens from three agro-ecological regions of western Algeria: coastal (CT), inland plains (IP) and highlands (HL), to reveal any underlying population structure, and to evaluate potential genetic introgression from commercial lines into local populations. A set of 233 chickens was genotyped with a panel of 23 microsatellite markers. Geographical coordinates were individually recorded. Eight reference populations were included in the study to investigate potential gene flow: four highly selected commercial pure lines and four lines of French slow-growing chickens. Two populations of wild <b>red</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> were also genotyped to compare the range of diversity between domestic and wild fowls. A genetic diversity analysis was conducted both within and between populations. Multivariate redundancy analyses were performed to assess the relative influence of geographical location among Algerian ecotypes. The results showed a high genetic variability within the Algerian population, with 184 alleles and a mean number of 8. 09 alleles per locus. The values of heterozygosity (He and Ho) ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 62 in Algerian ecotypes and were smaller than values found in <b>Jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> populations and higher than values found in commercial populations. Although the structuring analysis of genotypes did not reveal clear subpopulations within Algerian ecotypes, the supervised approach using geographical data showed a significant (p < 0. 01) differentiation between the three ecotypes which was mainly due to altitude. Thus, the genetic diversity of Algerian ecotypes may be under the influence of two factors with contradictory effects: the geographical location and climatic conditions may induce some differentiation, whereas the high level of exchanges and gene flow may suppress it. Evidence of gene flow between commercial and Algerian local populations was observed, which may be due to unrecorded crossing with commercial chickens. Chicken ecotypes from western Algeria are characterized by a high genetic diversity and must be safeguarded as an important reservoir of genetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of insertion and/or deletion (indels) polymorphisms as genetic markers was evaluated by genotyping 102 indels loci in native chicken populations from Myanmar and Indonesia {{as well as}} Red <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> and Green <b>jungle</b> <b>fowls</b> from Java Island. Out of the 102 indel markers, 97 were polymorphic. The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0. 206 to 0. 268 and 0. 229 to 0. 284 in native chicken populations and 0. 003 to 0. 101 and 0. 012 to 0. 078 in <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> populations. The coefficients of genetic differentiation (Gst) of the native chicken populations from Myanmar and Indonesia were 0. 041 and 0. 098 respectively. The genetic variability is higher among native chicken populations than <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> populations. The high Gst value was found between native chicken populations and <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> populations.

5000|$|The bantam {{version of}} the American Game does not derive from the {{original}} large fowl. It was created in New Jersey in the 1940s by a breeder named Frank Gary. He cross-bred the wild <b>Red</b> <b>Jungle</b> <b>Fowl</b> with fighting bantams of the type known {{at the time as}} [...] "pit game". He applied to have his new breed included in the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association, but when an objection was raised, withdrew his application and donated all rights in the breed, including a drawing by Arthur O. Schilling for the standard, to the American Bantam Association. The American Game Bantam was listed in the yearbook of the American Bantam Association from 1950,, and was admitted to the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 2009.|$|E
50|$|As {{the twentieth}} century began, the need to {{maintain}} and research large animals in a more natural environment became clear. Peter Chalmers Mitchell (ZSL Secretary 1903-35) conceived the vision of a new park no more than 70 mi away from London and thus accessible to the public, and at least 200 acre in extent. In 1926, profiting from the agricultural depression, the ideal place was found: Hall Farm, near Whipsnade village, was derelict, and held almost 600 acre on the Chiltern Hills. ZSL bought the farm in December 1926 for £13,480 12s 10d. In 1928 the first animals arrived at the new Whipsnade Park - two Amherst pheasants, a golden pheasant and five <b>red</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl.</b> Others soon followed, including muntjac deer, llamas, wombats and skunks. In 1931 Whipsnade Park was opened to the public as the world's first open zoological park.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of mega-telomeres may {{be enhanced by}} the process of domestication or development of highly inbred vertebrate lines. Interestingly, the largest chicken arrays were discovered in the most inbred genetic lines. Studies of full siblings and their progeny from the UCD 003 line, established in 1956 and maintained by full-sibling matings, established a consistent profile with 200 Kb or larger telomeres. However, less inbred <b>Red</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>fowl</b> families (the hypothesized ancestor of chickens) have slightly shorter Class II arrays and other avian species, such as the American bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), the northern goshawk (Accipter gentilis), possess fewer mega-telomeres and have a considerably smaller telomere size range. Furthermore, laboratory inbred mouse strains (Mus musculus) exhibit extremely long telomeres of 30-150 Kb in length, however the wild mouse species (Mus spretus) has significantly shorter telomeres ranging from 5-15 Kb.|$|E
