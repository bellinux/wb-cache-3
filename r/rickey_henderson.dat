5|$|<b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> {{signed a}} $12 million, 4-year {{contract}} with the Oakland Athletics on November 28, 1989, 6 days after Puckett signed his $9 million, 3-year contract.|$|E
5|$|Barry Bonds {{received}} the award in 2002, becoming the third player so honored {{for breaking the}} single-season home run record. Bonds {{was the first of}} two players to receive the award that season, along with <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson.</b> The award was given in each year from 2004 until 2007: Roger Clemens was honored during the 2004 All-Star Game, and Ichiro Suzuki was presented with the award for breaking the single-season hits record in 2005. Rachel Robinson was honored in 2007, receiving the award for establishing the Jackie Robinson Foundation. She was the first woman and the first non-player to be thus honored.|$|E
5|$|Four Athletics hold Major League records. Offensively, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> {{holds the}} single-season modern day steals record, {{recording}} 130 over 149 games played during the 1982 season. Frankie Hayes is {{tied for the}} single-game doubles record, recording four in a game on July 25, 1936. Eddie Collins stole six bases twice in September 1912; his mark would later be tied by Otis Nixon, Eric Young and Carl Crawford. Defensively, Bruno Haas, who spent his only professional season with the Athletics, holds the single game walks allowed record, pitching 16 in his Major League debut.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} before the 2008 season about where Bonds might play. However, no one signed {{him during the}} 2008 or 2009 seasons. If he had returned to Major League Baseball, Bonds would have been within close range of several significant hitting milestones: needing just 65 hits to reach 3,000, 4 runs batted in to reach 2,000, and 38 home runs to reach 800. He would have needed 69 more runs scored to move past <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> as the all-time runs champion, and 37 extra base hits to move past Hank Aaron as the all-time extra base hits champion.|$|E
5|$|First {{base was}} the highest paid {{position}} in 2010; regular starters at that position earned an average salary of $9,504,165 in compared to an overall average of $3,014,572. Pitcher Nolan Ryan was {{the first player to}} earn an annual salary above $1 million, signing a $4.5 million, 4-year contract with the Houston Astros in 1979. Kirby Puckett and <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> signed the first contracts which paid an average of $3 million a year in November 1989, while 2010 was the first season where the MLB average salary rose above that same mark. Five of the twenty highest paid players in 2013 were members of the Yankees. Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming it undermines the parity of MLB.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{took a quick}} 2–0 {{lead with}} a single by <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> to open the game {{followed}} immediately by a home run by Edgardo Alfonzo. They added to this lead in the third as Alfonzo drew a walk and then John Olerud hit a double which advanced Alfonzo to third base. Reds starter Steve Parris intentionally walked Mike Piazza to load the bases and was relieved by Denny Neagle. However, Neagle then walked Robin Ventura to score Alfonzo and extend the lead to 3–0. Neagle remained {{in the game and}} yielded a home run to Henderson to lead off the fifth inning for the Mets' fourth run. Neagle then loaded the bases with two outs with walks to Piazza and Ventura followed by a Darryl Hamilton single, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Reds pinch hit for Neagle {{in the bottom of the}} fifth, and Danny Graves entered for them to pitch the sixth inning. Graves walked Rey Ordóñez to leadoff the inning, Mets starter Al Leiter sacrifice bunted Ordóñez to second, and following an out he scored on a double by Alfonzo. Graves remained in the game until Mark Lewis pinch hit for him in the eighth and Dennys Reyes relieved him in the ninth. Graves and Reyes held the score steady after the sixth but the Reds' offense did not score against Al Leiter and the Mets won the game, and with it the Wild Card, 5–0.|$|E
25|$|With 808 steals in his career, Raines has the fourth-highest {{total in}} major league history, behind <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> Lou Brock and Ty Cobb.|$|E
25|$|During this time, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> {{shattered}} Lou Brock's modern {{major league}} record by stealing 130 bases {{in a single}} season (1982), a total {{which has not been}} approached since. On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball's most famous records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Brock.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{is one of}} only 29 {{players in}} {{baseball}} history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades. He is also one of only four players to hit a home run in each of four different decades, the others being Willie McCovey (who, like Williams, also retired with 521 career home runs), <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> and Omar Vizquel.|$|E
25|$|Brock {{held the}} single-season stolen base record with 118 {{until it was}} broken by <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> in 1982. He also held the major league record for career stolen bases with 938 until it was also broken by Henderson in 1991. He led the National League in stolen bases for a record eight times and also had a record twelve {{consecutive}} seasons with 50 or more stolen bases. Brock is still the National League's leader in career stolen bases.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, the Blue Jays' new {{retractable}} roofed home, SkyDome, {{opened in}} mid-season. It also {{marked the beginning}} of an extremely successful five-year period for the team. In May, management fired manager Jimy Williams and replaced him with Cito Gaston, the team's hitting instructor. The club had a dismal 12–24 record {{at the time of the}} firing, but went 77–49 under Gaston to win the AL East title by two games, with an 89–73 record. On May 28, George Bell's walk-off home run, off of Chicago White Sox closer Bobby Thigpen, marked the end of the Exhibition Stadium era. The first game at the new stadium took place on June 5 against the Milwaukee Brewers; the Jays lost 5–3. In the 1989 ALCS, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> led the World Series champion Oakland Athletics to a 4–1 series win.|$|E

On May 28, 1989, the Blue Jays played their final game at Exhibition Stadium against the Chicago White Sox, who coincidentally were the Blue Jays' opponents in their first game in franchise history, at the same stadium, twelve years earlier; the Blue Jays won, 7–5, in 10 innings. The first game at the new stadium took place on June 5 against the Milwaukee Brewers, which the Jays lost, 5–3. In the 1989 American League Championship Series, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> led the Oakland Athletics to a 4–1 series win.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{broke out}} in 1993 with a 19–8 record, 3.24 ERA and his first of six 300-plus strikeout seasons (308). In May 1993, Johnson again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the {{opponent}} was the Oakland Athletics. He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the Minnesota Twins' Chuck Knoblauch. Prior to the trade deadline, Johnson was nearly dealt to the Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and Mike Timlin. Toronto general manager Pat Gillick had two separate transactions on the table including the one for Johnson with Seattle general manager Woody Woodward and one for <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> with Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson. When Gillick was unable to contact Woodward he agreed to utilize the deal with Alderson. When Woodward returned Gillick's call {{he said he would}} agree to the deal for Johnson. However, Gillick gave his word to Alderson even though the deal had not been finalized. At the 1993 All-Star Game in Baltimore, Maryland, in a famous incident, Johnson threw a fastball over the head of Philadelphia Phillies first baseman John Kruk.|$|E
500|$|... "I’m {{about to}} give you one of my all-time {{favorite}} statistics: <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> walked 796 times in his career LEADING OFF AN INNING. Think about this again. There would be nothing, absolutely nothing, a pitcher would want to avoid more than walking <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> to lead off an inning. And yet he walked SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX times to lead off an inning.|$|E
500|$|Tony La Russa, Henderson's {{manager in}} the late 1980s in Oakland, said, [...] "He rises to the occasion—the big moment—better than anybody I've ever seen." [...] Coach Rene Lachemann said, [...] "If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey." [...] Teammate Mitchell Page said, [...] "It wasn't until I saw Rickey that I {{understood}} what baseball was about. <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> is a run, man. That's it. When you see <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> I don't care when, the score's already 1–0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it." ...|$|E

500|$|Longtime scout Charlie Metro {{remembered the}} havoc caused by Henderson: '"I {{did a lot}} of study and I found that it's {{impossible}} to throw <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|E

[...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody...

500|$|The League Championship Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{award is}} given {{in each of the}} two annual League Championship Series, for the American and National Leagues, to the player deemed to have the most impact on his team's performance. The award has been {{presented}} in the National League since 1977, and in the American League since 1980. Dusty Baker won the inaugural award in 1977 with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Frank White won the first American League award in 1980 with the Kansas City Royals. The eight Hall of Famers to win LCS MVPs include Roberto Alomar, George Brett, Dennis Eckersley, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> Kirby Puckett, Ozzie Smith, [...] Willie Stargell, and John Smoltz.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer at the Bat" [...] took a {{long time}} to produce. It was written by John Swartzwelder, who is a big {{baseball}} fan, but was suggested by Sam Simon, who wanted an episode filled with real Major League Baseball players. Executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss doubted that they would be able to get nine players, thinking that they would be able to get three at best. They succeeded, and the nine players who agreed to guest star were recorded over a period of six months, whenever they were playing the Los Angeles Dodgers or California Angels. Each player recorded their part in roughly five minutes and spent the next hour writing autographs for the staff. In several cases, the writers were unable to get the player who was their first choice. Nolan Ryan, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> Ryne Sandberg, and Carlton Fisk were among the players who turned down the chance to guest star.|$|E
500|$|Growing up, Rollins admired <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> one of {{the best}} leadoff hitters in MLB history, and {{especially}} early in his career, sought to emulate Henderson at the plate. This contributed to his propensity to swing early in the count, and chase high pitches, seeking to hit home runs rather than get on base, the stereotypical role of a leadoff hitter. Consequently, he struggled to make contact with the ball, striking out too much, and rarely walking. To help alleviate those predominantly negative tendencies, he worked with Tony Gwynn, Sr. prior to the 2003 season to work on using the whole field, and hit more ground balls than pop-ups. Overall, he [...] "always had a hard time accepting that he is vertically challenged at 5-foot-8", which contributed to his inclination to strive to hit for power rather than contact, and to seek to pull the ball rather than use the whole field. The Phillies all-time leader in hits, he also is second in Phillies history in stolen bases.|$|E
500|$|The Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award is {{presented}} by the Commissioner of Major League Baseball to a group or individual {{who has made a}} [...] "major impact on the sport" [...] of baseball. The award consists of a trophy: a gold baseball sitting atop a silver trophy base. The award has been presented thirteen times by Commissioner Bud Selig: eleven times to players, once to a team, and once to a non-player. The award is most often presented for breaking a Major League Baseball record; it has been presented three times to players who broke the single-season home run record (Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Barry Bonds). Other record-breakers to receive the award include Ichiro Suzuki (hits in a single season), Cal Ripken, Jr. (consecutive games played), <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> (career stolen bases and career runs scored) and Mariano Rivera (career saves, both regular season and postseason; postseason ERA). The most recent recipients are Rivera in 2013 and Derek Jeter in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Neither the Mets nor the Reds {{had made}} the playoffs the {{previous}} season. The Mets finished the 1998 season with an 88–74 record, while the Reds finished below [...]500, at 77–85. The Mets had been tied with the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants in the 1998 wild-card race as {{late in the season}} as September 25, at 88–72. However, the Mets did not win another game that year and finished their season one game back of the Cubs and Giants who tied at 89–73. The Cubs and Giants played a tie-breaker in 1998, with the Cubs ultimately winning the wild card. Sports writers said the Mets [...] "blew" [...] their lead and [...] "collapse", later comparing their 1998 season to the Mets' troubles late in the 1999 season. <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> and Robin Ventura joined the Mets prior to the 1999 season and spent the year as their starting left fielder and third baseman. The Reds added right fielder Michael Tucker, center fielder Mike Cameron, and starting pitchers Denny Neagle and Steve Avery during the offseason.|$|E
500|$|In Game 1, the Reds {{defeated}} the Athletics 7–0 in what Associated Press writer Jim Donaghy called [...] "a stunning combination {{of power and}} pitching": Cincinnati scored four runs off of Dave Stewart, who had a six-game winning streak in the playoffs, while pitchers José Rijo, Rob Dibble, and Randy Myers combined for a nine-hit shutout. The game ended the Athletics' ten-game postseason win streak. Bates did not play. Like Game 1, Cincinnati was the home team for Game 2, where Danny Jackson of the Reds faced Bob Welch of the Athletics. Oakland opened the scoring with a run {{in the top of}} the first inning, a ground ball by Jose Canseco that scored <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson.</b> The Reds responded for two runs in the bottom of the first. Oakland scored three more runs in the third, and Piniella removed Jackson from the game as the Athletics led the Reds 4–2. Cincinnati added a run in the bottom of the fourth and managed to tie the game in the eighth as Billy Hatcher hit a triple and scored on a groundout. After nine innings, the game remained tied, 4–4. Rob Dibble came into pitch in the ninth and held the Athletics scoreless for the two innings he pitched; Oakland countered with future Hall of Fame inductee Dennis Eckersley for the bottom of the tenth. Leading off for the Reds was Davis, who grounded out to shortstop. The next batter was supposed to be the pitcher Dibble but Bates entered the game to pinch hit. Hitting coach Tony Pérez told him to [...] "put the ball in play" [...] and [...] "run like Hell". Eckersley pitched Bates to an 0–2 ball–strike count when he hit the ball weakly to the third baseman and beat out an infield single; it was Bates' first hit against a right-handed pitcher in his MLB career. Chris Sabo advanced Bates to second on a single, and Oliver scored Bates on another single to win the game. Bates called the situation a [...] "dream come true".|$|E
500|$|The 1982 and 1983 Yankees were {{fifth and}} third, respectively. Henry Fetter {{wrote of the}} {{following}} year's team, which had several aging players, [...] "The 1984 Yanks had assembled an all-star lineup—but it was that of 1979." [...] In what became a trend in future seasons, the Yankees lacked effective pitching, undoing the efforts of a top-tier offense that included players such as Winfield and first baseman Don Mattingly, {{one of the few}} star hitters produced by the farm system during the era. Mattingly led the AL in batting average in 1984—beating out Winfield for the league lead. The Yankees' 1985 season began with a batting lineup improved by an offseason trade for <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> the future MLB career stolen base and runs scored record holder. Mattingly was AL MVP in 1985, with 145 RBI and a personal-best 35 home runs, while Guidry won 22 games. The Yankees had 97 wins, two off the division leader Toronto Blue Jays. The 1986 side's win total fell to 92, but it was only enough for second place again behind Boston. Mattingly hit an MLB record six grand slam home runs in 1987, but dealt with back pain that limited his effectiveness in his remaining years. The Yankees fell to fourth, beginning a six-year streak of fourth or worse. The Yankees had the most wins of any MLB team during the 1980s, but missed the playoffs eight times during the decade and did not win a World Series. Many New York baseball fans chose to support an exciting Mets team. From 1984 to 1992, a period that featured their 1986 World Series victory, the Mets' attendance topped that of the Yankees every year. Despite falling attendance, the Yankees' finances were not significantly harmed, as they had a 12-year television rights contract with the Madison Square Garden network that gave them a record $500million and flexibility to increase their payroll if desired.|$|E
500|$|On December 12, 2006, the Texas Rangers signed Lofton to {{a one-year}} contract. By signing with the Rangers, Lofton tied Todd Zeile for most teams played {{for by a}} {{position}} player. In 84 games with the Rangers, he hit [...]303 with 16 doubles. On July 27, 2007, Lofton was traded by the Rangers to the Indians in exchange for minor league catcher Max Ramírez. [...] "That's my biggest thing right now. I'm {{trying to get a}} World Series ring", Lofton said on joining the Indians {{for the third time in}} his career. The Jacobs Field crowd greeted Lofton with a standing ovation during his first at bat for this tour of duty with the Indians. Lofton noted, [...] "I missed being in Cleveland... I enjoy Cleveland. It's the city that got me going." [...] In Game One of the 2007 ALDS against the Yankees, he went 3-for-4 with four RBIs and one stolen base, which tied him with <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> for the MLB's all-time postseason stolen bases record (33). In Game Two, he went 2-for-3 with two walks and scored the winning run in the 11th inning. Then, in Game Three of the 2007 ALCS, the 40-year-old Lofton hit a two-run home run against the Boston Red Sox' Daisuke Matsuzaka, becoming the seventh-oldest player to hit a post-season home run. Lofton earned his 34th career postseason stolen base in Game Four of the 2007 ALCS, setting a new MLB record for playoff steals. The Indians, who at one point had a 31 game lead over the Red Sox, eventually lost the series. Lofton became a free agent at the end of the season but did not sign a contract with a major league team. He expressed interest in playing before the 2009 season. From 2002 to 2007, Lofton played for eight teams and made it to the postseason with four of them. Joe Torre said, after Lofton had been to the playoffs in 11 of the past 13 seasons and played for 11 clubs in his career, [...] "He bounced around a lot of clubs for a reason: They felt he could help them. He did a hell of a job." [...] As Rollie Fingers wrote, [...] "On one hand, Lofton could be seen as a catalyst who magically sparked his teams into playoff contention, but others could say that it was simply a case of top playoff contenders repeatedly seeing him as the final piece of their puzzle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coming {{back from}} a fourth-place regular season finish, the Criollos won their tenth {{championship}} in the 1980–81 season, but the Caribbean Series were not held that year. [...] On January 2, 1981, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> established a new stolen bases record with 42.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was also}} second to Ruth in career {{slugging}} percentage, where he remains today, and first in on-base percentage, with [...]4817.

2500|$|After three dismal seasons on {{the field}} and at the gate, the team started to gel again. In a final masterstroke as owner, Finley hired Berkeley native Billy Martin to manage the young team, led by new young stars <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> Mike Norris, Tony Armas, and Dwayne Murphy. Martin made believers of his young charges, [...] "Billyball" [...] was used to market the team, and the Athletics {{finished}} second in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Ichiro has a {{home run}} batting stroke that he {{displays}} in batting practice, but not in games. The New York Times criticized his inability to improve his power when his Mariner teams were often low-scoring while noting that he also did not steal bases as frequently as <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> or Tim Raines. Ichiro, however, once commented, [...] "If I'm allowed to hit [...]220, I could probably hit 40 , but nobody wants that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, Ichiro {{became the}} oldest player {{to start a}} game in center field since at least 1900, {{breaking}} the record previously held by <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson.</b> On June 29, Ichiro became the oldest active MLB player when Bartolo Colón was designated for assignment by the Atlanta Braves, [...] albeit Colon latched on with the Minnesota Twins a few weeks later. [...] On July 6, Ichiro hit two singles against the St. Louis Cardinals, bringing his hits total to 3,054 and surpassing Panamanian-born Rod Carew as the all-time leader in MLB hits among foreign-born players.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Haas ownership, {{the minor}} league system was rebuilt, which bore fruit later that decade as José Canseco (1986), Mark McGwire (1987), and Walt Weiss (1988) were chosen as A.L. Rookies of the Year. During the 1986 season, Tony La Russa {{was hired as}} the Athletics' manager, a post he held {{until the end of}} 1995. In 1987, La Russa's first full year as manager, the team {{finished}} at 81–81, its best record in seven seasons. Beginning in 1988, the Athletics won the A.L. pennant three years in a row. Reminiscent of their Philadelphia predecessors, this A's team finished with the best record of any team in the major leagues during all 3 years, winning 104 (1988), 99 (1989), and 103 (1990) games, featuring such stars as McGwire, Canseco, Weiss, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> Carney Lansford, Dave Stewart, and Dennis Eckersley.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan left Houston in a {{contract}} dispute following the 1988 season {{and joined the}} Texas Rangers. He became {{the first player to}} play for all four MLB original expansion teams: the Mets, Angels, Houston Colt [...]45s/ Astros and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers. (Ryan would be joined in this category by Darren Oliver, who made his Major League debut as Ryan's teammate in September 1993. Oliver's father Bob had also been a teammate of Ryan's, with the Angels from 1972 to 1974.) In 1989, he went 16–10 and led the league with 301 strikeouts. Against the Oakland Athletics on August 22, Ryan struck out <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson</b> to become the only pitcher to record 5,000 career strikeouts. (Following the game, Henderson was quoted as saying, [...] "If he ain't struck you out, then you ain't nobody.") His 4,999th and 5,001st strikeouts were from the same man, Athletics catcher Ron Hassey. Two years later, at 44, Ryan finished fifth in the league in ERA (2.91) and third in strikeouts (203).|$|E
2500|$|Williams lacked foot speed, as attested by his 19-year career {{total of}} only one inside-the-park home run, one {{occasion}} of hitting for the cycle, and just 24 stolen bases. (Interestingly, despite his slowness on the basepaths, {{he is one of}} only four players in history – along with the noted speedsters Tim Raines, <b>Rickey</b> <b>Henderson,</b> and Omar Vizquel – to have stolen a base in four different decades.) [...] Williams always felt that if he had had more speed, he could have raised his average considerably and it would have helped him hit [...]400 in at least one more season. Williams was sometimes considered to be an indifferent outfielder with a good throwing arm. He often spent time in left field practicing [...] "shadow swings" [...] for his next at-bat. Williams occasionally expressed regret that he had not worked harder on his defense. However, Williams did become an expert at playing the rebounds of batted balls off of the left-field wall and fences in Fenway Park. Later on, he helped pass this expertise to the left-fielder Carl Yastrzemski of the Red Sox.|$|E
