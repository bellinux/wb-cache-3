50|$|Trade unions, if they exist, are {{generally}} strongest {{on the plant}} or site level where the collection of membership dues takes place. The majority of union funds is also spent on this level. The most transparent finances are those of Solidarnosc. Membership subscriptions are distributed as follows: 60 per cent go to the Plant/Site Commission, 25 per cent to the Regional Board, 8 per cent to the National Commission (umbrella organisation), 5 per cent to the strike fund and 2 per cent to the sector union. OPZZ and FZZ Forum also have great problems with financing their activities. In both cases a part of subscriptions of 7 cent per month and member goes to central offices.

During the last few years especially Solidarnosc and OPZZ were forced to cut down on costs by closing offices and reducing staff. OPZZ seems to be in a better material situation than Solidarnosc, as it took over the larger part of the properties of trade unions dating from before 1989 (urban office properties, sanatoriums and holiday homes) and thus for years functioned on the basis of earnings from <b>renting</b> <b>and</b> <b>leasing</b> them.

50|$|Currently, about 80% {{of cargo}} is {{deemed to be}} transshipment, while 20% is gateway (such as fuel, {{construction}} materials, agriculture products and so on). This percentage split is likely to change with the start of FTZ, envisioned {{to be similar to}} the Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza), UAE. With it, the new Port of Baku will act as a major logistics hub in Central Eurasia, serving both European and Asian markets, as well as being part of an extensive international logistics network linking Europe and Asia. In particular, Port of Baku will trade & become the major centre for consolidation, concentration and distribution, providing a wide range of value-added services in the region to the markets of the South Caucasus, Central Asia, Iran, southern Russia and Turkey. There are a significant number of activities that can be classified as value-added services in the field of logistics. Generally, they fall into two categories:• General Logistics Services, including storage, loading and unloading, stripping, unstuffing, groupage, consolidation and distribution.• Value-Added Logistics (VAL), including repackaging, customizing, assembly, quality control, testing, repair, on-terminal, auto-accessorizing, grain storage and fumigating, news print storage, storage of commodities and transfer and in-container garment assembly.General value-added services include services such as the maintenance, <b>renting</b> <b>and</b> <b>leasing</b> of equipment, cleaning facilities, tanking, safety, security services, offices and information and communication services of various kinds. VAL activities, in particular, are growing in importance as producers concentrate on meeting the demands of customers for high quality specialized products. New players in this field of third party logistics services providers will be attracted to the Port of Baku at Alat to take over parts of the production chain (assembly, quality control, customizing, packaging and others) and of the after-sales services (including repair and re-use).FTZ would be in a natural position to participate in this logistics niche. It will be linked to other Caspian ports via high quality maritime connections through the New Port of Baku at Alat, and intermodal road and rail transport services from Alat to Georgia, Iran, Turkey, Russia and southeast Europe, while also providing air freight services from Baku International Airport.The activity in FTZ will create an additional volume of cargo aimed at exports. The majority of these cargoes is likely to be transported in containers via the various intermodal forms of transport.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The spatial {{organization}} of farm units in Polk and Linn {{counties in the}} mid-Willamette Valley has undergone significant change over the past 30 years. Whereas most study areas operations in the 1930 's and 1940 's consisted of small family owned farms with contiguous land bases, present mid-Willamette Valley units vary considerably in spatial organization, tenure patterns, and size. The purposes of this research are to determine the magnitude of farm size changes {{in the study area}} over the past 30 year; determine the spatial organization strategies underlying operator's choices of particular means of farm size changes; determine the means of farm size changes; assess the effects of farm size changes on the characteristics of agricultural land use in the study area; and determine the spatial characteristics of farm size changes. Approximately ten percent of the farmers in the study area (280) were interviewed concerning the spatial organization and evolution of their operations. Eight farms were selected for indepth case studies. The results of the farmer interviews were statistically treated by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program at Oregon State University. The results of farmer interviews indicate that full time commercial operators have steadily increased their land bases over the past 30 years. Interview data also reveal a large increase in the numbers of small part-time units and rural residences in the post World War II era. <b>Renting</b> <b>and</b> <b>leasing</b> of farm land is common in the study area, and as commercial farm operators continue to seek to enlarge the areal extent of their land, the competition for rental or lease land is increasing. There is also strong demand for suitable farm land by prospective buyers. Farmers have enlarged their land bases primarily because they believe they must if they are to achieve satisfactory economies of scale. The study suggests that this is the dominant effect. The need to enlarge the spatial component of their operations has forced many commercial farmers to purchase, rent, or lease land that is not joined to their headquarters. In some cases they must move equipment up to 25 miles to work their scattered parcels. Such farmers are well aware of the liabilities associated with farming non-contiguous land bases, but accept these problems in order to enlarge. The trends in agricultural land use in the study area are toward larger commercial units {{on the one hand and}} toward small part-time farm/rural residences on the other. The full-time commercial operators generally make effective use of their land base whereas, the part-time farmers are usually less concerned with maintaining optimal land use. The increasing numbers of rural residences and the increasing population of the study area lead to the conclusion that the mid-Willamette Valley is becoming an urbanized area with attending suburban sprawl, rural residences, small acreages, hobby or part-time farms, and relatively few large commercial farm units...|$|E
40|$|Globalization of {{the world}} economy has caused new forms of competition. Companies are faced with a new and {{fast-changing}} environment, so that international companies need to find new ways for succeeding in the battle for customers. Like suppliers, customers are also affected by sharper competition. They are forced to introduce new products and services, acquire latest technological developments {{and at the same time}} cut costs. One of the trends noticed amongst large international customers has been the narrowing of the supplier base, and search for the development of new types of relationships with the selected ones. As a result of these trends, suppliers are under additional pressures, operating under squeezed profit margins and higher customer demands. Traditional industrial products due to the technological development are becoming increasingly commoditized, and a shift in the measurement of value has occurred. Standardized features like quality, design, durability and ability to deliver all this at a reasonable price, while still being regarded as important, have remained only as the base for the creation and delivery of total service solutions, the so called `total package'. This marks a significant move towards the so called `soft' part of the offer, including services complementing the product offer in terms of creating and delivering `added value' to customers. Service, maintenance, <b>renting</b> <b>and</b> <b>leasing</b> of equipment, new sorts of financial solutions, information and consulting services are completely or partly being included in the offer. The Key Account Management concept has become a mode and tool for serving large customers on a global basis aiming towards achievement of longterm business success, developing and sustaining suppliers competitive advantage. It is defined as an organizational form and process in multinational companies by which the worldwide activities for serving multinational customers are co-coordinated centrally by one person or team within the supplying company. In the light of this, our case company, Volvo Construction Equipment has proposed a Master's Thesis project with the purpose of identifying and accessing the key elements for development and implementation of the KAM concept as a tool for the creation and increase of sustainable competitive advantage. This research has been conducted from several different perspectives: academics, consultants and the case company. Theories upon which the thesis is based are: network strategy as a part of interaction approach to industrial marketing, relationship marketing and organizational buying behavior theory. The empirical part of the thesis, and conclusions drawn from its analysis, are based on numerous interviews, seventeen in all, with both high-level and operational managers in selling and purchasing organizations. The empirical results, and the conclusions based on their analysis, have two dimensions. One is concerned with the general findings about the KAM development and implementation based on the information obtained through many interviews with the case and other companies. Analysis of the customers' purchasing processes and their views on KAM are also included and presented in this part. The second dimension presents the specific findings connected with Volvo CE but in a manner that can be of use to a broad array of business entities interested in developing KAM. It is divided in two large areas: the stepwise approach to the development and implementation of KAM practices and the necessary organizational structures and processes. Finally, we present the theoretical implications as well as a few ideas about further studies in this area...|$|E
