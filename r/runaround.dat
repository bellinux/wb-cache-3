5|$|After {{an early}} spell at Tavelsjö IK, Blomqvist signed for then {{recently}} formed Umeå FC in 1992. In the spring {{portion of his}} first season for the club, he helped them to the Division 2 Norra Norrland title, promoting the club to Division 1 Norra for the autumn. At the time {{this was the second}} tier of Swedish football. Subsequently, he signed for IFK Göteborg on 11 September 1993. Blomqvist played a part in the club's Allsvenskan win that year. He scored eight goals in 24 league appearances en route to the league title in 1994. Furthermore, he played a part in Sweden's advance to the semi finals of the World Cup and scored in the club's 3–1 win over Manchester United in the Champions League, knocking them out of the competition. This performance caught the eye of United manager Alex Ferguson and helped the team qualify for the quarter-finals of the tournament. Another title followed in 1995, with Blomqvist's goal against Helsingborgs IF, when he performed a variant of the Pelé <b>runaround</b> move, voted goal of the season. In his last season for Göteborg, he played against former club Umeå, who had reached the Allsvenskan {{for the first time in}} their history. In 1996, Blomqvist was voted Fan's Player of the Year and Midfielder of the Year. At the end of the 1996 season, he signed for newly crowned Serie A champions Milan.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{released}} a limited slate of twelve features {{in its first}} year; in 1930, that figure more than doubled to twenty-nine. Originally organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a transition to the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Encouraged by Rio Ritas success, RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating Technicolor sequences, among them Dixiana and Hit the Deck, both scripted and directed, like Rio Rita, by Luther Reed. Following {{the example of the}} other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical revue, Radio Revels. Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor. The project was abandoned, however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931. RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, The <b>Runaround</b> and Fanny Foley Herself (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.|$|E
25|$|By April 1998, Jones was {{suffering}} from both HIV and cancer. His neighbors and fellow workers were unaware that he had any health problems. Jones confided to a friend in early April {{that he had found}} a flesh-colored growth on his neck. The doctors at first were unsure of its cause, but later confirmed that it was cancer. Jones believed he was getting the <b>runaround</b> from his health insurer and also told his best friend that he was HIV-positive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1958 by Joe Favale (lead vocal, b.1940), who had been singing with a group called The Moments, and Tony Maltese (tenor), who had another group, The <b>Runarounds.</b> They {{recruited}} singers Dom Colurra (bass), Larry Cusamano (second tenor) and Joe Nigro (baritone), and found a manager, Henry Boye. Initially calling themselves The <b>Runarounds,</b> they renamed themselves as The Emotions in 1959. In 1962, they won a contract with Kapp Records, and released [...] "Echo", a song written by Favale but credited jointly to the group and Boye. [...] The record was chosen as a [...] "pick hit of the week" [...] by leading DJ Murray the K, and rose to number 76 on the Billboard pop chart.|$|R
2500|$|As of mid2012, {{all that}} remains of North Hawthorne is one siding running {{parallel}} to where the car shop used to be. [...] The NYS refers to this siding as one its <b>runarounds.</b> [...] The yard's roundhouse, which was sold in 1946, still stands, although it has undergone extensive modifications. [...] Some of the surrounding industrial buildings also retain old rail freight platforms, although these are either sealed up or in a state of disrepair.|$|R
50|$|Two fast-talking {{insurance}} salesmen — Wilbur Boswell and J. Addington Ganzy — help penniless socialite Mary Marsh to turn {{a dilapidated}} hotel, which was willed to her, into a thriving success. They soon run into trouble, however, {{in the form of}} two sets of rival gangsters who want to break into the hotel safe; also, Mary's mother, Rebecca Marsh, wants her to marry wealthy lawyer John Blackwell, although Mary has fallen in love with Wilbur. And while she takes an instant dislike to Wilbur, Rebecca falls for Ganzy. Adding to the complications is the fact that Blackwell is actually in league with the gangsters. The finale involves nighttime <b>runarounds</b> and a shoot-out in the hotel. During the pitched battle between the rival gangs and the police, Boswell and Ganzy save the jewels, after which Ganzy marries Rebecca, and then gives away Mary at her marriage to Wilbur.|$|R
25|$|In 1945 Horman co-wrote, with Dwight Taylor, the {{screenplay}} for the Humphrey Bogart suspense thriller Conflict. The following year, along with Sam Hellman, {{he would write}} {{the screenplay}} for the romantic screwball comedy, The <b>Runaround,</b> directed by Charles Lamont, and starring Ella Raines and Rod Cameron. In 1948 he co-wrote with Charles Grayson the original screenplay for the Abbott and Costello film, The Noose Hangs High, the original title of which was For Love or Money. With the advent of television, Horman would pen the first miniseries, The Living Christ, which consists of twelve half-hour episodes, and aired on NBC in 1951. Horman's career slowed down in the 1950s, he only wrote half a dozen films during the decade, one of which, Day of Triumph, was another film based {{on the life of}} Jesus. It was the last film directed by Irving Pichel, who died one week after completing the film in 1954. Horman's last two films were both for Republic Pictures in 1958, Young and Wild and Juvenile Jungle, both B-pictures directed by William Witney.|$|E
500|$|The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) {{joined the}} case the same month, {{as did the}} Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, giving the case {{national}} publicity. Attorney Martin A. Martin (President of the Danville NAACP) developed information that both the grand jury that indicted Waller and petit jury that convicted him were composed only of white men who paid polled taxes (thus excluding most blacks and Waller's peers), although the county clerk initially gave him the <b>runaround.</b> The groups hoped that the case would lead the US Supreme Court to rule that the poll tax was unconstitutional. [...] In December, Virginia Governor James H. Price granted Waller his first stay of execution, this one for three months, giving the new defense additional time to study the case.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with {{generally}} mixed reviews from television critics. Dan Martin of The Guardian thought that [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot" [...] was [...] "a little bit anticlimactic" [...] {{in comparison to the}} opening two-part episode of the series, though it was [...] "a nice old-fashioned <b>runaround</b> bolstered by some high concepts and cute moments", much like the classic episodes. He praised Lily Cole as the Siren but criticised the character of Avery. Martin later rated it the worst episode of the first twelve of the series (the finale, which had not aired at the time, {{was not included in the}} list). IGN's Matt Risley gave it an overall [...] "good" [...] score of 7 out of 10, admitting that there were [...] "some great lines" [...] and the [...] "Space Pirate" [...] twist was [...] "a refreshingly sci-fi spin on the well-worn genre plot", but he criticised the Siren for lacking qualities to become [...] "a credible and terrifying Who villain".|$|E
40|$|The women’s {{soccer team}} at Boise State is hardly {{recognized}} by the University. Although Boise State soccer is a Division I team, their soccer complex is located off campus, games are announced via social media, and their marketing on campus is nonexistent. Due {{to the lack of}} marketing and institutional support for women’s soccer, their games rarely gain new fans outside of players’ family or friends. Because of the lack of support and shortage of fans, the team itself must raise money to go on trips that teach the players about soccer. During the 2016 season, coaches and players engaged in raising money to pay for a trip to Spain so they could train and learn about the Basque culture. While the Boise State Athletics marketing team helped raise money for the trip, they were not raising sufficient funds before the deadline of their PonyUp Campaign. The current study examined marketing of Boise State’s soccer team at the Boas Soccer Complex during the 2016 season. Observations were made at the soccer games, and the research team met face-to-face with marketing staff to gain insight on how marketing promoted fundraising for the team’s trip to Spain. Results indicated that marketing efforts were limited to brief announcements at games, and the online PonyUp campaign. After many emails, countless <b>runarounds</b> and several meetings, the research team gained marketing’s permission to assist with fundraising for the trip to Spain. The research team’s efforts resulted in an additional boost to the soccer team’s marketing, and an additional $ 1, 080 for the soccer team’s trip to Spain...|$|R
5000|$|Writing for totalscifionline.com, Patrick Holm {{describes}} [...] "Part One" [...] as [...] "Overall, a good start" [...] {{but that}} [...] "Some odd gaps in logic and excess <b>runarounds</b> make...Two" [...] not {{as effective as}} it could have been." [...] Holm expresses surprise {{at the lack of}} references to the [...] "literally world-shaking events" [...] of Doctor Who episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] which precedes this story chronologically and which saw a Dalek invasion of Earth and Sarah Jane, Luke and Mr Smith helping to defeat them and return Earth to its rightful place in space. However, he states Ford's script for [...] "Part One" [...] is [...] "enjoyable" [...] and praises its mixing of [...] "old and new Who mythologies" [...] with its many [...] "other references back to the parent series Doctor Who". He also praises Ford for [...] "giving the Sontarans a few new tricks" [...] and notes that the effects in [...] "Part One" [...] indicate that the budget for The Sarah Jane Adventures has been increased. Whilst praising Knight and Langer for being [...] "much more fluid in their movements", Holm does not share Rawson-Jones's appreciation for the emotional scenes in [...] "Part One" [...] regarding Maria's departure and claims they lack [...] "the resonance you might expect." [...] Holm does state, however, that [...] "the scenes regarding Maria’s departure are handled better..."Part Two", even if some of the closing scene platitudes are a little vomit-inducing." [...] He cites as examples of weaknesses in [...] "Part Two"; the ease with which Kaagh is fooled by the children; and the incredible luck Clyde has when Sarah Jane and Luke happen to be {{on the other side of}} a locked door in order to let him in thus saving him from Kaagh. He is also critical of the reuse of the threat of [...] "something being brought crashing down to Earth...an overused plot last season" [...] and observes that an [...] "end of season rematch with Kaarg is unsubtly telegraphed". However, he does states that [...] "there are some good moments [...] "Part Two", particularly as Chrissie Jackson gets more character development in one 30-second scene than she had in most of One".|$|R
5000|$|The Passions are an American doo-wop {{group from}} Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. The quintet {{recorded}} a few demos in 1958, {{at which time}} Tony, Albee and Vinny began looking for replacements who were more career-minded. Another group in Bensonhurst had what they needed; when the three Sinceres heard <b>Runarounds</b> lead singer Jimmy Gallagher, they knew {{he was the one}} for them (Jimmy’s previous group, the Palladiyms, included Joe DiBenedetto, who later formed [...] "The Four-evers".)The Sinceres weren’t sure how to approach Jimmy, so they followed him home one night and knocked on his door. After convincing his mother that they only wanted to sing with her son, not mug him, the foursome went to a nearby park and ended up harmonizing for hours. They were now a quartet, with Jimmy on lead, Tony on first tenor, Albee on second tenor, and Vinnie on baritone.n 1959, while the Mystics were recording [...] "Hushabye" [...] at their first session, their friend Tony Armato was there cheering them on promoting his own group to their manager, Jim Gribble. Gribble soon signed the Sinceres and renamed them the Passions. He gave them a demo by a duo of studio singers who called themselves the Cousins. The song was [...] "Just to Be with You" [...] written by Mary Kalfin. The Cousins were Paul Simon and Carole King. By the time the group recorded [...] "Gloria" [...] Vinny had left and been replaced by Gallagher’s friend Lou Rotondo. Also in 1960 Lou Rotondo and Albie Galione, along with Albie Contrera of the Mystics, sang behind Clay Cole on [...] "Here, There, Everywhere" [...] (Roulette), single that became popular in the New York area. Audicon Records lost the group’s next release, the harmony rocker [...] "Made for Lovers." [...] The group recorded a few more sides for Audicon which were leased to Jubilee and Octavia. Released in August 1959 on Sol Winkler’s Audicon label, the Passions’ impeccable harmonies and Gallagher’s impassioned lead put [...] "Just to Be with You" [...] on radios across America. It was a top 20 hit in many eastern cities and it charted nationally, rising to number 69. The follow-up out of Audicon’s 1674 Broadway digs was twice as good. Both sides—the harmony filled [...] "I Only Want You" [...] and the beautiful Billy Dawn Smith ballad [...] "This Is My Love" [...] -vied for radio play and sales throughout the states. They were managed by Jim Gribble who managed several doo-wop groups including the Mystics and The Jarmels, and worked with producer songwriter Stan Vincent. In the late 1990s, they reunited with the Mystics and the Classics for the Brooklyn Reunion Show. Lead singer Jimmy Gallagher left the Passions in 1960 to join the Navy, but later sang with The Legends of Doo Wop in 1998.|$|R
500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian {{praised the}} exits of Amy and Rory and {{highlighted}} Gillan and Smith's performance, noting how {{more of his}} dark side is shown. Of the plot, he stated that it was [...] "funny and thoughtful" [...] but felt [...] "like a <b>runaround</b> bolted on {{to make way for}} the ending". Martin later rated it the fifth best episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery wrote that Hurran [...] "excelled" [...] in directing and that the episode worked [...] "incredibly well" [...] on an emotional level. However, he felt it did not succeed as well in terms of plot, citing the [...] "thin explanation" [...] for the happenings. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode three and a half out of five stars, stating that [...] "the surreal tone to the episode... helped camouflage the fact that the plot made very little sense". However, he praised the cast's [...] "impressive performances", especially Smith's.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, {{the word}} {{robotics}} {{was first used}} in print by Isaac Asimov, in his science fiction short story [...] "Liar!", published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction. Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology of electrical devices is electronics, he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots. In some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first {{use of the word}} robotics was in his short story <b>Runaround</b> (Astounding Science Fiction, March 1942). However, the original publication of [...] "Liar!" [...] predates that of [...] "Runaround" [...] by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{platform}} that was originally used by trains via Lampeter to Carmarthen is now {{used by the}} narrow gauge steam-operated Vale of Rheidol Railway. This railway's track runs parallel to and immediately {{to the south of}} the main line as far as Llanbadarn Fawr. Opened in 1902, it originally had its own terminus at [...] "Aberystwyth Smithfield" [...] (named after Smithfield Road, now Park Avenue). This closed in 1925 and was replaced by a station a short distance from the main railway station; that station site is now a supermarket car park. In 1968 its track was rerouted into the former standard gauge bay Platforms 1 and 2 of the main station. As their trains unload at ground level, a new ramp and ground-level island platform was built in the space between the two original platforms. There is a <b>runaround</b> loop and access to the former mainline railway shed. This was used as the storage and works area for the Vale of Rheidol Railway.|$|E
2500|$|North Hawthorne, {{known as}} North Paterson when {{originally}} constructed, was a rail station and yard located in Hawthorne, New Jersey in Passaic County. [...] The facility, which {{was equipped with}} car and engine shops, served passengers and freight for both the Erie Railroad and the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad from 1892 to 1966. [...] Passenger service from North Hawthorne primarily transported commuters {{to and from the}} Susquehanna Transfer station in North Bergen or the Erie Railroad's Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City. [...] Connecting service included the now defunct Public Service Railway, which at one time used North Hawthorne as the terminus of a trolley line connecting Hawthorne to Paterson. [...] Once a sizable complex with multiple spurs and sidings for surrounding industries, North Hawthorne has been reduced to a single <b>runaround</b> siding. [...] Every structure associated with the yard has been demolished, except for the roundhouse, which today is owned by private interests.|$|E
2500|$|These {{earthquakes}} created {{many political}} difficulties for the then-ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) or Institutional Revolutionary Party. The crisis was {{severe enough to}} have tested the capabilities of wealthier countries, but the government from local PRI bosses to President de la Madrid himself exacerbated the problem aside {{from the lack of}} money. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared it would not request aid; it specifically rejected help from the United States. It was also widely reported {{in the days after the}} earthquake that the military assisted factory owners in retrieving their machinery rather than in removing the bodies of dead factory workers. At many levels of the government, who was helped and by how much was determined by one's standing vis-à-vis the PRI. Those belonging to the party received preference and those considered opposition received the <b>runaround.</b> President de la Madrid refused to cut foreign debt payments to use the money to help with the recovery effort. The government's response to the earthquake was widely criticized at various levels of Mexican society, being seen as both authoritarian and incompetent. As most of the collapsed buildings were of recent construction and public works projects, the government was seen at fault due to mismanagement and corruption in these constructions. The government itself realized that it could not handle the crisis alone through already-established institutions and decided to open the process up to [...] "opposition groups".|$|E
