A short-lived revival of the Farmer-Labor Party idea was scrapped under Browder's direction, and the New Deal coalition endorsed as the practical base upon which a People's Front could be constructed.

25|$|Although {{successful}} economically, Austro-Hungarian policy - {{which focused}} on advocating the ideal of a pluralist and multi-confessional Bosnian nation (largely favored by the Muslims) - failed to curb the <b>rising</b> <b>tides</b> <b>of</b> nationalism.

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} a monarch who took the Enlightenment project seriously was Joseph II of Austria, who ruled from 1780 to 1790 and implemented {{a wide array of}} radical reforms, such as the complete abolition of serfdom, the imposition of equal taxation policies between the aristocracy and the peasantry, the institution of religious toleration, including equal civil rights for Jews, and the suppression of Catholic religious authority throughout his empire, creating a more secular nation.

30|$|Water depth at the RS {{inside the}} Sundarbans is highly {{dependent}} on the tidal oscillation at the coast {{and to a lesser}} extent on the magnitude of freshwater inflows from upstream.

25|$|The <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> fascism {{during the}} late 1930s {{resulted}} in Mucha's works and his Slavic nationalism being denounced in the press as 'reactionary'. Mucha’s Slav nationalism and Jewish roots made him a primary target of the Gestapo during Nazi occupation. When German troops moved into Czechoslovakia {{during the spring of}} 1939, Mucha was among the first persons to be arrested by the Gestapo. During his interrogation, the aging artist became ill with pneumonia. Though released eventually, he may have been weakened by this event. He died in Prague on 14 July 1939, due to lung infection, and was interred there in the Vyšehrad cemetery.|$|E

5000|$|Great Britain and France also {{desired to}} ensure that the Ottoman Empire came out of the Peace of Paris {{stronger}} and able to keep {{the balance of power in}} Europe stable. Britain and France hoped that peace and restricting Russian access to key areas in the area, such as the Black Sea, would free up the limping Ottoman Empire to focus on internal issues such as <b>rising</b> <b>tides</b> <b>of</b> nationalism in many nations under Turkish authority. Without the Ottomans being in full control of their empire, the Great Powers feared that there could potentially be a mad grab for Turkish territory, strengthening nations that could pose a threat to the French and British. A strong Russia and German force, bolstered by the acquisition of lands from a decaying Ottoman Empire, scared them into desiring nothing more than protecting the [...] "Sick Man of Europe" [...] from further external stress. [...] Thus, full removal of Russian presence of the Danubian provinces and the Black Sea was necessary to protect British and dominance, as well as to weaken Russia.|$|R

50|$|The 1960s were {{a tumultuous}} time in Western culture, {{especially}} in Europe {{due to the}} severe restructuring necessary following the Post-World War II economic expansion and in the United States due to its controversial participation in both the Cold War and South East Asian political affairs with the Vietnam War, where the American role was perceived {{from a number of}} directions as prolonging the residual effects of decades of colonial patronizing in the Asian region by economically well-to-do European powers. This period was marked by a number of nascent social changes including a heightened sensitivity to the futility of war which sparked hundreds of protest marches and popular uprisings on a worldwide scale, <b>rising</b> <b>tides</b> <b>of</b> awareness concerning the need to change overwhelmingly negative race-relations in the United States, experimental drug use, the growth of television, a new genre in popular music, and a general shift away from the social normative of previous generations. Out of this era stemmed some of today's most powerful forces, such as the Internet. The Internet was created in large part by people cooperating, taking chances, and experimenting outside of corporate settings. Many of the individuals who were drawn to the technology in its infancy were activists and progressives. Some scholars and social theorists recognize that we are undergoing another cultural change brought about by the New Industrial Revolution. This Revolution is changing the way that products are made and disposed of, how buildings are constructed, and our relationship to the natural world and its capital.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of Austrian history, from the Austrian Empire, to Austria-Hungary, and the First and the Second Austrian Republics, several {{political}} parties and groups have expressed pan-German nationalist sentiment. National liberal and pan-Germanist parties have been termed the [...] "Third Camp" [...] (...) of Austrian politics, as they have traditionally been ranked behind mainstream Catholic conservatives and socialists. The Freedom Party of Austria, a far-right political party with representation in the Austrian parliament, has pan-Germanist roots.

One of Lon Nol's first priorities was to fix the ailing economy by halting the illegal sale of rice to the communists. Soldiers were dispatched to the rice-growing areas to forcibly collect the harvests at gunpoint, and they paid only the low government price. There was widespread unrest, especially in rice-rich Battambang Province, an area long-noted for the presence of large landowners, great disparity in wealth, and where the communists still had some influence.|$|E

40|$|Today {{there are}} more cities {{localized}} on our coastlines than ever before. Unfortunately, this fact poses an immediate danger due to the <b>rising</b> <b>tides</b> <b>of</b> our oceans.

Thus, by creating these types of cities, architects will lead the way {{to ensure the safety of}} the public and ultimately civilization itself. I believe the most feasible solution to these problems is for us to advance our civilizations onto the oceans. Moreover, the concept of designing static cities and buildings must evolve with the changing world or we as architects will be at fault for failing to design a survivable future. Within the last decade we have seen cities become the tombs of the innocent.

Therefore, the aim of this research is the creation of a self contained, independent and divergent architectural system capable of being entirely self-sustained within a mobile seafaring environment. Moreover, through the creation of a closed-loop mobile civilization, both our dependence on land and the impending crisis awaiting static structures will be significantly diminished.
