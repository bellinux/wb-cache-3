40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Detailed current {{profiles}} {{between the}} sediment-water interface and 20 cm above it reveal a viscous sublayer {{in the bottom}} boundary layer on the Oregon continental shelf. Data from three field experiments are used to test fundamental assumptions about boundary layer flow in the ocean. The first study, discussed in Chapter 1, evaluates the hypothesis that, {{in the absence of}} the obvious influence of topographic irregularities, the flow behaves like a universally similar, neutrally-buoyant flow over a smooth wall. The second study, discussed in Chapter 2, evaluates the influence which irregular small-scale topography may have on the near-bed flow, while the third, discussed in Chapter 3, examines streamwise velocity fluctuations in the viscous Sublayer and buffer layer and evaluates the hypothesis that spectra from the viscous sublayer and buffer layer of laboratory and geophysical boundary layer flows can be reduced to universal forms. although the thickness of the viscous sublayer scales with v/u, as required by universal similarity, the non-dimensional sublayer thickness is not as constant as in neutrally-buoyant laboratory flows. Even {{in the absence of the}} obvious effects of bottom irregularities, the near-bed flow is not as simple as smooth-walled boundarylayer flows in the laboratory. In the second study, it is shown that when the near-bed flow experiences <b>resistance</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> drag as well as skin friction, the constant stress boundary layer assumption is not valid close to the sediment-water interface. Th the third study, it is shown that non-dimensionalized spectra of streamwise velocity fluctuations in the viscous sublayer and buffer layer at the ocean floor are very similar to those found in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{constitutive}} model to predict shear force versus shear angle for a viscous textile composite sheet is developed, based on fibre volume fraction, textile architecture and matrix rheology. The model is evaluated using results obtained for a pre-consolidated 2 × 2 twill weave glass/polypropylene thermoplastic textile composite and a 5 -harness satin weave carbon/epoxy thermoset prepreg. The model {{is based on}} an adaptation of uniaxial continuum theory for continuous fibre-reinforced composites. Meso- and micro-kinematics of deformation are considered in determining contributions to energy dissipation during shear. Contributions from a number of sources are included, representing shearing of the matrix between and within tows and also at tow crossovers. The model can represent the effects on shear <b>resistance</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>forming</b> conditions (temperature and rate) through incorporation of the matrix rheology. As this is fundamentally a predictive modelling approach, it should facilitate the improved design of materials and optimisation of component manufacture...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: River Tapi is westward flowing {{river of}} peninsular India. The length of river is 724 km. The Central Water Commission India has numb er of gauging staion, gauge and {{discharge}} station and discharge measurement stations on it. The Ukai dam {{is one of}} the major multipurpose dam constructed on down stream side of Savkheda gauging station. One of the problems faced by this dam is progressive silting of the dam and <b>due</b> <b>to</b> that considerable reduction in the life of the dam. Therefore, it is essential to study transportation of sediments in the river. Bed load is a part of sediment transport. In the computation of bed load, shear stress is used. Part of the shear stress is wasted in overcoming the <b>resistance</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> bed <b>forms.</b> Therefore, the total shear stress developed in the open channel requires correction in the form of correction factor called ripple factor.

The variation of ripple factor with Boundary Reynolds number is studied for the three seasons of the year for the period of 15 years. In E.

40|$|Abstract. HfO 2 -added Si 3 N 4 {{ceramics}} {{are known}} to exhibit excellent high-temperature strength and excellent damage characteristics because HfO 2 assists the crystallization of the grain boundary phase. However, the sintering shrinkage behavior and mechanical properties of HfO 2 -added Si 3 N 4 have not been well clarified so far, {{although it has been}} reported that TiO 2, in which Ti is from the same group as Hf in the periodic table, enhances the densification of the Si 3 N 4 -Y 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -AlN system and wear <b>resistance</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> TiN <b>formed</b> from TiO 2 and AlN in the grain boundary. In the present study, we focus on HfO 2 as the sintering aid to investigate the sintering shrinkage behavior and mechanical properties of HfO 2 -added Si 3 N 4. The powder mixtures are prepared by the addition of HfO 2 to the Si 3 N 4 -Y 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 or Si 3 N 4 -Y 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -AlN system. The sintering shrinkage curves of HfO 2 -added Si 3 N 4 ceramics show rapid shrinkage at 1600 °C as compared with those of the Si 3 N 4 ceramics without HfO 2. The shrinkage can be explained by the formation of SiO 2 -Y 2 O 3 -HfO 2 derived liquid phases. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of HfO 2 -added Si 3 N 4 were as excellent as those of the Si 3 N 4 ceramics without HfO 2...|$|R

At present intensive investigations are carried out in aim of use of Al – Li in automotive industry in particular to components subject to fatigue wear.

In this article the results of heat treatment of Al-Zn-Mg-Li alloy were presented. During investigations optimum parameters (timetemperature) of the solution heat treatment were elaborated. Micro hardness on the cross-section were investigated. Phase, chemicalcomposition and morphology were determined. It was found that hardness after thermo-mechanical treatment of Al-Zn-Mg-Li is about 20 % higher than for AlCu 4 Mg 1 (7075 –T 6) alloy...|$|R

The ripple factor is obtained using Meyer Peter and Muller formula, Einstein Formula, Kalinske’s formula, Du Boy’s formula, Shield’s formula, Bagnold’s formula, average of six formulae and multiple regression analysis. The variation of ripple factor with particle Reynolds Number is studied. The ripple factor obtained by different approaches are further analyzed using Origin software and carrying out multiple regression on the 15 years of data with more than 10 parameters, ripple factor by multiple regression has been obtained. These values are further analysed and giving statistical mean to the parameters a relationship of power form has been developed. The ripple factor increases with the increase in the value of Particle Reynolds number. The large deviation is observed in case of Kalinske’s approach when compare with other approache...|$|R
