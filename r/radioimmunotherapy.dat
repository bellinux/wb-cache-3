5000|$|<b>Radioimmunotherapy</b> (RIT) uses an {{antibody}} {{labeled with}} a radionuclide to deliver cytotoxic radiation to a target cell. [...] In cancer therapy, an antibody with specificity for a tumor-associated antigen {{is used to}} deliver a lethal dose of radiation to the tumor cells. The ability for the antibody to specifically bind to a tumor-associated antigen increases the dose delivered to the tumor cells while decreasing the dose to normal tissues. By its nature, RIT requires a tumor cell to express an antigen that is unique to the neoplasm or is not accessible in normal cells.|$|E
50|$|In pretargeted <b>radioimmunotherapy,</b> two {{or three}} {{medications}} are applied in succession. At first, an antibody-drug conjugate is administered, which consists of a monoclonal antibody designed to target the tumour, and a chemical marker which {{in the case of}} DOTA-biotin therapy is one of the proteins avidin and streptavidin. After a time of typically one or two days to let the antibody accumulate in the tumour, a clearing agent may be given to eliminate residues of antibody that are still circulating in the bloodstream; this is especially done in humans. After a further waiting time, the radiotherapy (90Y-DOTA-biotin) is administered. Due to the high affinity of biotin to avidin and streptavidin, the radiotherapy accumulates where the antibody is, namely in the tumour, where it delivers its radioactivity.|$|E
5000|$|Immune-based {{therapy is}} {{dominated}} by the use of the rituximab monoclonal antibody, sold under the trade name Rituxan (or as Mabthera in Europe and Australia). Rituximab may have good activity against MCL as a single agent, but it is typically given in combination with chemotherapies, which prolongs response duration. There are newer variations on monoclonal antibodies combined with radioactive molecules known as <b>Radioimmunotherapy</b> (RIT). These include Zevalin and Bexxar. Rituximab has also been used in small numbers of patients in combination with thalidomide with some effect. [...] In contrast to these antibody-based 'passive' immunotherapies, the field of 'active' immunotherapy tries to activate a patient's immune system to specifically eliminate their own tumor cells. Examples of active immunotherapy include cancer vaccines, adoptive cell transfer, and immunotransplant, which combines vaccination and autologous stem cell transplant. Though no active immunotherapies are currently a standard of care, numerous clinical trials are ongoing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Repeated {{administration}} of antibody-based therapies such as <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> depends on preserved antigen expression in tumor lesions.

Findings 30 of the 35 Brown Norway rats with syngeneic colon carcinoma treated with 400 MBq/kg 177 Lu-DOTA-BR 96 exhibited consistent complete response of the primary tumor. 13 animals developed metastases that were detected after treatment. The antigen expression was reduced in 17 of 23 metastases detected after <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> compared with untreated tumors. No tumors completely lacked positively stained tumor cells.

40|$|Summary. <b>Radioimmunotherapy</b> {{has evolved}} from an {{attractive}} concept to implementation in clinical trials for evaluation of toxicity and efficacy. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a useful setting for evaluation of this novel form of therapy. Groups investigating <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are implementing single high doses and multiple smaller doses of beta emitters 1 - 131 and Y- 90 attached to antibodies. All groups giving mul-tiple small doses observe partial responses to treatment with variable hematopoietic toxicity. Single very high doses have yielded complete responses with hematologic toxicity requiring reinfusion of stored bone marrow.

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} evaluated 18 F-FDG PET/CT {{for monitoring}} {{the response of}} non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to <b>radioimmunotherapy.</b> Methods:A total of 33 clinical patients received 131 I-tositumomab (n 5 23) or 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (n 5 10) and underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans before <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> and at 12 wk after <b>radioimmunotherapy.</b> A third scan was performed on 13 patients at 24 wk after <b>radioimmunotherapy,</b> 12 of whom did not receive interval therapy. Tumor metabolic activity was assessed before and after <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> visually and quantitatively by lean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVlean max). Response was assessed by the International Workshop Criteria (IWC) and Revised IWC, which includes 18 F-FDG PET (IWC-PET). Results: Mean SUVlean max de-creased from baseline in 244 target lesions 12 wk after radioim-munotherapy (from 6. 51 6 4. 05 to 3. 94 6 4. 41; P, 0. 01), regardless of response at 12 wk after <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> (P # 0. 02). After <b>radioimmunotherapy,</b> SUVlean max was lower for responders than for nonresponders (P # 0. 01). Median per-centage change in SUVlean max of target lesions per patient was 251 % (295 % to 97 %). No significant difference in decline in SUVlean max between patients who received 131 I-tositumomab and those who received 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan was demon-strated (231 % 6 51 % vs. 247 % 6 46 %; P 5 0. 38). Patients with greater than a 52 % decline in SUVlean max tended toward longer survival (P 5 0. 09) than those with lesser declines. The 12 -wk overall response rate to <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> based on IWC was 42 % (14 / 33); complete response rate was 15 % (5 / 33). Eleven of 12 patients with progression at 12 wk had new dis-ease sites, and in 4 patients, new disease sites were the only sites of progression.

40|$|Radiotherapy is a {{successful}} treatment modality for localized cancer. Our group has been exploring radiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy (<b>radioimmunotherapy)</b> to enhance systemic antitumor responses. Previously, we have shown that when local radiotherapy was combined with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (that enable T-cell responses by engaging costimulation [anti (a) -CD 137] and blocking coinhibition [a-PD- 1], up to 100 % of mice bearing established syngeneic AT- 3 mammary tumors were cured, but single modality treatments were not curative. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to this <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> approach. We observed that inhibition of signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway during the first 10 days of treatment severely impaired the curative effect of <b>radioimmunotherapy,</b> {{at least in part}} by reducing MHC class I expression on tumor cells, reducing dendritic cell (DC) activation status and CD 8 + T-cell function. This data indicates that the efficacy of this type of <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> approach involves mTOR signaling and therefore, mTOR inhibitory drugs may impede the efficacy of similar <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> approaches in humans.

40|$|Purpose:The {{purpose of}} this studywas to analyze differentmechanisms (cell cycle synchronization, DNA damage, and apoptosis) that might {{underlie}} potential synergy between chemotherapy (paclitaxel or doxorubicin) and <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> with a radionuclides. Experimental Design:Threemultiplemyeloma cell lines (LP 1, RMI 8226, and U 266) were treatedwith 213 Bi-radiolabeledB-B 4, amonoclonal antibody that recognizes syndecan- 1 (CD 138) 24 hours after paclitaxel (1 nmol/L) or doxorubicin (10 nmol/L) treatment. Cell survivalwas assessed using a clonogenic survival assay. Cell cycle modifications were assessed by propidium iodide staining and DNA strand breaks by the comet assay. Level of apoptosis was determined by Apo 2. 7 staining. Results: Radiation enhancement ratio showed that paclitaxel and doxorubicin were synergistic with a <b>radioimmunotherapy.</b> After a 24 -hour incubation, paclitaxel and doxorubicinarrested all cell lines in the G 2 -M phase of the cell cycle. Doxorubicin combined with a <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> increased tail DNA in the RPMI 8226 cell line but not the LP 1 or U 266 cell lines compared with doxorubicin alone or a <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> alone. Neither doxorubicin nor paclitaxel combined with a <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> increased the level of apoptosis induced by either drug alone or a <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> alone. Conclusion: Both cell cycle arrest in the G 2 -M phase {{and an increase in}} DNA double-strand breaks could lead to radiosensitization of cells by doxorubicin or paclitaxel, but apoptosis would not be involved in radiosensitizationmechanisms.

40|$|<b>Radioimmunotherapy</b> has {{demonstrated}} efficacy with acceptable toxicity leading to approval in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, {{but has been}} slower to develop {{for the treatment of}} advanced solid tumors. Prostate cancer represents a good candidate for <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> based upon high exposure to circulating antibodies at common disease sites with a specific, highly expressed cell-surface antigen in prostate-specific membrane antigen. Four phase I and II trials utilizing 177 Lu- or 90 Y-J 591 have been reported. Long-term toxicity and chemotherapy administration was analyzed. As expected, the only serious toxicity observed was myelosuppression. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 33. 3 % without significant hemorrhage and grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 17. 3 % with 0. 07 % febrile neutropenia.

40|$|Background: To date, inefficient {{delivery}} of therapeutic doses of radionuclides to solid tumors limits the clinical utility of <b>radioimmunotherapy.</b> We aim {{to test the}} therapeutic utility of Yttrium- 90 (90 Y) -radio-conjugates of a monoclonal antibody, which we showed previously to bind specifically to the abundant intracellular La ribonucleoprotein revealed in dead tumor cells after DNA-damaging treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings: Immunoconjugates of the DAB 4 clone of the La-specific monoclonal antibody, APOMABH, were prepared using the metal chelator, 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraacetic acid (DOTA), and then radiolabeled with 90 Y. Mice bearing established subcutaneous tumors were treated with 90 Y-DOTA-DAB 4 alone or after chemotherapy.

Radiosensitizing cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy was used for the syngeneic Lewis Lung carcinoma (LL 2) model, and for the xenograft models of LNCaP prostatic carcinoma and Panc- 1 pancreatic carcinoma. We demonstrate the safety, specificity, and efficacy of 90 Y-DOTA-DAB 4 -radioimmunotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy.

40|$|Triple-negative {{breast cancer}} (TNBC) is {{associated}} with poor survival. Chemotherapy is the only standard treatment for TNBC. The prevalence of BRCA 1 inactivation in TNBC has rationalized clinical trials of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Similarly, the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rationalized anti-EGFR therapies in this disease. However, clinical trials using these 2 strategies have not reached their promise. In this study, we used EGFR as a target for <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> and hypothesized that EGFR-directed <b>radioimmunotherapy</b> can deliver a continuous lethal radiation dose to residual tumors that are radiosensitized by PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy. Methods: We analyzed EGFR messenger RNA in published gene expression array studies and investigated EGFR protein expression by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of breast cancer patients to confirm EGFR as a target in TNBC. Preclinically, using orthotopic and metastatic xenograft models of EGFR-positive TNBC, we investigated {{the effect of the}} novel combination of 177 Lulabeled anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, chemotherapy, and PARP inhibitors on cell death and the survival of breast cancer stem cells.
