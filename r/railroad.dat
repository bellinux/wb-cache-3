5|$|After {{years of}} feuding, the Western <b>Railroad</b> {{joined with the}} Boston and Worcester <b>Railroad</b> in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany <b>Railroad</b> (B). The Housatonic <b>Railroad</b> was {{acquired}} by the New York, New Haven and Hartford <b>Railroad</b> (NYNH) as its Berkshire Division in 1892, with most service thus running from Danbury rather than Bridgeport. In 1900, the New York Central <b>Railroad</b> (NYC) leased the B, though the latter retained its independent identity for decades after. The B operated a rail yard and roundhouse just north of Union Station.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{also has}} {{significant}} history with rail transport, as {{the location of}} two major regional <b>railroad</b> headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at {{what is now the}} SUNY System Administration Building. In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central <b>Railroad</b> (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson <b>Railroad,</b> which was the first <b>railroad</b> in the state and the first successful steam <b>railroad</b> running regularly scheduled service in the country.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Kepple, {{one of the}} {{original}} Altoona & Wopsononock directors, was elected president of the newly organized company. The board remained largely unchanged, although Shellenberger finally severed his association with the <b>railroad.</b> It remained unprofitable, and Davis, in turn, sold the line to Sigmund Morris, of Altoona. Morris had incorporated the Altoona Northern <b>Railroad</b> on November 7, 1912 to acquire the line, and the Altoona, Juniata and Northern was merged into it on January 16, 1913. Morris planned to convert the <b>railroad</b> to , electrify it to make it an interurban, and extend it to connect with the Beech Creek <b>Railroad</b> (a subsidiary of the New York Central <b>Railroad)</b> at Patton. However, Morris was unable to execute these plans. A group of New York City investors took over the <b>railroad</b> about 1916. They converted the <b>railroad</b> to standard gauge, operating initially with ex-Pennsylvania <b>Railroad</b> 2-6-0s, but replacing them with Heislers when the 2-6-0s were found to be unsuitable for the track.|$|E
5|$|Ayer {{has been}} a major <b>railroad</b> {{interchange}} since the Fitchburg <b>Railroad</b> opened through South Groton in 1845, followed by the Stony Brook <b>Railroad,</b> Worcester and Nashua <b>Railroad,</b> and Peterborough and Shirley <b>Railroad</b> in 1848. The original depot was replaced with a union station with a large trainshed in 1848. Land speculation and industrial development spurred by the <b>railroad</b> access expanded the tiny farm village into the independent town of Ayer.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western <b>Railroad</b> {{continued}} {{the project of}} eliminating at-grade crossings between streets and railroads, the Montclair Branch was the next to receive the structural change. Bloomfield criticized the Lackawanna <b>railroad</b> for making a disgrace of the community. The <b>railroad</b> proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing the <b>railroad</b> came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by the <b>railroad</b> and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} the <b>railroad.</b> The park land cost the township $50,000 to buy for the construction, and it was to be turned over to the Essex County Park Commission.|$|E

The new <b>railroad</b> lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large <b>railroad</b> companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|<b>Railroad</b> {{stations}} have been located in downtown Pittsfield since the Western <b>Railroad</b> opened in 1841.

The New Haven <b>Railroad</b> and New York Central <b>Railroad</b> moved to smaller depots in 1960 and 1965, and Union Station was demolished in 1968. Rail service to Pittsfield ended in 1971 but returned in 1975 {{and moved to a}} new shelter downtown in 1981.

5|$|The HSRC {{continued}} to operate this rail line until December 11, 1911, {{when it was}} purchased by the Moorefield and Virginia <b>Railroad</b> Company. The Moorefield and Virginia <b>Railroad</b> Company assumed the $700,000 mortgage against the rail line. Cornwell and Eugene Ailes, the son-in-law of his brother John Jacob, served as officers of the conveyancing company for the transaction. The Moorefield and Virginia <b>Railroad</b> Company subsequently transferred the rail line to the Baltimore and Ohio <b>Railroad</b> Company in November 1913.|$|E
5|$|The New York City & Northern <b>Railroad</b> (later the Putnam Division of the New York Central <b>Railroad)</b> {{was built}} in 1880, {{effectively}} separating the park site into two parts. Its two stops in the Bronx were in the park itself, and at Kingsbridge to the south; after Kingsbridge, the <b>railroad</b> merged with the present-day Hudson Line of the Metro-North <b>Railroad.</b> The line had two tracks between the Hudson Line junction and the Van Cortlandt station, north of which the tracks merged into one.
