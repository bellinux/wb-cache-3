40|$|Nonlinear state {{estimation}} {{plays a major}} role in many real-life applications. Recently, some sigma-point filters, such as the unscented Kalman filter, the particle filter, or the cubature Kalman filter have been proposed as promising substitutes for the conventional extended Kalman filter. For multisensor fusion, the information form of the Kalman filter is preferred over standard covariance filters due to its simpler measurement update stage. This paper presents a new {{state estimation}} algorithm called the square root cubature information filter (SRCIF) for nonlinear systems. The cubature information filter is first derived from an extended information filter and a recently developed cubature Kalman filter. For numerical accuracy, its square <b>root</b> <b>version</b> is then developed.

To avoid Jacobian matrix computation and scaling parameter adjustment, improve numerical stability, and acquire more accurate estimated results for centralized nonlinear tracking, a novel centralized multi-sensor square root cubature joint probabilistic data association algorithm (CMSCJPDA) is proposed. Firstly, the multi-sensor tracking problem is decomposed into several single-sensor multi-target tracking problems, which are sequentially processed during the estimation. Then, in each sensor, the assignment of its measurements to target tracks is accomplished {{on the basis of}} joint probabilistic data association (JPDA), and a weighted probability fusion method with square <b>root</b> <b>version</b> of a cubature Kalman filter (SRCKF) is utilized to estimate the targets’ state. With the measurements in all sensors processed CMSCJPDA is derived and the global estimated state is achieved.

40|$|Several {{non-linear}} {{state estimation}} {{methods such as}} extended Kalman filter, cubature Kalman filter, and unscented Kalman filter are used to track objects in visual sensor networks. These conventional non-linear state estimation methods require the accurate knowledge of the object's initial conditions, process and measurement models, and corresponding noise characteristics. Often, the object trackers used in a visual sensor networks may not be provided with this knowledge. In this work, we propose a square root cubature H¿ information Kalman filter (SCHIF) based distributed object tracking algorithm. The H¿ method requires neither the exact knowledge of noise characteristic nor accurate process model. The information filters can be used without the knowledge of accurate initial conditions and it also makes the measurement update step computationally less complex in the distributed process. Finally, the square <b>root</b> <b>version</b> makes the filter numerically stable. Furthermore, the cameras in the network exchange their local estimates with other cameras.

Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is the type of filter, which is designed in order to overrun this problem.

3000|$|To {{overcome}} the drawbacks of EKF, many derivatives of KF {{have been proposed}} to date, the most popular one being the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) [34]. UKF belongs to a family of Kalman-like filters, called the sigma Point Kalman filters (SPKFs) [35]. SPKF addresses the issues of EKF for nonlinear estimation problems by using the approach of numerical integration. The dynamic system is again considered Gaussian, and thus one can identify that the prediction/update recursion can {{be transformed into a}} numerical evaluation of the involved integrals in the Bayesian recursion [36]. Then, only estimates of mean and covariance of predicted/update distributions are necessary and the integrals are numerically evaluated by a minimal set of deterministically chosen weighted sample points, called the sigma points. The nonlinear function is then approximated by performing statistical linear regression between these points. This approach of weighted statistical linear regression takes into account the uncertainty (i.e., probabilistic spread) of the prior random variable. Besides UKF, various other SPKFs such as quadrature Kalman filter (QKF) [37, 38] and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) [39] have been proposed and the choice among these filters depending upon various factors such as the degree of nonlinearity, order of system state, required accuracy, etc. Moreover, computationally efficient and numerically stable variants of these filters have also been proposed by means of the square <b>root</b> <b>version</b> of QKF and CKF.

40|$|State {{estimation}} is {{a process}} of estimating the unmeasured or noisy states using the measured outputs and control inputs along with process and measurement models. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been an important approach for nonlinear state estimation over the last five decades. However, EKFs are only suitable for ‘mild’ nonlinearities where the first-order approximations of the nonlinear functions are available and they also require evaluation of state and measurement Jacobians at every iteration. This thesis presents a few linear and nonlinear state estimation methods and their applications. To start with, we investigate the use of the linear H∞ filter, which can deal with non-Gaussian noises, in a control application. The efficacy of the linear H∞ filter based sliding mode controller is verified on a quadruple tank system. The main tools for nonlinear state estimation are cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and its variants. A solution to simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem using CKF is proposed. The effectiveness of the nonlinear CKF-SLAM over EKF- and UKF-SLAM is demonstrated. We propose a couple of new nonlinear state estimation algorithms, namely, cubature information filters (CIFs) and cubature H∞ filters (CH∞Fs), and their square root versions. The CIF is derived from an extended information filter and a CKF. The CIF is further extended for use in multi-sensor state estimation and its square <b>root</b> <b>version</b> is derived using a unitary transformation. For non-linear and non-Gaussian systems, we fuse an extended H∞ filter and CKF to form CH∞F which has the desirable features of both CKF and an extended H∞ filter.

40|$|During my {{internship}} at NASA Johnson Space Center, I {{worked in}} the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), where I was tasked {{with a number of}} projects focused on the automation of tasks and activities related to the operation of the International Space Station (ISS). As I worked on a number of projects, I have written short sections below to give a description for each, followed by more general remarks on the internship experience. My first project is titled "General Exposure Representation EVADOSE", also known as "GEnEVADOSE". This project involved the design and development of a C++/ ROOT framework focused on radiation exposure for extravehicular activity (EVA) planning for the ISS. The utility helps mission managers plan EVAs by displaying information on the cumulative radiation doses that crew will receive during an EVA {{as a function of the}} egress time and duration of the activity. SRAG uses a utility called EVADOSE, employing a model of the space radiation environment in low Earth orbit to predict these doses, as while outside the ISS the astronauts will have less shielding from charged particles such as electrons and protons. However, EVADOSE output is cumbersome to work with, and prior to GEnEVADOSE, querying data and producing graphs of ISS trajectories and cumulative doses versus egress time required manual work in Microsoft Excel. GEnEVADOSE automates all this work, reading in EVADOSE output file(s) along with a plaintext file input by the user providing input parameters. GEnEVADOSE will output a text file containing all the necessary dosimetry for each proposed EVA egress time, for each specified EVADOSE file. It also plots cumulative dose versus egress time and the ISS trajectory, and displays all of this information in an auto-generated presentation made in LaTeX. New features have also been added, such as best-case scenarios (egress times corresponding to the least dose), interpolated curves for trajectories, and the ability to query any time in the EVADES output. As mentioned above, GEnEVADOSE makes extensive use of <b>ROOT</b> <b>version</b> 6, the data analysis framework developed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), and the code is written to the C++ 11 standard (as are the other projects). My second project is the Automated Mission Reference Exposure Utility (AMREU). Unlike GEnEVADOSE, AMREU is a combination of three frameworks written in both Python and C++, also making use of ROOT (and PyROOT). Run as a combination of daily and weekly cron jobs, these macros query the SRAG database system to determine the active ISS missions, and query minute-by-minute radiation dose information from ISS-TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter), one of the radiation detectors onboard the ISS. Using this information, AMREU creates a corrected data set of daily radiation doses, addressing situations where TEPC may be offline or locked up by correcting doses for days with less than 95 % live time (the total amount time the instrument acquires data) by averaging the past 7 days. As not all errors may be automatically detectable, AMREU also allows for manual corrections, checking an updated plaintext file each time it runs. With the corrected data, AMREU generates cumulative dose plots for each mission, and uses a Python script to generate a flight note file (. docx format) containing these plots, as well as information sections to be filled in and modified by the space weather environment officers with information specific to the week. AMREU is set up to run without requiring any user input, and it automatically archives old flight notes and information files for missions that are no longer active. My other projects involve cleaning up a large data set from the Charged Particle Directional Spectrometer (CPDS), joining together many different data sets in order to clean up information in SRAG SQL databases, and developing other automated utilities for displaying information on active solar regions, that may be used by the space weather environment officers to monitor solar activity. I consulted my mentor Dr. Ryan Rios and Dr. Kerry Lee for project requirements and added features, and ROOT developer Edmond Offermann for advice on using the ROOT library. I also received advice and feedback from Dr. Janet Barzilla of SRAG, who tested my code. Besides these inputs, I worked independently, writing all of the code by myself. The code for all these projects is documented throughout, and I have attempted to write it in a modular format. Assuming that ROOT is updated accordingly, these codes are also Y 2038 -compliant (and Y 10 K-compliant). This allows the code to be easily referenced, modified and possibly repurposed for non-ISS missions in the future, should the necessary inputs exist. These projects have taught me a lot about coding and software design - I have become a much more skilled C++ programmer and ROOT user, and I also learned to code in Python and PyROOT (and its advantages and disadvantages compared to C++/ ROOT). Furthermore, I have learned about space radiation and radiation modeling, topics that greatly interest me as I pursue a degree in physics. Working alongside experimental physicists like Dr. Rios, I have developed a greater understanding and appreciation for experimental science, something I have always leaned towards but to which I lacked significant exposure. My work in SRAG has also given me the invaluable opportunity to witness the work environment for physicists at NASA, and what a career in academia may look like at a government laboratory such as NASA Johnson Space Center. As I continue my studies and look forward to graduate school and a future career, this experience at NASA has given me a meaningful and enjoyable opportunity to put my skills to use and see what my future career path might hold...|$|E
