5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on <b>racial</b> <b>issues</b> because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{caused a}} major change in the government's {{approach}} to <b>racial</b> <b>issues,</b> and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.|$|E

5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady {{at the time}} for her outspokenness, particularly her stance on <b>racial</b> <b>issues.</b> She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E
5|$|Despite his administration's scandals, Grant {{continued}} to be personally popular. His reelection was supported by Frederick Douglas and other prominent abolitionists along with reformers of the Indian question. A growing number of political reformers, however, were disappointed by the Gold Ring, Grant's support of Reconstruction, and corruption in the New York Customs House. To placate them, Grant created a Civil Service Commission authorized by Congress in 1871. The Commission, chaired by reformer George William Curtis, proposed reformist rules and regulations, which Grant implemented by executive order in April 1872, Congress appropriating funds in May. Congress stopped funding the Commission in December 1875, having refused to pass legislation to implement its recommendations. There was further intraparty division between the faction most concerned with {{the plight of the}} freedmen, and the faction concerned with the growth of industry and small government. During the war, both factions' interests had aligned, and in 1868 both had supported Grant. As the wartime coalition began to fray, Grant's alignment with the party's pro-Reconstruction elements alienated party leaders who favored an end to federal intervention in Southern <b>racial</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E
5|$|Willkie warned Republicans {{that only}} a full {{commitment}} to equal rights for minorities would woo African Americans back to the party, and he criticized Roosevelt for yielding to Southern racists among the Democrats. Willkie addressed a convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1942, {{one of the most}} prominent politicians to do so up to that point. He urged integration of the armed forces, and when a violent race riot broke out in Detroit in June 1943, he went on national radio in order to criticize both parties for ignoring <b>racial</b> <b>issues.</b> When the movie hearings of 1941 ended without further action, Willkie had been made chairman of the board of Twentieth-Century Fox. In 1943, he worked with Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP, to try to convince Hollywood to give blacks better treatment in films. Movie moguls promised changes, and some films featured blacks in major roles, but faced with objections from white Southerners, they reverted to giving blacks stereotyped roles after Willkie's death in 1944, such as servants. After his death, the NAACP named its headquarters the Wendell Willkie Memorial Building.|$|E
50|$|Left to {{sort out}} the issue is the school's African-American principal, Robert Rees, who has only held the {{position}} a few months, and Coral Bryson the specialist in charge of Kai's Individualized Education Program. Complicating the already tedious <b>racial</b> <b>issue</b> is Kai's adoptive parents, Aaron and Nancy Goldman, who are Jewish.|$|R

25|$|Zicree's {{original}} {{pitch for}} the episode featured Jake Sisko {{as the main}} character, and did not deal directly with <b>racial</b> <b>issues.</b> Zicree originally patterned the Bashir/Kira characters on Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore, and the O'Brien character on Isaac Asimov.|$|E
50|$|A major <b>racial</b> <b>issue</b> in {{this case}} is the concern {{surrounding}} pretext stops. It is believed by profiling a potential suspect gets rid of the need for wrongdoing, violating the Equal Protections Clause. In 1999, United States v. Armstrong shed further light on this issue. It showed that all arrests for crack cocaine in Washington D.C. were African Americans.|$|R

In 1829, Mier y Teran issued his report, which concluded that most Anglo Americans refused to be naturalized and tried to isolate themselves from Mexicans. He also noted that slave reforms passed by the state were being ignored.|$|E

By 1877 Small had returned to the Constitution and resumed his column.|$|E
5000|$|Sanders {{made the}} Yankees' Opening Day roster for the 1990 season. On May 22, 1990, Sanders became {{involved}} in a dispute with Chicago White Sox' catcher Carlton Fisk. Sanders started by stepping {{up to the plate}} with one out and a runner on third, drawing a dollar sign in the dirt before the pitch and then failed to run to first base after hitting a routine pop fly to shortstop, trotting back to the dugout instead. The Yankee fans booed, and Fisk told Sanders to [...] "run the fucking ball out" [...] and called Sanders a [...] "piece of shit." [...] Later in the game, Sanders told Fisk that [...] "the days of slavery are over." [...] Fisk was furious. [...] "He comes up and wants to make it a <b>racial</b> <b>issue,</b> there's no <b>racial</b> <b>issue</b> involved. There is a right way and a wrong way to play this game." ...|$|R

She was also active in HIV/AIDS causes.|$|E
25|$|The {{first time}} Barry noticed <b>racial</b> <b>issues</b> {{was when he}} had to walk to school while the white {{students}} were assigned a schoolbus to ride. The schools were segregated, as were public facilities. He had a number of jobs as a child, including picking cotton, delivering and selling newspapers, and bagging groceries. While in high school, Barry worked as a waiter at the American Legion post and, at age 17, earned the rank of eagle scout.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{contend that}} postracial beliefs complicate the show by only {{visualizing}} {{people of color}} at work and rarely in their homes or {{from their point of}} view. Several writers have argued that the show distorts history by not showing black admen, noting real-life successful African American advertising executives who got their start in the 1960s such as Clarence Holte, Georg Olden, and Caroline Robinson Jones. Latoya Peterson, writing in Slates Double X, argued that Mad Men was glossing over <b>racial</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E
50|$|By 1965, both {{liberals and}} segregationists in the Mississippi higher {{education}} community {{began to work}} toward integration. The Colvard administration was moderate for its time and place. In 1963, Dr. Colvard had been courageous enough to send his regional champion basketball team to the integrated NCAA championships, rejecting the desire by the white state political establishment {{to keep them out}} of the games because of <b>racial</b> <b>issue.</b> In 1965, Colvard, his staff, and the faculty were seeking a path to peaceful integration.|$|R
50|$|Bollaín {{sets the}} film during the Spanish {{property}} bubble {{to reflect the}} issues and consequences that even today directly affect Spanish society. Flowers from Another World analyses not only the <b>racial</b> <b>issue</b> but also {{the role of women}} at that time. This can even be compared to other similar cases in which women start a movement for social integration, {{as in the case of}} the Mexican immigrant women in the United States. Everything is portrayed through the figures of the three women who star in this story.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, the {{connotation}} {{of black}} to the <b>racial</b> <b>issue</b> became {{a point of}} pride to the native Africans. It used to be sold with the motto, [...] "America's Lusty, Lively Beer", perhaps in reference to Canada, though it is seldom seen in the United States. The motto came from an older advertising campaign in the United States. Another famous Afrikaans slogan for Black Label in South Africa is, [...] "Black Label sê die bybel", which means [...] "The Bible says (one should drink) Black Label." ...|$|R

Critics praised the cast, 1970s style, music, and approach to <b>racial</b> <b>issues,</b> while its pacing and some writing was viewed {{as some of the}} series' shortcomings. The season won several awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award. A second season of Luke Cage was ordered on December 3, 2016.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{a retired}} Chief Thompson {{declared}} {{the merger of}} the EMS and firefighting departments a failure. He blamed <b>racial</b> <b>issues</b> in part, noting that firefighters are primarily white and EMS personnel mostly African American and that white firefighters have little respect for the mostly black and poor people they provide emergency care to. Kenneth Lyons, president of the paramedics' union, agreed with Thompson's assessment but also emphasized that management failures and budgetary problems played a role. Retired Fire Chief Dennis L. Rubin (Thompson's successor) dismissed this analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Tightening {{immigration}} laws, {{as well as}} {{notions of}} [...] "zero immigration", reflected national views that arose within the discussion around immigrant family reunification and national identity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to conduct a bibliographical review in order to recover the {{classical}} discussion about social class, race, ideology of the whitening/blackening and the issue of individual success. From the 70 s on, with the rising of the organized black movements, improvements in the struggle against racism and racial prejudice and discrimination occur. However, difficulties in assuming the <b>racial</b> <b>issue</b> as a real problem which needs to be faced by the Brazilian society, still exist. If this facing problem does not happen, the social differences based on racism will continue to exist and with a tendency to incitement, specially when it is concerned with equality of opportunities...|$|R
