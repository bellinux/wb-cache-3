5000|$|As other countries, {{especially}} Mexico and Cuba, {{developed their}} own <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> <b>services,</b> the need arose to standardize engineering practices, reduce interference, and more fairly distribute clear channel assignments. Moreover, the development of better frequency control, and especially directional antennas, {{made it possible for}} additional stations to operate on the same or close by frequencies without significantly increasing interference. A key objective for the United States was that, in exchange for receiving clear channel assignments, Mexico would eliminate the high-powered English-language [...] "border blaster" [...] stations that had been directing their programming toward the U.S. and causing significant interference to U.S. and Canadian stations. However, an initial international meeting held in Mexico City in the summer of 1933 failed, primarily {{due to a lack of}} agreement over how many clear channel frequencies would be assigned to Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, in Colombia {{there are}} neither rules nor {{agreements}} that regulate transmobile and broadcasting sound services in its borders. This paper aims {{to justify the}} need to regulate these services through a study in three border areas: Ipiales-Tulcán (Ecuador); Puerto CarreñoPuerto Ayacucho (Venezuela) and Leticia-Tabatinga (Brazil) -Santa Rosa (Peru), to identify possible scenarios of interference from neighboring countries to Colombia. In this context, we performed simulations with the software Radio Mobile to assess {{the magnitude of the}} interference. The results show cases of interference between mobile and fixed services, which require control because they could potentially affect communications to the safety and emergency care of people. This also hinders the process for allocating spectrum and screening of new channels for <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> <b>services</b> and transmobile...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{and expansion of}} FM <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> <b>services</b> in Australia was a long, difficult process, marked by planning and policy blunders. Attesting this fact, two regional cities in Western Australia have experienced a lack of adequate and comprehensive commercial broadcasting services. The city of Geraldton has an oversupply of commercial radio services, leading to poor quality programming. The similarly sized city of Bunbury is not serviced by commercial FM radio at all, due to an error in planning television services in the early 1960 s. The intention {{of the study is}} to examine the policy paradigms which evolved from the process. Underpinned by Cultural Studies methodology, this dissertation analyses the competing policy discourses, and the failure of policy itself that bought about the above situations. The paper concludes that a lack of clear, and comprehensive policy guidelines when introducing FM radio led to the situation, which was continuing at the time this research was conducted...|$|E
40|$|The {{interference}} with existing <b>radio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> <b>services</b> because of unintentional radiation {{is a serious}} problem in power-line communication (PLC) systems. A radiation detection method based on burst packets, which had been proposed by the authors and was called scan and sum (SAS) method, was a low cost method and used to solve the problem. But its measurement took a long time and the burst packets occupied a channel. To shorten the measurement time, a new method based on periodic packets has been proposed in this paper, which is called periodic packet sound (PPS) method. Although both methods record the radiated signal as a sound data, the PPS does not need to scan the frequency of an AM radio receiver but analyses the sound data by a cross-correlation operation with a reference signal. First, how to generate the reference signal that depends on the modems is described. Second, an optimization of the packet size is studied, and finally it is shown that the detection sensitivity of PPS was maintained to be the same as SAS while the measurement time of PPS was 1 / 9 shorter than that of SAS. Moreover, the channel occupation of PPS was reduced to be 2...|$|E
