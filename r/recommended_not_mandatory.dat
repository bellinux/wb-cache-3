40|$|Purpose: The {{added value}} of {{baseline}} {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) scans in therapy evaluation in malignant lymphoma is unclear. In guidelines, baseline PET is <b>recommended</b> but <b>not</b> <b>mandatory</b> except in lymphoma types with variable fluoro-D-glucose uptake. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the hypothesis that adding baseline PET information decreases false positive readings with posttreatment PET and improves observer agreement. Methods: Forty-four patients (mean age 56 years, standard deviation 14) with malignant lymphoma were included. Two nuclear medicine physicians retrospectively and independently evaluated the posttreatment PET, 3 weeks later followed by paired reading of baseline and posttreatment PET. For each PET, 22 regions were classified as positive, negative, or equivocal, resulting in an overall PET score of positive, unclear, or negative. In case of discrepancies, consensus was reached. Results: Addition of baseline to posttreatment PET evaluation affected the classification of metabolic response in 34 % of malignant lymphoma patients treated with first-line chemotherapy. In one out of seven patients, addition of the baseline PET lead to opposite conclusions (95 % confidence interval 4 – 14). False positivity was reduced by adding the baseline scan information, bu...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRoot cause {{analysis}} (RCA) is a {{recommended practice}} in retrospectives and cause–effect diagram (CED) is a commonly recommended technique for RCA. Our {{objective is to}} evaluate whether CED improves the outcome and perceived utility of RCA. We conducted a controlled experiment with 11 student software project teams by using a single factor paired design {{resulting in a total}} of 22 experimental units. Two visualization techniques of underlying causes were compared: CED and a structural list of causes. We used the output of RCA, questionnaires, and group interviews to compare the two techniques. In our results, CED increased the total number of detected causes. CED also increased the links between causes, thus, suggesting more structured analysis of problems. Furthermore, the participants perceived that CED improved organizing and outlining the detected causes. The implication of our results is that using CED in the RCA of retrospectives is <b>recommended,</b> yet, <b>not</b> <b>mandatory</b> as the groups also performed well with the structural list. In addition to increased number of detected causes, CED is visually more attractive and preferred by retrospective participants, even though it is somewhat harder to read and requires specific software tools...|$|R

50|$|However, this {{rejection}} {{of the doctrine of}} original sin or the necessity of salvation is not something that most conservative or evangelical Quakers affiliated with Friends United Meeting or Evangelical Friends Church International tend to agree with. Although the more conservative and evangelical Quakers also believe in the doctrine of Inward light, they interpret it {{in a manner consistent with}} the doctrine of original sin, namely, that people may or may not listen to the voice of God within them and be saved, and people who do not listen will not be saved, thus there cannot be any universal reconciliation under the more conservative Quaker theology. Many more liberal Quaker meetings have no official creed and allow individual Quakers to have a wide variety of different beliefs, although following the recommendations of one's yearly meeting's Faith and Practice book is strongly <b>recommended</b> even though <b>not</b> <b>mandatory.</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{literature}} suggests that a high prevalence {{of a history of}} sexual and physical abuse among psychiatric inpatients is found when researchers inquire about abuse directly, but that relatively low rates are found in medical records. This study examined rates of reported abuse among patients who were and were not asked about abuse at admission. METHODS: The medical records of 100 consecutive admissions to an urban general hospital in New Zealand were examined after the introduction of a new admission form with a section inquiring about abuse. Use of the new admission form was <b>recommended</b> but <b>not</b> <b>mandatory.</b> RESULTS: The abuse section of the new form was completed for only 17 of the 53 patients with whom the new form was used. Review of the medical records of all 100 consecutive admissions revealed a prevalence rate of 32 percent for {{one or more of the}} four types of abuse. However, 14 of the 17 patients (82 percent) who were asked directly about abuse reported having experienced abuse. Nonsignificant trends suggested that male gender and being more disturbed or disturbing may be negatively related to the probability of being asked about abuse. Men may be particularly unlikely to disclose childhood abuse if not asked directly. CONCLUSIONS: The authors recommend including inquiry about abuse in standardized admission procedures and providing inpatient staff with training in how and when to ask patients about abuse and how to effectively follow up affirmative responses...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{evaluation}} of CO 2 -EOR projects has been developed. This model includes both reservoir simulation to handle reservoir properties, fluid flow and injection and production schedules, and a numerical economic model that generates a monthly cash flow stream from the outputs of the reservoir model. This model is general enough to be used with any project and provide a solid common basis to all of them. This model was used to evaluate CO 2 -EOR injection and production strategies and develop an optimization workflow. Producer constraints (maximum oil and gas production rates) should be optimized first to generate a reference case. Further improvements can then be obtained by optimizing the injection starting date and the injection plateau rate. Investigation of sensitivity of CO 2 -EOR to the presence of an aquifer showed that CO 2 injection can limit water influx in the reservoir and is beneficial to recovery, even with a strong water drive. The influence of some key parameters was evaluated: the producer should be completed in the top part of the reservoir, while the injector should be completed over the entire thickness; it is <b>recommended</b> but <b>not</b> <b>mandatory</b> that the injection should start as early as possible to allow for lower water cut limit. Finally, the sensitivity of the economics of the projects to some key parameters was evaluated. The most influent parameter is by far the oil price, but other parameters such as the CO 2 source to field distance, the pipeline cost scenario, the CO 2 source type or the CO 2 market price have roughly the same influence. It is therefore possible to offset an increase of one of them by reducing another...|$|R
40|$|Several R {{packages}} {{exist for}} the detection of differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. The analysis process includes three main steps, namely normalization, dispersion estimation and test for differential expression. Quality control steps along this process are <b>recommended</b> but <b>not</b> <b>mandatory,</b> and failing to check the characteristics of the dataset may lead to spurious results. In addition, normalization methods and statistical models are not exchangeable across the packages without adequate transformations the users are often not aware of. Thus, dedicated analysis pipelines are needed to include systematic quality control steps and prevent errors from misusing the proposed methods. SARTools is an R pipeline for differential analysis of RNA-Seq count data. It can handle designs involving two or more conditions of a single biological factor with or without a blocking factor (such as a batch effect or a sample pairing). It is based on DESeq 2 and edgeR and is composed of an R package and two R script templates (for DESeq 2 and edgeR respectively). Tuning a small number of parameters and executing one of the R scripts, users have access to the full results of the analysis, including lists of differentially expressed genes and a HTML report that (i) displays diagnostic plots for quality control and model hypotheses checking and (ii) keeps track of the whole analysis process, parameter values and versions of the R packages used. SARTools provides systematic quality controls of the dataset as well as diagnostic plots that help to tune the model parameters. It gives access to the main parameters of DESeq 2 and edgeR and prevents untrained users from misusing some functionalities of both packages. By keeping track of all the parameters of the analysis process it fits the requirements of reproducible research...|$|R
