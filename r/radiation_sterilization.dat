40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{morbidity}} and mortality from malaria and dengue fever among other pathogens are an increasing Public Health problem.

There are insufficient specific therapeutic drugs available and there are no reliable vaccines for malaria or dengue, although some progress has been achieved, there {{is still a long way}} between its development and actual field use. Most mosquito control measures have failed to achieve their goals, mostly because of the mosquito's great reproductive capacity and genomic flexibility. Chemical control is increasingly restricted due to potential human toxicity, mortality in no target organisms, insecticide resistance, and other environmental impacts. Other strategies for mosquito control are desperately needed. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a species-specific and environmentally benign method for insect population suppression, it is based on mass rearing, <b>radiation</b> mediated <b>sterilization,</b> and release of a large number of male insects. Releasing of Insects carrying a dominant lethal gene (RIDL) offers a solution to many of the drawbacks of traditional SIT that have limited its application in mosquitoes while maintaining its environmentally friendly and species-specific utility.

They also are closer to field use, so might be appropriate to consider first.

40|$|Pupae of the Queensland {{fruit fly}} or Q-fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) are {{irradiated}} routinely to induce reproductive sterility in adults {{for use in}} sterile insect technique programmes. Previous studies suggest that adult sexual performance and survival under nutritional and crowding stress are compromised by the current target dose of <b>radiation</b> for <b>sterilization</b> (70 - 75 Gy), and that improved mating propensity and survival under stress by irradiated males may be achieved by reducing the target sterilization dose without reducing the level of induced sterility. This {{raises the question of}} the amount by which the irradiation dose can be reduced before residual fertility becomes unacceptable. The present study measures the levels of residual fertility in male and female irradiated Q-flies at different irradiation doses (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 Gy), and investigates the possibility that fecundity and fertility increase between 10 - 15 and 30 - 35 days post emergence. Male flies require a higher dose than females to induce sterility, with no residual fertility found in females irradiated at doses of 50 Gy or above, and no residual fertility found in males irradiated at doses of 60 Gy or above. Irradiated females are more fecund at 30 - 35 days post emergence than at 10 - 15 days. However, fertility does not increase between 10 and 15 days post emergence and 30 - 35 days, even at doses below 50 Gy.

40|$|Photopolymerization {{has been}} widely {{explored}} in biomedical and tissue engineering applications due to its widely held potentials in the biomedical field. Photoinitiators embedded within crosslinked scaffold materials could potentially serve as a more effective alternative to present uses of gamma <b>radiation</b> for <b>sterilization</b> of implants and biomaterials. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the cellular toxicity and the intracellular response of three ultraviolet (UV) sensitive photoinitiators including eosin Y, 2 -hydroxy- 1 -[4 -(hydroxyethoxy) phenyl]- 2 methyl- 1 -propanone (Irgacure 2959) and dimethoxyphenyl acetophenone (DMPA) as well as the subsequent degree of proliferation of free radicals on HN 4 cells. WST- 1 assay indicated that HN 4 cells can tolerate a wide range of concentrations of eosin Y and low concentrations of Irgacure 2959 (≤ 1 mg/ml) but not DMPA. Consistent with these results, eosin Y displayed no effect on intracellular AKT inactivation, but both Irgacure 2959 and DMPA concentration-dependently induced intracellular AKT inactivation. To initiate free radicals, these photoinitiators were exposed to UV light at 365 nm with an intensity of 100 watts for 30 minutes. In all three photoinitiating systems, HN 4 cells failed to maintain cell viability and intracellular AKT activity. To further demonstrate the stability of free radicals on cytocompatibility, cell culture medium was mixed with eosin Y to reach a final concentration of 25 μl/ml, and this mixture was exposed to UV light for 30 min. The mixture was kept in the dark prior to exposure to the cells. The results illustrate that the free radicals can be stable up to 48 hours, and HN 4 cells failed to maintain cell viability and intracellular AKT activity in the eosin Y photoinitiating system after UV exposure. In summary, these results suggest that eosin Y is able to stabilize intracellular AKT activity and cell viability in a wider range than Irgacure 2959 and DMPA. However, the free radicals introduced by UV light significantly inhibit intracellular AKT activation and induce cytotoxicity. Future studies will aim to overcome the cruciality of removing from or significantly limiting free radicals within the photopolymer before biomedical applications. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Sperm {{competition}} is {{the competition for}} fertilizations between ejaculates, within a female, following multiple mating. There are four sperm utilization or precedence patterns: first male precedence, where the first male to mate fertilizes most of the eggs laid by a female; last male precedence, where the last male to mate fertilizes most of the eggs laid by a female; "all-or-none" pattern, where sperm from either male fertilizes all the eggs laid by a female but which male's sperm that is used is random; or sperm mixing, where sperm from each male is used equally in fertilizing eggs laid by a female. Intermediate utilization patterns are also possible. Sperm competition occurs {{in a wide variety}} of insect species as well as other animals. This study was undertaken to study sperm competition in the field cricket, Gryllus integer. Four experiments were conducted: a <b>radiation</b> and <b>sterilization</b> experiment, a diapause experiment, and 2 competition experiments. It was found that 7, 000 rad of gamma radiation sterilized adult ~ integer males. There was no diapause in the laboratory in ~ integer eggs. In the first competition experiment, three groups of females were used: females mated with a normal male, then with a second normal male (NN group); females mated with a normal male, and then with a sterile male (NR group); and females mated with a sterile male, and then with a normal male (RN group). The results obtained from this experiment showed that the mean proportion of eggs hatched was significantly different between 3 groups of females, with the proportion hatched much greater in the NN group than in either the NR or RN groups. The pattern for the proportion of eggs hatched following a double mating most closely resembled a pattern expected if sperm mixing is occurring. Results obtained in the replicate competition experiment showed that the mean proportion of eggs hatched for the females in the NR group was significantly lower than the proportion hatched in the other two groups. This also supports a model of sperm mixing as a precedence pattern. Values calculated following Boorman and Parker (1976), for the proportion of eggs fertilized by the second male to mate following a double mating, were 0. 57 in competition experiment 1 and 0. 62 in the replicate.
