[...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else."

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more {{willing to put up}} with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly <b>real</b> <b>for</b> a show like this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. [...] Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the [...] "hilariously whacked-out" [...] performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song [...] "Sex Hair", about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.|$|E

The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson agreed, and said of their [...] "debate over the existence of bisexuality" [...] that [...] "it was refreshing to see Glee portray a conversation like it really goes down in reality. It’s also good to see them not treat Kurt like such a saint all the time." [...] Semigran wrote that Kurt showed [...] "an unflattering side of himself", and Gonzalez stated that she [...] "was completely on Blaine's side here": Kurt [...] "wasn't fair" [...] and [...] "was sort of unlikable" [...] for once, though she did add that [...] "he's allowed to be flawed". Blaine's [...] "sudden confusion over his sexual orientation" [...] was deemed a [...] "false note" [...] by Reiter, who called his [...] "overwrought speech" [...] at the Lima Bean [...] "off-key". Harper was unhappy that [...] "major plot points like a gay character thinking he might be bi or straight get instigated, sorted out and wrapped up within an hour", and said {{she thought it was}} [...] "hurtful" [...] for Blaine to [...] "accept a date with Kurt's friend" [...] after he and Kurt had [...] "agreed to sort of work on a potential relationship between the two of them" [...] in the [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] episode.|$|E

500|$|Woodburne was {{initially}} against Susan developing the condition, {{but when she}} started researching it, she realised {{how much of a}} challenge the storyline would be and she changed her mind. The actress and the shows writers worked closely with the MS Society to make the storyline as realistic as possible and it was praised by both the society and viewers who have the condition. Jenna Litchfield of the MS Society said soap opera storylines in which characters are diagnosed with MS helped to highlight the condition and its effects. She added that the storyline had [...] "sparked interest." [...] Of the storyine, Woodburne stated [...] "It's a massive story and to take a character that has always been so strong and to challenge them physically and emotionally was terrific. I know that the writing department did an enormous amount of research." [...] Woodburne also explained that as Susan is such a strong person mentally, she goes through an emotional struggle when her body lets her down. Woodburne commented that she found the scenes distressing to play as she is so attached to her character. She told a writer for Inside Soap that it was a difficult storyline, but [...] "ultimately rewarding". On screen, Susan learnt how to keep her symptoms under control and Woodburne said she would occasionally have a relapse, as the condition does not go away. In 2011, Woodburne commented on the MS storyline, which she enjoyed, saying it was very challenging to tell a good story and make it authentic and <b>real</b> <b>for</b> people who have the condition.|$|E
500|$|Indecision {{over his}} {{sexuality}} in the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol" [...] drew some negative reviews of Blaine. Reiter noted that, [...] "So much of Blaine's charm {{has been his}} certainty about who he is." [...] Though she found his subplot with Rachel [...] "fun", she commented: [...] "Blaine's overwrought speech in the coffee shop after Rachel asks him out just felt off-key. Saying 'bye' to the Blaine sexual-confusion storyline wouldn't make us angry at all." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also criticised the storyline, which, he wrote, [...] "seemed like it might be an interesting, complicated look at teenage sexuality {{and how it can}} seem formed but might be more fluid than most teens would give it credit for, then lost its nerve and took the easy way out." [...] AfterElton.com Chris O'Guinn felt that the only aspect of the storyline handled acceptably was Blaine questioning whether he was bisexual, rather than outright straight. He criticized the shallow examination of his feelings, and wrote: [...] "Bisexuality is such a contentious issue that it should not be fumbled this way. For a character to say 'maybe I'm bi' in one scene and then the next say, 'nope, definitely gay' is almost cruel in how dismissive it is toward bisexuals by trivializing the intense confusion that many bisexual people feel in coming to terms with their orientation." [...] In a more positive review, Canning opined that Blaine and Kurt's conversation about sexuality was [...] "great". He was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them" [...] and said that it [...] "felt very <b>real</b> <b>for</b> kids in this situation." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, good-girl Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too <b>real</b> <b>for</b> Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E
