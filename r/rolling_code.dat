25|$|Radio {{remote control}} (RF remote control) {{is used to}} control distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the remote control device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the radio remote control is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or <b>Rolling</b> <b>code,</b> using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal remote control duplicator because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any remote control in the market.|$|E

50|$|A <b>rolling</b> <b>code</b> {{transmitter}} {{is useful}} in a security system for providing secure encrypted radio frequency (RF) transmission comprising an interleaved trinary bit fixed code and <b>rolling</b> <b>code.</b> A receiver demodulates the encrypted RF transmission and recovers the fixed code and <b>rolling</b> <b>code.</b> Upon comparison of the fixed and rolling codes with stored codes and determining that the signal has emanated from an authorized transmitter, a signal is generated to actuate an electric motor to open or close a movable component.|$|E

50|$|In 1927, {{a second}} {{transmitter}} was installed {{to initiate the}} first transatlantic commercial telephone service; linking New York and London on 60 kHz using single-sideband modulation. This transmitter was decommissioned in 1956 and became the time signal transmitter MSF. This new function developed from the decision, in 1951, to use the station to transmit modulated standard frequencies for scientific reference purposes. In 1972 these transmissions were consolidated onto the present frequency of 60 kHz and a further reference, that of a time signal, was added. In 1977 this {{took the form of}} the <b>rolling</b> slow <b>code</b> in use until April 2007, when BT's contract to transmit the time signal also passed to VT Communications, using their Anthorn radio station in Cumbria.|$|R
5000|$|Gimbal's {{technology}} has raised security concerns related to customer privacy. Unlike GPS, which isn't very accurate, and doesn't work indoors or in dense cities, beacons have more precise location sensing capabilities. Analysts have been {{quoted as saying}} that wider adoption of the technology requires addressing these concerns. [...] In interviews, the company described how it was addressing these concerns, by only allowing their beacons to work with Gimbal-enabled apps that consumers download to their smartphones. Unlike some other beacon technology, it was reported that Gimbal's beacons will not connect to a phone that isn't running a specific app. The company also announced that they have developed a <b>rolling</b> encrypted <b>code</b> to ensure only users with the correct privileges can see the beacon's information, and that their technology is TRUSTe-certified.

5000|$|Medical {{devices such}} as pacemakers, insulin pumps, {{operating}} room monitors, defibrillators, and surgical instruments, including deep-brain stimulators, can incorporate the ability to transmit vital health information from a patient's body to medical professionals. Some of these devices can be remotely controlled. This has engendered concern about privacy and security issues, human error, and technical glitches with this technology. While only {{a few studies have}} looked at the susceptibility of medical devices to hacking, there is a risk. [...] In 2008, computer scientists proved that pacemakers and defibrillators can be hacked wirelessly via radio hardware, an antenna, and a personal computer. These researchers showed they could shut down a combination heart defibrillator and pacemaker and reprogram it to deliver potentially lethal shocks or run out its battery. Jay Radcliff, a security researcher interested in the security of medical devices, raised fears about the safety of these devices. He shared his concerns at the Black Hat security conference. Radcliff fears that the devices are vulnerable and has found that a lethal attack is possible against those with insulin pumps and glucose monitors. Some medical device makers downplay the threat from such attacks and argue that the demonstrated attacks have been performed by skilled security researchers and are unlikely to occur in the real world. At the same time, other makers have asked software security experts to investigate the safety of their devices. [...] As recently as June 2011, security experts showed that by using readily available hardware and a user manual, a scientist could both tap into the information on the system of a wireless insulin pump in combination with a glucose monitor. With the PIN of the device, the scientist could wirelessly control the dosage of the insulin. [...] Anand Raghunathan, a researcher in this study, explains that medical devices are getting smaller and lighter {{so that they can be}} easily worn. The downside is that additional security features would put an extra strain on the battery and size and drive up prices. Dr. William Maisel offered some thoughts on the motivation to engage in this activity. Motivation to do this hacking might include acquisition of private information for financial gain or competitive advantage; damage to a device manufacturer's reputation; sabotage; intent to inflict financial or personal injury or just satisfaction for the attacker. [...] Researchers suggest a few safeguards. One would be to use <b>rolling</b> <b>codes.</b> Another solution is to use a technology called [...] "body-coupled communication" [...] that uses the human skin as a wave guide for wireless communication. On 28 December 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations that are not legally enforceable for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of Internet-connected devices.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Skylink {{produced}} a universal transmitter called Model 39 {{that was designed}} to work for both <b>rolling</b> <b>code</b> and non-rolling code GDOs. The Model 39 bypasses the Chamberlain's <b>rolling</b> <b>code</b> system by imitating Security+'s resynchronization feature. The Model 39 transmitter sends three fixed codes in rapid succession; this either causes the door to open due to the first code or it causes the door to resynchronize and open due to the latter two codes.|$|E

40|$|Internal {{clearance}} in {{rolling element}} bearings is usually present {{to allow for}} radial and axial growth of the rotor-bearing system and to accommodate bearing fit-up. The presence of this clearance also introduces a "dead band" into the load-deflection behavior of the bearing. Previous studies demonstrated {{that the presence of}} dead band clearance might {{have a significant effect on}} synchronous rotor response. In this work, the authors investigate transient response of a rotor supported on rolling element bearings with internal clearance. In addition, the stiffness of the bearings varies nonlinearly with bearing deflection and with speed. Bearing properties were accurately calculated with a state of the art <b>rolling</b> bearing analysis <b>code.</b> The subsequent rotordynamics analysis shows that for rapid acceleration rates the maximum response amplitude may be less than predicted by steady-state analysis. The presence of clearance may shift the critical speed location to lower speed values. The rotor vibration response exhibits subharmonic components which are more prominent with bearing clearance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{paper is}} devoted to the study and {{evaluation}} of residual life for defective rails P 50 operated on the roads of the Kyiv subway, which are taken out of service because of defects 11. 1 - 2 {{on the side of the}} rolling surface of the rail head. Methodology. The studies were performed with the use of experimental methods: testing of samples of defective rails in the cyclical strength of the pulse machine and testing of defective rails in the static load limit on the hydraulic vertical press. Findings. The performed experiments indicate that on the tests basis in 2 million cycles is only a small development (increase in size) 0. 5 - 0. 7 mm of existing code defects 11. 2 as a result of shedding the particles of crumble out metal on the side of the rails head of working prototypes. The intensity and the catastrophic development of defects, such as 11. 2, or transformation of these defects in defects such as 21. 2 or 30 G. 2 did not happen in any case. Originality. For the first time in Ukraine with the theoretical calculations substantiated the greater possibility of defects formation of contact fatigue origin in the form of spall and jag of metal on the surface of the rail, at the edge of the head. It is the result of the creation of a high degree of stress nonequilibrium compression in this area, due to the high values of principal normal stresses and appearance of large shear stresses in the body of the head at a depth of 2. 5 - 3. 5 mm, exceeding the yield strength and metal endurance. The tests of experimental prototypes of defective rails on high cycle endurance (based โ = 2, 1 h 10 cycles) with periodic defectoscopic control were conducted. Practical value. In experiments, the new data of the resistance ability to spall rail defects on the surface of the head of <b>rolling</b> on the <b>code</b> 11. 1 - 2 long-term cyclic loading equal to operational magnitude at the wheel load test of 2 million cycles was obtained.

50|$|A <b>rolling</b> <b>code</b> (or {{sometimes}} called a hopping code) {{is used in}} keyless entry systems to prevent replay attacks, where an eavesdropper records the transmission and replays it {{at a later time}} to cause the receiver to 'unlock'.

50|$|The {{data may}} also be encrypted, so that while anyone can receive the data, only certain {{destinations}} are able to actually decode and use the broadcast data.

5000|$|A <b>rolling</b> <b>code</b> {{transmitted}} by radio signal {{that can be}} intercepted can be vulnerable to falsification. In 2015, {{it was reported that}} Samy Kamkar had built an inexpensive electronic device {{about the size of a}} wallet that could be concealed on or near a locked vehicle to capture a single keyless entry code to be used at a later time to unlock the vehicle. The device transmits a jamming signal to block the vehicle's reception of <b>rolling</b> <b>code</b> signals from the owner's fob, while recording these signals from both of his two attempts needed to unlock the vehicle. The recorded first code is forwarded to the vehicle only when the owner makes the second attempt, while the recorded second code is retained for future use.

50|$|Remote {{controls}} send {{signals in}} code. When the sending code {{is the same}} as the code that is expected by the receiver, then the receiver will actuate the relay, unlock the door, or open the barrier.

50|$|The {{third stage}} of garage door opener market uses a {{frequency}} spectrum range between 300-400 MHz {{and most of}} the transmitter/receivers rely on hopping or <b>rolling</b> <b>code</b> technology. This approach prevents criminals from recording a code and replaying it to open a garage door. Since the signal is supposed to be significantly different from that of any other garage door remote control, manufacturers claim it is impossible for someone other than the owner of the remote to open the garage. When the transmitter sends a code, it generates a new code using an encoder. The receiver, after receiving a correct code, uses the same encoder with the same original seed to generate a new code that it will accept in the future. Because there is a high probability that someone might accidentally push the open button while not in range and desynchronize the code, the receiver generates look-a-head codes ahead of time. <b>Rolling</b> <b>code</b> is the same method of security used on the clickers of cars, and with some internet protocols for secure sites.|$|E
50|$|DIP {{switches}} {{were used}} extensively in ISA architecture of PC expansion cards to select IRQs and memory addresses. Before {{the advent of}} cheaper, battery-backed RAM, DIP switches were also often used on arcade games in the 1980s and early 1990s to enter game settings such as difficulty {{or the number of}} credits per coin. DIP switches were very commonly used to set security codes on garage door openers as well as on some early cordless phones. This design, which used up to 12 switches in a group, was used to avoid RF interference from other nearby door opener remotes or other devices. Current garage door openers use <b>rolling</b> <b>code</b> systems for better security.|$|E

The device was designed with cooperation of Siemens Automotive and Huf exclusively for Mercedes-Benz, but many luxury manufacturers have implemented similar technology based on the same idea. In addition to the SmartKey, Mercedes-Benz now integrates as an option Keyless Go; this feature allows the driver to keep the SmartKey in their pocket, yet giving them the ability to open the doors, trunk as well as starting the car without ever removing it from their pocket.|$|E
