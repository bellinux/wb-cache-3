5|$|Ljudevit Posavski, Croatian Duke of Pannonian Croatia, led a {{resistance}} to Frankish domination. Ljudevit {{also had to}} fight against Dalmatian Croatia, as their prince Borna was a Frankish ally. After unsuccessful <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> Ljudevit and Pannonian Croats, the Franks again controlled Istria, Dalmatia, and Pannonia. Nevertheless, Dalmatian Croatia remained a semi-independent duchy between the two Empires, as they {{had a right to}} elect their own prince.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States gained {{official}} {{possession of}} the region following {{the conclusion of the}} American Revolution, British influence on its Native American allies in the region remained strong, especially near Fort Detroit. This influence caused the Northwest Indian War, which began when British-influenced native tribes refused to recognize American authority and were backed in their <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> British merchants in the area. American military victories in the region and the ratification of the Jay Treaty, which called for British withdrawal from the region's forts, caused a formal evacuation, but the British were not fully expelled from the area until the conclusion of the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E

5|$|At 6:30AM, Israeli {{helicopters}} started landing {{the bulk}} of the paratrooper battalion north of Karameh. An Israeli aircraft was supposed to drop leaflets addressed to Fatah, after the paratroopers had surrounded the town; however, due to difficult weather conditions, the helicopters flying the paratroopers arrived twenty minutes too late. Met with <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> Fatah commandos and Jordanian regulars supported by Jordanian artillery, the paratroopers suffered heavy losses. When the southern task force began their drive north towards Karameh, they encountered a Jordanian infantry brigade supported by armor, artillery and antitank weapons. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes, but was only able to inflict minor damage on the dug-in Jordanians. Fighting from their entrenched positions, the Jordanians repelled several Israeli assaults.|$|E
5|$|By 1August 1944, the British {{had made}} {{significant}} gains on the Vire and Orne Rivers during Operation Bluecoat, while the Americans had achieved a complete {{breakthrough in the}} west. On 4August, Simonds and General Harry Crerar—newly appointed commander of the First Canadian Army—were given the order to prepare an advance on Falaise. Three days later, with heavy bomber support, Operation Totalize began, marking the first use of Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers. While the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division attacked east of the Caen–Falaise Road, 2nd Division attacked to the west. By noon Verrières Ridge had finally fallen, and Canadian and Polish armour was preparing to exploit south towards Falaise. However, strong <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> the 12th SS Panzer Division and the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division halted the advance. Although 12km (7.5mi) of ground had been gained, Canadian forces had failed to reach Falaise itself.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand {{had almost}} fully conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking {{a large number of}} prisoners. Despite {{stubborn}} <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> Filipino and US forces, the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile. On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division. Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea and Indian Ocean, and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha. These easy victories over unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{screening}} for novel anticancer compounds, B 1 [N-(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl) - 2 -aminothiazonaphthalimide], a novel amonafide analogue, was generated as a new anticancer candidate. In the present study, B 1 displayed stronger antitumor effects than amonafide in HL 60 cells. We further examined whether B 1 overcomes the <b>resistance</b> conferred <b>by</b> Bcl- 2, as overcoming the <b>resistance</b> conferred <b>by</b> Bcl- 2 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer. Our viability assay showed that B 1 overcomes the <b>resistance</b> conferred <b>by</b> Bcl- 2 in human promyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells. Various apoptosis assessment assays showed that B 1 overcomes the <b>resistance</b> conferred <b>by</b> Bcl- 2 in HL 60 cells by inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, we elucidated the marked downregulation of 14 - 3 - 3 s protein by B 1, indicating that B 1 overcomes the <b>resistance</b> conferred <b>by</b> Bcl- 2 inHL 60 cells via 14 - 3 - 3 s. The analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that MBD 2 {{was associated with the}} methylated 14 - 3 - 3 s promoter-associated CpG island and thus interfered with transcriptional activity of the methylated promoter. Furthermore, knockdown of MBD 2, using siRNA transfec-tion, inhibited B 1 -induced apoptosis and overcame the <b>resistance</b> conferred <b>by</b> Bcl- 2. Accordingly, these data showed the involvement of MBD 2 in B 1 -induced apoptosis and overcoming the <b>resistance</b> conferred <b>by</b> Bcl- 2, which suggested that MBD 2 might guide the development of future anticancer agents.

5|$|By {{the time}} Mansur's Fatimid {{reinforcements}} arrived in Aleppo, Abu'l-Hayja' and the Kilab {{had reached the}} city's outskirts. The Fatimid troops marched toward Abu'l-Hayja's camp, after which the Kilab, having secretly agreed to Mansur's offer, abandoned Abu'l-Hayja'. The latter then fled back to Byzantine territory. Basil II at first refused to once again grant asylum to the Hamdanid, but Mansur persuaded him to keep Abu'l-Hayja' under virtual house arrest in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Meanwhile, Mansur did not abide by his promise to al-Hakim, who responded by sending an army from Cairo {{with the aim of}} replacing Mansur with the Hamdanid emir Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif. This army made it to Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, in Aleppo's countryside, in 1011, but retreated after encountering <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> the Kilab, who attempted to kidnap Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif and sell him to Mansur.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} century BC {{additional}} lines of bank and ditch were constructed {{turning it into a}} multivallate hillfort which is now known as the castle. There is evidence that the fort was violently taken in around AD43 and that the defences were further slighted later in the 1st century after the construction of a Roman army barracks on the hilltop. Excavations of the southwest gate in 1968 and 1969 revealed evidence for one or more severe violent episodes, associated with weaponry and destruction by fire. Whereas the excavator, Leslie Alcock, believed this to have been dated to around AD70, Richard Tabor argues for a date associated with the initial invasion, either AD43 or 44. Michael Havinden states that it was the site of vigorous <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> the Durotriges and Dobunni to the second Augusta Legion under the command of Vespasian.|$|E

5|$|From the 1840s, use of {{the river}} declined, {{as a result of}} {{competition}} from the railways, and changes in coastal shipping. Littlehampton grew in importance as a port and after years of <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> the people of Arundel, the customs house was moved there in 1864. The Mid-Sussex Railway opened their line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859, which was extended to Ford and Littlehampton in 1863. Receipts from tolls had peaked at £2044 for the five years from 1835 to 1840, when a dividend of 11.8 percent was paid, but dropped quickly, raising just £389 for years between 1870 and 1875, when the dividend was 1 percent.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1948, the Indian Army {{was sent}} into Hyderabad under Operation Polo {{on the grounds}} that the law and order {{situation}} there threatened the peace of South India. The troops met little <b>resistance</b> <b>by</b> the Razakars and between 13 and 18 September took complete control of the state. The operation led to massive communal violence with estimates of deaths ranging from the official one of 27,000-40,000 to scholarly ones of 200,000 or more. The Nizam was retained as the head of state in the same manner as the other princes who acceded to India. He thereupon disavowed the complaints that had been made to the UN and, despite vehement protests from Pakistan and strong criticism from other countries, the Security Council did not deal further with the question, and Hyderabad was absorbed into India.|$|E
