5000|$|A {{site for}} the {{dwelling}} was secured by digging a drift into the steep hillside and piling the excavated earth and stone out in front until a terrace {{large enough to accommodate}} the projected house had been provided. The floor area was scooped out to shallow saucer shape—in this case 9 m. in diameter—and coated with mud. At the margins, the mud curved upward to end against the half-buried foot logs which were the basal course of the wall. The walls were composed of horizontal wood and mud masonry. They rose with an inward slant to a little better than head height, then were cribbed for a distance to reduce the diameter of the flat portion of the roof, which was of clay supported by parallel poles, The arc of stones was a <b>retaining</b> <b>device</b> placed to hold back the ever-growing accumulation of refuse that was dumped at the brink of the terrace.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of types of <b>retaining</b> <b>devices</b> are {{currently}} available but their limitations, recommendations and guidelines are scattered in the technical literature. A synthesis study {{has been made in}} which different technologies have been investigated to develop guidelines {{for the use of the}} different types of <b>retaining</b> <b>devices.</b> For this purpose, an extensive literature review has been performed and a new classification has been proposed. An electronic database with 207 selected cases from the technical literature and INDOT archives has been created. The database stores the following information: (1) Type of Retaining Device; (2) Geometry (3) Soil conditions; (4) Experience and Performance; (5) Construction; (6) Durability; (7) Economy; and (8) Special considerations. The information stored has been analyzed through a number of correlations. Two design flowcharts have been developed to identify the most cost-effective solutions based on the height of the wall, cost, and soil conditions: one for Fill Walls, and another one for Cut Walls. The conclusions and recommendations obtained are in agreement with guidelines from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and with specifications from the Indiana Department of Transportation. The following is recommended for implementation: (1) Use the flowcharts developed as a preliminary decision-making tool to decide the optimum type of wall for a given project; and (2) the recommendations are based on up-to-date information. It is expected that with time design trends and wall typologies may become obsolete and new technologies may become available. It is recommended that the database and flowcharts be updated every five years. The flowcharts and additional notes provide general recommendations based on limited information. The flowcharts are not intended to cover all possible cases; they should be used for preliminary design and to facilitate engineering decisions. Site-specific conditions or project constraints may require a different solution than that provided by the charts...|$|R

With the rapid {{proliferation}} of mobile devices, the issues of energy consumed to manufacture these devices and {{the environmental impact of}} electronic waste comes to the fore.

Increase in mobile device lifespan can be achieved only if consumers <b>retain</b> their <b>devices</b> longer which could be accomplished by a combination of changes in hardware manufacturing processes, software upgrades, economic incentives, education, to name a few.

40|$|Tongue {{retaining}} devices make {{a comeback}} and prove their validity through a plethora of scientific research. By Allen J. Moses, DDS, and R. Michael Alvarez, DDS The tongue <b>retaining</b> <b>device</b> (TRD) was invented by Charles Samelson, MD, an analytically trained psychiatrist motivated by his own snoring problem. His wife, an accomplished pianist, complained that the loud snoring was affecting her “musical ear. ” She was also experiencing such secondary effects of his snoring as sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) due to the numerous arousals. Samelson could mimic his snoring by allowing {{the base of his}} tongue to fall against the back of his throat, and reasoned that snoring was a partial airway obstruction. To keep his airway open during sleep, he needed to keep his tongue forward. Initially, he molded tongue sleeves out of beeswax. By creating suction in the sleeve and extending the tip of the sleeve anterior to the lips, the goal was accomplished; however, the beeswax was fragile and broke apart easily...|$|E

40|$|An {{occlusion}} {{device is}} placed in an abnormal opening of the heart or its surrounding vessels to regain normal blood flow. There are various occlusion devices available for treatment of various congenital heart defects like PDA, ASD, etc. However, they have limitations like residual shunting, erosion of tissue, displacement and breakage of device, thrombus formation and sudden death. To improve efficiency and to reduce failure of occlusion devices, {{it is important to}} simulate blood flow through defect before and after placement of device. It is also important to evaluate stresses and forces exerted by blood flow on device and by the device on the vessel wall. Contact friction between device and vessel wall plays a crucial role in anchoring the device. The objective is to develop a framework to determine conditions to restrict dislocation of device in terms of contact friction. Typical occlusion devices are porous initially and later due to thrombogenesis, their porosity reduces until eventually it acts as a natural permanent plug. Thus, a porous sponge is a good model for an occlusion device. The mathematical model developed here is for differential pressure causing incipient movement of device, and minimum value of contact friction for restricting movement of the device for two shapes, cylindrical and conical, in uncompressed as well as pre compressed forms. The model for differential pressure is fitted by conducting physical experiment with sponge. Mathematically, porosity is modeled using viscous resistance and inertial resistance which are calculated by experiment and simulation with ANSYS. We perform computer experiments (simulations) on a cylindrical device in a cylindrical vessel and on a conical device in a tapered vessel to determine the differential pressure across the device and hence contact friction with varied porosity under boundary conditions as in body. The contact friction required to <b>retain</b> <b>device</b> is lesser in case of conical device compared to cylindrical device. As compression of device increases, friction require to retain it decreases. Hence, lesser porosity results in larger differential pressure and lesser compression which will eventually need higher friction values to <b>retain</b> the <b>device...</b>|$|R

While percutaneous devices have been shown to permit more rapid puncture site closure, previous reports have suggested the incidence and severity of complications associated with these devices are greater than with manual compression.
