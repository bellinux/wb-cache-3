40|$|Abstract—We {{dynamically}} monitor per cycle scan {{activity to}} speed up the scan clock for low activity cycles without exceeding the specified peak power budget. The activity monitor is implemented as on-chip hardware. Two models, one for test sets with peak activity factor of 1 and the other for test sets with peak activity factor lower than 1 have been proposed. In test sets with peak activity factors of 1, the test <b>time</b> <b>reduction</b> accomplished depends upon an average activity factor of αin. For low αin, about 50 % test <b>time</b> <b>reduction</b> is analytically shown. With moderate activity, αin = 0. 5, simulated test data gives about 25 % test <b>time</b> <b>reduction</b> for ITC 02 benchmarks. BIST with dynamic clock showed about 19 % test <b>time</b> <b>reduction</b> for the largest ISCAS 89 circuits in which the hardware activity monitor and scan clock control required about 2 - 3 % hardware overhead. In test sets with peak activity factors lower than 1, the test <b>time</b> <b>reduction</b> depends on an input activity factor of αin and an output activity factor of αout.

With an acetic acid (1. 5 %, wt/vol) marinade, calculated D values in the presence and absence of mussels were 77. 3 and 33. 3 h, respectively. Likewise, for an acetic acid (0. 75 %) -lactic acid (0. 75 %) marinade and an acetic acid (1. 5 %) -Glucono Delta-Lactone (0. 2 %) -based marinade, the D values in the presence and absence of mussels were 125. 5 and 26. 9 h and 86. 3 and 19. 3 h, respectively. Various increases in decimal <b>reduction</b> <b>times</b> in the presence of mussels indicated that there was no simple relationship between the listericidal natures of these marinades and the presence of mussels.

Both organisms were isolated from storm-water runoff collected below a sampling site when counts were sufficiently high in soil.

The speed <b>reduction</b> <b>time</b> was the variable {{used to describe}} the driver’s behaviour. Forty-two drivers drove a driving simulator on an urban scenario in which the baseline condition and the safety measures were implemented. The speed <b>reduction</b> <b>time</b> was modelled with a parametric duration model to compare the effects on driver’s braking behavior of vehicle dynamic variables and different countermeasures. The parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) duration model with a Weibull distribution identified that the vehicle dynamic variables and only the countermeasure curb extensions affected, in a statistically significant way, the driver’s speed <b>reduction</b> <b>time</b> in response to a pedestrian crossing. This result shows that the driver, due to the improved visibility of the pedestrian allowed by the curb extensions, was able to receive a clear information and better to adapt his approaching speed to yield to the pedestrian, avoiding abrupt maneuvers.
