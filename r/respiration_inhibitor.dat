However, it should be pointed out that conidia from A. niger MYA 135 could also have a preformed adhesive material (Schumacher et al. 2008) that is functional in BM at initial pH[*] 5 and not in water. In contrast, the conidia adhesiveness of other filamentous fungi such as Stagonospora nodorum (Newey et al. 2007) and Botrytis cinerea (Doss et al. 1993) is not affected by this <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> showing that in these cases the metabolism is not required.|$|E
40|$|SummaryIdentifying {{the targets}} of {{bioactive}} compounds is a major challenge in chemical biological research. Here, we identified the functional target of the natural bioactive compound glucopiericidin A (GPA) through metabolomic analysis. We isolated GPA while screening microbial samples for a filopodia protrusion inhibitor. Interestingly, GPA alone did not inhibit filopodia protrusion, but synergistically inhibit protrusion with the mitochondrial <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> piericidin A (PA). These results suggested that GPA might inhibit glycolysis. Capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) provided strong evidence that GPA suppresses glycolysis by functionally targeting the glucose transporter. GPA may therefore serve as a glucose transporter chemical probe. Simultaneous inhibition of both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration dramatically decreased intracellular ATP levels, indicating that GPA inhibits ATP-dependent filopodia protrusion with PA. Our results represent a challenge of molecular target identification using metabolomic analysis...|$|E

Parkinson's disease has been associated with exposure to the pesticide rotenone, a mitochondrial <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> We previously reported that intranasal administration of rotenone in mice induced dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration in the olfactory bulb (OB) and reduced olfactory functions. In the present study, we investigated the DA neurons in the brains of mice that were administered rotenone intranasally for an extended period. We found that the olfactory function of mice was attenuated by rotenone administration. Electrophysiological analysis of the mitral cells, which are output neurons in the OB, revealed that the inhibitory input into the mitral cells was retarded. In the immunohistochemical analysis, neurite degeneration of DA neurons in the substantia nigra was observed in rotenone-administered mice, indicating that rotenone progressively initiated the degeneration of cerebral DA neurons via the nasal route...|$|E

Physical interactions between yeast Pichia guilliermondii and postharvest fruit pathogen Penicillium expansum in culture were studied in detail using light and transmission electron microscope to give better understanding on their mode of antagonism. Both organisms were co-cultured for 24 -hr on potato dextrose agar. Light microscopy observations on the co-culture showed that the yeast cells attached firmly on the fungal hyphae. This attachment was inhibited by several substances such as enzymes degrading protein (protease or trypsin), a <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (sodium azide), an acid (hydrochloric acid) or an alkali (sodium hydroxide). Although autoclaved hyphae {{did not affect the}} attachment, but boiled enzymes and autoclaved yeast cells totally abolished the attachment.

Amytal induced a stronger inhibitory effect on scotonasty. Salicylhydroxamic acid, which inhibits the cyanide-insensitive respiration pathway, was also poorly effective when applied alone. KCN and salicylhydroxamic acid applied together increased the inhibition. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation were very effective: 2, 4 -dinitrophenol and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibited the scotonastic movements at concentrations higher than 10 μm and 1 μm, respectively.

A <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> that inhibits aflatoxin production was identified during a screening process for natural, aflatoxin-production inhibitors. This prompted us to evaluate respiration inhibitors as potential aflatoxin control agents. The inhibitory activities of four natural inhibitors, seven synthetic miticides, and nine synthetic fungicides were evaluated on aflatoxin production in Aspergillus parasiticus. All of the natural inhibitors (rotenone, siccanin, aptenin A 5, and antimycin A) inhibited fungal aflatoxin production with IC 50 values around 10 µM. Among the synthetic miticides, pyridaben, fluacrypyrim, and tolfenpyrad exhibited strong inhibitory activities with IC 50 values less than 0. 2 µM, whereas cyflumetofen did not show significant inhibitory activity. Of the synthetic fungicides, boscalid, pyribencarb, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and kresoxim-methyl demonstrated strong inhibitory activities, with IC 50 values less than 0. 5 µM. Fungal growth was not significantly affected by any of the inhibitors tested at concentrations used. There was no correlation observed between the targets of respiration inhibitors (complexes I, II, and III) and their IC 50 values for aflatoxin-production inhibitory activity.

Five different isozymes (alpha-esterase, lactate, malate, isocitrate and sorbitol dehydrogenases) and five random decamer primers for RAPD-PCR {{were used to}} generate molecular markers. Using unweighted pair-group with arithmetic average analysis, ctenanthe isolates were found to form a separate group distinct {{from that of the}} rice isolates for both sets of markers. Amplified polymorphic sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b that were digested with Fnu 4 HI or StyI revealed no differences among Pyricularia isolates at amino acid positions 143 or 129 which confer resistance to strobilurins in several fungi. In absence of the alternative <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) the three fungicides showed inferior and variable efficacy, with a trend toward the rice isolate being less sensitive.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a respiratory stress is part of the mechanism through which the dormancy-breaking compounds, hydrogen cyanamide (HC) and sodium azide, induce the release of buds from the endodormancy (ED) in grapevines. The accumulation of metabolites like succinate, alanine (Ala) and c-amino butyric acid (GABA), together with the activation of theGABA-shunt pathway, is a general feature of plants in response to oxygen deprivation and to respiratory stress. Unexpectedly, in a previous study, we found that GABA applied exogenously to grapevine buds, down-regulated the expression of most genes encoding for antioxidant enzymes, suggesting that its accumulation under respiratory stress conditions could be deleterious for the bud. In order to analyze whether GABA accumulates under respiratory stress conditions in grapevine buds, we analysed in this study, the effect of hypoxia, the <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> KCN and the dormancy breaker compound HC, on the level of GABA, and on the expression levels of the GABA-shunt genes (VvGAD, VvGABA-T, VvSSADH). Additionally, genes from the Ala fermentative pathway (VvAlaAT, VvAspAT) were also analysed. The results revealed that although the three treatments mentioned above, up-regulated the expression of VvGAD 1, the content of GABA remained constant, while Ala content increased. The lack of GABA accumulation under respiratory stress is an important physiological fact in grapevine buds, since it avoids the down-regulation of antioxidant genes, and promotes the incorporation of succinate into the TCA cycle, a fact that would be important in the release of buds from the ED...|$|E

Labeling of cells with lectin-HRP was done at 4 degrees C, and internalization was performed at 37 degrees C in a culture medium free of lectin-HRP. 15 - 20 min after incubation at 37 degrees C, lectin-HRP receptor complexes were seen in vesicles or tubules located near the plasma membrane. After 1 - 3 h at 37 degrees C, lectin-HRP-receptor complexes accumulated in vesicles and tubules corresponding to acid phosphatase-rich vesicles and tubules (GERL) at the trans aspect of the Golgi apparatus. A few coated vesicles and probably some dense bodies contained HRP after 3 - 6 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. Soluble HRP was not endocytosed under the conditions of this experiment or when it was present in the incubation medium at 37 degrees C. Internalization of lectin-HRP-receptor conjugates was decreased or inhibited by mitochondrial <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitors</b> but not by cytochalasin B or colchicine.

Nitrite-dependent N 2 O formation and/or cell growth during the anaerobic culture was not affected by further addition of ammonium ions but was suppressed by <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitors</b> such as rotenone or antimycin, suggesting that denitrification plays a physiological role in respiration. Dissimilatory nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase (Nor) activities could not be detected in cell extracts of the denitrifying cells.

Glucose, an important signal molecule and the preferred carbon source for Cryptococcus, plays {{a critical role in}} fungal development and virulence. Cryptococcus contains more than 50 genes sharing high sequence homology with hexose transporters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, there is no report on their function in glucose sensing or transport. In this study, we investigated two hexose transporter-like proteins (Hxs 1 and Hxs 2) in Cryptococcus that share the highest sequence identity with the glucose sensors Snf 3 and Rgt 2 in S. cerevisiae. The expression of HXS 1 is repressed by high glucose, while the HXS 2 expression is not regulated by glucose. Functional studies showed that Hxs 1 is required for fungal resistance to oxidative stress and fungal virulence. The hxs 1 Δ mutant exhibited a significant reduction in glucose uptake activity, indicating that Hxs 1 is required for glucose uptake. Heterologous expression of Cryptococcus HXS 1 rendered the S. cerevisiae mutant lacking all 20 hexose transporters a high glucose uptake activity, demonstrating that Hxs 1 functions as a glucose transporter. Heterologous expression of HXS 1 in the snf 3 Δ rgt 2 Δ double mutant did not complement its growth in YPD medium containing the <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> antimycin A, suggesting that Hxs 1 may not function as a glucose sensor.

40|$|Accumulation of HIF- 1 alpha during normoxic {{conditions}} at high cell density {{has previously been}} shown to occur {{and can be used}} to stabilize HIF- 1 alpha protein {{in the absence of a}} specific anaerobic chamber. However, the impact and origin of this pool of HIF- 1 alpha, obtained under normoxia, has been underestimated. In this study, we have systematically compared the related pools of HIF- 1 alpha stabilized in normoxia by high cell density to those obtained at low density in hypoxia. At first glance, these two stimuli appear to have similar outcomes: HIF- 1 alpha stabilization and induction of HIF- 1 -dependent genes. However, upon careful analysis, we observed that molecular mechanisms involved are different. We clearly demonstrate that density-dependant HIF- 1 alpha accumulation during normoxia is due to the cells high consumption of oxygen, as demonstrated by using a <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (oligomycin) and respiratory-defective mutant cells (GSK 3). Finally and most importantly, our data indicate that a decrease in AKT activity followed by a total decrease in p 70 (S 6 K) phosphorylation reflecting a decrease in mTOR activity occurs during high oxygen consumption, resulting from high cell density. In contrast, hypoxia, even at severe low O(2) levels, only slightly impacts upon the mTOR pathway under low cell density conditions. Thus, activation of HIF- 1 alpha in exponentially growing cells via hypoxic stimulation is independent of the Akt/mTOR pathway whereas HIF- 1 alpha activation obtained in high confluency is totally dependent on mTOR pathway as rapamycin totally impaired (i) HIF- 1 alpha stabilization and (ii) mRNA levels of CA 9 and BNIP 3, two HIF-target genes.

Compounds that target the respiratory pathway have the potential to kill both replicating and persistent M. tuberculosis and shorten TB treatment, as this pathway is essential in both metabolic states. We developed a novel respiratory pathway-specific whole-cell screen to identify new respiration inhibitors. This screen identified the biphenyl amide GSK 1733953 A (DG 70) as a likely <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> DG 70 inhibited both clinical drug-susceptible and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. Whole-genome sequencing of DG 70 -resistant colonies identified mutations in menG (rv 0558), which is responsible for the final step in menaquinone biosynthesis and required for respiration. Overexpression of menG from wild-type and DG 70 -resistant isolates increased the DG 70 MIC by 4 × and 8 × to 30 ×, respectively. Radiolabeling and high-resolution mass spectrometry studies confirmed that DG 70 inhibited the final step in menaquinone biosynthesis. DG 70 also inhibited oxygen utilization and ATP biosynthesis, which was reversed by external menaquinone supplementation. DG 70 was bactericidal in actively replicating cultures and in a nutritionally deprived persistence model. DG 70 was synergistic with the first-line TB drugs isoniazid, rifampin, and the respiratory inhibitor bedaquiline. The combination of DG 70 and isoniazid completely sterilized cultures in the persistence model by day 10.

Here, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied to determine the influence of these factors (pH, redox potential, and active respiration) on surface electrostatics and metal immobilization. Acid–base titrations revealed a decrease in ionizable ligands at pK_a 5 (putative carboxyls) in cells grown below pH 6. 2 and in cells grown anaerobically relative to cells grown under oxic and circumneutral pH conditions. This observation correlates with Western immunoblotting assays that revealed a reduction in carboxylated B-band lipopolysaccharide in these cells. Furthermore, spectrophotometric analysis revealed a decrease in zinc, copper, and iron immobilization in these cells, suggesting that lipopolysaccharide modification in response to environmental stimuli influences metal binding. The effect of active versus inactive metabolism on metal adsorption was also examined using <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitors</b> carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and sodium azide. Cells treated with these compounds bound more zinc, copper, and iron than untreated controls, suggesting proton extrusion through respiration competes with metal cations for reactive groups on the cell surface. Accumulation of gold did not show the same trend, and transmission electron microscopy studies confirmed it was not a surface-mediated process. These results suggest that variations in growth environment and cell physiology influence metal accumulation by bacterial cell surfaces and may help to explain discontinuous accumulation of metal observed throughout microbial communities. ...|$|R

This uptake was performed according to a unique affinity system (K(m) = 5. 9 mM, V(m) = 526 pmol mgDW(- 1)) in the concentration range of 0. 1 - 5 mM. The uptake rate increased with increasing temperature (5 - 35 °C) and was inhibited following treatment with sodium azide (NaN 3) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), suggesting the involvement of an active component. Treatment with p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS) did not modify the uptake, indicating that external thiol groups were not necessary. KCl, which induced membrane depolarization had no significant effect, and fusicoccin (FC), which hyperpolarized cell membrane, stimulated the uptake, suggesting that the pH component of the proton motive force was likely a driving force. These {{data suggest that the}} SA uptake by the pulvinar tissues may be driven by two components: an ion-trap mechanism playing a pivotal role and a putative carrier-mediated mechanism. Unlike other benzoic acid derivatives acting as classical <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (NaN 3 and KCN), SA modified the pulvinar cell metabolism by increasing the respiration rate similar to CCCP and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP).

The various seed quality parameters – viability, vigour, speed of germination, seedling dry weight, and moisture content were evaluated. In the untreated control, decreased seed viability was observed within 10 months of storage. However, iodine and chlorine were proved effective in retaining high seed viability up to 90. 7 and 88. 0 %, respectively, even after 22 months of storage.

We have recently demonstrated a role of endonuclease activation, considered a feature of apoptosis, in DNA damage and cell death in chemical hypoxic injury to renal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK 1 cells). Tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated to be involved in cell signaling pathway leading to cell growth, proliferation, and apoptotic death. However, a role of tyrosine phosphorylation as a signal transduction pathway involved in DNA damage and cell death has not been previously examined in hypoxic injury in any tissue. In the present study, we have demonstrated that chemical hypoxia with a combination of antimycin A, a mitochondrial <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> and substrate deprivation resulted in rapid increase in protein tyrosine kinases activity and protein tyrosine phosphorylation prior to any evidence of cell death in LLC-PK 1 cells. The inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases, genistein, lavendustin A, tyrphostin, and herbimycin A provided a marked protection against chemical hypoxia-induced DNA damage (as measured by alkaline unwinding assay) and cell death (as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay). In a separate study, we confirmed the ability of the inhibitors, lavendustin A and herbimycin A to prevent chemical hypoxia-induced increase in protein tyrosine kinases activity and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, the inhibitors used did not affect ATP depletion induced by antimycin A, suggesting that the inhibitors do not alter cellular uptake of antimycin A. Taken together, our data provide a strong evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation {{plays an important role in}} DNA damage and cell death in chemical hypoxic injury to renal tubular epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Septa of filamentous ascomycetes are perforated by septal pores that allow communication between individual hyphal compartments. Upon injury, septal pores are plugged rapidly by Woronin bodies (WBs), thereby preventing extensive cytoplasmic bleeding. The mechanism by which WBs translocate into the pore is not known, {{but it has been}} suggested that wound-induced cytoplasmic bleeding "flushes" WBs into the septal opening. Alternatively, contraction of septum-associated tethering proteins may pull WBs into the septal pore. Here, we investigate Woronin body dynamics in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Ultrastructural studies showed that 3. 4 ± 0. 2 WBs reside on each side of a septum and that single WBs of 128. 5 ± 3. 6 nm in diameter seal the septal pore (41 ± 1. 5 nm). Live cell imaging of green-fluorescent ZtHex 1, a major protein in WBs, and the integral plasma membrane protein ZtSso 1 confirms WB translocation into the septal pore. This was associated with the occasional formation of a plasma membrane "balloon", extruding into the dead cell, suggesting that the plasma membrane rapidly seals the wounded septal pore wound. Minor amounts of fluorescent ZtHex 1 -eGFP appeared associated with the "ballooning" plasma membrane, indicating that cytoplasmic ZtHex 1 -eGFP is recruited to the extending plasma membrane. Surprisingly, in ~ 15 % of all cases, WBs moved from the ruptured cell into the septal pore. This translocation against the cytoplasmic flow suggests that an active mechanism drives in WB plugging. Indeed, treatment of unwounded and intact cells with the <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> CCCP induced WB translocation into the pores. Moreover, CCCP treatment recruited cytoplasmic ZtHex 1 -eGFP to the lateral plasma membrane of the cells. Thus, keeping the WBs out of the septal pores, in Z. tritici, is an ATP-dependent process...|$|E

We tested this hypothesis using the clonal plant pathogen, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Nine susceptible isolates were exposed independently to five commercial fungicides with different modes of action: boscalid (<b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor),</b> iprodione (unclear mode of action), thiophanate methyl (inhibition of microtubulin synthesis) and azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin (quinone outside inhibitors). Mycelium of each isolate was inoculated onto a fungicide gradient and sub-cultured from the 50 - 100 % inhibition zone for 12 generations and experiment repeated. Mutational changes were assessed for all isolates at six neutral microsatellite (SSR) loci and for a subset of isolates using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). SSR analysis showed 12 of 85 fungicide-exposed isolates had a total of 127 stepwise mutations with 42 insertions and 85 deletions. Most stepwise deletions were in iprodione- and azoxystrobin-exposed isolates (n = 40 / 85 each). Estimated mutation rates were 1. 7 to 60 -fold higher for mutated loci compared to that expected under neutral conditions. AFLP genotyping of 33 isolates (16 non-exposed control and 17 fungicide exposed) generated 602 polymorphic alleles. Cluster analysis with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) identified fungicide-exposed isolates as a distinct group from non-exposed control isolates (PhiPT = 0. 15, P = 0. 001). Dendrograms based on neighbor-joining also supported allelic variation associated with fungicide-exposure. Fungicide sensitivity of isolates measured throughout both experiments did not show consistent trends. For example, eight isolates exposed to boscalid had higher EC 50 values {{at the end of}} the experiment, and when repeated, only one isolate had higher EC 50 while most isolates showed no difference. Results of this support the hypothesis that sublethal fungicide stress increases mutation rates in a largely clonal plant pathogen under in vitro conditions. Collectively, this work will aid our understanding how non-lethal fungicide exposure may affect genomic variation, which may be an important mechanism of novel trait emergence, adaptation, and evolution for clonal organisms...|$|E
40|$|Stimulants of the {{neutrophil}} respiratory burst, both soluble and crystalline, greatly {{inhibit the}} flow of cells through a Nuclepore filter with 5 fim diameter pores. The stimuli appear to reduce cell deformability by a mechanism independent of the activation of <b>respiration,</b> since <b>inhibitors</b> of the respiratory burst (/V-phenyl maleimide, quercetin) are without effect on the change. It is suggested that stimuli reduce membrane deformability rather than cause aggregation, since slowing of flow is independent of cell density and is much less when the filter pore size is increased to Sfim. The technique, recently used to study alterations in erythrocyte deformability, may be appropriate for investigating leucocyte flow in some clinical disorders...|$|R

It is shown that inhibitors of the alternative oxidase, salicyl hydroxamate and propyl gallate strongly stimulate H 2 O 2 production by these mitochondria oxidizing succinate.

40|$|Early in the {{development}} of spores, there appears in gill tissue of the mushroom Agaricus bisporus a red pigment that inhibits mitochondrial <b>respiration.</b> The <b>inhibitor</b> and its immediate precursor were isolated from the mushroom and identified as γ-L-glutaminyl 3, 4 -benzoquinone (I) and γ-L-glutaminyl 4 -hydroxybenzene (II), respectively, neither of which had previously been described. II was synthesized chemically and the synthetic material was identical with isolated II in all regards. An enzyme that oxidizes II to I was isolated concurrently. I reacts unusually rapidly, completely, and at low concentration with the sulfhydryl groups of various mitochondrial enzymes, accounting for its originally observed properties. It may also prove of value as a general inhibitor of sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{available}} annotated gene sequence information, the {{enteric pathogen}} salmonella, like other enteric bacteria, contains three putative membrane-associated H 2 -using hydrogenase enzymes. These enzymes split molecular H 2, releasing low-potential electrons {{that are used}} to reduce quinone or heme-containing components of the respiratory chain. Here we show that each of the three distinct membrane-associated hydrogenases of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is coupled to a respiratory pathway that uses oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Cells grown in a blood-based medium expressed four times the amount of hydrogenase (H 2 oxidation) activity that cells grown on Luria Bertani medium did. Cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline consumed 2 mol of H 2 per mol of O 2 used in the H 2 -O 2 respiratory pathway, and the activity was inhibited by the <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> cyanide. Molecular hydrogen levels averaging over 40 μM were measured in organs (i. e., livers and spleens) of live mice, and levels within the intestinal tract (the presumed origin of the gas) were four times greater than this. The half-saturation affinity of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium for H 2 is only 2. 1 μM, so it is expected that H 2 -utilizing hydrogenase enzymes are saturated with the reducing substrate in vivo. All three hydrogenase enzymes contribute to the virulence of the bacterium in a typhoid fever-mouse model, based on results from strains with mutations {{in each of the three}} hydrogenase genes. The introduced mutations are nonpolar, and growth of the mutant strains was like that of the parent strain. The combined removal of all three hydrogenases resulted in a strain that is avirulent and (in contrast to the parent strain) one that is unable to invade liver or spleen tissue. The introduction of one of the hydrogenase genes into the triple mutant strain on a low-copy-number plasmid resulted in a strain that was able to both oxidize H 2 and cause morbidity in mice within 11 days of inoculation; therefore, the avirulent phenotype of the triple mutant is not due to an unknown spurious mutation. We conclude that H 2 utilization in a respiratory fashion is required for energy production to permit salmonella growth and subsequent virulence during infection...|$|E
40|$|Commercial scale {{mammalian}} cell culture systems have many technical barriers: (i) accumulation of inhibitory waste products; (ii) sensitivity to {{low level of}} shear; and (iii) cellular oxygen demand in excess of bioreactor's capability to provide oxygen without damaging cells. Because of these problems, systematic approaches for providing sufficient oxygen transfer rates to large scale {{mammalian cell}} culture systems {{have yet to be}} adequately developed. This work, however, suggests a unique approach to this problem from a different point of view. A research program has been undertaken to determine if the metabolism of mammalian cells can be manipulated to minimize or eliminate the oxygen transfer capabilities required by the cells from a given bioreactor. The <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> rotenone, has been added to the cultures of a T cell fusion partner, Jurkat, at levels that completely inhibit respiration. Growth of the cells, at these concentrations of rotenone in completely defined media, did not occur unless the media was supplemented with at least 1 mM pyruvate or at least 1 % fetal bovine serum. Respiration inhibited cells utilized much less glutamine, respiratory fuel, and concomitantly produces much less ammonia. They grew to one million cells per ml at near normal rate but the maximum cell density was 65 % that of un-inhibited cultures. Proline and a minimum amount of glutamine (0. 2 mM) were found to be essential for the growth of Jurkat cells in the presence of rotenone. Intracellular thiol content measured with flow cytometry technique was found to be lower for rotenone cultures, possibly due to the free radicals formation at higher oxygen concentration. With continuous reactor experiments, the fact that Jurkat cells grow without using oxygen in the presence of rotenone was firmly confirmed and more metabolic details were found. In addition to the increased glycolysis, respiration inhibited culture increased the utilization of arginine, asparagine, serine, histidine, and aspartic acid and increased the production of lysine, glycine, glutamic acid, and alanine. At steady state with 90 nM of rotenone, pulse inputs of proline and pyruvate increased the cell density up to 1. 4 million cells per milliliter...|$|E
40|$|After DNA and proteins, {{carbohydrates}} are {{the third}} language of life. Chapter 1 introduces {{the reader to}} this class of biomolecules, also called sugars or glycans, {{that can be found}} on the outer surface of almost all cells and plays a critical role as the social messengers of a cell. Although our knowledge about the role of glycans in eukaryotic cells has increased considerably in recent decades, our understanding of the glycan layer on bacterial cells is still very limited. Besides the carbohydrates that are present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes an additional wide range of unique (e. g. microbial sialic acid), often very complex (e. g. pseudaminic acid), carbohydrates is present in prokaryotes. This chapter briefly introduces two research fields, carbohydrate chemistry and chemical biology, that when combined provide a powerful way to investigate the biological role of these unique bacterial carbohydrates at the molecular level. This chemistry-based approach, termed chemical microbiology, often starts with the development of a chemical synthesis for a target bacterial carbohydrate. Subsequently, the synthetic route towards this target allows for the introduction of unnatural functional groups, like chemical reporters, that result in the molecular tools needed to study their biological function. The studies described in this thesis, focus on developing such molecular tools to study the role of glycans and glycoconjugates in human gut bacteria and human-associated bacteria. Chapter 2 provides an overview of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) a popular chemical biology technique to label glycans in living cells. In MOE, carbohydrates derivatives are synthesised with unnatural chemical reporters and used to study their incorporation in glycans of eukaryote to prokaryote species. The progress in this field over the last 6 years is reviewed in detail with a special emphasis on the synthesis of the unnatural carbohydrates from commercially available sources. The principle behind MOE is that these unnatural carbohydrates with e. g. azide, alkyne, cyclopropene, or isonitrile chemical reporter groups, are still recognised by the endogenous enzymes in the cell that salvage this new carbohydrate. In this way they can enter the associated biochemical pathways and end up in newly biosynthesised cellular glycans. Subsequent labelling techniques, such as strain promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition or tetrazine ligation, enable the visualisation of these incorporated unnatural carbohydrates with for instance fluorescence microscopy. Metabolic labelling is further explored in chapter 3. Key cell envelope glycoconjugates in the mucin-degrading gut microbiota member, Akkermansia muciniphila, were subjected to chemistry-based functional analysis, with Escherichia coli being used as a control species. Two novel non-toxic peptidoglycan (PG) probes were designed and synthesised to investigate the presence of PG in this species. Their design was based on the natural d-alanine dipeptide motif found in PG. Inspired by the fact that d-alanine dipeptide-derivatives were previously reported to be incorporated in newly synthesised PG, we synthesised a cyclopropene and isonitrile d-alanine dipeptide. Our probes proved to be non-toxic, as shown by growth and viable count analysis, and were therefore superior over existing PG probes. Another beneficial property was that the probes also did not influence the specific growth rate of A. muciniphila or E. coli. The PG probes were successfully incorporated into the peptidoglycan layer of A. muciniphila and visualised using a tetrazine click-ligation with a fluorophore. Our analysis proved for the first time that A. muciniphila has a PG layer. Besides PG labelling, we also investigated metabolic labelling of other glycoconjugates on the outer surface of A. muciniphila. This part of the study showed that azido-monosaccharide derivatives of N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, and fucose are successfully processed by A. muciniphila salvage pathways and incorporated into its surface glycoconjugates. Especially 6 -azido-fucose was readily processed by the recently discovered l-fucose salvage pathway of A. muciniphila. The two compatible labelling techniques were next combined in a dual labelling experiment. Our isonitrile dipeptide peptidoglycan probe and 6 -azido-fucose were successfully incorporated into A. muciniphila. Subsequent fluorescent labelling with bio-orthogonal techniques resulted in dual labelling of peptidoglycan and fucose-containing glycans in live A. muciniphila cells. With the positive results of MOE in A. muciniphila in hand, chapter 4 describes the further investigation of MOE. After successful validation of our Ac 4 FucAz probe for MOE in Bacteroides fragilis we continued their application in other human gut microbiota members, including the butyrate-producing Anaerostipes rhamnosivorans, Intestimonas butyriciproducens, and Eubacterium hallii. Labelling of these human gut microbes proved to be rather challenging with a-specific cellular labelling with the fluorophore being the major problem. Initial results, however, did show that a 6 -azido-l-rhamnose probe resulted in fluorescent labelling of A. rhamnosivorans, which provides initial evidence for the existence of an as of yet undocumented salvage pathway. In this species the 6 -azido-fucose probe was not salvaged. Via confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis we observed that the 6 -azido-rhamnose probe was selective for A. rhamnosivorans in the presence of A. muciniphila. Such a co-culture experiment is a first step in mimicking the complex human gut microbiome. For E. hallii Ac 4 GalNAz gave clear metabolic labelling and the majority of the cell population could be labelled with the fluorescent dye after a strain-promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition. Other glycan probes (Ac 4 GlcNAz, Ac 4 FucAz, and Neu 5 Az) also resulted in labelling, but not as prominent as Ac 4 GalNAz. Surprisingly, MOE has never been reported for the common lab strain Escherichia coli MG 1655. Curious to investigate this in more detail we started MOE in E. coli. However, no labelling was obtained when Ac 4 GlcNAz probe was added to E. coli, most likely due to the fast growth, metabolism and turnover. Only, when fresh Ac 4 GlcNAz probe was added every 30 minutes, metabolic labelling in E. coli was observed. To further investigate the influence of GlcNAc metabolism in E. coli on MOE, single-gene knock-outs of E. coli GlcNAc metabolism from the Keio collection were investigated. Labelling was observed for NagA (N-acetyl glucosamine 6 P deacetylase) and NagK (N-acetyl-d-glucosamine kinase) E. coli mutants. Both enzymes are involved in the last step of the biosynthesis towards UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. When the overall E. coli metabolism was inhibited, after addition of the <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitor</b> sodium azide, no metabolic labelling was observed. These results indicate that MOE in E. coli is possible, but challenging and can only be performed under specific circumstances. An investigation into the total synthesis of pseudaminic acid, a sialic acid produced by specific human-associated prokaryotes, is described in chapter 5. Sialic acids are typically found at the terminal positions of surface glycoconjugates in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Other related microbial sialic acids are legionaminic and acinetaminic acid. The total synthesis of these microbial sialic acids is notoriously difficult, as exemplified by the fact that only a few chemical synthesis routes towards them are currently known. Our total synthesis of pseudaminic acid started from the readily available amino acid l-threonine that was transformed into a key versatile Garner aldehyde derivative intermediate. With this aldehyde in hand, the Henry nitro-aldol condensation reaction was investigated. After studying numerous conditions, such as asymmetric catalysis or elongated reaction times, and extensive optimisation efforts we were never able to obtain the Henry reaction product to continue with this route. As an alternative, a tethered aminohydroxylation was investigated for its ability to introduce the key functional group and stereochemistry onto an intermediate obtained from the Garner aldehyde derivative. This reaction indeed gave the desired amino-alcohol motif in the correct stereochemistry, but another diastereomer proved very difficult to separate from the desired product. After some additional transformations and protection steps we obtained a derivative in which the primary alcohol could be oxidised to provide a hexose intermediate that resembles the hexose intermediate present in pseudaminic acid biosynthesis. This key hexose intermediate will likely enable a subsequent Barbier reaction, a chain elongation step, in future studies. With most of the key transformations accomplished, the completion of a pseudaminic total synthesis based on l-threonine should soon be possible. Besides finishing the total synthesis, future work should also focus on adapting this synthesis route to allow installation of chemical reporter groups on pseudaminic acid for its application in MOE. Chapter 6 is the general discussion about all the work mentioned in the other chapters. It also contains additional information and suggestions for further research in the field of chemical microbiology...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin E {{is a major}} chain-breaking {{antioxidant}} {{which is}} able to reduce liver oxidative damage without modifying aerobic capacity in T 3 -treated rats. We investigated whether vitamin E has similar effects in hyperthyroid state induced by cold exposure. Cold exposure increased aerobic capacity and O 2 consumption in homogenates and mitochondria and tissue mitochondrial protein content. Vitamin E did not modify aerobic capacity and mitochondrial protein content of cold liver, but increased ADP-stimulated respiration of liver preparations. Succinate-supported H 2 O 2 release rates were increased by cold during basal and stimulated respiration, whereas the pyruvate/malate-supported ones increased only during basal respiration. Vitamin administration to cold-exposed rats decreased H 2 O 2 release rates with both substrates during basal respiration. This effect reduced ROS flow from mitochondria to cytosol, limiting liver oxidative damage. Cold exposure also increased mitochondrial capacity to remove H 2 O 2, which was reduced by vitamin treatment, showing that the antioxidant also lowers H 2 O 2 production rate. The different effects of cold exposure and vitamin treatment on H 2 O 2 generation were {{also found in the}} presence of <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Although this can suggest that the cold and vitamin induce opposite changes in mitochondrial content of autoxidizable electron carriers, it is likely that vitamin effect is due to its capacity to scavenge superoxide radical. Finally, vitamin E reduced mitochondrial oxidative damage and susceptibility to oxidants, and prevented Ca 2 +-induced swelling elicited by cold. In the whole, our results suggest that vitamin E is able to maintain aerobic capacity and attenuate oxidative stress of hepatic tissue in cold-exposed rats modifying mitochondrial population characteristics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{established}} that a recombinant protein fragment (45 A) {{of the egg}} receptor for sperm of the sea urchinStrongylocentrotus purpuratusexhibits several characteristics {{that are consistent with}} that expected of a receptor. Using a quantitative sperm binding assay with glutathioneS-transferase fused to a recombinant protein containing the C-terminal half of the 45 A construct immobilized on glutathione beads, {{it was found that the}} interaction between sperm and this protein is a kinetically transient event. Sperm binding to the receptor fragment reached a maximum at 20 s after adding sperm in the presence of egg jelly to beads coated with recombinant receptor. In the next 20 – 120 s, approximately 50 – 70 % of the sperm detached from the beads. Similar phenomena were observed when the kinetics of sperm binding to dejellied, glutaraldehyde-fixed eggs were studied. Because the acrosome reaction, a prelude to binding, is known to be accompanied by a decrease in the ATP level of sperm, we studied the effect of various inhibitors on both sperm detachment and the level of ATP. It was found that the detachment rate increased slightly when <b>respiration</b> <b>inhibitors</b> that blocked ATP production in mitochondria were added. In contrast, the dynein ATPase inhibitor,erythro- 9 -[3 -hydroxynonyl]adenine, which is known to inhibit flagellum motility by blocking ATP utilization, stabilized the binding of sperm to the receptor and allowed maintenance of a high internal ATP level. Immotile, tailless sperm that physically lacked dynein ATPase, and therefore sustained their internal ATP levels, also exhibited stable binding provided that the sperm and beads were physically mixed. These results suggest that the internal ATP level of the sperm controls the stability of its binding to the receptor. The possible mechanism of the detachment and its significance with respect to the overall process of fertilization are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a phytopathogenic ascomycete {{responsible}} for grey mould on many crops. <b>Respiration</b> <b>inhibitors</b> play an increasing {{role in the}} control of this disease. Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs, including carboxamides) inhibit the fungal respiration by blocking the ubiquinonebinding site of the mitochondrial complex II. Old SDHIs (i. e. carboxin), essentially active against Basidiomycetes were replaced in the 2000 s by {{a new generation of}} SDHIs with a broader spectrum including Ascomycetes. Boscalid is the only representative of this new generation in France up to now. A few years after its market introduction, field mutants of B. cinerea, resistant to boscalid were isolated in France and Germany. At least six different phenotypes, named CarR 1 to CarR 6, have been pinpointed by characterizing their resistance pattern towards 20 SDHIs. CarR 1 to R 4 phenotypes exhibit low to medium level of resistance, whereas CarR 5 and R 6 show high level of resistance to different SDHIs, including boscalid. CarR 1 and CarR 2 strains are currently the most frequent strains detected in German and French vineyards. The resistance mechanism was investigated for the different phenotypes by searching for putative alterations in the SDH proteins, which could be {{responsible for}} the observed resistance. Our findings show point mutations in the sdhB gene lead to a specific amino acid change in SdhB for each phenotype. Isogenic mutants have been generated through a gene replacement strategy to confirm the role of these mutations in the various SDHI resistance phenotypes. We have shown that each mutation of the sdhB gene confers resistance to at least one SDHI. Isogenic mutants show similar resistance factors compared to field mutants carrying the same mutation. SDH enzyme activity and inhibition by different SDHIs were measured in these mutants. Our results provide evidence for differential SDH inhibition profiles according to the tested mutations, correlating with the mutants’ resistance pattern. SDH enzyme affinity to different SDHIs will be measured in these mutants...|$|R
