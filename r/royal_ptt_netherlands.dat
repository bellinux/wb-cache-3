40|$|In recent years, in many {{countries}} numerous reforms have taken place {{with regard to the}} public sector. It is beyond doubt that the role of the private sector increased. This phenomenon occured not only in the United States and the United Kingdom, but also in other European countries including the Netherlands. The change in the relationship between public enterprise and the state is, however, not new. It has been a continuing process since the establishment of public enterprises. A historical analysis of this process is therefore important. This paper focuses on the Post, Telegraph and Telephone Company (PTT) 2. The goal of this paper is not only to shed light on the fascinating history of the State Enterprise for Postal, Telegraph and Telephone Services in the Netherlands and its changing relationship with the government, but also to explore the significance of the various motives and arguments which led to the establishment and to the recent denationalisation of the PTI'. In 1989 the Dutch PTT was denationalised and became the <b>Royal</b> <b>PTT</b> <b>Netherlands</b> NV (Koninklijke PTT Nederland, KPN), a private joint-stock company. All the shares were held by the state. The first instalment of shares was sold on the stock exchange in June 1994. The recent developments of the PTT will not be discussed here, but an analysis will be made of the past relationship between the PTT and the state. After a short introduction to the relevant aspects of Dutch public enterprises we concentrate foremost on the PTT. We begin by examining how different divisions of the PTT came to be government owned, and how the Post, Telegraph and Telephony became the PTT. Subsequently, the tMy thanks to Dr. G. Hogesteeger and Drs. R. Van Hoesel for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{predicted}} growth in the telecommunications market over the next few years, it is expected that the process of configuring telecommunications services will become much more complex. As a result, the use of advanced information processing techniques to support the people who carry out configuration will become necessary. We describe the design of a prototype system that provides active decision support in such a scenario. The system combines a number of different techniques from operations research and artificial intelligence by use of a blackboard which is specially modified in order to allow the user to actively participate in the decision making process.

INTRODUCTION As discussed in (Motta, 1991) both the current practice of industrial KBS, and the consensus among researchers (Frisch & Cohn, 1991) suggest that hybrid architectures, embedding a number of specialized representations/reasoners, are required to enable knowledge engineers to build efficient and powerful KBs.

40|$|In this {{document}} we propose and discuss {{a framework for}} the knowledge representation component of the Vital workbench. We argue that the framework described here, organized around a two-layer architecture, allows us to support the engineering side of knowledge based systems (KBSs) development, while also facilitating the development of knowledge repositories, the verification, visualization, and debugging of KBSs. The main issues {{that need to be}} tackled if such a framework can be developed successfully are also discussed.

40|$|SCHISMA {{is a joint}} {{research}} project of KPN (<b>Royal</b> <b>PTT</b> Nederland) and the University of Twente. The project aims at providing a natural language dialogue system which interfaces a database containing information about theatre performances in a certain city or region. The interface should {{make it possible to}} ask about performances in general, to tune in to a specific performance and, if desired, make a reservation for this performance. Research until now has concentrated on various aspects of realising such a theatre information and booking system. Among these aspects are the building of a Wizard of Oz environment for the acquisition of a corpus of dialogues for this domain, analysis and tagging of the dialogue corpus, recognition of domain-specific concepts (actors, authors, plays, dates, etc.), syntactic analysis and dialogue modelling. The emphasis in this paper will be on the analysis of individual utterances at various levels. Most important for the project are short and medium term goals of delivering prototype systems that allow demonstration of the system and evaluation of the design choices. Due to these goals the project does not strive at incorporating advanced but isolated research results on discourse models and syntactic and semantic analysis. Rather we investigate how to identify user preferences and how to embed systems like these in a more comprehensive environment of information and transaction services...|$|R
