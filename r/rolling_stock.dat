5|$|Initially {{the railway}} was worked by GWR broad-gauge Metropolitan Class steam {{locomotives}} and <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> Soon {{after the opening}} disagreement arose between the Met and the GWR over the need to increase the frequency, and the GWR withdrew its stock in August 1863. The Met continued operating a reduced service using GNR standard-gauge <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> before purchasing its own standard-gauge locomotives from Beyer, Peacock and <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{there have been}} moves towards greater {{modernisation}} and standardisation, with large purchases of new <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> from companies like Alstom and China CNR Corporation, as well as smaller orders of second hand <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> which {{the government of the}} City of Buenos Aires claims are temporary measures while those lines are modernised to be able to incorporate more modern <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> Such stock has been acquired from Tokyo, Nagoya, and Madrid. From 2013 to 2019, 468 new cars are set to arrive while 232 are receiving refurbishment, bringing {{the average age of the}} fleet to 22 years in 2016, down from 34 in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{shipment}} of the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> to India, Calthrop and the Leeds Forge Company, manufacturer of the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> conducted tests on a specially built test track located at Newlay, near Leeds. The line was opened for inspection by railway officials and journalists, {{and a number}} of reports were published in the technical railway press.|$|E
50|$|Two old <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> were {{replaced}} with new ones in November 2007. New <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> {{were made by}} Garaventa, a company based in Bern, Switzerland. Doppelmayr, an Austrian company helped {{in the creation of}} the new funicular, which has a capacity of 160 person, 30 more than the older one.|$|R

5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has had {{among the}} longest serving and most varied <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> in the world, {{in part due}} to the network having been {{originally}} built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. The network began with uniform <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with {{the exception of a few}} UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's Line B using Metro Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} deficits {{are covered}} through subsidies by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. The trackage and other infrastructure {{is owned by}} the government agency Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> is owned and operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). <b>Rolling</b> <b>stock</b> maintenance is performed by NSB-owned Mantena.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} program, the Staten Island Railway {{would be}} fully rehabilitated and would also get new <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> through Phases I and II.|$|E
50|$|From {{the end of}} 2016 to the {{beginning}} of 2017, several subsidiaries of CRRC gained licences from the National Railway Administration to produce the <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Competition and {{regulation}} in railways: {{the role of}} the <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> - The liberalization process in the railway industry is highly influenced by the availability of <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks.</b> Although these assets are duplicable and cannot therefore be defined as essential facilities, evidence from many countries shows that they represent the most relevant barrier to entry in the market. In this paper, following the UK experience, we analyse {{the role of the}} <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> and the hypothesis of a vertical separation of these assets from the present owner, i. e. the incumbent operator Trenitalia SpA. We therefore evaluate {{the pros and cons of}} a potential de-integration of the Italian railway industry in order to enhance market competitiveness and the overall efficiency of this industry..

50|$|Fortunately, many <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> {{and other}} objects, {{as well as}} station {{buildings}} could be preserved from deterioration and vandalism. Some pieces are currently exhibited at the Petroleum Museum of Comodoro Rivadavia.|$|R
5|$|Line A {{is renowned}} for having kept its {{original}} 1913 <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> {{running on the}} line up until 2013, making them the oldest underground carriages in commercial service {{in the world at}} the time. They were built by La Brugeoise, et Nicaise et Delcuve, a Belgian <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> manufacturer established in the city of Bruges, between 1913 and 1919. Entirely made of wood, they were originally designed to run as underground as well as tramway cars, but they were adapted in 1927 to their current style for underground service only.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of unique loading gauges and bespoke rail technologies has complicated {{maintenance of the}} system, as <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> requires custom wheelsets, brake systems, and power systems.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor Enterprise, {{the working}} group leading the project, {{estimated}} that the full project being considered was likely to cost around £30 million, including the building of replica <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> reconstructing original coaches and Van 4, as well as improving the line as an important local tourist attraction.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, DTO {{systems could}} provide a {{flexible}} way to coordinate trains, and this flexibility can improve the system performances in many respects, such as the efficient usage of <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> and regenerative energy [37].|$|R
5|$|Fitting new {{traction}} equipment both improves Miles per Breakdown values and overall reduces operating and maintenance costs. As the trains will therefore {{be in the}} depot less, it will allow South West Trains to acquire additional <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> without the {{need to build a}} new depot.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, La Brugeoise subway {{carriages}} {{were replaced}} by new Chinese 200 Series <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> just 11 months prior to their 100-year anniversary on the line. The original <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> has since been maintained, some in exhibition and some being converted to 1500v to run tourist services on the line. During the festivities of the 100-year anniversary of the underground on 1 December 2013, many restored La Brugeoise trains circulated Line A {{and there was a}} symphonic orchestra at Plaza de Mayo station as well as free rides for the entire city in order to mark the event. Throughout the week that followed, there were also numerous displays and events across the different lines of the Underground.|$|E
5|$|Of the two LRTA lines, the LRT Line 2 {{prominently}} employs wrap {{advertising in}} its <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> The LRT Line 1 have begun using wrap advertising as well initially for their second-generation trains, followed by their third-generation trains.|$|E
50|$|This {{train service}} was removed last May 23, 2014 {{to give way}} to {{maintenance}} servicing of the <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks.</b> Another reason was the 3 consecutive weeks of delays and cancellations of some train trips.|$|R

5|$|There are {{political}} signals to prioritize electrification the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer plus the Meråker Line. NSB {{will need to}} replace the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> in the 2010s, and want to coordinate the new stock with electrification.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{experimentally}} boilered No. 126, all the M7s entered into British Railways service in 1948. In that year No. 672 fell down the lift shaft which provided <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> {{access to the}} Waterloo and City Line at Waterloo, and was cut up. The remainder survived until 1957, {{but over the next}} seven years the remainder of the class was withdrawn as part of the Modernisation Plan..|$|E
5|$|At present Eurostar is {{concentrating on}} {{developing}} its connections with other services, but direct services to other destinations would be possible. However, the routes that any potential services {{are likely to}} take would include infrastructure that Eurostar's <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> has not been built to use— German railways mostly have 15 kV AC electrification, while the Netherlands uses 1.5 kV DC (except on HSL Zuid and the Betuweroute).|$|E
25|$|Line 1 {{is built}} upon the old surface-level line, and was opened in 2006, {{spanning}} 26.2km with 22 stations. The Shuanglin station {{was closed for}} upgrading on December 28, 2016. And the old <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> (DKZ9 Series) were replaced at the same time.|$|R
25|$|Rolling stocks on the Taipei Metro are {{multiple}} unit <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks,</b> using a third rail to provide electricity (750 volts DC) for propulsion.

30|$|Besides {{branch line}} closures, {{important}} investments {{were made on}} the main lines (second tracks, electrifications, new signaling systems, higher speed tracks, new <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks)</b> and the first motorway sections were also built this time along with a comprehensive secondary road paving program.|$|R
5|$|By the 1980s country {{passenger}} services were run down, and older wooden <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> was now approaching their use by date. As a result, the N type carriages were introduced from 1981, {{followed by the}} converted H type stock from 1984. Since then, diesel multiple units have become the norm for new purchases, with the Sprinter introduced in 1992, and the VLocity from 2005.|$|E
5|$|For the {{extension}} to Queen's Park, the LER supplemented the existing <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> with 14 new carriages ordered from Brush Traction and Leeds Forge Company plus spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP These carriages, the 1914 stock, {{were the first}} to have doors in the sides of the carriages as well as the ends. For the longer extension to Watford, the LER and the LNWR ordered 72 new carriages from the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. Manufacture of this <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> was delayed by the war, and, while it was waiting for delivery, the Bakerloo Tube used spare 1915 stock carriages ordered for an unfinished extension of the CLR to Ealing Broadway and more spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP Delivery of the carriages for the Watford service, known as the Watford Joint stock because ownership was shared with the LNWR, began in 1920; they were painted in the LNWR's livery to distinguish them from trains operating only on the Bakerloo Tube's tracks.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{as part of}} the commemorations of the 70th {{anniversary of}} the {{creation}} of the Wood Green Local Board, the railway goods depot was used for a three-day exhibition of locomotives and other railway <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> The exhibition was a great success, and was visited by around 14,000spectators. Among locomotives on exhibit were the land speed record holder Mallard and a Class 9F steam locomotive.|$|E
