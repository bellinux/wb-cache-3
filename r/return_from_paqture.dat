In this paper, we study financial contracting between an investor and a firm with private information about its <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> exploration and exploitation. The investor-optimal mechanism offers contracts with different tolerance for failures to screen <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> exploitation, and with different exposure to the project's revenues to screen <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> exploration. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for private information about <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> exploration to have zero value to the firm. When these conditions fail, private information about exploration may even decrease the firm's payoff...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilise}} {{and improve their}} income situation, rural households are strongly encouraged to diversify their activities {{both within and outside}} the agricultural sector. Often, however, this advice is only moderately pursued. This paper addresses issues of rural household income diversification in the case of Poland. It investigates <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> rural household income strategies using propensity score matching methods and extensive datasets spanning 1998 - 2008. Results suggest that <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> combining farm and off-farm activities were lower than <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> concentrating on farming or on self-employment outside agriculture. This differential is stable over time although <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> diversification have relatively improved after Poland’s accession to the EU. This is also visible in the fact that since 2006 <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> combining farm and off-farm activities have evened with <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> relying solely on hired off-farm labour, thus smoothing the difference observed before the accession. Further, over the analysed period, households pursuing the diversification strategy performed better than those relying solely on unearned income. Finally, in general, the income in households combining farm and off-farm activities was higher than in those combining two off-farm income sources...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Old Testament)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Biblical {{scholars}} frequently {{recognize the}} association of the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile with the themes of creation and redemption in Isaiah, and in the Prophets generally. However, {{since the publication of}} von Rad's article, "The theological problem of the Old Testament doctrine of creation" (1936), the focus of modern biblical scholarship has been, almost exclusively, on the relationship between creation and exodus typology (the new exodus) and not on the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile itself as a biblical theological theme. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} carry out a thorough investigation of the biblical theological significance of the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile in Isaiah. Our main objective is to demonstrate that there is a significant, unifying explanation of {{the association of}} the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile with the themes of creation and redemption. From our survey of the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile in modern biblical scholarship, we find that, generally, scholars explain the linking of the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile with the themes of creation and redemption, just as a means of assuring the exiles that the LORD will redeem them again, and will do so in a more glorious way than in the exodus. The bulk of this paper is taken up with a grammatical-historical and biblical theological analysis of the book of Isaiah in order to identify the biblical theological themes associated with the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile. Subsequently, we show that in Isaiah the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile plays an increasingly significant role as a type of the greater, spiritual and eschatological redemption. From this footing, our thesis is substantiated and defended by comparing the biblical data and our findings with the explanations given by other scholars. Thus, we conclude that the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> exile is itself a type of redemption by new creation pointing to a greater, spiritual and eschatological "return from exile," accomplished in Christ.
