5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} full-fledged <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: In Australia, {{changes in}} social {{attitude}} to conservation {{and the environment}} over the past sixty years has demanded changes to property <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> In Queensland, as in most jurisdictions in Australia, {{there has been an}} increase in controls and a gradual and progressive unbundling of traditionally held property rights as a response by governments to this social change. This project investigated the property <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of land owners in Queensland with property which adjoins the littoral zone. This gave an insight into the number and type of property <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> which are unique to property with a littoral boundary. The study also examined how these property <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were spatially defined and how they were recorded for land administration. Field surveys were carried out at three sites to examine the spatial extent of <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in a real world environment. Results showed that while private property <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were recorded under the current titling system, most publicly created <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were not. The study also revealed problems with how <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> are defined spatially in legislation which lead to ambiguity in defining these <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in the real world. Finally it was found that where information was available in relation to the spatial extent of <b>rights,</b> restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> it was often inaccurate...|$|R

5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E
5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing. On March 4, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided the Premier's house, they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh, whose office had to assist, and placed him under a gag order. The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the prevailing modernist conception of ethics, wherein responsibility toward others {{is seen as the}} necessary cost one has to bear in exchange for the right to pursue individual self-interest, Levinas calls into question the claim to a natural drive toward self-interest and individual freedom. He argues instead that our basic condition, or “ethical nature,” is a commitment to the rights of the other person. However, in order to understand Levinas’s inversion of the traditional model, {{it is important to understand}} the backdrop against which it stands. In this chapter, we begin by unpacking the traditional Western view of <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility,</b> drawing especially on the social contract theories of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. We then discuss Levinas’s approach to <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility,</b> <b>and,</b> finally, we explore the implications of such a conception for moral education...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and interpret}} adolescents´ lived experiences of their <b>rights,</b> duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> {{in relation to}} their health choices. Fourteen focus group interviews with 67 adolescents aged 15 and 16 were conducted and analysed using the phenomenological hermeneutical method. Adolescents´ lived experiences of their rights {{in relation to their}} health choices were described as things that were allowed. Duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were perceived as something that they were required to carry out for their own health or other people´s health. Although their experiences of <b>rights,</b> duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> overlapped, they referred to different aspects of their health choices. Adolescents viewed their <b>rights,</b> duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in the wider context, with parents and society defining their opportunities to make independent choices. We found that ethical considerations influenced adolescents´ choices and, the opportunities to exercise their <b>rights,</b> duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> varied.
