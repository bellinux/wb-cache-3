She was married to Miguel Salas Anzures ( [...] head of fine arts, INBA [...] ) who made possible to other ways of artistic expressions and not only the traditional and official art.|$|E
50|$|Gentry {{was awarded}} a studio at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris and worked there for four years. During this period he experimented, working in acrylic on <b>raw</b> <b>linen.</b> He befriended many artists he met at the Cité: Mordecai Ardon, Gerald Jackson, Francisca Lindberg, Christine O'Loughlin, Vicente Pimentel, Mary Anne Rose, Grace Renzi, and Ulla Waller. He had solo {{exhibitions}} in the United States and Sweden: Randall Gallery, NYC, 1978; Fabien Carlsson Gallery, Gothenburg, Sweden, 1977; Montclair State College, Montclair, New Jersey, 1977.|$|E
50|$|Born in San Francisco, Kohlberg {{moved to}} New York {{and set up}} a {{business}} buying linen in Ireland which was then shipped to China, where local weavers turned the <b>raw</b> <b>linen</b> into fine textiles. The finished products were then sent to the United States where they were sold to consumers as luxury fabrics. His business interests led him to travel often to China. During one such trip in 1943, after inspecting the progress of the Chinese war effort, he became convinced him that the many stories in the American press of Chiang Kai-shek's corruption were false and were being spread by communist sympathizers.|$|E

50|$|Myra {{introduced}} a new technique of engraving on metal, utilizing acids, but printed from the surface, called Metal Relief. She had her first exhibition in Mexico in 1963 and gradually {{became one of the}} leading Latin American women artists. Her Metal Relief works were well received by art critic Paul Westheim in the important magazine El Nuevo Arte de los Metales and by art connoisseur, reviewer and historian Jorge Olvera. She continued her in-depth research and found her definitive expression in painting with pastel on <b>raw</b> <b>linen.</b> In this technique she was a pioneer. Her thematic approach was also new: she was the first Latin American abstract painter to use movements of free geometrical lines. All her works since 1965 are called Rhythms.|$|E
50|$|Magnolia Editions (aka Magnolia Tapestry Project and Magnolia Press) is a {{fine art}} studio in Oakland, California. Founded in 1981, Magnolia Editions publishes fine art projects, {{including}} unique and editioned works on paper, artist books, and public art. The studio includes facilities for etching/intaglio printing as well as digital printing onto substrates such as gessoed panel, glass, leather, plexiglas, aluminum, or <b>raw</b> <b>linen.</b> Several artists have worked at Magnolia to realize major commissions for the San Francisco International Airport and the Oakland International Airport. Other recent projects have incorporated a mix of traditional and digital techniques, such as a digital photogravure method in which a 'resist' is digitally printed on an etching plate, developed by Magnolia Editions director Donald Farnsworth, and projects which merge painting and printmaking by printing acrylic color over hand-painted, three-dimensional textures.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Corday {{moved her}} studio from Tokyo, Japan to Seville, Spain. The years in Spain (2000-2004), Corday's palette {{was limited to}} black. Corday created her own paint mulling raw pigment and {{charcoal}} into a synthetic polymer base to create a tar-like substance and fabricated tools for its application to <b>raw</b> <b>linen</b> and canvas. Corday {{moved back to the}} United States in 2005 to a studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York. She created a series of painted works as abstract blueprints for the form HELDAN and the PROTOIST Series. In 2009, Corday's painted work entitled THAHLES (72×216 inches) was acquired by the Richard Meier collection installed at 165 Charles Street, New York City, New York. And in 2013, PROME was acquired by the collection of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill’s San Francisco office, overseen by Craig W. Hartman.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with <b>raw</b> meat, white <b>linen,</b> sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{described}} as the English Yves Saint Laurent for his French approach to tailoring and fabrics, McDonnell's design inspiration was Balenciaga and he said his aim was to design clothes that could be worn by {{women between the ages}} of 18 and 45. The label became well known for its woollen and jersey knitwear and its use of fine materials such as tweed and silk - although it also responded to fashion trends such as the early '70s craze for cheesecloth and calico. By 1973, an article in The Guardian noted he had carved a niche for daywear, in contrast to a focus on eveningwear by many designer contemporaries, and was the first British designer to produce a classic silk shirt for women. The article added: [...] "He has a feeling for fabrics, whipping up the luxury naturals...in pure silk, <b>raw</b> silk, heavy <b>linens,</b> cottons, natural wools and cashmeres...His day clothes provide the perfect balance of the tailored and the dressmakery." ...|$|R
50|$|A Maryland native, Corday's {{interest}} {{in the arts and}} science was marked by her classical training in piano during her formative years. In 1991, before receiving her B.A. in Communication Arts (1992), she wrote an original research paper which led to an Astrophysics internship at NASA Ames Research Center.Corday continued her academic studies later on in graduate courses in Cultural Anthropology at Washington University. From 1992-99, she worked in graphic and structural design for advertising companies, such as Wieden+Kennedy, Bartle Bogle Hegarty, and SKUzzio Design.In 1999 and 2000, Corday began devoting her time to painting. She spent one year in Tokyo, Japan, then would later go to Seville, Spain for three years working on her sound and tidal energy project called Instrument for the Ocean to Play.Corday's work and experiences in Spain shifted her palette to black, hand-making her own tar-like paint through raw pigments, charcoal, and synthetic polymers, and fabricated tools to apply the paint to <b>raw</b> <b>linen</b> and canvas. Corday's black palette painting are considered to be early blueprints of her sculptural work.|$|E

50|$|Today, he is {{best remembered}} for his {{financial}} reforms, and he is often cited {{as an example of}} a good governor of a domain. Yonezawa had been in debt for roughly a hundred years when Harunori took over; Shigesada even considered returning the domain to the shogunate as a last resort. However, he was convinced by his father-in-law, the daimyō of Owari Province, to instead resign as daimyō. It was under these conditions that Harunori came to be daimyō of Yonezawa. He introduced strict disciplinary measures, and ordered the execution of several karō (advisors) who opposed his plans. As a result of various measures he took, Yonezawa became fairly prosperous, and did not suffer much from the famine which swept Japan in the Tenmei era (1781-1789). For instance the Uesugis chose to keep all their retainers but cut all salaries to one-sixth of their former level. Yozan also cut his own living expenses, wearing cotton clothes instead of silk and having his meals consist of one bowl of soup and one vegetable. He reduced his living allowance from 1500 ryō per year to 209 ryō and the number of maidservants from 50 to nine. He also set policies encouraging new industry such as weaving, pottery and papermaking and encouraged existing enterprises such as paraffin, <b>raw</b> silk and <b>linen.</b> Education was necessary to create the brilliant men required to enrich the country, and he reopened the clan school which had closed down due to financial constraints and invited scholars from Edo to teach. He also established a medical school to teach the latest medical knowledge from Holland. Another policy change ensured adequate water from the mountains for the rice fields by enlisting retainers and samurai to dig irrigation ditches and to repair dikes. Administrative reform and personnel promotion based on merit, not class, eliminated waste and simplified public offices. When Yōzan came to power, the total debt of the fief had reached the level of 200,000 ryō; by 1823 the entire amount of the debt had been repaid. In 1830, less than a decade after Harunori's death, Yonezawa was officially declared by the shogunate to be a paragon of a well-governed domain.|$|R

40|$|The {{body image}} of the Turin Shroud {{has not yet been}} {{explained}} by traditional science; so a great interest in a possible mechanism of image formation still exists. We present preliminary results of excimer laser irradiation (wavelength of 308 nm) of a <b>raw</b> <b>linen</b> fabric and of a linen cloth. The permanent coloration of both linens is a threshold effect of the laser beam intensity, and it can be achieved only in a narrow range of irradiation parameters, which are strongly dependent on the pulse width and time sequence of laser shots. We also obtained the first direct evidence of latent images impressed on linen that appear in a relatively long period (one year) after laser irradiation that at first did not generate a clear image. The results are compared with the characteristics of the Turin Shroud, reflecting the possibility that a burst of directional ultraviolet radiation may {{have played a role in}} the formation of the Shroud image...|$|E

We present experimental results of excimer laser irradiation (wavelengths 308 nm and 193 nm) of a <b>raw</b> <b>linen</b> fabric and of a linen cloth, seeking for a possible mechanism of image formation. We achieved a permanent coloration of both linens as a threshold effect of the laser beam intensity. The coloration is obtained in a surprisingly narrow range of irradiation parameters: the shorter the laser wavelength, the narrower the range. We also obtained the first direct evidence of latent coloration impressed on linen that appears in a relatively long period (one year) after a laser irradiation that at first did not generate an evident coloration.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade’s flax fabrics are {{reverting}} as draperies, curtains and other interior materials. The necessity for reduced flammability of such textiles has been increased by governmental legislations {{in many countries}} [1]. It is noticeable, that hazards may occur by fires as the combined effects of smoke and toxic gases. Standards and codes of human safety based on recognized general requirements of fire protection are obligatory for lot of textile materials used in building, transport, construction, home and protection garments [2]. All fabrics will burn with some being more combustible than others. The burning rates can be reduced with flame retardants (FR), applied through treatment [3] with chemicals, such as inorganic salts, mix of ammonium polyphosphates, halogen donators, expandable graphite (intumescent) etc. [1]. The choice of every individual FR and kind of treatment depends on requirements for produced material. The antimony compounds can be safely used for the textile treatment without causing a risk to {{human health and the}} environment [4].
