40|$|For example, {{a common}} {{mistake in the}} {{furniture}} sector regarding environmental requirements {{is the belief that}} the selection of material with less environmental impact could be the best choice to a product with less environmental impact. This is not always true. The following example may illustrate the issue: comparing the environmental impact of the life cycles of two chairs, one made of <b>recyclable</b> cardboard <b>paper</b> and the other one of wood. At first, one may imagine that the cardboard paper chair has a smaller environmental impact in relation to the wooden chair in the preproduction and production phases (that is, in the phase in which the material is selected e in the fabrication process). However, if the entire life cycle of the chairs is considered, it is known that the wooden chair lasts around 12 years, whereas the <b>recyclable</b> cardboard <b>paper</b> chair lasts much less. Therefore, in order for the <b>recyclable</b> cardboard <b>paper</b> chair to fulfill the same function as the wooden chair, that is, to be used for 12 years, {{it will have to be}} reconstructed several times. As a consequence, the value of the initial environmental impact the chair made of <b>recyclable</b> cardboard <b>paper</b> should be multiplied by as many times as it would need to be reconstructed, which leads to a higher impact value than that of the life cycle impact of the wooden chair. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} printed on {{recycled}} and <b>recyclable</b> <b>papers.</b> ii Executive Summary Flooding, upland soil and streambank erosion, sedimentation, and contamination {{of drinking water}} from agricultural chemicals (nutrients and pesticides/herbicides) are critical environmental problems in Illinois. Upland soil erosion causes loss of fertile soil, streambank erosion causes loss of valuable riparian lands, and both contribute large quantities of sediment (soil and rock particles) in the water flowing through streams and rivers, which causes turbidity in sensitive biological resource areas and fills water supply and recreational lakes and reservoirs. Most of these physical damages occur during severe storm and flood events. Eroded soil and sediment also carry chemicals that pollute water bodies and stream/reservoir beds. Court Creek and its 97 -square-mile watershed in Knox County, Illinois, experience problems with flooding and excessive streambank erosion. Several fish kills reported in the streams of this watershed were due to agricultural pollution. Because o...|$|R

40|$|This {{report was}} printed on {{recycled}} and <b>recyclable</b> <b>papers.</b> iii The {{rapid increase in}} population and developed land in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area has placed a heavy demand on water resources. Water sources {{most likely to be}} developed in this region during the next few decades are shallow aquifers. Since shallow aquifers are vulner-able to surface-derived contaminants, the increase in developed land may be escalating the rate at which groundwater quality is being degraded. A statistical study of historical groundwater quality data was undertaken to determine if urbanization activities have affected shallow ground-water quality. Of the major ions, chloride (Cl-) concentrations have shown the largest increases in the region, due primarily to road salt runoff. In the majority of shallow public supply wells in the western and southern collar counties of DuPage, Kane, McHenry, and Will, Cl- concentra-tions have been increasing since the 1960 s. About 43 percent of wells in these counties have rate increases greater than 1 milligram per liter per year (mg/L/yr) and 15 percent have increases greater than 4 mg/L/yr. Approximately 24 percent of samples collected from public supply well...|$|R

The reservoir was created in 1922 by constructing a dam to impound the flow of the Sangamon River. The dam was modified in 1956 to increase the maximum capacity of the lake to 28, 000 acre-feet. The lake receives water from the 925 -square-mile watershed of the Upper Sangamon River that includes portions of seven counties in east-central Illinois. Lake Decatur has high nitrate-N concentrations which have been consistently exceeding the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) drinking water standard of 10 milligrams per liter (mg/L) since 1980. This has created a serious situation for the drinking water supply of the City of Decatur, since nitrate-nitrogen (N) cannot be removed from finished drinking water through regular water purification processes. Since 1993, the Illinois State Water Survey (ISWS) has been monitoring the Lake Decatur watershed for trends in discharge, nitrate-N concentration, and nitrate-N yield and t...|$|R
50|$|In Thailand {{the roles}} in solid waste {{management}} (MSW) and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is then divided among the central government, regional governments, and local governments. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible to stimulate regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating central and local governments. Local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area. Local governments themselves do not dispose of waste, but instead hire private companies that have been granted that right by the PCD. A major problem is lack of funding for waste management—the average Thai household pays less than one dollar a month to dispose of their solid waste. The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center; General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO); SGS Thailand; Waste Management Siam Ltd (WMS); and Better World Green Public Company Limited (BWG). A leading resource recovery company is Wongpanit, who purchase mixed <b>recyclables</b> (<b>paper,</b> plastics, glass, aluminum, steel) at about 11,300 baht per tonne.

40|$|Many UK local authorities, {{looking to}} meet their {{regulatory}} recycling targets, have opted for voluntary kerbside collection schemes for source segregated recyclables from households. The success of a recycling service is highly dependant {{on the number of}} people who participate in the service and the frequency of its use. High participation rates are therefore an essential component of any effective kerbside collection scheme. It is commonly accepted that recycling behaviour is strongly influenced and motivated by personal opinions as well as external issues such as access and convenience. This paper characterises the recycling attitudes within West Oxfordshire, UK, and compares them with the results from a previous study conducted during 2003 in Brixworth, in Daventry, UK. From 1 st April 2004, West Oxfordshire District Council, expanded its kerbside collection scheme for dry recyclables, adding cardboard, batteries, aerosols and mixed plastics to the already collected <b>recyclables</b> (<b>paper,</b> glass, textiles and metals) and increasing the frequency from fortnightly to weekly In this study, the recycling attitudes and behaviour of a cross-sectional socio-economic sample from households from West Oxfordshire, is investigated. It is observed that the propensity to recycle varies between individuals and socio-economic areas, and that recycling is influenced by concern for future generations, the need to bury less waste in landfills, and the fact that recycling saves resources and protects the environment. The results from this study can be used to help inform local authorities who are considering the development of their recycling schemes and associated promotional campaigns based on an understanding of their socio-demographic profile.
