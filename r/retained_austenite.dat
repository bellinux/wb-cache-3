40|$|High {{chromium}} irons {{are well}} known for their good wear resistance. Since they are brittle, they tend to fracture under impact. Hence, {{there is a need}} to improve the impact property with minimal reduction in wear characteristics. Towards this end, manganese, known for its tendency to <b>retain</b> <b>austenite</b> and containing 5 and 10 % in chromium (16 - 19 %) irons has been tried. Since the mechanical properties are microstructure sensitive, the castings are made in both metal and sand moulds followed by thermal treatment. The as-cast and heat-treated samples are examined microstructurally and then evaluated for hardness, and impact properties. While the hardness decreases with increase in manganese content from 5 to 10 % irrespective of the sample condition (i. e., mould type/heat treatment adopted), the impact property shows two different trends. The 10 % metal cooled manganese bearing sample exhibits higher values compared to the 5 % ones. On the other hand, for the sand case, 5 % manganese shows higher impact energy compared to the 10 % ones. Thus, there is a reversal in the impact behavior for the same level of increase in manganese content for these two cases. These findings are correlated with the structural features noticed through microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Multiphase TRIP-assisted steels are {{particularly}} interesting for the automotive industry, as they exhibit an exceptional strength-ductility balance {{due to the}} combination of a multiphase microstructure and the mechanically-induced transformation of metastable austenite to martensite (i. e. the TRIP effect). The multiphase microstructure - and the retention of metastable austenite - is achieved through {{the combination of a}}ppropriate chemistry and heat treatment conditions, i. e. an intercritical anneal followed by an isothermal dwell in the temperature range for bainite formation. The present work focuses mainly on the effect of heat treatment conditions that are compatible with CGL process, i. e. a high bainitic dwell temperature, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of two TRIP-assisted steel grades differing by their silicon and aluminium contents. It has thus been established that it seems easier to <b>retain</b> <b>austenite</b> when Si is replaced by Al, and more particularly {{that it was possible to}} retain a significant amount of austenite in a mixed 0. 5 Al- 1. 0 Si grade, and hence to observe a TRIP effect. On the other hand, a Si-alloyed grade did not exhibit a significant retention of austenite, possibly due to carbide precipitation. It has also be seen that the intercritical annealing temperature has a strong influence on the amount of austenite that can ultimately be retained after the bainitic dwell, possibly by affecting the C content in the intercritical austenite...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} as-cast structure of HBHSS consists of a great amount of martensite and M 2 (B,C) and a few <b>retained</b> <b>austenites</b> and M 23 (B,C) 6. After solution treated at 1, 050 °C and followed by oil cooling, the amount of M 23 (B,C) 6 carbo-borides in quenched HBHSS increases obviously and the macrohardness of the quenched HBHSS is 66 HRC, which is very close to the 65. 8 HRC of as-cast HBHSS. On the whole, the hardness of HBHSS alloy shows a trend of slight decrease with increasing {{tempering temperature}} when tempered below 500 °C. While when above 500 °C, the hardness increases slightly as the tempering temperature increases and reaches a peak at 525 °C and then decreases obviously. The impact toughness of HBHSS has a tendency to increase as the tempering temperature increases. Tempering can improve the tensile strength and elongation of HBHSS, but a higher tempering temperature causes a slight decrease in both tensile strength and elongation. Excellent wear resistance can be obtained by tempering at 500 to 550 °C...|$|R
5000|$|Tempering {{involves}} a three-step {{process in which}} unstable martensite decomposes into ferrite and unstable carbides, and finally into stable cementite, forming various stages of a microstructure called tempered martensite.

Depending on the carbon content, it also contains {{a certain amount of}} [...] "retained austenite." [...] <b>Retained</b> <b>austenite</b> are crystals which are unable to transform into martensite, even after quenching below the martensite finish (Mf) temperature.

The base alloy is prepared with a chemical composition of 0. 28 % C, 1. 0 % Mn, 1. 0 % Mo, 0. 35 % V, 4. 2 % Cr with trace amount of S and P This alloy displays yield strength of about 1450 MPa in quenched-and-tempered condition. It is further attempted to increase the strength and toughness of the base alloy by addition of 1 to 3 % of nickel. As a result {{there is a substantial}} improvement of mechanical properties. 3 % nickel steel displays tensile strength of 1758 MPa and yield strength of 1 542 MPa. The austenite grains are marginally reduced in nickel alloys. With the chemical composition of nickel alloys when about 0. 07 % titanium is inoculated during ESR process, there is a deterioration of the tensile properties. In 3 % nickel alloy the effect is more prominent, which displays yield strength of 1455 MPa along with the lowest value of elongation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) studies indicate that the microstructures of un-inoculated nickel steel predominantly consist of tempered lath martensites. In titanium inoculated alloys the microstructures are mixture of <b>retain</b> <b>austenite,</b> bainite and martensites.

Charpy impact test demonstrates that it has still high ductility, the fatigue performance isn’t inferior to that before the explosion, the abrasive resistance is higher than that before the explosion and macroscopic residual deformation is extremely small. Such changes are related with the internal stress and changes of metallographic structure after explosion.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} tempering treatment on mechanical properties and the microstructure of DIN 1. 4021 Martensitic Stainless Steel, austenite treatment was conducted for the samples at 1000 ºC temperature for 60 min and then the samples were oil quenched.

TRIP steels also exhibit a strong bake hardening (BH) effect following deformation. Research to date has not shown much experimental evidence of the TRIP-effect enhancing ductility, {{since most of the}} austenite disappears in the first 5% of plastic strain, a regime where the steel has adequate ductility already.

Many proponents of this process claim increased accuracy of the resulting barrels, but independent testing of the process by major manufacturers has shown no increase in accuracy. However, the conversion of austenite to martensite {{has been shown to}} result in easier machining and greater wear resistance on steels that tend to have significant amounts of <b>retained</b> <b>austenite,</b> such as stainless steels, and the process does appear to significantly affect the accurate life of stainless steel barrels.|$|E
40|$|The first {{evidence}} is {{provided for the}} existence of a tetragonal or slightly orthorhombic unit cell of bainitic ferrite.

Thedeviationsfrom the cubic cell are maintained to elevated temperatures, as expected from an increased solubility of carbon in the ferrite.

40|$|Abstract The microstructures and {{mechanical}} properties of Dual Phase (DP), Transformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP), and Quenching & Partitioning (Q&P) steels were investigated {{in order to}} define the strengthening mechanism of 0. 2 C steel.

The Q&P steel was produced from full austenization, followed by quenching to the temperature between M s and M f, and then enriching the carbon to stabilize the austenite throughout the heat treatment. For the DP and TRIP steels, as the intercritical annealing temperature increased, the tensile strength increased and the elongation decreased.

The average grain size achieved in 316 L and 304 L SS is ~ 100 nm, and grain refinement occurs more rapid in 316 L SS than that in 304 L. Also the structures are shown to <b>retain</b> a predominant <b>austenite</b> phase.

Tensile strength of nanocrystalline steels exceeds 1 GPa with good ductility in both systems. Mechanical properties of ECAPed 316 L are also shown to have less dependence on strain rate than ECAPed 304 L. ECAPed steels were shown to exhibit thermal stability up to 600 oC as indicated by retention of high hardness in annealed specimens. Furthermore, there is an increased tolerance to radiation-induced hardening in the nanocrystalline equiaxed materials subjected to 100 keV He ions at an average dose of 3 - 4 displacement-per-atom level at room temperature.

50|$|The common, non-stainless grades contain 17-19 wt.% nickel, 8-12 wt.% cobalt, 3-5 wt.% molybdenum, and 0.2-1.6 wt.% titanium. Addition of {{chromium}} produces stainless grades {{resistant to}} corrosion. This also indirectly increases hardenability as they require less nickel: high-chromium, high-nickel steels are generally austenitic {{and unable to}} transform to martensite when heat treated, while lower-nickel steels can transform to martensite. Alternative variants of Ni-reduced maraging steels are based on alloys of Fe and Mn plus minor additions of Al, Ni, and Ti where compositions between Fe-9wt.% Mn to Fe-15wt.% Mn have been used. The Mn has a similar effect as Ni, i.e. it stabilizes the austenite phase. Hence, depending on their Mn content, Fe-Mn maraging steels can be fully martensitic after quenching them from the high temperature austenite phase or they can contain <b>retained</b> <b>austenite.</b> The latter effect enables the design of maraging-TRIP steels where TRIP stands for Transformation-Induced-Plasticity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first stage}} of {{tempering}} occurs between room-temperature and 200 C. In the first stage, carbon precipitates into ε-carbon (Fe24C). In the second stage, occurring between 150 C and 300 C, the <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> transforms into a form of lower-bainite containing ε-carbon rather than cementite (archaically referred to as [...] "troostite"). The third stage occurs at 200 C and higher. In the third stage, ε-carbon precipitates into cementite, and the carbon content in the martensite decreases. If tempered at higher temperatures, between 650 C and 700 C, or for longer amounts of time, the martensite may become fully ferritic and the cementite may become coarser or spheroidize. In spheroidized steel, the cementite network breaks apart and recedes into rods or spherical shaped globules, and the steel becomes softer than annealed steel; nearly as soft as pure iron, making it very easy to form or machine.|$|E
5000|$|Martempering (Marquenching): Martempering is not {{actually}} a tempering procedure, hence the term [...] "marquenching". It {{is a form}} of isothermal heat treatment applied after an initial quench, typically in a molten salt bath, at a temperature just above the [...] "martensite start temperature". At this temperature, residual stresses within the material are relieved and some bainite may be formed from the <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> which did not have time to transform into anything else. In industry, this is a process used to control the ductility and hardness of a material. With longer marquenching, the ductility increases with a minimal loss in strength; the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize. Then the steel is cooled at a moderate speed to keep the temperature gradient minimal. Not only does this process reduce internal stresses and stress cracks, but it also increases the impact resistance.|$|E
50|$|Characterization of microstructures {{has also}} been {{performed}} using x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques for many years. XRD {{can be used to}} determine the percentages of various phases present in a specimen if they have different crystal structures. For example, the amount of <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> in a hardened steel is best measured using XRD (ASTM E 975). If a particular phase can be chemically extracted from a bulk specimen, it can be identified using XRD based on the crystal structure and lattice dimensions. This work can be complemented by EDS and/or WDS analysis where the chemical composition is quantified. But EDS and WDS are difficult to apply to particles less than 2-3 micrometers in diameter. For smaller particles, diffraction techniques can be performed using the TEM for identification and EDS can be performed on small particles if they are extracted from the matrix using replication methods to avoid detection of the matrix along with the precipitate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{annealing}} process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region {{for a set}} period of time. During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity. The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed into martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition. By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, {{as well as the}} degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled. Depending on processing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. [...] TRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of Austen and bainite in a ferrite matrix. Thermal processing for TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region {{for a period of time}} sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse into austenite. The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there. This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product. While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the <b>retained</b> <b>austenite.</b> This, in turn, lowers the martensite start temperature to below room temperature. Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite). This combination of micro-structures has the added benefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming. This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger. Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa. Martensitic steels are also high in C and Mn. These are fully quenched to martensite during processing. The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel. Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and amount}} of the <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> in the duplex microstructure of martensite and lower bainite of a low alloy cold die steel (it is called GD steel for short) with high strength and high toughness have been investigated. The thermal and mechanical stabilities of the <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> were analyzed. Furthermore the effects of <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> on the mechanical properties of the steel were studied. The {{results show that the}} morphology {{and amount of}} <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> vary with silicon content in the steel. <b>Retained</b> <b>austenite</b> with high stability is responsible for the simultaneous increase in strength and toughness of the steel. The duplex microstructure of martensite and abnormal lower bainite of the steel with the maximum silicon content exhibits a relatively good strength-toughness combination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effects of {{acicular}} ferrite and <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> on the mechanical properties of bainite-base steels were investigated. Various morphology and volume fraction of constituent phases {{have been obtained}} by control of hot rolling conditions and alloy compositions. It {{has been shown that}} the steels containing <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> have better combinations of strength and ductility than the ones with no <b>retained</b> <b>austenite.</b> However, there is no noticeable change in DBTT by the incorporation of <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> in the microstructure since <b>retained</b> <b>austenite</b> exists as fine particles. On the other hand, DBTT of the steels are largely affected by the presence of {{acicular ferrite}} in the microstructure. EBSD analyses of fractured Charpy specimens show that cracks are deflected within the morphological packet of acicular ferrite, indicating its role in reducing the effective grain size of the steels...|$|E
