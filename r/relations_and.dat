By the calculation, we find the classical <b>and</b> quantum dispersion <b>relation</b> <b>and</b> transmissivity are identical.

40|$|Abstract. The {{variable}} precision probabilistic {{rough set}} model {{is based on}} equivalent <b>relation</b> <b>and</b> probabilistic measure. However, the requirements of equivalent <b>relation</b> <b>and</b> probabilistic measure are too strict to satisfy in some practical applications. In order to solve the above problem, a variable precision rough set model based on covering <b>relation</b> <b>and</b> uncertainty measure is proposed. Moreover, {{the upper and lower}} approximation operators of the proposed model are given, while the properties of the operators are discussed...|$|R

These two goal programming models are also extended to obtain the collective priority vector of several incomplete fuzzy preference relations. Finally, two illustrative numerical examples are given to verify the developed models...|$|R

5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory.

Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

5000|$|The {{relation}} [...] "injects into" [...] is a preorder (that is, a reflexive <b>and</b> transitive <b>relation),</b> <b>and</b> [...] "be isomorphic" [...] is an equivalence relation. Also embeddability {{is usually}} a preorder, and similarity {{is usually a}}n equivalence relation (which is natural, but not provable {{in the absence of}} formal definitions). Generally, a preorder leads to an equivalence <b>relation</b> <b>and</b> a partial order between the corresponding equivalence classes. The Schröder-Bernstein property claims that the embeddability preorder (assuming that it is a preorder) leads to the similarity equivalence <b>relation,</b> <b>and</b> a partial order (not just preorder) between classes of similar objects.|$|R

5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields.

Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power <b>relations,</b> <b>and</b> sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E
