25|$|However, Haig, who {{in dealing}} with these matters favoured {{confirming}} the death sentence for the perceived ringleader while commuting similar sentences for other soldiers involved in the same incident, deemed Braithwaite the <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> for the mutiny and as was his habit, confirmed the sentence of death. The sentences passed onto the Australians were commuted to two-years punishment with hard labour. Braithwaite was shot by a firing squad {{early in the morning}} of 29 October 1916. The only New Zealand soldier executed for mutiny during the war, he is buried in the St Sever Cemetery Extension in the city of Rouen.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 70% of Superfund cleanup {{activities}} {{historically have}} been paid for by parties responsible (PRPs) for the cleanup of contamination. The exceptions occur when the <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> either cannot be found or is unable {{to pay for the}} cleanup. Until the mid-1990s, most of the funding came from a tax on the petroleum and chemical industries, reflecting the polluter pays principle, but since 2001, most of the funding for cleanups of hazardous waste sites has come from taxpayers. Despite the name, the program has suffered from under-funding, and Superfund cleanups have decreased to a mere 8 in 2014, out of over 1,200. As a result, the EPA typically negotiates consent orders with PRPs to study sites and develop cleanup alternatives, subject to EPA oversight and approval of all such activities.|$|E

Because LPSDP shared office space with the press, in effect, she {{was in charge of}} the finances and daily operations of LPSDP. In February 1922, she revived the publication of Lietuvos žinios and Lietuvos ūkininkas. The publications were outspoken about their ideals and did not shy from criticism of the government for which Bortkevičienė faced fines and arrests. In 1923 alone there were 17 lawsuits where Bortkevičienė was named as the <b>responsible</b> <b>party.</b> For publishing a caricature of Prime Minister Vytautas Petrulis and Minister of Defense Leonas Bistras in October 1925, she was fined 2,000 litas or imprisonment for 1.5 months. Not having enough funds, she was imprisoned until her friends raised enough money.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the end of}} February 303, a fire {{destroyed}} part of {{the imperial}} palace. Galerius convinced Diocletian that the culprits were Christian conspirators who had plotted with palace eunuchs. An investigation into the act was commissioned, but no <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> was found. Executions followed. The palace eunuchs Dorotheus and Gorgonius were eliminated. One individual, a Peter, was stripped, raised high, and scourged. Salt and vinegar were poured in his wounds, and he was slowly boiled over an open flame. The executions continued until at least April 24, 303, when six individuals, including the bishop Anthimus, were decapitated. The persecution intensified. Now presbyters and other clergymen could be arrested without having even been accused of a crime, and condemned to death. A second fire appeared sixteen days after the first. Galerius left the city, declaring it unsafe. Diocletian would soon follow. Lactantius blamed Galerius's allies for setting the fire; Constantine, in a later reminiscence, would attribute the fire to [...] "lightning from heaven".|$|E

This included the United States Coast Guard, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California Department of Fish and Wildlife including the Office of Spill Prevention and Response, and the Santa Barbara Office of Emergency Management together with the <b>responsible</b> <b>party,</b> Plains All American Pipeline. The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ordered the pipeline operator {{to provide them with}} the ruptured pipe for metallurgical testing in order to establish the condition of the pipe when it failed. All the oil in the pipeline had to be cleaned out before the section could be removed to determine if corrosion, pressure or a series of failures led to the rupture in the pipeline.|$|E

The edict ordered {{the destruction of}} Christian scriptures and places of worship across the empire, and prohibited Christians from assembling for worship. Before the end of February, a fire destroyed part of the Imperial palace. Galerius convinced Diocletian that the culprits were Christians, conspirators who had plotted with the eunuchs of the palace. An investigation was commissioned, but no <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> was found. Executions followed anyway, and the palace eunuchs Dorotheus and Gorgonius were executed. One individual, Peter Cubicularius, was stripped, raised high, and scourged. Salt and vinegar were poured in his wounds, and he was slowly boiled over an open flame. The executions continued until at least 24 April 303, when six individuals, including the bishop Anthimus, were decapitated. A second fire occurred sixteen days after the first. Galerius left the city for Rome, declaring Nicomedia unsafe. Diocletian would soon follow.|$|E

500|$|Some protesters {{resorted to}} illegal means to {{demonstrate}} {{their opposition to the}} project. In December 1989, trees and shrubbery on condemned lots were destroyed in an attempt to prevent them from being transplanted by landscapers. A field office belonging to M.J. Lee Construction Co., a contractor working on the project, was burglarized on March 4, 1990. The perpetrators stole or destroyed tools and poured oil on planning documents. A week later, the fuel lines on heavy equipment were slashed. On the night of April 26, several vehicles at a Creek Turnpike worksite belonging to M.J. Lee were vandalized; the vandals smashed windshields and headlights, stole fuel caps, and dumped mud into the fuel tanks. Messages reading [...] "Death to OTA", [...] "Death to [...] Bellmon" [...] and [...] "Death to Bartlett" [...] (who had recently also become a Tulsa city councilman) were written in mud {{on the side of a}} water truck at the site. The vice president of the firm emphasized that the company alone bore the brunt of the estimated $10,000 ($17,900 in [...] dollars) financial loss, not OTA, and offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the <b>responsible</b> <b>party.</b> Construction signage was also removed or covered up with Tulsans Against Turnpikes signs, and survey markers were relocated. Tulsans Against Turnpikes publicly condemned the vandalism, offering an additional $500 reward for information. A member of the group's board stated [...] "We deplore this kind of cowardly, illegal action. There is no reason for some sick person to take out frustrations on the contractor." [...] In response to the vandalism, Tulsa police launched an investigation, and OTA stated that Oklahoma Highway Patrol officers would be on patrol in the construction areas. On August 11, 1990, a contractor arriving for work discovered a vandal attempting to break the window of a crane. As the employee approached the crane, four people fled the scene. The employee was able to detain two of them, both aged eighteen, until police arrived and cited them for misdemeanor malicious mischief.|$|E

Northrop Grumman facilities released more than 23,798 pounds of toxic chemicals into the air in that year.|$|E
2500|$|Historically about 70 {{percent of}} Superfund cleanup {{activities}} {{have been paid}} for by potentially <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> (PRPs). [...] when the party either cannot be found or is unable {{to pay for the}} cleanup, the Superfund law originally paid for toxic waste cleanups through a tax on petroleum and chemical industries. The chemical and petroleum fees were intended to provide incentives to use less toxic substances. Over five years, $1.6 billion was collected, and the tax went to a trust fund for cleaning up abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.|$|E

2500|$|This belief {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} from some Christians, who feel this gives Satan {{the status of}} sin-bearer alongside Jesus Christ. Adventists have responded by insisting that Satan is not a saviour, nor does he provide atonement for sin; Christ alone is the substitutionary sacrifice for sin, but holds no responsibility for it. In the final judgment, responsibility for sin is passed back to Satan who first caused mankind to sin. [...] As the <b>responsible</b> <b>party,</b> Satan receives the wages for his sin and the sins of all the saved—namely, death. Thus, the unsaved are held {{responsible for their own}} sin, while the saved are no longer held responsible for theirs.|$|E

He shared the widespread hope that the fascists would become a more moderate and <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> upon taking power, but withdrew his support in 1924, voting against the law that restricted press freedom.
