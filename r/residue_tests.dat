In the context of food sampling and <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> for the National Residue Control Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National Residue Control Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the {{veterinary medicinal products}} and medicated feed additives that might be prioritised for <b>residue</b> <b>testing.</b> However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> programme.

40|$|Australia exports a major {{proportion}} of its agricultural production and is {{highly dependent on}} maintaining and developing access to, and competitiveness in, export markets. To preserve Australia’s status as a provider of high quality grain, the majority of Australian primary producers rely on pesticides to protect their crops from pests and diseases, particularly in post-harvest situations. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) supports Australian agriculture by registering and allowing the supply of safe and effective animal health and crop protection products. A residue risk management continuum is established when the effectiveness of chemical registration and control of chemical use regulations is assessed through residue monitoring programs. Programs assess good agricultural practice and provide traceback capacity to investigate areas of concern. Risk communication provides opportunities for continuous improvement. In the early 1960 s, the Australian Government established a non-regulatory body, the national residue survey (NRS). In 2008 - 2009, random monitoring programs were conducted for over 50 commodities (21 grains, five horticultural commodities, 11 fish species, 12 animal species, honey and egg with over 20, 000 samples collected for analytical testing. The NRS grain residue monitoring program {{is presented as a}} case study of the residue risk management continuum demonstrating to overseas markets the high level of residue integrity of Australian grain. Over 4, 000 grain samples are collected and analysed per annum. Most of the samples are collected in the bulk export program where samples are collected from every hatch of every ship loaded at the seventeen Australian grain export terminals. The chemical screens have expanded beyond the multi-residue screen (MRS) insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, to include phosphine, additional herbicides (not included in the MRS), heavy metals and mycotoxins. In its current form, the NRS grains program provides 15 years of <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> data which demonstrates a very high degree of conformance with Australian MRLs and the import tolerances of overseas trading partners. In addition, trends in <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> data demonstrate a decline in the frequency of residue detections and the levels of residue detected. To be confident that <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> results meet the requisite standards, the reliability of the Australian analyses must be assured. The NRS laboratory performance evaluation system has been developed to provide that assurance, using a range of proficiency tests and other techniques in the selection of laboratories for NRS work. <b>Residue</b> <b>testing</b> results are reported against both Australian MRLs and the international MRLs which apply in the relevant export market. NRS maintains databases of overseas MRLs and compares its <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> results of exported commodities against those standards.

40|$|AbstractThe {{precipitation}} of carbides in F 82 H {{steel and}} its model steel (Fe- 0. 2 TaC) were investigated by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) and extracted <b>residue</b> <b>tests</b> (ERT). The effects of tempering on the precipitation in F 82 H steels were elucidated {{on the basis of}} the characterization of carbides, as well as the quantitative estimation of precipitation strengthening at room temperature. Firstly, the number density of precipitates was measured by extracted residue test in Fe- 0. 2 TaC and tempered F 82 H steel, and compared with the TEM observation. It was found that the ratio of volume fraction between the TEM and the ERT was respectively 1. 84 and 0. 54 for Fe- 0. 2 TaC and tempered F 82 H steel, revealing that the collection probability of ERT strongly depends on the precipitate features, size and number density. Effects of annealing on the precipitation in F 82 H steels were investigated by ERT. The amount of carbide showed a non-linear relationship to tempering parameter, TP[*] = [*]T(20 [*]+[*]logt). It steeply increased in the TP range from 15. 3 to 16. 2. The precipitation strengthening in F 82 H steel was estimated to be about 5 – 10 % relative to its proof strength, suggesting that the carbides in F 82 H steel have a minor role on the tensile strength at room temperature, though these precipitates are greatly beneficial for improving the creep and radiation resistance at elevated temperatures...|$|E

Spinosad controls many caterpillar pests in vines, pome fruit and vegetables (including tomatoes and peppers), thrips in tomatoes, peppers and ornamental cultivation and dipterous leafminers in vegetables and ornamentals. The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed {{under a variety of}} conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD 50 or LC 50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions. <b>Residue</b> <b>tests</b> conducted under laboratory conditions using worker honeybees exposed to treated foli-age, indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore, the effects seen in laboratory acute toxicity tests did not trans-late to a more realistic exposure scenario. Semi-field cage studies demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of low bee activity. At high application rates evidence for repellence was seen and in one study some minor effects were noted on brood survival. In field studies dry residues of spinosad were safe to foraging worker honey-bees, with no adverse effects seen on mortality, foraging behaviour, brood or queen.

Also to perform its supercritical fluid extraction optimization. Fatty acid composition was determined using gas chromatography. Total phenolic content was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu method. The antioxidant activity of extracts was determined using DPPH•, ABTS+• and ORAC assays. The results showed that mostly unsaturated fatty acids compose the oil, the phenolic content of the extracts were dependent on the extraction solvent namely that methanol extracts possessed most of phenolic content and antioxidant activity compared to other two. The <b>residue</b> <b>tests</b> showed opposite results that hexane residue contained more phenols and had more antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. Along those tests optimal supercritical fluid extraction parameters were determined with which to obtain best oil yield. The aim of the second part of the project was to determine best extraction mode of unidentified target compound of Chrysochromulina polylepis using solid phase extraction columns of different polarity and ionization and different solvents of different polarity and then to determine whether that compound had toxic effects on sea life or not using fish gill assay. Small scale extractions showed that the best target compound yield was using either acetone or methanol solvents with strong anion exchange column however due to large salt content when upscaled to large scale it was proven ineffective. C 18 column was then chosen which provided nearly as good yield as SAX column on small scale tests.

40|$|Patients {{receiving}} hemodialysis therapy {{risk exposure}} to 'both disinfectants and sterilants. Dialysis equipment is disinfected periodically with strong solutions of hypochlorite or formaldehyde. More recently, reuse of dialyzers has introduced {{the use of}} additional sterilants, such as hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid. The use of these sterilants is recognized by the center staffs and the home patient as a potential risk, and <b>residue</b> <b>tests</b> are carried out {{for the presence of}} these sterilants at the ppm level. Gross hemolysis resulting from accidental hypochlorite infusion has led to cardiac arrest, probably as a result of hyperkalemia. Formaldehyde is commonly used in 4 % solutions to sterilize the fluid paths of dialysis controllers and to sterilize dialyzers before reuse. It can react with red cell antigenic surfaces leading to the formation of anti-N antibodies. Such reactions probably do not occur with hypochlorite or chloramines. The major exposure risk is the low concentration of disinfectant found in municipal water used to prepare 450 L dialysate weekly. With thrice-weekly treatment schedules, the quality requirements for water used to make this solution must be met rigorously. Standards for water used in the preparation of dialysate have recently been proposed but not all patients are treated with dialysate meeting such standards. The introduction of sterilants via tap water is insidious and has led to more pervasive consequences. Both chlorine and chloramines, at concentrations found in potable water, are strong oxidants that cause extensive protein denaturation and hemolysis. Oxidation of the Fe 2 " in hemoglobin to Fe 3 " forms methemoglobin, which is incapable of carrying either 02 or CO 2. Chloramine can form not only methemoglobin, but can also denature proteins within the red cell, thus forming aggregates (Heinz bodies). Chloramines also inhibit hexose monophosphate shunt activity, a mechanism that makes the red cell even more susceptible to oxidant damage. These risks can only be minimized through close cooperation between the clinical staffs and the water carrier's technical personnel...|$|E

40|$|Reliable {{analysis}} of veterinary drug residues in animal-derived foodstuffs represents an important measure to ensure consumer protection. European Legislation addresses this issue, for instance by defining maximum residue level, specifying sampling and monitoring plans, and stipulating performance and validation criteria for analytical methods. Certified reference materials (CRMs) constitute {{an important tool}} for method validation and method performance verification. This article addresses {{the current status of}} legislation, describes characteristics of analytical methods in veterinary drug <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> and then focuses on the challenges and considerations towards the development of new (certified) reference materials in this fieldJRC.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{determined}} {{the sequence of}} a venom allergen phospholipase A 1 from white-faced hornet (Dolichovespula maculata) by cDNA and protein sequencings. This protein of 300 amino acid residues (Dol m I) has no sequence similarity with other known phospholipases. But it has sequence similarity with mammalian lipases; about 40 % identity in overlaps of 123 <b>residues.</b> <b>Tests</b> suggest that hornet phospholipase has weak lipase activity. Hornet venom has 3 major allergens, and another hornet allergen antigen 5 (Dot m V) was previously found to have sequence similarity with a mammalian testis protein and a plant leaf protein...|$|R
40|$|Americans {{consume more}} shrimp {{than any other}} seafood, much of which is {{produced}} on farms in other countries. Antimicrobial drugs are detected occasionally in farmed shrimp, especially in shrimp originating from outside the United States (U. S.). While importing shrimp intended for food containing any antimicrobial is illegal, incentives remain for antimicrobial use by shrimp farmers. Many antimicrobials {{that have been found}} in farmed shrimp have the potential to cause illness in humans. Increasing use of 3 rd party audits, increasing funding for <b>residue</b> <b>testing,</b> and enhancing veterinary infrastructure in exporting countries may help improve current U. S. regulation of farmed shrimp...|$|R
