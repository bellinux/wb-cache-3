This work compared the early phase of duck hepatitis B virus infection in 1 -day-old (D 1) and 28 -day-old (D 28) ducks to determine whether differences in viral or host innate immune response can be related to the difference in outcome. In the first phase, almost immediately after inoculation, virus was taken up by components of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>systems,</b> particularly liver-specific macrophages, Kupffer cells. Very early after infection, the induction of alpha interferon by infected hepatocytes occurred and was rapidly reinforced by recruitment of effector lymphocytes, which directly or indirectly caused apoptosis, eliminating infected hepatocytes, as was seen in mature birds. In addition, a lack of lymphocytic infiltration of the liver was found in D 1 ducks, which supports the suggestion that the innate immune network is less effective in D 1 ducks. Taken together, these results suggest that failure of the co-ordinated innate immune response rather than a defect in induced antiviral cell-mediated immunity may be the key factor which makes baby ducks vulnerable to persistence of hepadnavirus infection. 12 page(s...|$|R

It showed parallel relation with {{the function of the}} <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system.</b> 2) If the ink was small in quantity, it did not give much effects to tumor growth though the function of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> was low. 3) The <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> blocked by the Indian ink method had a connection with the growth of tumor to some extent and gave pictures which accelerated its growth. And stromal reaction near the tumor was weak. 4) Using the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> blocked by the Indian ink method, the appearance of the reticulo-endothelial cells in the tumor tissue was less compared with the control. Vol. Ⅱ Chapter 1 To prove the reaction on the X-rays of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> and tumor growths, the author made an experiment based on the idea of tumor-host relationship. X-rays, 600 r a day continuing 5 days totalling 3000 r, were irradiated into the tumor bed, albino-rat thigh, and then Yoshida sarcoma cells were transplanted on the irradiated part. The influence against tumor growth, survival rates and metastasis were examined and the effects were found as follows: 1) Compared with the control, the tumor growths were restrained in the order of transplanted groups of the next day after irradiation, transplanted groups of 10 days after irradiation, and transplanted groups of 30 days after irradiation. With the survival rates, life extension could be recognized in the same order. 2) Stromal reaction could be strongly found in pre-irradiated groups, especially in these being transplanted the next day. Reticulo-endothelial cells could be found many compared with the control. Above all, it could be presumed that in case of preoperative irradiation, the part of reticulo-endothelial cells which has not been infiltrated by tumor cells shows protection system by stromal reaction.

In the case of intravenous injection to mice LD 50 of this colloid solution proves to be 1. 25 ml/ 20 g (solution containing 100 γ Fe… plus 10 mg/ml of glycyl-lycine), and when 1 / 3 of this amount {{is used as a}} fixed dose for the tracing of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system,</b> there can be observed no side-effects and it yields the desired result. 2. It has been demonstrated that immediately after the in travenous iujection phagocytosis of this colloid solution commences rapidly and Fe… can be detected in reticulo endothelial cells, and subsequently it is utilized for hemoglobin synthesis. Experimentally, it is observed that phagocytotic phase and iron metabolic phase are distinct and in addition, the retension in the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> is rapidly released. 3. This iron colloid can reveal precisely any experimental abnormality of the reticulo-endothelial function. It has been shown that the funcfion of <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> should be studied from two angles of phagocytosis and utilization, and that there is room for further clitical study on the unilateral approach in this study. 4. Compararative studies on the efficiency of commercial, hard-binding iron colloid with this loose-binding colloid have demonstrated that cellular blocking occurs least with this new iron colloid in vivo. In addition, similar comparisons made in vitro likewise verify this point. 5. In the comparison of this colloid with serum iron colloid, no superiority can be seen with either one as regards the efficiency in vivo metabolism.

30|$|PEG {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{coatings}} for NPs to be used in in vivo applications because its hydrophilic and steric nature minimizes protein adsorption and reduces detection by the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> clearance <b>system</b> (RES), prolonging blood circulation for improved cellular target delivery [18]. In certain in vitro cellular diagnostic or gene-delivery applications, PEG-free NPs are used [3, 5, 19] while in other applications, especially those that are in vivo, NPs are often functionalized with PEG (“PEGylated”) [20, 21]. Walkey and colleagues demonstrated that AuNPs not grafted with PEG (“bare AuNPs”) or grafted with different densities of PEG exhibited major differences in the cellular uptake and intracellular agglomeration state [22]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging showed that increasing the PEG density decreased intracellular agglomeration of NPs and reduced the number of NPs per vesicle following incubation with J 774 A. 1 macrophages [22]. These previous results suggest a possibility that the extent of spectral shifting for AuNPs following cellular interaction could depend on whether they are PEGylated since the optical properties of plasmonic NPs are highly sensitive to their local dielectric environment and proximity to other plasmonic NPs [8, 23, 24]. Furthermore, it is unknown if the added PEG layer on PEGylated AuNPs provides a sufficient separation distance between NPs when PEGylated AuNPs are clustered within intracellular vesicles, which is capable of decreasing plasmonic coupling-associated spectral shifts. Because NPs in many applications are PEGylated, it is therefore important to understand how this factor affects the extent of the shift in the NP spectra that occurs. In this paper, we seek to quantitatively assess the shifts that occur when a NP is PEGylated compared with when it is bare to allow for finer design of the NP optical response for a given application.|$|R

This statd appears to be largely independent of serologic specificity; it is also remarkable for its short duration. The present article deals with experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism by which it develops, with special reference to the rSle of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> (R-E) <b>system.</b> Materials and Methods Tests were conducted under the conditions described in the preceding article, Two agents were employed for R-E blockade: 25 per cent coUoidal thorium dioxide (thorotrast, Heyden Co.), and 1 per cent aqueous trypan blue. The dose of thorot~ast was 9 ml.; this was given intravenously 16 hours before the test injection of pyrogen. The dose of trypan blue was 6 ml.; this was given twice, 16 hours and 1 hour previous to injection of the pyrogen. In experiments on the effect of R-E blockade the doses of pyrogens used were the same as those given in the preceding article. In tests of the speed of removal of pyrogen from the blood, the donor animal was prepared for cardiac puncture.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{hallmark}} of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) is microscopically demonstrable lysosomal distension. In mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA), this occurs {{as a result}} of an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase sulphamidase. Consequently, heparan sulphate, a highly sulphated glycosaminoglycan, accumulates primarily within the cells of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> and monocyte-macrophage <b>systems</b> and, most importantly, neurones. Children affected by MPS IIIA experience a severe, progressive neuropathology that ultimately leads to death at around 15 years of age. METHODS: MPS IIIA pathology was addressed in a mouse model using two separate methods of therapeutic gene delivery. A lentiviral vector expressing murine sulphamidase was delivered to 6 -week-old MPS IIIA affected mice either by intravenous injection, or by intraventricular infusion. Therapeutic outcomes were assessed 7 months after gene transfer. RESULTS: After intravenous gene delivery, liver sulphamidase was restored to approximately 30 % of wild-type levels. The resultant widespread delivery of enzyme secreted from transduced cells to somatic tissues via the peripheral circulation corrected most somatic pathology. However, unlike an earlier study, central nervous system (CNS) pathology remained unchanged. Conversely, intraventricular gene delivery resulted in widespread sulphamidase gene delivery in (and reduced lysosomal storage throughout) the brain. Improvements in behaviour were observed in these mice, and interestingly, pathological urinary retention was prevented. CONCLUSIONS: The CNS remains the last major barrier to effective therapy for children affected by LSDs. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the uptake of lysosomal enzymes from the peripheral circulation into the CNS, making direct gene delivery to the brain a reasonable, albeit more challenging, therapeutic option. Future work will further assess the relative advantages of directly targeting the brain with somatic gene delivery with sulphamidase modified to increase the efficiency of transport across the BBB.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} was {{the identification and}} functional characterization of mutations in the ABCA 1 gene in four patients with severe HDL deficiency. SUBJECTS: Patients were referred to the clinic because of almost complete HDL deficiency. METHODS: The ABCA 1 gene was sequenced directly. The analysis of the ABCA 1 protein, ABCA 1 mRNA and ABCA 1 -mediated cholesterol efflux was performed in cultured fibroblasts. Intracellular localization of ABCA 1 mutants was investigated in transfected HEK 293 cells. RESULTS: Two patients were homozygous for mutations in the coding region of the ABCA 1 gene, resulting in an amino acid substitution (p. A 1046 D) and a truncated protein (p. I 74 YFsX 76). The third patient was homozygous for a splice site mutation in intron 35 (c. 4773 + 1 g>a), resulting in an in-frame deletion of 25 amino acids (del p. D 1567 _K 1591) in ABCA 1.

The ability of the bone marrow to develop macrophage colonies in vitro in {{the presence or absence of}} sera from tumour-bearing mice has also been tested. A clear depression of macrophage locomotion and macrophage colony formation in vitro was found in the presence of sera or tumour supernates from tumour-bearing mice as early as 24 to 72 h after tumour inoculation. Similarly, tumour-bearing mice showed marked depression of carbon clearance in tests repeated throughout the first 72 h after tumour inoculation.

Numerous studies on Corynebacterium parvum have shown, in particular, its ability to cause proliferation and enhanced activity of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system.</b> This organism also leads in mice to anaemia and this report describes the simultaneous appearance of a red cell autoantibody in mice injected with C. parvum or another diphtheroid (SF 16) isolated from rheumatoid joint fluid. The significance of this latter observation is considered {{in relation to the}} unexplained anaemia of rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Seven casts of {{generalised}} amyloidosis in the cat, {{occurring in}} 100 consecutive cat autopsies, were studied pathologically. Tissues from 2 of the cats were further investigated using the electron microscope. None of the cats had {{suffered from a}} prolonged infection, but one had had chronic allergic dermatitis. In 6 of the 7 cats chronic hypervitaminosis A coexisted with generalised amyloidosis. It is suggested that chronic hypervitaminosis A, which causes prolonged stimulation of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system,</b> may have predisposed to {{the high incidence of}} generalised amyloidosis reported in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} in the rabbit of an abnormal protein analogous {{in many of}} its properties to the human C-reactive protein has been demonstrated (1). This rabbit acute phase protein reacts only with a special form of the pneumococcal somatic polysaccharide, Cx, whereas human C-reactive protein reacts both with Cx and the classical C polysaccharide. Both the human and the rabbit proteins as they occur in the blood are bound to lipid and in both instances the lipid-protein complexes are precipitable by calcium ion if the salt concentration is low. Both acute phase proteins are antigenic in several laboratory animals (1 - 3). Lipid-free preparations of them, crystalline or not, act as antigens which stimulate in sheep the production of specific antisera which do not react with normal serum. Reciprocal immunological cross-reactions employing sheep antisera to C- and Cx-reactive proteins have recently been demonstrated (3). Although these are partial cross-reactions, they are appreciable. Virtually nothing is yet known concerning any natural biological function of these acute phase proteins to explain their appearance and disappearance from the blood. There is, however, some evidence that the Cx-reactive protein is elaborated in response to appropriate stimuli by some cellular component of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> (4). Blockade of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> with thorotrast reduces the capacity of rabbits to elaborate the abnormal protein...|$|E
40|$|A CAJM {{survey on}} the prevelence of leprosy amongst the Lovale Tribe of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Leprosy is a chronic disease {{due to the}} {{invasion}} of the skin, mucous membranes, peripheral nerves, the cells of the <b>reticulo-endothelial</b> <b>system</b> and, less commonly, certain {{other parts of the body}} (e. g., testis) with the Mycobacterium leprae. We do not know how the bacilli gain entry and become established in the tissues of the host, but all I have observed is in keeping with the view that most infections probably take place through skin abrasions and, just possibly, some, particularly in children, via intact skin...|$|E
40|$|It is over 125 {{years since}} Ilya Metchnikoff {{described}} {{the significance of}} phagocytosis. In this review we examine the early origins and development of macrophage research continuing {{after his death in}} 1916, through the period of the <b>Reticulo-Endothelial</b> <b>System.</b> Studies on these cells resulted in a substantial literature spanning immunology, haematology, biochemistry and pathology. Early histological studies on morphology and in situ labelling laid the foundations to appreciate the diversity and functional capacity of these cells in the steady state and during pathology. We complete this phagocyte retrospective with the establishment of the Mononuclear Phagocyte System nomenclature half a century ago...|$|E
