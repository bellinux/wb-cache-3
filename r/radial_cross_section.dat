For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the pitch diameter is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted H3, would have a pitch diameter 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than base pitch diameter and would thus result in cutting an external thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits {{which is the same}} system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of 0.013 mm.Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.The pitch diameter of a thread is measured where the <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of a single thread equals [...]5 x Pitchexample: 16 pitch thread = 1/16" [...] = [...]0625" [...] the pitch actual pitch diameter of the thread is measured at the <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> measures [...]03125" ...|$|E

Scanning the fan surface with a laser, we find that the transition between the proximal and distal deposits coincides with a distinct slope break. A <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> reveals that the stratigraphy records the signal of this segregation. To interpret these observations, we conceptualize the fan as a radially symmetric structure that maintains its geometry as it grows. When combined with slope measurements, this model proves consistent with the sediment mass balance and successfully predicts the slope of the proximal–distal transition as preserved in the fan stratigraphy. While the threshold-channel theory provides an order-of-magnitude estimate of the fan slopes, driven by the relatively high sediment discharge in our experimental system, the actual observed slopes are 3 – 5 times higher than those predicted by this theory...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the ARPES spectra for {{emission}} from the bonding {{as well as the}} antibonding Fermi surface sheet in Bi_ 2 Sr_ 2 CaCu_ 2 O_ 8 (Bi 2212) possess remarkable site selectivity properties in that the emission for photon energies less than 25 eV is dominated by p → d excitations from just the O-sites in the CuO_ 2 planes. There is little contribution from Cu electrons to the ARPES intensity, even though the initial states at the Fermi energy contain an admixture of Cu-d and O-p electrons. We analyze the origin of this effect by considering the nature of the associated dipole matrix element in detail and find that various possible transition channels (other than p → d on O-sites) are effectively blocked by either the fact that the related <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> is small and/or a lack of available final states.

40|$|Following a {{suggestion}} that a directed relativistic explosion may have a universal intermediate asymptotic, we derive a self-similar solution for an ultra-relativistic jetted blast wave. The solution involves three distinct regions: an approximately paraboloid head where the Lorentz factor γ exceeds ∼ 1 / 2 of its maximal, nose value; a geometrically self-similar, expanding envelope slightly narrower than a paraboloid; and an axial core in which the (cylindrically, henceforth) radial flow u converges inward towards the axis. Most (∼ 80 %) of the energy lies well beyond the leading, head region. Here, a <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> shows a maximal γ (separating the core and the envelope), a sign reversal in u, and a minimal γ, at respectively ∼ 1 / 6, ∼ 1 / 4, and ∼ 3 / 4 of the shock radius. The solution is apparently unique, and approximately agrees with previous simulations, of different initial conditions, that resolved the head. This suggests that unlike a spherical relativistic blast wave, our solution is an attractor, and may thus describe directed blast waves {{such as in the}} external shock phase of a γ-ray burst.

40|$|Cell {{shape is}} {{important}} to understanding the mechanics of three-dimensional (3 D) cell aggregates. When an aggregate of embryonic cells is compressed between parallel plates, the cell mass and the cells {{of which it is}} composed flatten. Over time, the cells typically move past one another and return to their original, spherical shapes, even during sustained compression, although the profile of the aggregate changes little once plate motion stops. Although the surface and interfacial tensions of cells have been attributed to driving these internal movements, measurements of these properties have largely eluded researchers. Here, an existing 3 D finite element model, designed specifically for the mechanics of cell-cell interactions, is enhanced {{so that it can be}} used to investigate aggregate compression. The formulation of that model is briefly presented and enhancements made to its rearrangement algorithms discussed. Simulations run using the model show that the rounding of interior cells is governed by the ratio between the interfacial tension and cell viscosity, whereas the shape of cells in contact with the medium or the compression plates is dominated by their respective cell-medium or cell-plate surface tensions. The model also shows that as an aggregate compresses, its cells elongate more in the circumferential direction than the radial direction. Since experimental data from compressed aggregates are anticipated to consist of confocal sections, geometric characterization methods are devised to quantify the anisotropy of cells and to relate <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> to 3 D properties. The average anisotropy of interior cells as found using <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> corresponds more closely with the 3 D properties of the cells than data from series of parallel sections.

40|$|Deep-ocean, Δ^(14) C, Pb concentrations, and Pb {{isotopes}} were reconstructed from a deep-sea coral Enallopsammia rostrata from 1410 m depth off of Bermuda. Our high-resolution {{time series}} is created from closely spaced <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections,</b> with samples {{taken from the}} center of concentric coral growth bands that we show to be the oldest portion of the section. Prebomb radiocarbon ages from the coral demonstrate that the vertical growth rate of the coral is linear, and the age of the coral is estimated to be 560 – 630 yr old based on the growth rate. Using this age model to reconstruct Δ^(14) C in deep seawater, we first detect bomb radiocarbon at the coral growth site around 1980, and show that Δ^(14) C increased from − 80 ± 1 ‰− 80 ± 1 ‰ (average 1930 – 1979) to a plateau at − 39 ± 3 ‰ (1999 – 2001). Pb/Ca of the coral ranges between 1. 1 – 4. 5 nmol/mol during the 16 th and 17 th centuries, and Pb isotope ratios (^(206) Pb/^(207) Pb = 1. 21, ^(208) Pb/^(207) Pb = 2. 495) in this period agree with pre-anthropogenic values found in the pelagic sediments of the North Atlantic Ocean basin. Coral Pb/Ca is slightly elevated to 6. 2 ± 0. 9 nmol/mol between the 1740 s and the 1850 s and then increases to 25. 1 ± 0. 2 nmol/mol in the 1990 s. The increase in coral Pb/Ca is accompanied by a decrease in coral ^(206) Pb/^(207) Pb and ^(208) Pb/^(207) Pb, indicating that the increase was caused by the infiltration of anthropogenic Pb to the coral growth site. Comparing our data to the surface coral Δ^(14) C and Pb records from Bermuda reveals a time scale of tracer transport from the surface ocean to the coral growth site. Some characteristic features, e. g., the bomb-derived Δ^(14) C increase, appear in the deep ocean approximately 25 yr later than the surface, but the overall increase of Δ^(14) C and Pb in the deep ocean is smaller and slower than the surface, showing the importance of mixing during the transport of these tracers...|$|R
40|$|The tectorial {{membrane}} (TM) {{is thought}} to {{play a critical role}} in stimulating cochlear hair cells. Recently, it has been shown that the tectorial membrane supports traveling waves [14] and that these waves may contribute to cochlear tuning and sensitivity by longitudinally coupling <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> [15]. While previous work examined how TM wave properties may impact a variety of hearing properties, the molecular origins controlling wave propagation are still unclear. To better understand molecular mechanisms, I examined the role of porosity and viscosity in wave propagation. Wave properties were measured for mouse TMs immersed in artificial endolymph solutions with poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) added to increase viscosity. Two PEGs with different molecular weights (MW) were used: one (8 kDa) chosen to penetrate TM pores [30] while the other (400 kDa) could not. Findings show that introducing small MW PEG increases TM wave speeds by - 38 % and decreases wave decay constants by - 42 %. Analysis of a lumped parameter model of the TM showed that these changes in wave parameters can be explained by a change in shear viscosity from ~ 0. 2 Pa*s to ~ 0. 65 Pa*s with no accompanying change in shear modulus. In contrast, introducing large MW PEG has little effect on wave speed (~ 2 %) or decay (- 9 %), suggesting shear viscosity inside the TM is significantly more important compared to fluid viscosity. This result suggests that fluid surrounding the TM has two separate effects on TM motion. First, increasing fluid viscosity has the obvious effect of increasing drag on the surface of the TM. In addition, if high viscosity fluid penetrates the TMs porous structure then the TMs material properties are also directly affected. Of these two effects, the latter has a much greater impact on TM waves. Thus, the porosity of the TM may {{play a critical role in}} cochlear mechanics. by Jonathan Blake Sellon. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{operating}} railway equipment, {{in particular}} the elements, such as a wheel and a rail there is damage accumulation of any kind, causing a premature equipment failure. Thus, {{an analysis of the}} mechanisms and modeling of damage accumulation and fracture both on the surface and in the bulk material remain a challenge. Data on the defective wheel sets to be subjected to facing has been collected and analyzed to assess the locomotive wheel sets damage of the locomotive fleet company of AK «Yakutia Railways», city of Aldan, The Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). For this purpose, three main locomotives have been examined. The object of research carried out in this paper, is a locomotive wheels tire, which is subjected to cyclic impact (dynamic) loads during operation. In this regard, the need arises to determine both the strength of material in response to such shock loads and the quantitative calculation of damage accumulated therein. The accumulated fatigue damage has been attributed to one <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of the wheel coming into contact with the rail once per revolution of the wheel. Consequently, in one revolution a wheel is under one loading cycle. As stated, the average mileage of locomotives to have the unacceptable damages formed on the tread surface is 12 thousand km. Test results establish that along with the high-cycle loading the shock-contact action on rail joints significantly affects the accumulation of damage in the locomotive wheels tire. The number of cycles to failure due to the formation of unacceptable damage in the locomotive wheels tire is N = 2, 4 × 106 and 6 × 105 cycles, respectively, for fatigue and shock-contact loading. In general, we can say that the problem of higher intensity to form the surface damage {{is directly related to the}} operation of the locomotive wheel tire under abnormally low climatic temperatures. With decreasing ambient temperature, this element material rapidly looses its plastic properties, thereby accelerating the process of damage accumulation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Apple {{bruising}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} problems causing loss of apple quality during harvesting and post-harvesting process. The degree of bruising may be described by bruise surface or volume, but manual measurement of these variables is tedious and often inaccurate. Image analysis techniques could be more accurate and reliable. This study was therefore designed as part of a project to develop a semi-automatic system to determine apple bruise size, by establishing an effective method of image analysis for measuring apple bruises in the laboratory. Systems for image analysis of apple bruises were set up using the VIPS (Vision Image Processing System) computer language, a program developed at Massey University. Bruises on fresh and stored "Granny-Smith" apples were made using a falling pendulum, and steel and hockey balls dropped vertically in a series of experiments. Parameters such as bruise width and depth in the bruise cross-section were measured by traditional manual methods and compared with semi-automatic image analysis values. The surface bruise area was also measured by both methods. Bruise volume assessments were made both by estimation from single cross-sections and by taking several cross-sections through the bruise and measuring their thickness. In order to test repeatability of the measurement technique, apple bruises were measured by independent assessors and their results were compared with image analysis data. Bruise width and depth measurements from a <b>radial</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> were the same for the manual method and image analysis. Bruise volumes calculated from these two methods by assuming a geometric shape also gave similar results, regardless of the way in which the bruise was made. However, the standard deviation of bruise volume among the replicates technique from the image analysis was half that for the manual measurement method. Direct measurement of the bruise surface area (after skin removal) by image analysis was five times less variable than by manual measurement. The manual method, however, consistently overestimated bruise area by 10 % compared with the image analysis. An improved method to estimate bruise volume using image analysis is proposed, which does not require a geometric shape of the apple bruise to be assumed. This involves taking a series of sections parallel to the skin. This method was more amenable to image analysis techniques and appears to be more accurate than the traditional manual radial cross-section method for bruise volume assessment...|$|E

The ratio of simulated discharges between two models by surveyed data <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> and SRTM data <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> have index of performance indicator for Nash–Sutcliffe Index (NI) is 0. 95 and index of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0. 41. Index of Performance indicator for comparison of simulated discharges between models with Nash–Sutcliffe Index (NI) is 0. 95 and index of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0. 41. The results show that <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> from SRTM can be an alternative to extract data <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> for Upper Citarum River flood modeling...|$|R
