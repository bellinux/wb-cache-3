The 20 MW BiOlevano project is due to come on stream {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2011 at a cost of €80 million. A key feature is the development of the wood-chip supply chain. A high proportion (more than 85%) of the plant’s raw materials will come from a short supply chain. The BiOlevano unit features very high conversion efficiency (more than 30%) and extremely low emissions, lower than any other biomass power plant in Italy.The plant, designed to deliver 140 GWhe per year of renewable energy, sufficient to meet the needs of about 50,000 families, will consume approximately 200,000 tonnes/year of wood chips. These will come mainly from poplar trees grown according to the short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> (SRF) formula, defined as high-density plantations of fast-growing species to be used for energy conversion. Taking into account the carbon capture cycle of its raw materials, the Olevano plant will reduce atmospheric emissions of CO2 by more than 100,000 tonnes/year by replacing electricity generated from fossil fuels.|$|E

40|$|The {{utilisation}} of disturbed and contaminated {{sites for}} the production of willow (Salix) short <b>rotation</b> coppice <b>forestry</b> is an area of opportunity that has not been fully addressed. The significant areas of contaminated and disturbed sites in the UK that require remediation represent an opportunity for exploring alternative low cost remediation strategies. Conventional approaches to site remediation have involved costly engineered solutions, solutions which clearly cannot be afforded on all contaminated and disturbed sites. As an alternative to hard engineered solutions this thesis considers the potential to utilise these areas {{for the production of}} willow short <b>rotation</b> coppice <b>forestry.</b> The planting of these sites with willow provides a potential income stream through the sale of the biomass produced. In addition willow short <b>rotation</b> coppice <b>forestry</b> provides many additional benefits to these sites such as their ability to absorb heavy metals, provide fast site enhancement and stabilisation, act as a carbon sink and as a potential route for the recycling of organic matter. Current knowledge and experience of willow short <b>rotation</b> coppice <b>forestry</b> has been gained from its production on agricultural land. As part of this research a field trial was established on a capped former steelworks site to quantify the ability of contaminated and disturbed sites to successfully establish and promote the growth of willow. The silvicultural practices employed to grow willow Short Rotation Coppice were considered to assess their impact upon the survival and biomass produced {{at the end of each}} growing season, and specifically to consider whether adopting different management techniques were beneficial in growth conditions associated with disturbed and contaminated sites. The silvicultural practices considered in this field trial were the addition of fertiliser, the use of herbicide, rotation length before coppicing (1, 2 or 3 Years) and planting density (0. 5 m and 1. 0 m). In addition a further 18 clones were screened to consider their ability to establish and survive in such harsh growing mediums. Results have indicated considerable variability within the field trial, which may be indicative of the heterogeneity of the growing medium. The main silvicultural practice in the field trial that influenced survival and growth was weed control. All other silvicultural practices used were considered to have less influence on the survival and growth of the willow. Yields obtained from willow short <b>rotation</b> coppice <b>forestry</b> grown on disturbed and contaminated sites fail to compare with those grown on the higher grades of agricultural land. On contaminated and disturbed sites however, survival rather than biomass yield is viewed as the key issue to ensure that ground cover is established. Work undertaken by the Water Research Council to assess the potential of a rapid screening technique for willow establishment and survival on metal contaminated sites is replicated and expanded to other clones of willow and heavy metals. The results obtained from this quick and simple leaf disc screening trial would in the first instance seem to indicate that the leaf damage suffered by leaf discs obtained from differing clones of willow to be consistently more pronounced amongst individual cultivars. Limitations are imposed upon this quick screening test by the lack of available information to allow comparison of these screening trials with information for willows established in growing mediums of a similar metal contamination. To fully appreciate the value of growing willow on disturbed and contaminated sites it is considered that the economic equation should be readdressed and that the value of additional opportunities/ benefits are included if the true value of utilising these sites for its production is to be demonstrated. Studies to identify the non-marketable benefits for woodlands and energy crops grown in Sweden are used to give an indication of the true economic value of growing willow SRC on disturbed and contaminated sites, and are used to provide an insight into the economic value that can be attributed to the social and environmental benefits of willow production...|$|R

To compare growth of eucalypts with other promising short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> genera. 3. To develop volume and biomass functions for E. gunnii. 4. To estimate yields and patterns of growth for E. gunnii. Searches on CAB abstracts and World of Science showed that there was limited research conducted on eucalypts in the UK.

The thesis provides an account of the long history of eucalypts in the UK, the first record of a eucalypt being planted in Britain probably being Eucalyptus obliqua in the late 1700 s (Aiton 1789).

Mitigation measures to reduce the detrimental effect of higher temperatures combined with lower soil moisture {{on the amount of}} SOC are changes in land cover and adaptation of land-management practices to increase net primary production and reduce losses of aboveground biomass from decomposition [36, 39, 40, 55]. Under given climatic conditions, grassland and forests tend to have higher stocks of organic C than arable land and are seen as net sinks for C [56]. Adaptive measures on agricultural land use are changes in farming practices, such as a reduction in tilling or retaining crop residues after harvesting. The recent environmental conditions in combination with the type of silviculture that has been developed over the past 50 years can efficiently sequester C on timescales of decades.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{economics}} of carbon storage using a model that includes forest size structure and determines the choice between <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> and continuous cover forestry. Optimal harvests may rely solely on thinning, implying infinite rotation and continuous cover forestry, or both thinning and clearcuts, implying finite rotation periods. Given several carbon prices and interest rates, we optimize the timing and intensity of thinnings along with the choice of management regime. In addition to the carbon storage in living trees, we include the carbon dynamics of dead trees and timber products. Forest growth is specified by an empirically validated transition matrix model for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The optimization problem is solved in its general dynamic form by applying bilevel optimization with gradient-based interior point methods and a genetic algorithm. Carbon pricing postpones thinnings, increases stand density by directing harvests to larger trees, and typically yields a regime shift from <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> to continuous cover forestry. In continuous cover solutions, the steady-state harvesting interval and the diameter distribution of standing and harvested trees are sensitive to carbon price, implying that carbon pricing increases the sawlog ratio of timber yields. Additionally, we obtain relatively inexpensive stand-level marginal costs of carbon storage...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{overview}} of hydrochemical {{studies of the}} upper River Severn catchment in the Plynlimon region of mid-Wales, as linked to twenty years of research at CEH Wallingford, is presented. The work provides a bibliography of publications to date and illustrates that the water quality changes associated with felling are often small {{when compared with the}} effects of climate variability. The felling effects are manifested most clearly at the local scale and with clear as opposed to phased felling. Phased felling over several years, which is standard forestry practice, provides a much reduced response. The highly heterogeneous nature of the catchment is emphasised. This complexity makes identification and modelling of the changes very difficult to describe in terms of space and time. Long-term records (forty years or more) are needed to allow assessment of the changing water quality patterns associated with climate variability, climate change, changing pollutant deposition patterns and <b>forestry</b> <b>rotation</b> cycles.

In Japan, it aimed to reduce fossil fuels supply 670, 000 Â kL of crude oil equivalent in thermal power plants and 340, 000 Â kL of crude oil equivalent in the utilization of heat by biomass. It was decided to use 25 % {{or more of the}} forestry products such as logging residues. Japanese government aim to supply 634 Â PJ of woody biomass for power generation in 2010. This amount of energy accounts for 2. 8 % of total primary energy. More than 68 % of Japan is covered by forests, and more than 40 % of these forests are plantations. But the use of woody biomass is limited because it is still not seen as economically viable.

The use of forest resources to produce biochemical and bioproducts is seen by many communities and the provincial and federal governments as having potential to help communities adapt to this change.

Ranchers in the Quesnel area were interviewed to determine how short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> crops would affect their current operations, the opportunities and barriers they see to its implementation, and their level of interest in growing these crops on their own land. The majority of ranchers were willing to grow crops provided it was profitable, though they were concerned about losing agricultural land to tree production. If agroforestry methods that integrate traditional crop production with short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> crops are used, there is potential for ranchers to have another source of income. However, there is also a chance that agricultural land will be removed from food production or excessively regulated. Both of these outcomes would negatively affect ranchers. [...] Leaf 3.

40|$|The {{development}} of the bioenergy sector {{has led to an}} increasing interest in energy crops. Short rotation coppices (SRC) are forestry management systems in which fast-growing tree species are produced under intensive cultivation practices to obtain high wood chips yields. In Italy, most SRC plantations consist of poplar biomass-clones. SRC plantations can be carried out with different management systems with diverse cutting times; consequently, the cultivation system can be crucial for attaining high yields depending on: i) short and ii) medium cutting frequency. Nowadays, the larger part of Italian SRC is based on 2 -year cutting short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> (SRF) but the best quality of wood chips is linked to 5 -year plantation medium <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> (MRF). This work compares an SRF and an MRF poplar plantation located in the Po Valley in northern Italy. In particular, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to evaluate their energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The LCA software SimaPro 7. 10 was used to create the LCA model and to assure an accurate impact assessment calculation. The analysis shows several differences between MRF and SRF in terms of fertiliser requirements and intensive agricultural activities. Results highlight that MRF produces a more sustainable wood chip production than SRF according to energy and environmental concerns. Furthermore, hot spots were identified in both SRF and MRF due to the high energy consumption and the related emissions. These hot spots were: i) mineral fertilisation; ii) mechanical weed-control; iii) harvesting and biomass transport...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Even-aged forests {{prevail in}} Croatia’s <b>forestry.</b> <b>Rotation</b> period is based mostly on natural parameters. In practice, {{rotation}} period {{is given by}} Croatian Rulebook of forest management. Cutting age is determined based on inventory data and many other stand characteristics. Rotation period is a planned time and it always has to be unique for particular tree species, and cutting age is the age of a stand {{at the moment of}} the final cut. The aim of the paper is to compare rotation period based on economic parameters and rotation period determined by using forest inventory data. Material and methods: Owing to absence of long term stand calculation data, research object was taken from Forest Management Handbook (1995). Mean annual increment (MAI) and current annual increment (CAI) provided fundamental data for calculations. The research was conducted at one hectare Common Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stand. Assortment structure and value of timber was estimated by the present cutting value method calculated by using Croatian forests Ltd. Price list for the year 2008. Labor costs in forest exploitation were also taken into account. Results and conclusion: In order to achieve cost-effective management of common beech stands, it is necessary to adjust current optimal rotation period. Optimal rotation period should be based on management goals as the main factors. So far the most common criterion adopted in Croatian forestry has been the rotation of maximum sustained yield or maximum Mean annual increment.

40|$|Biofuels are a {{potentially}} {{important source of}} energy for our society. Common practice in life cycle assessment (LCA) of bioenergy has been to assume that any carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission related to biomass combustion equals the amount absorbed in biomass, thus assuming no climate change impacts. Recent developments show the significance of contributions of biogenic CO 2 emissions during the time they stay in the atmosphere. The goal {{of this article is}} to develop a global, spatially explicit method to quantify the potential impact on human health and terrestrial ecosystems of biogenic carbon emissions coming from forest wood extraction for biofuel production. For this purpose, changes in aboveground carbon stock (delta C forest) due to an increase in wood extraction via changes in rotation time are simulated worldwide with a 0. 5 x 0. 5 degree grid resolution. Our results show that both impacts and benefits can be obtained. When the extraction increase is reached by creating a longer rotation time, new growth is allowed resulting in carbon benefits. In a case study, we assessed the life cycle impacts of heat production via wood to determine the significance of including biogenic CO 2 emissions due to changes in forest management. Impacts of biogenic CO 2 dominate the total climate change impacts from a wood stove. Depending on the wood source country, climate change impacts due to heat production from wood either have an important share in the overall impacts on human health and terrestrial ecosystems, or allow for a large additional CO 2 sink. <b>Forestry</b> <b>rotation</b> time; Global scale modelling; Human health impact; Life cycle impact assessment; Spatially explici...|$|R
40|$|Background: Forest {{ecosystems}} are increasingly seen as multi-functional production systems, which should provide, besides timber and economic benefits, also other ecosystem services related to biological diversity, recreational uses and environmental functions of forests. This study analyzed {{the performance of}} even-aged rotation forest management (RFM), continuous cover forestry (CCF) and any-aged forestry (AAF) {{in the production of}} ecosystem services. AAF allows both even-aged and uneven-aged management schedules. The ecosystem services included in the analyses were net present value, volume of harvested timber, cowberry and bilberry yields, scenic value of the forest, carbon balance and suitability of the forest to Siberian jay. Methods: Data envelopment analysis was used to derive numerical efficiency ratios for the three management systems. Efficiency ratio is the sum of weighted outputs (ecosystem services) divided by the sum of weighted inputs. The linear programing model proposed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes was used to derive the weights for calculating efficiency scores for the silvicultural systems. Results and conclusions: CCF provided more ecosystem services than RFM, and CCF was more efficient than RFM and AAF in the production of ecosystem services. Multi-objective management provided more ecosystem services (except harvested timber) than single-objective management that maximized economic profitability. The use of low discount rate (resulting in low cutting level and high growing stock volume) led to better supply of most ecosystems services than the use of high discount rate. RFM where NPV was maximized with high discount rate led to particularly poor provision of most ecosystem services. In CCF the provision of ecosystem services was less sensitive to changes in discount rate and management objective than in RFM.

To compare growth of eucalypts with other promising short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> genera. 3. To develop volume and biomass functions for E. gunnii. 4. To estimate yields and patterns of growth for E. gunnii. Searches on CAB abstracts and World of Science showed that there was limited research conducted on eucalypts in the UK. This research provides an original contribution to knowledge through; a long term assessment {{of the performance of}} species of cold tolerant eucalypts across a range of sites, identification of the basis for the rapid growth of eucalypts in comparison with trees from other genera, identification of the best fit function to describe stem form in E. gunnii and a characterisation of the pattern of growth in this species. The thesis provides an account of the long history of eucalypts in the UK, the first record of a eucalypt being planted in Britain probably being Eucalyptus obliqua in the late 1700 s (Aiton 1789). A review is then provided of the experience and constraints to growing nine eucalypt species in the UK and their potential for short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> are described. The rapid growth of eucalypts makes them well suited to short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry,</b> but there are considerable risks from frosts and extreme winters. Results from a trial established in Cumbria, north west England are described. Survival and growth was compared between E. gunnii, E. nitens and native or naturalised species, identified by Hardcastle (2006) as having potential for short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry.</b> The rapid rate of growth of E. gunnii was attributed to a combination of large leaf area, a long period of growth during the year and a high specific leaf area. There was 99 % mortality of E. nitens at the trial over winter, preventing comparison with other species. At the same trial and assessment was made of frost damage during the winter of 2009 - 2010, which proved to be the coldest for thirty years (Met Office 2010). E. gunnii was found to be more cold-tolerant than E. nitens, with 35 % of the former surviving the winter and less than 1 % of the latter. Larger trees were damaged more so than smaller trees reinforcing the argument for good silviculture to promote rapid, early growth. The study on stem form and growth of E. gunnii represents the first in the UK. Volume, height and dbh of a total of 636 trees, measured by felling, optical dendrometer and terrestrial laser scanner were used to test the goodness of fit of a volume function developed in France by AFOCEL and is South America by Shell Oil. The AFOCEL function was found to predict volume with less bias and be suitable for all but the smallest trees. Characterisation of growth curves using mined historic data indicated yields of 16 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 or approximately 8 t ha- 1 y- 1 at 20 years old. In contrast, growth curves derived from stem analysis of nine trees from Chiddingfold (south east England) and Glenbranter (central western Scotland) indicated lower yields at 7 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 at age 28 years and 4. 5 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 at age 30 years respectively.

The Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) utilizes actively managed breeding habitat on the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Managing the spatial arrangement of future breeding habitat {{is a complex}} forest management problem. While it is relatively simple to identify good areas to create habitat in the near future, {{it is difficult to}} foresee, without analysis, whether good habitat patches and amounts can be maintained through a full <b>forestry</b> <b>rotation.</b> Additionally, financial investments required to create suitable habitat are substantial, and managers should carefully consider habitat designs that increase breeding success. A harvest scheduling model was applied on the Hiawatha National Forest to explore opportunities for habitat management. Results help support implementation of the 2006 Forest Management Plan, which identified goals and objectives to create and maintain 6700 acres of age 6 - 16 Kirtland's warbler (KW) habitat within a larger 33, 500 acre KW habitat system. Applications addressed a mid-sized landscape (174, 808 acres), comprised of 12, 307 stands and a 60 year planning horizon, consisting of 30 two-year planning periods with KW habitat production objectives. Three major model explorations are documented. First, a heuristic is developed to solve an intractable dynamic programming (DP) problem. Secondly, a pre-processing heuristic is developed to pare down the number of stand-level management options that must be included in the harvest scheduling model. Finally, the modeling system is applied to the problem to identify a management strategy and show financial and spatial trade-offs of alternative management strategies. Results of the first exploration indicate that an optimal DP solution can be identified with the proposed heuristic with improved solution times. The second exploration shows substantial time savings from eliminating many KW management options without compromising solution value.

40|$|Pricing {{greenhouse}} gas emissions is a burgeoning and possibly lucrative financial means for climate change mitigation. Emissions pricing {{is being used to}} fund emissions-abatement technologies and to modify land management to improve carbon sequestration and retention. Here we discuss the principal land-management options under existing and realistic future emissions-price legislation in Australia, and examine them with respect to their anticipated direct and indirect effects on biodiversity. The main ways in which emissions price-driven changes to land management can affect biodiversity are through policies and practices for (1) environmental plantings for carbon sequestration, (2) native regrowth, (3) fire management, (4) forestry, (5) agricultural practices (including cropping and grazing), and (6) feral animal control. While most land-management options available to reduce net {{greenhouse gas}} emissions offer clear advantages to increase the viability of native biodiversity, we describe several caveats regarding potentially negative outcomes, and outline components that need to be considered if biodiversity is also to benefit from the new carbon economy. Carbon plantings will only have real biodiversity value if they comprise appropriate native tree species and provide suitable habitats and resources for valued fauna. Such plantings also risk severely altering local hydrology and reducing water availability. Management of regrowth post-agricultural abandonment requires setting appropriate baselines and allowing for thinning in certain circumstances, and improvements to <b>forestry</b> <b>rotation</b> lengths would likely increase carbon-retention capacity and biodiversity value. Prescribed burning to reduce the frequency of high-intensity wildfires in northern Australia is being used as a tool to increase carbon retention. Fire management in southern Australia is not readily amenable for maximising carbon storage potential, but will become increasingly important for biodiversity conservation as the climate warms. Carbon price-based modifications to agriculture that would benefit biodiversity include reductions in tillage frequency and livestock densities, reductions in fertiliser use, and retention and regeneration of native shrubs; however, anticipated shifts to exotic perennial grass species such as buffel grass and kikuyu could have net negative implications for native biodiversity. Finally, it is unlikely that major reductions in {{greenhouse gas emissions}} arising from feral animal control are possible, even though reduced densities of feral herbivores will benefit Australian biodiversity greatly.

40|$|Short <b>rotation</b> {{plantation}} <b>forestry</b> {{based on}} exotic tree species (principally radiata pine (Pinus radiata)) {{is a major}} land use in New Zealand (1. 7 million ha, 7 % of total land area). The maintenance of primary production in such a plantation forest ecosystem depends upon {{a number of factors}} including replenishment of available nutrients removal in harvested biomass. Litterfall is a major pathway of nutrient return to the forest floor. In addition, understorey biomass and woody debris from thinning and pruning also contribute to nutrient and organic matter cycling in a managed forest. Needle litter, understorey litter and woody debris undergo decomposition to release nutrients and thereby maintain the integrity of the forest ecosystem. Substrate quality is an important factor that regulates the decomposition of litter and woody debris materials. Decomposition and associated nutrient release from selected above ground litter and woody debris components from radiata pine forests were investigated using a combination of controlled environment (microcosm) and field experiments. The principle objective {{of the study was to}} determine the influence of litter and woody debris quality on decomposition and associated nutrient release. The impact of green needle litter on senescent needle litter decomposition and nutrient turnover in the forest floor was investigated under controlled conditions (microcosm) and in the field. The results obtained indicated that green needle addition did not significantly affect organic matter and nutrient turnover. However, addition of green needles did affect short-term nutrient availability. Green needles lost 69, 87, 75, 72, and 79 % of the original nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, respectively after 10 months, while the corresponding data for senescent needles was 22, 71, 31, 4, and 38 %, respectively. The effect of selected understorey litters on decomposition and nutrient release from senescent pine needles was investigated in a microcosm experiment. After 10 months the weight loss of senescent pine needles (64 %) was significantly greater than bracken (Pteridium aquilinum- 26 %), gorse (Ulex europaeus- 30 %), broom (Cytisus scoparius- 30 %) and lotus (Lotus pedunculatus- 40 %) litter. Net release of all nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium) occurred from decomposing senescent pine needles, although net immobilization of potassium was observed for all understorey litters. Mixing pine and understorey litter significantly influenced decomposition rate and associated nutrient release. Pine needles mixed with understorey litter decomposed slower than needles alone, but mixed understorey litter (except bracken) decomposed faster than understorey alone. Nutrient availability (especially magnesium and potassium) was found to be as important as energy availability in determining the overall rate of decomposition. A laboratory study on the biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon from radiata pine litter indicated that this was influenced by its quality as determined by the stage of decomposition. The aqueous extract of the litter (L) layer decomposed faster (38 %) than that of the fermented/humus (FH) layer (15 %) during 3 months of incubation. The inhibitory effects of polyphenols on the biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon was confirmed in this study. The ¹³C NMR technique was used to describe the DOC degradation. The NMR results complemented the results obtained through the proximate analyses and it gave better insights in to the pathways of Land FH DOC breakdown. A chronosequence study of woody debris decomposition over 13 years showed that the overall half- life was 14 years and decomposition of different components was clearly related to quality. Thus, log wood contained greater concentrations of carbohydrates (soluble and holocelluose) and decomposed faster than log bark and side branches. ¹³C NMR technique was used to study the decomposition of wood, bark and sidebranches over 13 years. The NMR spectra confirmed the results obtained through proximate analysis and proved to be an useful technique in understanding the process of litter decomposition. The slower decomposition rate of log bark was attributed to the higher polyphenol concentration, while higher lignin concentration and an unfavorable microclimate were the main reasons for slow decomposition of side branches. The mass and volume of woody debris was much lower than that of natural conifer forests due to the young age of woody debris (thinning slash) and net mineralization of nutrients from the decomposing woody debris was apparent during decomposition. Even after 13 years, woody debris contained considerable amounts of carbon (5. 5 t ha⁻¹) and nutrients (41, 2, 41, 8, 3 kg ha⁻¹ of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium, respectively). Therefore, management of woody debris (thinning residues) may be important for the long-term sustainability of forest soils...|$|R
40|$|Poplar is {{distributed}} widely throughout the world. There are about 30 natural species. Taxonomically poplars {{are divided into}} six groups. Poplar tree can be 200 - 300 years old. Normally two sets of 19 chromosomes {{are present in the}} nucleus of Poplar, while the size of genome is remarkably small. Poplar is a fast growing species. Poplar species are deciduous and semi evergreen and are distributed widely on the northern hemisphere. Poplars have various ecological habitats. They can grow in pure stands or mixed with other hardwood and conifer species. Poplars are also used in short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> for production of biomass for bio energy, fiber and environmental services. The short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> in Sweden is based on Salix but in this study the focus is on poplar. Discoloration occurs normally in the core wood for most poplar species. Present thesis is made in order to study the distribution of the discoloration for poplars. In the study 36 poplar trees from three provinces in Sweden (Lat. 56 - 60 ˚ N.) were measured. Discs were collected at different percentages of different stem height. The objective of work was to observe the relationship of discoloration with diameter and height of poplar tree. Besides these 36 sample trees, a clear felled poplar stand at Valsätra in Uppsala Municipality was studied. Diameter and discoloration on 110 stumps were measured. In the third part the measurements of shootings of poplar species in Valsätra are shown. The discoloration in stems was directly proportional with the height of the tree. The percentage of discoloration in a stem decreased with increasing tree height...|$|E
40|$|Poplars (Populus sp.) {{are widely}} used in short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> for {{production}} of biomass for bioenergy, fibre and environmental services. Swedish short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> is based on Salix sp., and {{little is known about}} the production potential of poplar plantations and their effects on the environment. This thesis focuses on four aspects of intensive short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> with poplars: 1) Biomass production and partitioning at several initial densities and a range of latitudes and growing conditions in Sweden, 2) the effects of poplar plantation on floristic diversity in the Swedish agricultural landscape, 3) the pattern of wind damage and its effects on production in poplar plantations in southern Sweden, and 4) ecological characterisation of poplar varieties in short-term experiments with pot-grown plants. Annual biomass production in poplar plots and plantations over a rotation period of 9 - 14 years ranges between 3. 3 and 9. 2 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1. These high production figures are achieved on relatively fertile, non-fertilised and non-irrigated agricultural land. The production assessments for commercial poplar plantations established at lower initial densities (1000 trees ha- 1) in southern Sweden indicate a similar production potential as in closely spaced cultures (5000 trees ha- 1 yr- 1), though at 3 - 5 years longer rotations. Lower initial densities enable higher pulpwood yields along with the production of biomass for bioenergy. A comparison among 21 poplar plots, 0. 1 - 13 ha large and adjacent arable fields, indicates that small poplar plantations may increase floristic diversity on a landscape scale, mainly by providing a different type of habitat that may favour shade-tolerant and draught-sensitive species. This is reflected by a relatively low number of species shared by both types of habitat. Wind damage in two poplar plantations, 15 and 33 ha large, was assessed using wind damage classes based on leaning angle of individual trees on plots established before wind damage occurred. The loss of increment on the strongest damaged plots during the two-year period after the storm was 30 %, whereas there was no difference in growth between damaged and undamaged plots in the third year after the storm. A short-term experiment using pot-grown plants revealed differences in clonal growth response in terms of physiological and morphological variables that determined relative growth rate and nutrient productivity, despite that most of clones were of the same species and geographic origin. The importance of different response variables in determining growth also shifted as an effect of irrigation and fertilisation treatment. Provided that suitable plant material is selected and widely available, commercial SRF with poplars represent a valuable alternative crop for surplus agricultural land with a potential to produce multiple benefits to society through the high production of biomass and fiber and positive effects on the environment...|$|E
40|$|Bioenergy is one {{important}} form {{of renewable energy}} where Finland, Norway and Sweden have considerable potential. Greatly increased use of biomass for energy will, however, have considerable effects on environmental values like biodiversity, landscape appearance, outdoor recreation, and the cultural heritage. This review concludes that positive or marginally negative effects of biomass harvesting are likely for harvesting of logging residues, clearance of trees under power lines, along roads, and from marginal agricultural land, as well as production of energy crops on arable land. Negative effects are likely from harvesting of stumps, more intensive forest cultivation on logged areas, and harvesting of biomass from currently non-commercial forests. The environmental effects of production of biomass from reed canary grass or short <b>rotation</b> <b>forestry</b> will depend on where and how such production takes place...|$|E

The aims of this study were to evaluate the profitability of SRF under various scenarios and to provide information on economically optimal production decisions. Dynamic systems analysis was applied to model biophysical growth, costs, and benefits of a poplar plantation. The model includes two different harvesting systems (cut-and-chip harvester, feller-buncher harvester) and two transportation systems (transportation of wood chips with tractor or truck). The model takes into account variations in biomass growth based on different plant densities and rotation periods as well as biomass decay and heating value depending on the chosen harvesting system and length of storage. The results indicate that SRF can be profitable under certain conditions in Austria...|$|E
