The production power cars featured a redesigned front end without conventional buffers, although a <b>rigid</b> <b>drawbar</b> {{can be used to}} connect an HST to an ordinary locomotive. Following the introduction of production HST sets, the prototype unit was withdrawn, the power cars passing to the Research Division at Derby. Of the ten prototype coaches, two were adapted for use in the Royal Train, five were modified for use with the production HSTs, and three were transferred to Departmental stock.|$|E
50|$|Two years later, {{after an}} {{intensive}} {{study of the}} ultra long haul market sector, DAF unveiled the 95.500 Super Spacecab at the 1994 RAI show. The 95 series cabin had gained height and length, and sat atop Cummins' 14 litre N14, rated at 507 Bhp. ZF's new Aluminium-cased 16S221 gearbox was fitted, with optional Intarder, an innovation was the hydraulic gearshift developed with Konsberg of Norway. Within an overall height of 3.85m, the Super boasted an interior standing height of 2.25m, a luxury bunk with generous stowage underneath and {{a full range of}} options included microwave, fridge, TV/Video. The 95.500 was available as a 4x2 tractor or <b>drawbar</b> <b>rigid,</b> with LHD only, though the Super Spacecab was available on 11.6 litre-engined models, and sold well. The 95.500 is now a very rare truck, which is surprising given the original list price of Â£87, 650.|$|R
