50|$|Swire also {{objected to}} the gag order {{provision}} of section 215, reasoning that a gag order is necessary for wiretaps as without secrecy the effectiveness is greatly diminished, while a <b>record</b> <b>search</b> is not diminished if secrecy is kept. He believes {{that the ability to}} speak to the press is an important First Amendment right which the gag rule takes away. He believes that the new, broader search powers of FISA combined with an inability to tell others that the order is being carried out removes an effective check against abuse of power: publicity. Swire recommends that the gag order be removed, but failing this it should be time limited and eventually revealed, and perhaps make the fact of a search announceable, but disallow the naming of the suspect.|$|E

Two partial skeletons, of a white man and woman, [...] "were bulldozed out of a swatch of gravely soil." [...] At the time, no one could figure out whose bones they were. Marked as [...] "John and Mary Doe", the bones were placed in a box at the morgue. Later an amateur historian {{who worked for the}} village of Skaneateles believed that the skeletons were the Wilkinson's. The county medical examiner agreed and the bones were returned to the family in 1991 after spending 20 years in a cardboard box on a shelf at the Onondaga County medical examiner's office in Syracuse.

He settled into the UK racing scene quickly with a win at his first ride in the UK at Aintree on Mix n Match in the Earl of Sefton Plate on 25 March 1961 and the wins soon mounted up. He was successful in the UK and France. A few of the horses he was associated with in the UK are [...] "The Pouncer", [...] "Althrey Don", [...] "Mountain Call", [...] "Laureate" [...] and [...] "Park Top". In 1969 he was injured in a race fall at Newbury and after recovery broke the same leg in a training accident prior to his return to racing.
