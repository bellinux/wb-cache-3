25|$|Americans {{have the}} highest average {{household}} income among OECD nations, and in 2010 had the fourth highest median household income, down from second highest in 2007. According to one analysis middle class incomes in the United States fell into a tie with those in Canada in 2010, and may have fallen behind by 2014, while several other advanced economies have closed the gap in recent years. According to the Census Bureau, inflation-adjusted household income reached an all-time high of $59,039 in 2016, with record gains in recent years.

25|$|There is {{a fairly}} clear {{long-term}} correlation between the performance of global stock markets and the audience ratings of CNBC.

25|$|In March 2013, as {{the stock}} market's Dow Jones Industrial Average set <b>record</b> <b>highs,</b> {{household}} and personal income were both down sharply from their 2007 peaks.

Inflation-adjusted ("real") per-capita disposable personal income rose steadily in the U.S. from 1945 to 2008, but has since remained generally level.|$|E

25|$|News of the earthquake, {{combined}} {{with the fact that}} replacement power sources (such as oil and gas) are at <b>record</b> <b>highs,</b> caused TEPCOs stock to plummet 7.5%, the largest drop in seven years, which amounted to around 4.4billion USD lost in stock capitalization. This made the event even more costly to the company than the 2002 data falsification scandal. Additionally, TEPCO warned that the plant closure could cause a power shortage during the summer months. Trade minister Akira Amari requested that business users cut electricity use, and in August TEPCO was forced to reduce electricity supplies for industrial uses, the first time it had to resort to such measures in 17years.|$|E
25|$|Community and {{equality}} are mutually reinforcing... Social capital and economic inequality moved in tandem {{through most of}} the twentieth century. In terms of the distribution of wealth and income, America in the 1950s and 1960s was more egalitarian {{than it had been in}} more than a century... hose same decades were also the high point of social connectedness and civic engagement. <b>Record</b> <b>highs</b> in equality and social capital coincided. Conversely, the last third of the twentieth century was a time of growing inequality and eroding social capital... The timing of the two trends is striking: somewhere around 1965–70 America reversed course and started becoming both less just economically and less well connected socially and politically.|$|E
25|$|The Rhodesian economy {{experienced}} a modest {{boom in the}} early 1970s. Real per capita earnings for blacks and whites reached <b>record</b> <b>highs,</b> although the disparity in incomes {{between blacks and whites}} remained, with blacks earning only about one-tenth as much as whites. After 1975, however, Rhodesia's economy was undermined by the cumulative effects of sanctions, declining earnings from commodity exports, worsening guerilla conflict, and increasing white emigration. When Mozambique severed economic ties, the Ian Smith regime was forced to depend on South Africa for access to the outside world. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined between 1974 and 1979, before full independence in 1980. An increasing proportion of the national budget, an estimated 30%–40% per year, was allocated to defence, and a large budget deficit raised the public debt burden substantially.|$|E

25|$|On January 1, 1982, the MTA {{implemented}} {{the first of}} its five-year Capital Improvement programs to repair the existing system. Scheduled Maintenance Services were formed to replace components before they failed. Subway cars in classes R26 to R46 went through general overhaul programs to fix and rehabilitate rolling stock. Older equipment (any car classes with contract numbers below R32s on the B Division and R26s on the A Division) were retrofitted with air conditioning. The red tag areas were incrementally repaired and welded rail could be seen on many lines {{by the end of the}} 1980s. At the end of the century, the MDBF rates for the entire system were at <b>record</b> <b>highs</b> and steadily increasing. The Franklin Avenue Shuttle, however, was worse in 1989 than it was in 1980, and necessitated a complete renovation by 1998, because the MTA planned to abandon the line by the end of the century.|$|E
