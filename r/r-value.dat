In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of <b>R-value),</b> the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant).

40|$|Abstract. The {{anisotropic}} plastic {{behavior of}} metallic sheet {{has a significant}} influence on spring-back, and is usually modeled by anisotropic yield function in numerical simulation. Material parameters of anisotropic yield function are generally identified either by yield stresses or by <b>r-values,</b> or both of them. For Hill 1948 and Yld 89 anisotropic yield functions, <b>r-values</b> are still widely used to calibrate their material parameters in spring-back prediction. Here, yield stresses and <b>r-values</b> were respectively used to calibrate them, and the differences of the spring-back simulated by these two identification methods were discussed. To evaluate their accuracy, the simulation results were compared with the spring-back calculated by Yld 2000 - 2 d anisotropic yield function. The result shows that when yield stresses were used to identify the material parameters of Hill 1948 and Yld 89 yield functions, the simulated spring-back was closer to that of Yld 2000 - 2 d yield function...|$|R
