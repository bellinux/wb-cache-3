25|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data <b>recording</b> <b>density.</b> Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk {{and the number of}} sectors per track, only the latter increases the {{data transfer}} rate for a given rpm. Since {{data transfer rate}} performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} record spacing on track edge noise are studied for CoCrTa and CoCrPt/CoCrTa media. Variations in record {{spacings}} (seperation from magnetic media to write head pole tips) are accurately achieved {{by using an}} identical set of disks {{for each type of}} media, with different overcoat thicknesses. Track edge noise is characterized using track profiles of the media noise. An integrated spectral technique is used to measure media noise, and the effects of the different playback spacings (seperation from magnetic media to read head pole tips or read element) are removed by dividing the spectral playback loss factor from the media noise spectra. On track transition noise is studied as a function of linear density at three different record spacings for each media type. Transition noise is found to increase with linear <b>record</b> <b>density</b> as expected, as well as with record spacing for a given linear density. Track profiles were performed at three linear <b>record</b> <b>densities</b> for each <b>record</b> spacing to observe the density dependence of similar effects on track edge noise. For both media, on-track noise and track edge noise are found to decrease with reduced record spacing, and the amount of decrease are found to be <b>record</b> <b>density</b> dependent.
