The main result of the analysis is that liquidity has normally been provided by the ECB in a neutral and smooth manner, but also that there has been attempt, albeit very limited, to correct deviations of the overnight rate from the main refinancing rate. Moreover, the paper finds that liquidity has affected the overnight interest rate to a significant extent only after the last main <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation</b> of the maintenance period, when it is not possible for the ECB to adjust liquidity imbalances except by making recourse to fine-tuning operations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a microstructure {{model for the}} unsecured overnight euro money market, similar to that developed for stock markets by Easley and O'Hara (1992). More specifically, this paper studies the role of heterogeneity in the population of banks participating on this market, {{and the influence of}} the institutional framework and market organizational aspects of the overnight deposit market. A first empirical assessment of the functioning of this market is based on the probability of informed trade which measures the ability of traders (banks) to interpret signals on the expected evolution of the overnight rate. This indicator is estimated on real-time data publicly available to market participants. Results show that between 2000 and 2004 a heterogeneous learning process of market mechanisms within participants could be observed. From 2005 onwards, however, heterogeneity in the learning process sharply decreased. Moreover, the empirical evidence show that the March 2004 changes in Eurosystem's operational framework have modified the informational patterns of order flow in the euro area money market: informed trades became even more predominant between the last main <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation</b> {{and the end of the}} reserves maintenance period than they were before March 2004.

50|$|Jens Ulbrich and Alexander Lipponer (economists at the Bundesbank) {{justified}} {{the policy of}} the ECB during the European balance-of-payments crisis as follows: In the crisis, the Eurosystem consciously assumed a larger intermediation function in view of the massive disruptions in the interbank market by extending its liquidity control instruments. With this greater role in the provision of central bank money - essentially by changing to a full allotment procedure in <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> and the extension of longer-term <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> - the total volume of refinancing credits provided has increased (temporarily even markedly). At the same time, the quality requirements for the underlying collateral were reduced in the crisis.

40|$|In {{the past}} few months, euro area money markets {{have been exposed to}} intense tensions. On 8 August, {{overnight}} interest rates rose to very high levels which required interventions of the Eurosystem in order to stabilise short-term money market interest rates around the target level, i. e. the minimum bid rate on the main <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations.</b> The article explains how the Eurosystem steers very short-term money market interest rates by adjusting its supply of liquidity on the money market. It is shown how the Eurosystem’s liquidity management stabilised short-term money market interest rates around the minimum bid rate on the main <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> {{in the first half of}} 2007. Although short-term money market interest rates were more volatile during the period of financial turmoil, the Eurosystem nevertheless managed to safeguard the signalling function of the short-term money market interest rates by applying its operational framework in a flexible way. More specifically, the Eurosystem decided to allot more liquidity than the benchmark amount in the main <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> early within the maintenance period. It was also decided to conduct fine-tuning operations on a more frequent basis in order to stabilise short-term rates. Finally, the Eurosystem also decided to increase the share of longer-term <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> in the total amount of outstanding open market operations. Despite the relative success in stabilising very short-term money market interest rates, longer maturity unsecured interest rates – for instance the 3 -month Euribor – increased significantly during the period of financial turmoil. These movements cannot be controlled directly by central banks as they are determined predominantly by private sector behaviour. However, when assessing the appropriate monetary policy stance, the Governing Council of the ECB takes these possibly changing financing conditions into account. monetary policy implementation, Eurosystem, open market operations...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} the Centralized-Counterparty Clearinghouse (CCP) behind the General Collateral (GC) repos traded on two large {{repurchase}} agreement (repo) platforms potentially suffered from systemic risk during the European sovereign debt crisis in 2008 - 2011. We find that GC repo rates respond to movements in sovereign risk, in particular {{at the peak}} of the crisis in 2011 and in GIIPS countries. This is surprising given that our data are from the safest segment of the European repo market, in which the CCP assumes counterparty default risk. We document that in 2011 the repo market behaved as if the probability of CCP default (conditional on sovereign default) was very large, and did not react to increases in haircuts. The ECB’s 36 -month long-term <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation</b> of December 2011 alone was able to disconnect the CCP from the sovereign crisis. Overall, our evidence is consistent with CCPs providing some protection in periods of intermediate sovereign stress (2009 - 2010), but being ineffective {{at the peak of}} the sovereign crisis (2011).

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognised that the operational {{framework for the}} monetary policy of the Eurosystem 1 has been functioning well since {{the launch of the}} euro in 1999.

Also, credit institutions have had only limited recourse to the standing facilities, which shows that the money market has been working efficiently.

Despite th{{is generally}} positive assessment, some possible measures have been examined with the aim of further improving the efficiency of the operational framework.

40|$|Direct European Central Bank {{intervention}} {{in the market for}} asset-backed securities (ABS) has the potential to become, under certain conditions, a mechanism to unlock credit markets in the euro area. When and how the ECB acts will be significant. Acting immediately to purchase existing eligible ABS products (simple structures with corporate credit exposure) is likely to produce little direct effect, given the small size of the available market, estimated at some 2 ̆ 0 ac 68 billion. However, beneficial indirect effects could arise, because of the freeing up of capital on banks' balance sheets, thus creating greater opportunities for banks to access the ECB's targeted longer-term <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation</b> (TLTRO) programme, because more loans can be granted with the same amount of capital. Improving the regulatory environment for ABS products could help revitalise a market that can be conservatively estimated at 2 ̆ 0 ac 3 trillion for the euro area when all types of ABS are included, but regulatory change requires time.
