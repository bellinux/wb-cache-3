40|$|Optimization {{of methods}} to treat and {{rehabilitate}} children, suffering from lymphopharyngeal ring diseases, is an urgent medical and social issue. The {{purpose of the}} given research was to study the efficacy of fenspiride (erespal) in treatment of children with chronic lymphopharyngeal ring diseases. The authors generalized {{the findings of the}} 3 byear dynamic observation carried out among 157 children aged between 3 and 8 years old. They found out that the 2 B week fenspirideb based therapy in average age doses has positive effects on the run of the acute respiratory infection, coming to existence against the hypertrophy of the lymphopharyngeal ring tissues, accelerates the remission of chronic adenoiditis. In the event of the <b>repeat</b> <b>application,</b> fenspiride increases efficacy of the nonspecific resistance and local immunity factors, rebuilds the microflora, slows down the progress of hypertrophy of the lymphopharyngeal ring tissues.

40|$|Impression {{cytology}} {{refers to}} {{the application of a}} cellulose acetate filter to the ocular surface to remove the superficial layers of the ocular surface epithelium. These cells can then be subjected to histological, immunohistological, or molecular analysis. Proper technique is essential as the number of cells sampled can vary considerably. Generally two to three layers of cells are removed in one application but deeper cells can be accessed by <b>repeat</b> <b>application</b> over the same site. Applications for impression cytology include diagnosing a wide range of ocular surface disorders, documenting sequential changes in the conjunctival and corneal surface over time, staging conjunctival squamous metaplasia, and monitoring effects of treatment. It is also a useful investigational tool for analysing ocular surface disease with immunostaining and DNA analysis. It is non-invasive, relatively easy to perform, and yields reliable information about the area sampled with minimal discomfort to the patient. Major ophthalmic centres should develop and introduce this technique into routine clinical practice. This is best achieved with a team approach including the ophthalmologist, pathologist, microbiologist, and the immunologist. See end of article for authors ’ affiliation...|$|E

40|$|Resistance to {{phosphine}} in {{insect pests}} of stored grain {{is a serious}} problem and there is a world-wide need for the development of sustainable resistance management strategies. Here we introduce results from a new mathematical model of resistance development that includes all life stages, rates of oviposition, natural mortality and mortality under fumigation in relation to resistant genotype. The example we discuss is phosphine resistance in the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica where resistance is known to be controlled by two major genes that are close to recessive in expression, so that resistance is not fully expressed unless both resistant genes are present and homozygous. An example of a scenario where this model could be used concerns the <b>repeat</b> <b>application</b> of phosphine in a situation where control of all life stages has not been achieved. We determined a critical interval within which a second fumigation must occur to stop a rapidly recovering population of resistant genotypes. Such scenarios can be readily investigated using this approach to provide the grain industry with resistance management options and strategies...|$|E

AI/A. Betasan was included at the standard rate of 5. 6 ounces of product/ 1000 ft 2. Turf response to sulfentrazone was mostly linear with application rate, with higher application rates causing more damage to the turf. Responses occurred quicker in the fall (by 3 DAT) compared to late winter (7 DAT). Magnitude of injury was also somewhat less in the late winter than in the fall, although rank responses were still rate dependent for sulfentrazone treated creeping bentgrass turf. Applied rates of 0. 250 and 0. 375 lb. AI/A were deleterious and not acceptable for putting green quality turf. A marginal (acceptable) response occurred overall at the 0. 125 lb. rate.

40|$|Following the {{positive}} results obtained regarding the molluscicidal {{properties of the}} latex of Euphorbia splendens that were corroborated in laboratory and field tests under restricted conditions, a field {{study was conducted in}} experimental streams located in an endemic area. After recording the average annual fluctuations of vectors in three streams, a solution of E. splendens latex at 12 ppm was applied in stream A, a solution of niclosamide at 3 ppm that was applied in stream B and a third stream (C) remained untreated for negative control. Applications of E. splendens and niclosamide resulted in a mortality of 100 % among the snails collected in the streams A and B. No dead snails were found in the negative control stream. A monthly follow-up survey conducted during three consecutive months confirmed the return of vectors to both experimental streams treated with latex and niclosamide. This fact has called for a need to <b>repeat</b> <b>application</b> in order to reach the snails that remained buried in the mud substrate or escaped to the water edge, as well as, newly hatched snails that did not respond to the concentration of these molluscicides.

40|$|Treatment {{efficacy}} {{in cancer}} patients using systemically applied cytostatic drugs is decreased by cytotoxic side effects, which limits {{the use of}} efficient dosages. Degradable starch microspheres (DSM) are used to apply drugs into blood vessels which supply the target organ leading to drug accumulation in the target organ by reduction of the blood flow. The present investigations show that DSM is a very effective embolization material leading to effective and enhanced accumulation of 5 -FU within the liver tumor tissue of experimental induced liver cancer in rats. By using intravital microscopy, a rapid deceleration of the blood flow into the target organ is observed immediately after application of DSM. The microspheres are stepwise degraded {{in the direction of}} the systemic blood flow and are totally dissolved after 25 minutes. These stepwise processes leave the degraded material during the degradation process within the vessels leading to temporally reciprocal blood flow via some of the side-arms of the major blood vessels. By using DMS in transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), severe adverse side effects like postembolization syndrome are rarely observed when compared to other embolization materials. The complete degradation of DSM causes only a short-lasting temporary vascular occlusion, which allows a <b>repeat</b> <b>application</b> of DSM in TACE...|$|E
40|$|The {{fate of the}} 14 C-labelled {{herbicide}} bentazone (Basagran(sup) R - 480 g AI/ha) {{was investigated}} in undisturbed sandy soil lysimeters exposed and cultivated under different climatic conditions. The lysimeters (1. 2 m depth, 1 square meter Surface area) were taken from agricultural land and installed in outdoor testing facilities at the Fraunhofer-Institute in Schmallenberg and at the BASF AG, Limburgerhof. The formulated product was applied at both study sites post-emergence to cereals (1 kg AI/ha). Despite different climatic conditions and therefore varying amounts of leachate the total radioactivity in the leachate was very similar two years after a single application. A <b>repeat</b> <b>application</b> of 14 C-bentazone {{in the second year}} led to an expected increase of total radioactivity in leachate. Nevertheless, the annual mean concentration of 14 C-bentazone was still below 0. 1 Myg/l. The relative amounts of total radioactivity in the soil cores two years after the second application were nearly identical (about 49 % of the applied radioactivity) and corresponded approximately to the results obtained two years after the single application.

Percent plot seed heads were {{decreased}} significantly on three of five evaluation dates before either the loss of treatment effect and/or environmental conditions triggered profuse flowering (by 20 April, 2000). The five-ounce rate produced moderate seed head suppression at 16 and 25 days after the first treatments by which afterwards, control was minimal. By April, the five-ounce repeat applications were no better in suppression of seed heads than either of the single applications, regardless of application timing (March 3 or 29). The ten-ounce rates generally produced 40 % - 80 % greater seed heads suppression than the five-ounce rate treatments. Maximum seed head control was achieved by the repeat applications (March 3 and 29) of the ten-ounce rate, which consistently produced between 8 % and 19 %, seed head cover up until the first ten days of April 2000.

40|$|Public health {{fears and}} {{economic}} concerns surround bed bug (Cimex lectularius) infestations. A resurgence of bed bug infestations was seen nationwide {{beginning in the}} early 2000 s, and anecdotal reports from pesticide applicators and health districts in Idaho suggest a similar upward trend; however, the magnitude of the Idaho problem, the geographic distribution, pesticide application practices, costs, and client education practices is unclear. Web-based, electronic, and phone surveys were developed for three groups with a stake in bed bug response and/or control including Idaho Health Districts, licensed pest control operations (PCO), and members of the Idaho lodging and restaurant association in order to assess the bed bug problem in Idaho. Preliminary PCO responses suggest a statewide distribution of bed bugs, with an apparent increase in call volume over the last 12 months suggests this is an increasing burden. Preliminary survey results suggest that complaints were received from all lodging types; however, hotels, shelters, and high-density housing were most frequently reported as problematic settings for infestation. Bed bugs were found extensively throughout these facilities, especially near beds.

40|$|The Expectation-Maximization (EM) {{algorithm}} {{is a very}} popular optimization tool for mixture problems and in particular for model-based clustering problems. However, while the {{algorithm is}} convenient to implement and numerically very stable, it only produces local solutions. Thus, it may not achieve the globally optimal solution in problems that have {{a large number of}} local optima. This paper introduces several new algorithms designed to produce global solutions in model-based clustering. The building blocks for these algorithms are methods from the operations research literature, namely the Cross-Entropy (CE) method and Model Reference Adaptive Search (MRAS). One problem with applying these methods directly is the efficient simulation of positive definite covariance matrices. We propose several new solutions to this problem. One solution is to apply the principles of Expectation-Maximization updating, which leads to two new algorithms, CE-EM and MRAS-EM. We also propose two additional algorithms, CE-CD and MRAS-CD, which rely on the Cholesky decomposition. We conduct numerical experiments of varying complexity {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed algorithms in comparison to classical EM. We find that although a single run of the new algorithms is slower than a single run of EM, all have the potential for producing significantly better solutions. We also find that although <b>repeat</b> <b>application</b> of EM may achieve similar results, our algorithms provide automated, data-driven decision rules which may significantly reduce the burden of searching for the global optimum. ...|$|E
