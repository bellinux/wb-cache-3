In September 2005, water specialists from Australia, Europe, and the United States met at an international symposium hosted by the Australian National University to debate the challenges of sustainable water management in developed economies and to critique the various strategies and reforms introduced in each region to address them. This special edition of the Environmental Law Reporter contains a collection of articles that grew out of that symposium. Below, Karen Hussey, a co-convenor of the symposium, outlines these articles and examines a theme common to them all [...] the <b>regulatory</b> <b>fragmentation</b> of natural resource management...|$|E
40|$|Nanotechnology {{has been}} {{established}} as a priority research and policy focus, cutting across several R&D fields from pharmaceutics, food and electronics. The raise of nanotechnologies {{has been accompanied by}} an enduring uncertainty characterising the developments of the scientific knowledge related to this field, as well as the social trajectories of technological applications. Such a condition inevitably affects regulatory responses to such technologies, their development and their uses. This special issue addresses this junction between uncertainty and regulation. With no ambition of providing a comprehensive assessment of such a complex issue, this collection of articles examines three relevant dimensions for understanding uncertainty in nanotechnology regulation, which can be useful entry points for further reflection and discussion: scientific uncertainty, <b>regulatory</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> social actors’ opinions about and attitudes to nanotechnology and regulation...|$|E

Based on the theory of monopolistic bottle-necks the fallacies of overregulation by undue unbundling obligations are indicated. Neither the promotion of infrastructure competition by mandatory un-bundling of competitive subparts of telecommunications infrastructure, nor <b>regulatory</b> induced network <b>fragmentation</b> within monopolistic bottleneck com-ponents is justified. The impact of the shrinking of the areas of network specific market power on the remaining unbundling regulation is analyzed.

40|$|The article {{draws on}} decentred {{analyses}} of regulation, which emphasise the fragmentation and hybridisation of regulatory systems, to analyse contemporary financial services regulation, principally in the UK. The analysis focuses on actors, their regulatory capacities, the regulatory functions {{which they do}} or could perform, their interrelationships, {{and the ways in}} which they are or could be enrolled within the regulatory system. The article contrasts such an analysis with the more familiar 'toolkit' analysis, and argues that the enrolment analysis provides a mapping device which facilitates a more nuanced analysis of the nature of <b>regulatory</b> hybridity and <b>fragmentation,</b> and facilitates debates on the development of the regulatory system. It also provides a critical frame in which to assess the likely effectiveness, the adherence to normative values, and the accountability of the regulatory system as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Background In recent years, {{there has}} been rapid growth in {{pharmaceutical}} spending in China. In addition, the country faces many challenges {{with regards to the}} quality, pricing and affordability of drugs. Pricing and reimbursement are important aspects of pharmaceutical policy that must be prioritised in order to address the many challenges. Methods This review draws on multiple sources of information. A review of the academic and grey literature along with official government statistics were combined with information from seminars held by China's State Council Development Research Center to provide an overview of pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement in China. Results Pricing and reimbursement policy were analysed through a framework that incorporates supply-side policies, proxy-demand policies and demand-side policies. China's current pharmaceutical policies interact in such a way to create dysfunction in the form of high prices, low drug quality, irrational prescribing and problems with access. Finally, the country's fragmented regulatory environment hampers pharmaceutical policy reform. Conclusions The pricing and reimbursement policy landscape can be improved through higher drug quality standards, greater market concentration, an increase in government subsidies, quality-oriented tendering, wider implementation of the zero mark-up policy, through linking reimbursement with rational prescribing, and the promotion of health technology assessment and comparative effectiveness research. Addressing broader issues of <b>regulatory</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> the lack of transparency and corruption will help ensure that policies are created in a coherent, evidence-based fashion...|$|E
40|$|In the post-Bretton Woods era, {{the advent}} of ever-expanding capital markets beyond {{national}} borders led {{to a series of}} financial reforms in many industrial economies. In comparing reform cases across different time periods in the United States, Japan, and Germany, Sara Konoe stresses the role of dynamic interactions between institutions and political contexts in determining reform paths. In non-crisis periods, <b>regulatory</b> <b>fragmentation</b> is utilized by financial sectors to pursue their demands for liberalization, though those in self-regulating or monopolized markets resist the agenda of liberalization. A time of crisis empowers reformers to restructure the financial regulatory structure and markets and enables the tightening of regulation.

40|$|The {{building}} project development approval process is increasingly complex and fraught with conflict {{due to the}} rise of the sustainable urban development movement and inclusive decision making. Coupled with this, government decision-making decentralization has resulted in a fragmented and over-regulated compliance system. Problems arising from the process include wasted resources, excessive time delays, increased holding and litigation costs, inadequate planning coordination, high levels of advocacy costs and a divisive politicized approval process. In Australia, despite attempts by government and industry associations, numerous problems are still unresolved. Design managers increasingly assume a liaison role during the approval phase. There is a long tradition of planning theory literature which provides context for understanding the knowledge-power-participation relationship for this paper. This study investigated the policy, process and practice conflicts during the approval stage in achieving sustainable urban developments. Three regional local government areas within one state jurisdiction and observations from detailed structured focus group interviews involving 23 stakeholders, proposers and assessors were analysed to explore this conflictual environment. As a result of <b>regulatory</b> <b>fragmentation</b> and excessive consultation, various persuasion tactics have been developed by all stakeholders of which `reciprocity' and `authority' were identified as the most common. Two challenges for design managers were thus identified: first, the emergence of the role of a by default central informal arbitrator across conflicting planning instruments; and, second, as a navigator through a set of persuasion tactics. An inclusive knowledge-based design management framework for sustainable urban development is proposed considering Habermas' communicative planning theory, Foucaltian governance and discursive powers thesis and Cialdini's persuasion theory, as well as being grounded in the key empirical results from this study, using various types and sources of knowledge as an authoritative persuasion tactic.

40|$|MBA thesisDuring the 1990 s, South Africa {{experienced}} {{the failure of}} the Masterbond group of companies which attracted approximately a billion rand by promising investors secured investment in the form of debentures. A public outcry led to the appointment of a commission of inquiry led by Justice Nel. Part of the findings of the Nel report pointed to the need to update the security laws existing at the time and to regulate intermediaries who are usually seen as a vital link between the public and investment companies offering securities, including instances where fraud is being perpetrated on the public. Following the Nel inquiry, a number of steps were taken. A major step was the enactment of the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act (Act No. 37 of 2002, known as the FAIS Act). The FAIS Act brought with it the relief {{that for the first time}} in South Africa, financial intermediaries would be regulated. Its main objective is to protect consumers and strengthen the integrity of the financial services industry. In furtherance of the above mentioned objectives, the FAIS Act provides for strict requirements for those who apply for licences to render financial services to the public; as well as codes of conduct for intermediaries. The FAIS Act only came into full operation on 30 September 2004. South Africa has come a long way since the days of Masterbond; however, a number of financial services providers continue to fail. In the process consumers have been left with nothing but empty promises. The question is whether there are any regulatory factors that could possibly be influencing the failure of financial services providers. Elsewhere in the world, <b>regulatory</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> capture 1 and lack of capacity and information sharing amongst regulators have been 1 Regulatory capture refers to a situation where regulators take on the objectives of management in the firms they regulate, thereby possibly losing sight of the ultimate objectives of regulation (Benink, H.

40|$|After {{the initial}} {{excitement}} about the Internet as a space outside of governmental control has evaporated and courts {{in several states}} have applied national laws to ‘Cyberspace’, {{there is now a}} consensus among scholars that regulators have in principle the authority and capacity to regulate the Internet. Nevertheless, the application of the established tools of regulation - legislation and adjudication - to the current challenges to copyright regulation posed by the Internet has proven to be ineffective and produced undesirable side effects. Although market self-regulation has been suggested as a more efficacious approach to regulating the Internet and has proven effective in content regulation and Internet governance, the market has so far been unsuccessful in providing an effective and efficient remedy to the challenges to copyright regulation. The purpose of this thesis is to examine a novel approach to regulation and analyse its benefits and limitations. The novel approach defies the conceptualisation as co- and self-regulation, but introduces the solution from outside the regulated environment through entrepreneurship and innovation, and relies on the forces of the market to become effective. In this thesis, I analyse the regulatory systems implemented by two private organisations, Noank Media and Creative Commons, in China’s reportedly ineffective copyright law environment and find that their market-based and innovative approach to regulation can be understood as a form of social entrepreneurship. Social enterprises have been claimed to deliver social goods more effectively and efficiently than governmental intervention, because they are said to rely on local knowledge, to be driven by the demand of the stakeholders, and to be focused on social value creation. Based on quantitative and qualitative fieldwork with Noank Media’s and Creative Common’s stakeholders in China I analyse to what extent these two enterprises managed to successfully leverage the assets of social entrepreneurship. I conclude that while the novel approach has demonstrated the potential to produce more effective and more efficient regulation, it does not automatically result in Better Regulation. Further efforts are required to ensure participation, transparency, and public accountability, and to avoid <b>regulatory</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The apex {{of formal}} {{international}} law development to address environmental issues {{may have occurred}} in the 1990 s, as evidenced by the difficulty in negotiating a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, but the increasing globalization of environmental law creates opportunities for regulatory innovation at the international level that may prove more successful than “traditional” state-to-state international law. A key characteristic of globalization in any field is increasing linkage, which includes linkage of national and international law and greater understanding of the linkages between nations that require coordinated management of common issues. For this reason, among others, globalization of environmental law appears poised to facilitate a reconsideration of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>fragmentation</b> that has heretofore characterized environmental law, particularly at the international level. The first wave of environmental laws that emerged in the 1970 s, at both the national and international levels, arose from recognition of the limited ability of environmental systems to withstand the onslaught of human activities corresponding with technological advance and population growth. Subsequent developments through the 1990 s (epitomized by the Rio Earth Summit) represented a maturing of the field through development of legal arrangements to directly address the profound complexity of massive environmental threats, such as climate change and biodiversity loss, at a global level. With few exceptions, however, these efforts have not succeeded in significantly reducing the threats they sought to address. A cause of this failure, running through virtually all national and international efforts, is the underlying assumption that closely intertwined environmental issues can be addressed within the confines of highly fragmented governance systems. This fragmentation includes a vertical (scale of governance) and horizontal (scope of governance authority at a given level) dimension, which encompass both institutional and issue competence elements. Building upon the trends of globalization in environmental law to more successfully address global environmental threats will require the effective development of linkages among the fragmented pieces of the environmental governance puzzle. Thus, questions of fragmentation and linkage form an under-recognized but essential element of the crossroads at which global environmental law now stands. Improving global environmental governance must involve a more effective approach to overcoming the artificial divides created by the fragmentation that was imbued in environmental law from its earliest origins and which continue to limit its ability to achieve desired results in the context of international politics. The proposed presentation (and possible paper) will explore the limitations of fragmented governance and identify potential pathways to building more effective global environmental law that responds to the reality of environmental issues linked across geography and topical scope. The presentation builds upon my 2010 IUCN Academy Colloquium presentation by analyzing the relationship of linkage and global environmental law, then drawing upon the global environmental law paradigm (or framing) to construct policy-relevant and forward-looking strategies for more successful environmental governance in the current context of global financial stress. The presentation will thus include both theoretical and practical analysis of the potential for globalization to reinvigorate environmental governance throughout the world...|$|E
