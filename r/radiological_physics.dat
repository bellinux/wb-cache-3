40|$|A {{delegation}} of the College of Radiologists of the overarching Colleges of Medicine of South Africa observed the spring sitting of the Part 2 B Examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) in London, in April 2016. Although the principal {{focus of the}} Observership was the Part 2 B examination, the delegates also assessed broader aspects of the FRCR. This report presents an overview of current FRCR practices, including the findings of an independent review of the FRCR, and reflects on the implications for the South African Fellowship examination. The report is based on discussions with key Royal College role players, direct observation of the Part 2 B examination and web-based documentation. It allows appreciation of the continued close alignment of the FC Rad Diag(SA) (Fellowship of the College of Radiologists of the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa) with the FRCR and highlights expected trends in the FC Rad Diag(SA). It also documents the increasing human resources required for successful conduct of examinations. It is hoped that the report will be of interest and relevance to the broad South African radiological community and to those contemplating specialist training in the discipline. It is trusted that it will encourage wider involvement of <b>radiological</b> and medical <b>physics</b> colleagues in the various FC Rad Diag(SA) examination processes. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} portion of the research undertaken at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) is focused on the strategic programs of the US Department of Energy`s (DOE) Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER). These programs, which include Environmental Processes (Subsurface Science, Ecosystem Function and Response, and Atmospheric Chemistry), Global Change (Climate Change, Environmental Vulnerability, and Integrated Assessments), Biotechnology (Human Genome and Structural Biology), and Health (Health Effects and Medical Applications), have been established by OHER to support DOE business areas in science and technology and environmental quality. PNL uses a set of critical capabilities based on the Laboratory`s research facilities and the scientific and technological expertise of its staff to help OHER achieve its programmatic research goals. Integration of these capabilities across the Laboratory enables PNL to assemble multidisciplinary research teams that are highly effective in addressing the complex scientific and technical issues associated with OHER-sponsored research. PNL research efforts increasingly are focused on complex environmental and health problems that require multidisciplinary teams to address the multitude of time and spatial scales found in health and environmental research. PNL is currently engaged in research in the following areas for these OHER Divisions: Environmental Sciences [...] atmospheric radiation monitoring, climate modeling, carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, ecological research, subsurface sciences, bioremediation, and environmental molecular sciences; Health Effects and Life Sciences [...] cell/molecular biology, and biotechnology; Medical Applications and Biophysical Research [...] analytical technology, and <b>radiological</b> and chemical <b>physics.</b> PNL`s contributions to OHER strategic research programs are described in this report...|$|R

A new facility to provide neutrons with energies in the range of 10 to 100 keV is being developed.Available beams include: Single particle microbeam to irradiate individual cell nuclei with single ions; monoenergetic neutrons with mean energies from 0.2 to 15 MeV; charged particles (protons, deuterons, helium-3 and helium-4 ions) with defined LET in the track-segment mode; molecular ions providing pairs of particles of known average separation; 50 to 250 kVp X-rays from standard x-ray machines; and monoenergetic X-rays with energies between 0.3 and 3.0 keV produced by proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE).|$|E
50|$|The NCI {{provides}} {{funding for}} numerous cancer research endeavors. Two of its largest known grants include the <b>Radiological</b> <b>Physics</b> Center (RPC) in Houston, Texas and the Quality Assurance Review Center (QARC) in Providence, Rhode Island. The RPC assures the NCI of proper {{participation in the}} physics-related aspects of its studies and QARC provides radiotherapy quality assurance and diagnostic imaging data management {{to all of the}} NCI sponsored cooperative groups. The RPC essentially guides all participating institutions as to how radiation is to be applied in a radiotherapy protocol. QARC on the other hand performs thousands of radiotherapy reviews per year and receives radiotherapy data from around 1,000 hospitals in both the United States and abroad. In all, over 30,000 cases have been reviewed at QARC since its inception in 1977. QARC also maintains a strategic affiliation with the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts.

5000|$|Dr. John E. Rose {{would become}} Health Physics and <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> {{division}} director at Argonne. Rose {{was involved with}} radiation detection instrumentation, including hand and foot monitors and other detectors. Further note regarding Rose: {{it was in the}} Manhattan District of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the name [...] "health physics" [...] was born, and great advances were made in radiation safety. From the beginning, the leaders of the Manhattan District recognized that a new and intense source of radiation and radioactivity would be created, and thus, in the summer of 1942, asked Ernest O. Wollan, a cosmic ray physicist at the University of Chicago, to form a group to study and control radiation hazards. Thus, Wollan was the first to bear the title of health physicist. He was soon joined by Carl G. Gamertsfelder, recently graduated physics baccalaureate, and Herbert M. Parker, the noted British-American medical physicist. By mid 1943, six others had been added: Karl Z. Morgan, James C. Hart, Robert R. Coveyou, Ole G. Landsverk, Ph.D. of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory, University of Chicago, L.A. Pardue and Dr. John E. Rose.|$|E
