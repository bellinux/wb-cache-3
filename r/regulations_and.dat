From the perspectives of Self-Determination Theory and the Psychology of Working Framework, we tested a structural model with social class and work volition predicting SDT motivation variables, which in turn predicted meaningful work. Partially supporting hypotheses, work volition {{was positively related to}} internal <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> negatively related to amotivation, whereas social class was positively related to external <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> amotivation. In turn, internal regulation was positively related to meaningful work, whereas external <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> amotivation were negatively related to meaningful work. Indirect effects from work volition to meaningful work via internal <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> amotivation were significant, and indirect effects from social class to meaningful work via external <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> amotivaiton were significant. This study highlights the important relations between SDT motivation variables and meaningful work, especially the large positive relation between internal <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> meaningful work.

40|$|Housing {{affordability}} is {{a complex}} issue that relates the supply and consumption costs of housing {{to the ability of}} the household to pay for housing costs. The <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy framework sets the direction for mitigating the negative impacts of housing affordability. This dissertation investigates whether the future direction created by current <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy is appropriate, and whether it will ultimately lead to progress in housing affordability in Roma, {{as well as in the}} wider context. Roma is a regional town within Queensland's Surat Basin resource province. Significant growth of the Coal Seam Gas industry in the region is predicted, which will have ramifications on future availability and affordability of appropriate housing. A detailed analysis of the relevant literature, <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy governing housing provision in Roma has yielded gaps and areas of conflict within the <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy framework. Using Roma as a case study, the disparities in <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy have been examined in depth to gauge what impact the conflicting elements will have on housing affordability. The significance of the areas of conflict within the framework has wider regional and state wide implications that will need to be addressed by regulators. This dissertation has shown that the volume, complexity and lack of coordination between the various elements of <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy detract from the execution of the <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy framework. As a consequence, <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy roadmaps have been produced to enable the relationships between components within the <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy framework to be visualised. The roadmaps assist with the interpretation of the future direction of <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy, and show where changes can be incorporated into the framework to achieve the desired outcome. The major recommendation resulting from this dissertation is to ensure the principles of supply and demand in the housing market are balanced. This will involve the provision of additional residential land to be developed at higher density than currently exist in Roma. In conjunction, the methods of measuring housing affordability must be amended, along with accurate and realistic predictions of housing demand to constantly ensure that the <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> policy framework is relevant, and the supply of land is sufficient. ...|$|R
