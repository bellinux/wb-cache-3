50|$|The larvae are a pest on Citrus species. They bore {{into the}} petals <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> {{of the flower}} buds of their host plant, causing {{premature}} flower drop or fruit distortion.|$|R
50|$|The air-vessel <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> may be {{conveniently}} made of iron, but as {{the effect}} does not depend upon {{the nature of the}} material, other metals or convenient materials may be used. The size of the air-vessel must depend upon the blast, and upon the heat necessary to be produced. For an ordinary smith’s fire or forge, an air-vessel <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> capable of containing 1200 cubic inches will be of proper dimensions; and for a cupola of the usual size for cast-iron founders, an air-vessel capable of containing 10,000 cubic inches will be of a proper size.|$|R

5000|$|The {{attack on}} the {{character}} of the person is perhaps best brought together by the highly suggestive and related compound word, slut's-hole, meaning a place <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> for rubbish; the associated quote provides a sense of this original meaning: ...|$|R
50|$|Due to Japanese {{military}} limitations prohibiting air-to-ground ordnance, the F-4EJs {{were delivered}} without the AN/AJB-7 bombing computer system and {{also did not}} have an air-refueling probe <b>or</b> <b>receptacle.</b> In service F-4EJs replaced the JASDF's fleet of Lockheed F-104 J Starfighters.|$|R
5000|$|Otto Rank explores {{this topic}} in his book, The Myth of the Birth of the Hero. The exposure, {{especially}} in water, [...] "signifies no more {{and no less}} than the symbolic expression of birth. The children come out of the water. The basket, box, <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> simply means the container, the womb; so that the exposure directly signifies the process of birth".|$|R
5000|$|An AC power {{conditioner}} is the typical {{power conditioner}} that provides [...] "clean" [...] AC power to sensitive electrical equipment. Usually this {{is used for}} home or office applications and has up to 10 <b>or</b> more <b>receptacles</b> <b>or</b> outlets and commonly provides surge protection as well as noise filtering.|$|R
50|$|During {{the wedding}} reception, it is typical {{to release a}} pair of white male and female doves, symbolising marital harmony and peace. These are placed in a cage <b>or</b> <b>receptacle,</b> which can be opened by pulling ribbons or cords or {{manually}} opened and released by the couple themselves. After their release from their cage, the person who catches them may take them home to rear as pets.|$|R
5000|$|Connecting {{an older}} device {{to a host}} with a USB-C {{receptacle}} requires a cable or adapter with a USB-A or USB-B plug <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> on one end and a USB-C plug on the other end. Legacy adapters with a USB-C receptacle are [...] "not defined or allowed" [...] by the specification because they can create [...] "many invalid and potentially unsafe" [...] cable combinations.|$|R
5000|$|Scoop Proof {{describe}} a longer shell design on the pin half (plug <b>or</b> <b>receptacle)</b> of a connector. The longer shell allows the pin contacts—protruding {{from the face}} of the connector—to be recessed sufficiently so as not to be damaged if the mating shell is [...] "scooped" [...] into it during mating process. This prevents pins from being bent or contacts from being electrically shorted during mating.|$|R
50|$|Flowers may be {{directly}} {{attached to the}} plant at their base (sessile—the supporting stalk or stem is highly reduced or absent). The stem or stalk subtending a flower is called a peduncle. If a peduncle supports more than one flower, the stems connecting each flower to the main axis are called pedicels. The apex of a flowering stem forms a terminal swelling which is called the torus <b>or</b> <b>receptacle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gangbox (also gang box) is a colloquial term {{utilized}} {{in the construction}} industry, referring to a toolbox or workbox that can be accessed by multiple workers. Gangbox is also a term in the electrical industry used to indicate a box, usually metal, which houses installed electrical componentry. [...] A 1-gang box hosts a single component such as a switch <b>or</b> <b>receptacle,</b> a 2-gang box hosts two components side-by-side, and so on.|$|R

These seaweeds have a long breeding season, shedding eggs and sperm in the winter months when othertypesof eggs are difficultto obtain. In 1929 â€” 30 eggs of Fucus vesiculosus were collected from Oc tober until June. Throughout this time some eggs were always ob tainable from plants with relatively large fruiting tips, <b>or</b> <b>receptacles...</b>|$|R
50|$|The toast rack's {{design and}} shape follows {{prevailing}} fashion. The dividers were often made from silver wires and these in turn were soldered {{to either a}} wire-work or solid base that sat on four feet. Sometimes the base is separate and was used to dispose of any crumbs that fell. Some ingenious designs were made including expanding or folding types (so as to take up less space). Others had incorporated egg-cups <b>or</b> <b>receptacles</b> for jam <b>or</b> marmalade.|$|R
5000|$|A {{good quality}} power {{conditioner}} is designed with internal filter banks {{to isolate the}} individual power outlets <b>or</b> <b>receptacles</b> on the power conditioner. This eliminates interference or [...] "cross-talk" [...] between components. For example, if the application will be a home theater system, the noise suppression rating listed in the technical specifications of the power conditioner will be very important. This rating is expressed in decibels (db). The higher the db rating, the better the noise suppression.|$|R

500|$|In G.triplex, {{the bases}} of the rays usually break around the {{perimeter}} of the endoperidium to form a saucerlike platform <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> in which the endoperidium rests. However, not all specimens form this receptacle, leading to possible confusion with other Geastrum species. Curtis Gates Lloyd claimed that in tropical regions, with an abundance of high temperatures and humidity, the fungus expands rapidly, which is more conducive to the fleshy layer breaking away to form a receptacle; in more temperate areas this effect would not be as pronounced and [...] "usually does not occur at all".|$|R

60|$|Immediately {{thereafter}} the Topila erupted. The {{roar of the}} Chill's exhaust nearly drowned {{the roar}} of the guns, but the fragile hull of the craft was shaken and rocked by the bursting shells. An occasional bullet thudded into or pinged off the Chill, and, despite Peter's warning that, high or low, they were bound to get it if it came to them, every man on board, including Peter, crouched, with chest contracted by drawn-in shoulders, in an instinctive and purely unconscious effort to lessen the area of body he presented as a target <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> for flying fragments of steel.|$|R

Every one carried a basket <b>or</b> <b>receptacle,</b> which he swung aloft, and they sang, prayed, rejoiced on their knees. Jones {{turned away from}} the sickening scenes that convinced him these savages were little better than cannibals. Rea cursed them, and tumbled them over, and threatened them with the big bowie. An altercation ensued, heated on his side, frenzied on theirs. Thinking some treachery might befall his comrade, Jones ran into the thick of the group.|$|R

5000|$|A potty {{chair is}} a proportionately small chair or {{enclosure}} with {{an opening for}} seating very young children to [...] "go potty." [...] It is {{a variant of the}} close stool which was used by adults before the widespread adoption of water flushed toilets. There are a variety of designs, some placed directly over the toilet called [...] "Toilet Training Seats" [...] so the egested fecal material drops directly into the toilet bowl thereby eliminating manual removal and disposal of the said waste from a receptacle beneath the hole which is often a bag <b>or</b> <b>receptacle</b> similar to a chamber pot.

The common base of the florets (<b>or</b> <b>receptacle)</b> is flat with indents where the florets are inplanted, while scales and hairs are absent. The bell-shaped involucre consists of four to five rows of green bracts, sometimes tinged purple at the stretched tip and with a papery irregularly fine dentate edge. The bracts in the outer row are 6-7 mm long and 1½-2 mm wide, while bracts in rows further up are increasingly long, eventually reaching 21-23 mm. Each head carries twenty five to forty florets.|$|R
5000|$|In 1857, {{when the}} chancel {{of the church}} was demolished, a slab of Purbeck marble was found, about 26 inches by 14, bearing an incised {{portrait}} of {{a man wearing a}} long robe, his hands raised to hold a plain shield <b>or</b> <b>receptacle,</b> with a horn hanging on a strap from his left shoulder. This was tentatively identified as Waleran Venator (Waleran the Huntsman), who held land in the parish and was patron of the living in the 11th century, which was the approximate date of the chancel. However, from the costume being of a later date, Alan de Langford, Verderer of Grovely Wood {{at the end of the}} 13th century, has also been suggested.|$|R
