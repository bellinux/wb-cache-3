Three {{different}} numerical tests, i. e. no <b>rolling</b> <b>test,</b> free <b>rolling</b> <b>test</b> and <b>rolling</b> resistance <b>test,</b> in {{the framework}} of discrete element method (DEM) are carried out to simulate the micro-structure development in shear bands. The rotational angles and effective strain in the specimen under different conditions are given out. By contrast, it can be concluded that the development of shear bands in granular material can be simulated well when the rolling resistance is taken into account in DEM...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSingle-flank and double-flank <b>rolling</b> <b>tests</b> are {{functional}} verifications {{to obtain}} representative {{parameters of the}} future gear behavior under operating conditions. The reliability of the results are questioned due to the great number of error sources together {{with a lack of}} norms that could provide a standard traceability procedure. Currently, there are not commercial machines that integre both tests. In this work, the development of an equipment which combines single-flank and double-flank <b>rolling</b> <b>tests</b> for worm-worm gear is presented. Consequently, complete studies about principal influences and relation between both types of test can be performed.

30|$|Prior to the <b>rolling</b> <b>tests,</b> the mass, roughness, and {{hardness}} of the specimens were measured. The <b>rolling</b> contact fatigue <b>test</b> {{was then}} carried out, and the weight, roughness, and hardness of the specimens were subsequently measured again. To analyze the wear and fatigue damage mechanisms in the wheel materials, SEM {{was used to}} observe subsurface cracks and the scar morphology, and an optical microscope was used to analyze plastic deformations near the surface.|$|R
30|$|In the <b>rolling</b> <b>tests</b> of {{different}} materials (Fig.  8 a), for the layers displaying a steep hardness gradient, {{the thickness of}} these layers has a negative correlation with the initial surface hardness, while the hardness increments have a positive one.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} optimal {{tests for}} model selection between two nested {{models in the}} presence of underlying parameter instability. These are joint tests for both parameter instability and a null hypothesis on (a subset of) the parameters. They modify the existing tests for parameter instability to allow the parameter vector to be unknown. It is commonly argued that out-of-sample <b>rolling</b> <b>tests</b> are useful to select between competing models when the parameters are time-varying. This paper argues that the optimal tests identified here are locally asymptotically more powerful than the out-of-sample <b>rolling</b> <b>tests.</b> It also shows that the optimal tests are more powerful than sequential tests that test for parameter instability in a first stage and select the model in a second state, the reason being that the two stages of the test are not independent. A simple empirical application to international finance models of nominal exchange rate determination is considered. ...|$|R

40|$|Cross wedge rolling (CWR) {{is a very}} {{efficient}} technological process which has a favourable effect on properties of rolled products. At the same time, however, this forming technique causes complex non-linear problems resulting from variable contact conditions in the deformation zone. During the rolling process either adhesion or surface slip on the rolling contact surface may occur. The situation is further complicated by complexly-shaped wedge tools with thread-forming grooves. Those problems notwithstanding, the cross wedge rolling process can be examined effectively {{with the aid of}} computer simulations which precede both laboratory and industrial tests. Lublin University of Technology has developed and implemented a novel method of screw spike rolling as well as it has conducted computer simulations and model <b>tests</b> of <b>rolling</b> semi-finished gears. Even though the <b>rolling</b> <b>tests</b> have been carried out on semi-finished gears, it is expected that significant material savings can be yielded in the process of producing finished products. Given the <b>rolling</b> <b>tests</b> conducted on other products, it can be assumed that the quality of produced gears thus can be also improved, in contrast to gears produced by means of metal machining methods. Apart from screw spikes, hot cross wedge rolling also allows to produce coarse-pitch gears, which is not possible in a cold cross wedge rolling operation. ?????????-???????? ????????
