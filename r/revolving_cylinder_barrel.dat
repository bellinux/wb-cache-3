50|$|As {{a general}} rule, revolvers cannot be {{effective}} {{with a sound}} suppressor ("silencer"), as there is usually a small gap between the <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the <b>barrel</b> which a bullet must traverse or jump when fired. From this opening, a rather loud report is produced. A suppressor can only suppress noise coming from the muzzle.|$|R

The <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> is ground and/or honed internally with a typical surface finish of 4 to 16 microinch. The piston reciprocates in the cylinder.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this study, CrZrN {{film was}} {{deposited}} on AISI 4130 <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> and valve plate using a unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The tribological properties between a coated steel <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> and coated steel valve plate {{were evaluated by}} a custom-built disk-to-disk tribometer {{and the results were}} compared with those between a coated steel <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> and a conventional bronze valve plate. The lowest friction coefficients were observed between a coated steel <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> and coated steel valve plate and they were approximately one half of those between a coated steel <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> and conventional bronze valve plate in the range of testing up to 1600 rpm. Coated valve plate and bronze valve plate showed a steady state of friction coefficient at approximately 0. 03 and 0. 06, respectively after about 1000 rpm, but steel valve plate without coating showed a continuous decrease in friction coefficient, which suggested that active wear is continuously occurring. By applying CrZrN coating on the commercial <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel</b> and steel valve plate, much improved tribological results could be obtained, by a factor of approximately 2 in terms of friction coefficient than those from bronze valve plate. Under a tap water environment CrZrN coating appeared to perform better than CrSiN coating. Although further work to reduce the friction coefficient below 0. 13 in the steady state after initial drop is still needed, possibilities of applying CrZrN coating to realize a water hydraulic pump were demonstrated through the present work...|$|R

5000|$|The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver was {{the first}} {{commercial}} example, introduced in 1901. It was recoil-operated, and the <b>cylinder</b> and <b>barrel</b> recoiled backwards to cock the hammer and <b>revolve</b> the <b>cylinder.</b> It was distinctive in that cam grooves were milled {{on the outside of}} the cylinder to provide a means of advancing to the next chamber—half a turn as the cylinder moved back, and half a turn as it moved forward[...]38 caliber versions held 8 shots, [...]455 caliber versions 6. Around 4,750 were made in total.|$|R
50|$|The STC {{conversion}} on the Cessna 182 {{includes a}} new cowl, both {{to accommodate the}} different engine dimensions and to provide the required cooling airflow. Belly-mounted cowl flaps are still used, but less cooling airflow is directed over the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels</b> and more cooling airflow is directed into side-mounted oil coolers. About one-third of the engine cooling is provided by airflow over the cylinders; the remainder is provided by engine oil. The engine's oil distribution system routes a large oil flow to hot zones in the cylinder heads and upper <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrels,</b> carrying the heat away to the oil coolers.|$|R
5000|$|Leavitt {{took out}} his patent {{less than a year}} after Samuel Colt had {{obtained}} a patent on his seminal revolver, and before Colt had a chance to bring his new weapon to market. The patent was granted to Leavitt at his residence in Cabotville, Massachusetts, now part of Chicopee, Massachusetts. The design was radical in one respect. [...] "The <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> which I use does not differ from such as have been previously employed in many-chambered guns," [...] Leavitt wrote in his patent application. [...] "The improvement which I have made consists in giving a convex form to that end of the <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> which is in contact with the barrel." ...|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, popular usage {{refers to}} the whole {{assembly}} of cylinder, piston, and piston rod (or more) collectively as a [...] "piston", which is incorrect.

25|$|A {{revolver}} is a repeating handgun {{that has}} a <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> containing multiple chambers {{and at least one}} barrel for firing.

50|$|Most <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder,</b> {{axial piston}} engine designs utilize a fixed, multi-lobed barrel-type cam and rollers on the pistons to control the {{reciprocating}} movement of the pistons. The benefit of this approach, versus a conventional crankshaft-and-connecting-rod mechanism, is that the kinematics of the piston motion can be optimized with regards to combustion cycle efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Welded body {{cylinders}} have no tie rods. The barrel is welded {{directly to}} the end caps. The ports are welded to the barrel. The front rod gland is usually threaded into or bolted to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>barrel.</b> That allows the piston rod assembly and the rod seals to be removed for service.|$|R
