5|$|In combating the Iron Guard, Tătărescu {{chose to}} relax {{virtually}} all {{pressures on the}} latter (while mimicking some of its messages), and instead concentrated again on curbing {{the activities of the}} <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCR) and outlawing its Popular Front-type organizations (see Amicii URSS).|$|E
5|$|His career {{stalled in}} the 1970s because {{he refused to}} swear {{allegiance}} to the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and was forced out of academia for his sympathies towards Israel. When Librescu requested permission to emigrate to Israel, the Academy of Science of Romania fired him. In 1976, a smuggled research manuscript that he had published in the Netherlands drew him international attention in the growing field of material dynamics.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> seized {{political}} power, the sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, {{under the supervision of}} the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's integration in the strategic system of the Soviets, at the beginning of the Cold War.|$|E

5000|$|The SovRoms' end, {{evidence}} of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> relative emancipation from Soviet control, ran parallel to the De-Stalinization process; it was approved by Nikita Khrushchev and carried out by Miron Constantinescu (head of the Planning Board).|$|R
5|$|In the end, Tătărescu became {{involved}} in negotiations aimed at withdrawing Romania from the conflict, and, while beginning talks with the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCR), tried to build foreign connections to support Romania's cause following the inevitable defeat; he thus corresponded with Edvard Beneš, leader of the Czechoslovak government in exile in England. Beneš, who had already been discussing matters involving Romania with Richard Franasovici and Grigore Gafencu, and had agreed to support the Romanian cause, informed the Allied governments of Tătărescu's designs.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Romania on an official visit in late 1946-early 1947, {{as part of}} a tour of the emerging Eastern Bloc during which he also stopped in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The speeches he and Sașa Pană gave on the occasion, published by Orizont journal, were noted for condoning official positions of the PCF and the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> and are credited by Irina Livezeanu with causing a rift between Tzara and young Romanian avant-gardists such as Victor Brauner and Gherasim Luca (who rejected communism and were alarmed by the Iron Curtain having fallen over Europe). In September of the same year, he was present at the conference of the pro-communist International Union of Students (where he was a guest of the French-based Union of Communist Students, and met with similar organizations from Romania and other countries).|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{had planned}} to provide China with an atomic bomb {{complete}} with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead. When Khrushchev {{paid a visit to}} China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit. Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader Peng Zhen mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.|$|E
5000|$|The Union of Communist Youth (Romanian: UTC) was the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> youth organisation, {{modelled}} {{after the}} Soviet Komsomol. It aimed to cultivate young cadres into the party, {{as well as}} to help create the [...] "new man" [...] envisioned by communist ideologues.|$|R
40|$|The article {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between the French and the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Parties</b> in the 1960 s. A thorough research in the Archives of the FCP indicates that the scarcity of the contacts between the two parties is due both to the mutations of the post-War global communist system and to the particular nature of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>communist</b> Party-state...|$|R
50|$|Although {{initially}} {{a supporter}} of the regime, he expressed alarm after the July Theses were issued in 1971, and, considered {{one of the leaders of}} the liberal wing of the Writers' Union of Romania, was dropped from the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> central committee at its 13th Congress in 1984.|$|R
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, Gheorghe Tătărescu {{initiated}} a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, {{he was also the}} President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After that moment, relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the Tămădău Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to testify in the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.|$|E
25|$|Tănase {{became a}} public figure soon after the Romanian Revolution of 1989: in 1990, he {{took part in the}} Golaniad, the protest {{movement}} against former members of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> who had gained power during the Revolution.|$|E
25|$|His {{last major}} office {{was that of}} Ambassador to Romania, where he {{maintained}} close contacts with the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> faction formed around Ana Pauker and {{played a part in}} facilitating electoral fraud during the general election of 1946.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{began in}} 1952 and was {{completed}} in 1956. The building was named Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Scînteii [...] "I.V.Stalin" [...] and later Casa Scînteii (Scînteia {{was the name of}} the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> official newspaper). It was designed by the architect Horia Maicu, and was intended to house all of Bucharest's printing presses, the newsrooms and their staff. Its height is 91.6 m without the television antenna, which measures an additional 12.4 m.|$|R

The building was named Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Scînteii [...] "I.V.Stalin" [...] and later Casa Scînteii (Scînteia {{was the name of}} the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> official newspaper). It was designed by the architect Horia Maicu, in the pure (albeit comparatively small-scale) style of Soviet Socialist realism, resembling the main building of the Moscow State University, and was intended to house all of Bucharest's printing presses, the newsrooms and their staff.|$|R
25|$|In {{his final}} years, Zissu's Zionism merged with {{explicit}} anti-communism, clashing {{directly with the}} <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> anti-cosmopolitan agenda. His renewed effort to ensure the mass emigration of Romanian Jews, and his contacts with Israel, made him a target for the communist regime: in 1951, he was arrested, and, in 1954, sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of high treason. He was amnestied after some two years in prison, {{where he had been}} tortured and brutalized. Himself an emigrant, he died shortly after resettling in Israel.|$|R
25|$|Like Mihail Sebastian, who {{was himself}} {{becoming}} influenced by Ionescu, he maintained contacts with intellectuals {{from all sides}} of the political spectrum: their entourage included the right-wing Dan Botta and Mircea Vulcănescu, the non-political Petrescu and Ionel Jianu, and Belu Zilber, {{who was a member of}} the illegal <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ceaușescu was outlived by her mother, a near centenarian at {{the time}} of her death, her brother Gheorghe Petrescu (also an {{important}} figure in the party) and her three children: Valentin (b. 1948), Zoia (1949–2006) and Nicu (1951–1996), who was also a very important member of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> Elena Ceaușescu was buried in the Ghencea Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The post-1945 {{constant}} {{growth in}} membership, {{by far the}} highest of all Eastern Bloc countries, {{was to provide a}} base of support for Gheorghiu-Dej. The conference also saw the first mention of the PCdR as the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCR), the new name being used as a propaganda tool suggesting a closer connection with the national interest.|$|E
50|$|The Romanian Ecologist Party (Partidul Ecologist Român) {{was founded}} by Petre Metanie, a teacher, in 1978 as a {{political}} organisation opposed to Nicolae Ceaușescu and the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> policy of indiscriminate economic growth, without regard for ecological consequences. In the seventies {{a large number of}} children were born malformed due to high levels of chemical pollution in the air, water and food. The fauna also suffered enormously due to dams built {{in the path of the}} natural migration of fish, and there was damage to populations of wild boar, deer and birds.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the time}} of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> Fifth Congress in 1931, Béla Kun, who was at the time a leading Comintern figure {{directed}} the party to replace its entire leadership, including the general secretary Vitali Holostenco - appointing Stefanski, who was at the time still a member of the KPP, to head the Romanian party as the general secretary. The reshuffling of the PCdR's leadership structure also signified a boost in the political careers of, among others, Filipescu, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, Bela Breiner, Gheorghe Stoica, Nicolae Goldberger, and Vanda Nicolski, all of whom were nominated to the Central Committee.|$|R
500|$|Following the November 1918 Armistice with Germany, Dada's {{evolution}} {{was marked}} by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and Otto Flake began publishing Der Zeltweg, a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible. Richter, who admits that the magazine was [...] "rather tame", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing {{with the impact of}} communist revolutions, in particular the October Revolution and the German revolts of 1918, which [...] "had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change." [...] The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that Der Zeltweg was [...] "an association of revolutionary artists." [...] According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of <b>Romanian</b> <b>communist</b> students, and, as such, may have met with Ana Pauker, who was later one of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> most prominent activists.|$|R
25|$|In November 1989, the XIVth Congress of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCR) saw Ceaușescu, then aged 71, re-elected {{for another}} five years {{as leader of the}} PCR. During the Congress, Ceaușescu made a speech denouncing the anti-Communist {{revolutions}} happening throughout the rest of Eastern Europe. The following month, Ceaușescu's government itself collapsed after a series of violent events in Timișoara and Bucharest.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} in his life, Groza {{was able to}} amass a {{personal}} fortune as a wealthy landowner and establish a notable reputation as a prominent layman within the Romanian Orthodox Church, a position which would later make him invaluable to a <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCR) that was campaigning to attract the support of Eastern Orthodox Christians who constituted the nation's most numerous religious group in 1945.|$|E
25|$|During the war's final stage, Kavtaradze {{was sent}} to the Romanian Kingdom, whose {{alliance}} with the Axis Powers was ended by the King Michael Coup of August 1944 (see Romania during World War II). His office as Ambassador, like the Soviet military presence, was instrumental in providing guidance and assistance for the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCR). He took over his post in 1945, and kept it until 1952.|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, on the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> agenda {{two major}} points were highlighted: massive {{industrialization}} and the recruitment of party members. The article explores the role and functions of the socialist enterprise in communist Romania, a place where the interaction between party and society was strongly emphasized. Focusing on the first two decades of communist rule, I have chosen as a case study an enterprise with an old tradition, created at {{the end of the}} XIXth century: The Hunedoara Integrated Iron and Steel Works. In the confined space of the socialist enterprise the political, economical and social objectives of the communist regime were put in practice. In this context, the socialist enterprise became one of the most important places of propaganda, domination and control...|$|R
5000|$|In Communist Romania, Rodion Markovits' overall {{work was}} {{considered}} for translation and republication during the mid-1960s—a {{project of the}} state-run ESPLA Publishing House, with assistance from his former Timişoaran colleagues Zoltán Franyó and József Méliusz. Markovits continued to be respected by the national communist authorities, even as the diplomatic contacts with Hungary began to worsen. Around 1968, the Romanian regime promoted Markovits, Jenő Dsida, Sándor Makkai, Aladár Kuncz and some others as the canonical authors of Hungarian-Romanian literature, but, Hungarian observers wrote, it remained silent about the more unpalatable political stances these authors took. In a 1981 review of Hungarian Romanian literature, published by the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> Era Socialistă, Kuncz and Markovits were introduced as authors of [...] "anti-militarist novels ... unmasking the cruelty of World War I".|$|R
5000|$|Grigore Cugler {{was opposed}} to the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> {{takeover}} of the country, effected in successive stages after World War II (see Communist Romania). In late 1947, just after the Communist Ana Pauker took over as Foreign Minister, he decided to resign his diplomatic position, motivating his gesture {{in a letter to}} Pauker as the consequence of [...] "the new orientation in Romanian government policies, which part with my convictions and sentiments". Manolescu argued that the choice of words was in contrast with the usual perception of their author as [...] "trifling". Reportedly, Cugler's action caused consternation in Bucharest, where no one had yet attempted to confront Ana Pauker using such terms. He himself spoke of his departure as an [...] "unlimited vacation", and, shortly before leaving, handed down copies of his texts for Vremea to his friend Petru Dumitraşcu.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the protesters}} {{attempted}} to burn down the building that housed the district committee of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCR). The Securitate responded with tear gas and water jets, while police beat up rioters and arrested many of them. Around 21:00 the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the Romanian Orthodox Cathedral and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces.|$|E
25|$|Many attacks {{focused on}} Monica Lovinescu, who was {{broadcasting}} anti-communist messages on Radio Free Europe— {{in one instance}} during 1987, Barbu used his column in Săptămâna to belittle the work of Eugen Lovinescu, a major literary critic who was Monica Lovinescu's father; this drew criticism from the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (of which Barbu was a member) and alarm from the Securitate, as it went against more restrained official guidelines regarding the works of Eugen Lovinescu.|$|E
25|$|Failing {{to control}} the crowds, the Ceaușescus finally took cover inside the {{building}} that housed the Central Committee of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> The {{rest of the day}} saw an open revolt of Bucharest's population, which had assembled in University Square and confronted the police and army at barricades. The rioters were no match for the military apparatus concentrated in Bucharest, which cleared the streets by midnight and arrested hundreds of people in the process.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{losses on}} the Eastern Front led Antonescu {{to embark on}} {{inconclusive}} peace negotiations with the Allies. After the negotiations, he was ousted in a coup d'état led by young monarch Michael I, which later became known as King Michael's Coup. After a brief detention in the Soviet Union, the deposed Conducător was handed back to Romania, where he was tried by a special People's Tribunal and executed. This {{was part of a}} series of trials that also passed sentences on his various associates, as well as his wife Maria. The judicial procedures earned much criticism for responding to the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> ideological priorities, a matter that fueled nationalist and far right attempts to have Antonescu posthumously exonerated. While these groups elevated Antonescu to the status of hero, his involvement in the Holocaust was officially reasserted and condemned following the 2003 Wiesel Commission report.|$|R
5000|$|With all {{meaningful}} opposition {{having been}} eliminated, the People's Democratic Front, {{dominated by the}} <b>Communist</b> <b>Romanian</b> Workers <b>Party</b> (as the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> had been renamed after merging with the Social Democrats) received 93.2% of the vote and won 405 of the 414 seats in the Great National Assembly.|$|R
2500|$|Allegedly, Nichita Smochină found {{understanding}} from Romania's {{new national}} communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu. He claimed that, in 1965, Ceaușescu {{asked him to}} retrieve those documents which showed Antonescu's move to a separate peace; driven by a Securitate guard to Caransebeș, where he had allegedly buried the evidence {{back in the late}} '40s, Smochină only recovered three empty crates. Ceaușescu allowed him to receive a new pension, but he was denied reintegration into the Academy, with the suggestion that such a move would dampen Romania–Russia relations. These were openly tested by the Bessarabian community in February 1967, when Halippa presented Ceaușescu's Council of State with reports on the existence of oppressed Soviet Romanians. These included a polemical note by Smochină, who condemned the Soviet-endorsed delimitation of a [...] "Moldovan people" [...] in Bessarabia, and in general the ideology of [...] "Moldovenism". A month later, Halippa advanced Smochină's name among those of Bessarabians who could serve as specialists for the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> ISISP foundation of social science.|$|R
