40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a set of flight worthy <b>radomes</b> which form the parts of wing mounted store(pod). The various activities of this program are: design, analysis, fabrication, testing and certification. This set contains <b>radomes</b> of tangent ogive shapes and arbitrary complex geometries. Solid wall concept with E glass-epoxy composite material was selected which caters for limited frequency band Stress analyses of <b>radomes</b> subjected to flight loads were carried out by finite element technique. Fabrication was carried out by employing pressure bag moulding and vacuum bag moulding techniques. Structural tests were carried out to ensure that the <b>radomes</b> resist the flight loads in a satisfactory manner. These <b>radomes</b> were painted under controlled humidity and temperature conditions with special imported coatings which provide protection against rain erosion and static electricity. These <b>radomes</b> were subjected to six environmental tests as per MIL 810 C and JSS. No physical damage and functional deterioration was noted after the environmental tests. Eight sets of four <b>radomes</b> were supplied to the sponsoring authority...|$|R
30|$|The {{simulation}} {{results indicate that}} the offset focus can compensate the degradation of dielectric sandwich <b>radomes</b> and have a good potential application for metal-space frame <b>radomes,</b> especially the distortion of radiation patterns.|$|R
50|$|On rotary-wing and {{fixed-wing}} aircraft using microwave satellite for beyond-line-of-sight communication, <b>radomes</b> often appear as blisters on the fuselage. In addition to protection, <b>radomes</b> also streamline the antenna system, thus reducing drag.|$|R
5|$|The first anti-submarine {{version for}} the Royal Navy, with Gnome H.1400 engines, a five-bladed tail rotor, a Plessey Type 195 dipping sonar and MEL ARI 5995 search radar in a dorsal <b>radome.</b> The Westland Sea King HAS.1 first flew on 7 May 1969. 56 built, {{many of which}} were {{converted}} to HAS.2.|$|E
5|$|Upgraded {{version of}} the Sea King Mk.43 for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Upgraded avionics, {{including}} MEL Sea Searcher radar in large dorsal <b>radome,</b> weather radar in nose and FLIR turret under nose. Three new-build plus upgrade of remaining Mk.43 and Mk.43A helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Upgraded anti-submarine warfare {{version for}} the Royal Navy, with longer range MEL Super Searcher radar in {{enlarged}} dorsal <b>radome,</b> new AQS902 acoustic processing system with provision to use sonobouys. Entered service in June 1981; 30 new build aircraft plus about 55 converted from earlier versions. Some later converted into the HAR.5 for Search and Rescue.|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO provided information on the potential for shortfalls {{in the performance of}} two <b>radomes,</b> one for the F- 15 Eagle and one for the F- 16 Falcon, focusing on whether replacement <b>radomes,</b> bought for spares and supplied by vendors other than the original manufacturer, met the Air Force's specifications for the original <b>radomes.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Another less known {{military}} {{version is}} the 202B Electronic warfare model. This version {{was made in}} small numbers, and had distinct large <b>radomes</b> {{at each end of}} the fuselage. The <b>radomes</b> contained the Electronic Warfare mission systems.|$|R
5000|$|For {{maritime}} satellite communications service, <b>radomes</b> {{are widely used}} to protect dish antennas which are continually tracking fixed satellites while the ship experiences pitch, roll and yaw movements. Large cruise ships and oil tankers may have <b>radomes</b> over 3 m in diameter covering antennas for broadband transmissions for television, voice, data, and the Internet, while recent developments allow similar services from smaller installations such as the 85 cm motorised dish used in the ASTRA2Connect Maritime Broadband system. Small private yachts may use <b>radomes</b> as small as 26 cm in diameter for voice and low-speed data.|$|R
5|$|Developed {{version of}} the B.1. Larger, thinner wing than the B.1 (Phase 2C wing) and fitted with Olympus 201-202 engines of 17,000 lbf (76 kN) each, or Olympus 301 engines of 20,000 lbf (89 kN) each. Uprated {{electrics}} with Auxiliary Airborne Power Plant (AAPP) (Auxiliary power unit) and Ram Air Turbine (RAT). ECM similar to B.1A. Terrain-Following Radar (TFR) in nose thimble <b>radome</b> fitted to most aircraft in mid-60s. New Radar warning receiver aerials on tail fin giving it a square top from the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|As Liquid, in REX, battles Snake, Gray Fox appears, destroys REX's <b>radome,</b> and is killed. Snake destroys REX and defeats Liquid, then escapes with Meryl or Otacon via an {{underground}} tunnel, pursued by Liquid in a Jeep. After their vehicles crash, Liquid pulls {{a gun on}} Snake but dies from FoxDie. Colonel Campbell, briefly ousted from command, calls off a nuclear strike to destroy evidence of the operation, and has Snake registered as killed in action to stop the US government searching for him. Naomi Hunter, who injected Snake with the FoxDie virus, tells him that he has an indeterminate amount of time before it kills him. Ocelot calls the U.S. President; he was a double agent whose mission was to steal Baker's disk of Metal Gear specifications.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Sea Kings {{had similar}} {{avionics}} {{to that of}} the Sea King HAS.1, with the same ARI 5995 search radar in a dorsal <b>radome,</b> but had American Bendix AN/ASQ-13A dipping sonar instead of the Plessey sonar of the Royal Navy Sea Kings. They also had more powerful engines giving improved high temperature hover performance. Australia's Sea Kings were flown by 817 Squadron RAN from HMAS Melbourne until the carrier was retired from service, without replacement. As the Sea King was too large to operate from the s, 817 Squadron was then forced to operate from land bases, in both ASW and utility roles, with the Sea King relinquishing the anti-submarine mission in 1990.|$|E

30|$|In practice, {{one-piece}} <b>radomes</b> {{are extremely}} rare, and most <b>radomes</b> are multipartite dielectric ones, especially for large <b>radomes.</b> In this simulation, both the panels and joints (composed of glass fiber) are included. The metal bolts are ignored. The effect of metal bolts is extremely small, since the area {{blocked by the}} bolts is so small as a literature indicated [26]. The thickness of joints is 30  mm. The joints are considered as thick dielectrics with an analysis strategy of ray tracing. The diameter of the enclosed antenna is 26  m, M is 3, and focus diameter ratio is 0.3.|$|R

5|$|The {{basis for}} TrollSat was an {{agreement}} signed in 2006 between the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Space Centre and Kongsberg Satellite Services. It specified that the Space Centre would install a Kongsberg-built <b>radome,</b> while the Polar Institute would provide power and undertake maintenance. In exchange, they could freely use the earth station {{for their own}} transmission needs. The commercial activities would {{be carried out by}} Kongsberg Satellite Services. A concern was raised regarding if satellite downloading would violate the Antarctic Treaty, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negated. The station started operations on 1 March 2007 and was officially opened by Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg.|$|E
5|$|In November 1973, as {{a result}} of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 {{equipped}} No. 543 Squadron, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role. The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important GIUK gap between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan's H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In wartime, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to Buccaneers or Canberras, and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping. Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft, the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2). The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the Terrain Following Radar (and its thimble <b>radome)</b> and adding the LORAN C radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a gloss paint finish, with a light grey undersurface, to protect against sea spray.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Soviet Navy and Communist Bloc's fishing fleets began {{operating}} around the British Isles in increasing numbers. The British public began taking {{an interest in}} their operations as civilian fisherman began complaining about their presence. Operation Chacewater began, in which Coastal Command began monitoring their movements, in particular other vessels that loitered in areas covering the arrival and departure routes for Royal Navy nuclear submarine forces. Soon after, counter operations such as Operation Adjutant were carried out, which was aimed at searching for Soviet submarines. The main threat from the Soviets in the Atlantic came from the Soviet Northern Fleet and in early 1965 most of the Command's units were concentrated in No. 18 Group RAF, based in Scotland to monitor their activities. No recorded confrontation took place between Coastal Command and Soviet naval forces during this time, although both the Shackletons from RAF Ballykelly and frigates operating out of Londonderry would 'ping' the Soviet submarines carrying out surveillance off the mouth of Lough Foyle. In at least one instance, a Ballykelly-based Shackleton lost its <b>radome</b> when making a mock attack on the Russian sub.|$|E

5|$|The German Navy {{placed an}} order for 22 Sea King Mk.41s on 20 June 1969 as a {{replacement}} for the Grumman Albatross flying boat in the Search and Rescue Role. This was the first export sale for the Westland Sea King, and was the first dedicated Search and Rescue Sea King variant, with an enlarged cabin and more fuel. The German Sea Kings had similar radar and navigation equipment to the HAS.1, but was not fitted with sonar. The 22 Sea Kings were delivered between April 1973 and September 1974, equipping Marinefliegergeschwader 5 (MFG 5) (Naval Air Wing 5). An additional Sea King was delivered in April 1975 to replace one destroyed in a gale. The surviving Sea Kings were upgraded between 1986 and 1988, adding the capability to carry Sea Skua anti-ship missiles, which required the addition of a Ferranti Seaspray radar in a nose <b>radome.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} {{original}} Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage {{to withstand the}} great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown). The leading edge slats, flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, {{as well as an}} in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX). The rear <b>radome</b> is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high-Alpha (angle of attack) landings.|$|E
5|$|To {{fulfill the}} Air Force {{requirement}} for all-weather attack, Republic proposed the F-105D variant in 1957. This version featured an enlarged nose and <b>radome</b> housing the AN/ASG-19 Thunderstick bombing/navigation system. The AN/ASG-19 was designed around the Autonetics R-14A radar, which operated in both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, and the AN/APN-131 Doppler navigation radar. In the cockpit, the F-105D featured vertical-tape instrument displays for adverse weather operation. The {{ability to carry}} the TX-43 nuclear weapon was also added. The RF-105 reconnaissance development was also restarted, now based on the F-105D. The first D-model took its maiden flight on 9 June 1959. Plans to build over 1,500 F-105Ds were cut short when Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara decided to equip no more than seven combat wings with the type. In November 1961, production was cut {{in favor of the}} Air Force adopting the Navy's F-4 Phantom II, and in the longer term, the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark of the TFX program.|$|E

5|$|The Phantom FG.1 and FGR.2 {{as built}} were similar, being fitted with broadly the same engines and avionics, {{although}} there were minor differences. The FGR.2 was fitted with the Mark 202 version of the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, while the FG.1 had the Mark 203; this was fundamentally the same, but the 203 had a modified control system for the afterburner, allowing it to light faster and enable power to be applied quickly {{in the event of}} a bolter on the small decks of the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers. Both variants were fitted with a licence built version of the Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 avionics package; the FG.1 was fitted with the AN/AWG-11, which differed primarily in having a nose <b>radome</b> that was hinged and able to fold backwards against the aircraft's fuselage to allow for storage in the hangar of an aircraft carrier; the system was designed to be integrated with both the AGM-12 Bullpup missile and WE.177 as required. The AN/AWG-12 fitted to the FGR.2 was not foldable, and featured a better ground mapping mode, to take into account the strike role for which the type was originally procured; allied to this was a Ferranti inertial navigation/attack system (removed when the type converted to the air defence role). It was also configured to be able to control the SUU-23A gun pod, which the Royal Navy's FG.1s lacked.|$|E
