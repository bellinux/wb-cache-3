The organization’s primary source of revenue was satellite usage fees which, after deduction of operating costs, was redistributed to INTELSAT members in proportion to their shares as <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and compensation for use of capital. Satellite services were available to any organization (both INTELSAT members and non-members), and all users paid the same rates.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Goff {{noted that}} {{normally}} {{a failure to}} repay a loan results in a claim in contract, but on {{the facts of this}} case that remedy was not available because of the fraudulent changes to the documentation. Accordingly, he turned to the problem of whether there had been a total failure of consideration. He noted that [...] "although no part of the principal sum had been repaid by the appellants, two instalments of interest had been paid; and the question arises whether these two payments of interest precluded recovery on the basis that in such circumstances the failure of consideration for the advance was not total." [...] He then answered that the view of the Court was that it did not. Payments of interest were different from payments of capital sums. However the court noted that it was possible that the documents were altered prior to one of the payments, in which case the payments would be treated as <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> However Lord Goff was unequivocal: [...] "even if part of the capital sum had been repaid, the law would not hesitate to hold that the balance of the loan outstanding would be recoverable on the ground of failure of consideration; for at least in those cases in which apportionment can be carried out without difficulty, the law will allow partial recovery on this ground (see David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1992) 175 CLR 353, 383)." ...|$|E
40|$|Art. 2511 of the Italian Civil Code defines co-operatives as {{companies}} “with variable capital and mutual purpose”. Therefore main characteristics of co- operative companies are: capital variability {{and most of}} all the pursuit of a mutual purpose. The cooperative company, while pursuing a mutual purpose, carries out in any case a business activity. Lawmakers has intervened at various times on the financial structure of cooperative companies, providing access to increasingly articulated funding sources. A turning point in this regard has been represented by Law n. 59 of 1992, which provided two special classes of shares reserved for cooperatives: investment shares and voting capital shares in the co-operatives. Both categories are addressed to special subjects, even without the requirements identified by the statute for the admission to the company, not interested in the pursuit of the mutual purpose but to the return on capital invested. Investment shares are freely transferable and may have a preferential treatment with regard to the distribution of profits that can {{go so far as to}} the identification of an interest rate increased by two percent compared to that for the cooperative members; voting capital shares in the co-operatives however, are similar to savings shares, as they do not entitle to vote and have special capital franchisees as regards the distribution of profits and <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> Para- graph 1 of Article 2526 of the ICC allows the statute of co-operative companies “to provide for the issue of financial instruments in accordance with the regu- lation on limited shareholder companies”. Therefore the question arises: what kind of financial instruments are governed under this law and if the reference is to the participatory financial instruments introduced by Legislative Decree no. 6 / 2003 on public limited companies...|$|E

Once the money reaches the front of the queue, it is split into micro-loans (typically of £10-20 each) that go to multiple borrowers.

5000|$|A {{current account}} deficit {{is not always}} a problem. The Pitchford thesis states that a current account deficit does not matter if it is driven by the private sector. It is also known as the [...] "consenting adults" [...] view of the current account, as it holds that deficits are not a problem if they result from private sector agents {{engaging}} in mutually beneficial trade. A current account deficit creates an obligation <b>of</b> <b>repayments</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>capital,</b> and that <b>capital</b> consists <b>of</b> many individual transactions. Pitchford asserts that since each of these transactions were individually considered financially sound when they were made, their aggregate effect (the current account deficit) is also sound.|$|R

60|$|In {{the case}} of the farmer and the labourer, their {{interests}} are always the same, and it is absolutely impossible that their free contracts can be onerous to either party. It is the interest of the farmer, that his work should be done with effect and celerity: and that cannot be, unless the labourer is well fed, and otherwise found with such necessaries of animal life, according to his habitudes, as may keep the body in full force, and the mind gay and cheerful. For of all the instruments of his trade, the labour of man (what the ancient writers have called the instrumentum vocale) is that on which he is most to rely for the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> his <b>capital.</b> The other two, the semivocale in the ancient classification, that is, the working stock of cattle, and the instrumentum mutum, such as carts, ploughs, spades, and so forth, though not all inconsiderable in themselves, are very much inferior in utility or in expense; or, without a given portion of the first, are nothing at all. For, in all things whatever, the mind is the most valuable and the most important; and in this scale the whole of agriculture is in a natural and just order; the beast is as an informing principle to the plough and cart; the labourer is as reason to the beast; and the farmer is as a thinking and presiding principle to the labourer. An attempt to break this chain of subordination in any part is equally absurd; but the absurdity is the most mischievous in practical operation, where it is the most easy, that is, where it is the most subject to an erroneous judgment.|$|R
