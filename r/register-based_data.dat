Research topics: The paper focuses on health economic analyses based on register data. For the sake of simplicity, the studies are divided into three main categories: economic evaluations of healthcare interventions, cost-of-illness analyses, and other analyses such as assessments of healthcare productivity. Conclusion: We examined a number of studies using <b>register-based</b> <b>data</b> on healthcare costs. Use of <b>register-based</b> <b>data</b> renders...|$|E

We rely on a difference-in-differences strategy while exploiting Danish <b>register-based</b> panel <b>data</b> for children born in 1990 - 1999. We study effects of treatment initiated between ages five and ten and document that treated children benefit in terms of fewer hospital contacts in general, fewer emergency ward contacts, and fewer injuries. Estimated effects are large: early treatment is effective in reducing the probability of at least one hospital contact in a given year with around 30 % compared to the mean. Effects are significantly smaller in later cohorts where more children are diagnosed and treated...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the large}} {{literature}} on {{the long-term effects of}} parental divorce, few studies have analyzed the effects of parental divorce on spouse selection behavior. We use <b>register-based</b> event-history <b>data</b> from Finland to study the effects of parental divorce on spouse selection according to education with conditional multinomial logistic regression (CMLR) models. The results show that Finnish children of divorce postpone their marriages. They have a lower likelihood of marrying spouses with higher secondary education or more, but given this constraint, they have a higher likelihood of marrying people with higher levels of education than themselves. The results suggest that children of divorce are less preferred spouse candidates, but nonetheless prefer marrying better educated spouses than themselves...|$|R
40|$|This article compares and {{contrasts}} male immigrant {{labor market}} experiences in Sweden and Denmark {{during the period}} 1985 - 1995. Using <b>register-based</b> panel <b>data</b> sets from Sweden and Denmark, {{a picture of the}} employment assimilation process of immigrants from Norway, Poland, and Turkey is presented. The comparative approach shows that immigrants in Sweden and Denmark experienced similar declines in employment prospects between 1985 and 1995 despite quite different developments of aggregate labor market conditions. A possible explanation is that the changing organizational structure - toward more flexible work organization - has resulted in a decrease in the attractiveness of immigrant employees due to the increasing importance of country-specific skills and informal human capital...|$|R

The paper uses a <b>register-based</b> <b>data</b> source covering white-collar manufacturing workers {{over the period}} 1995 - 2004. Taken together, {{the results show that}} wages and job classification are higher for polytechnic graduates, once other covariates are controlled for. Despite this, almost 20 % of graduates from polytechnics have been forced to take a position in manufacturing in which they can be considered to be ‘overeducated’.

40|$|We study {{workplace}} {{peer effects}} in fertility decisions using a game theory model of strategic interactions among coworkers {{that allows for}} multiple equilibria. Using <b>register-based</b> <b>data</b> on fertile-aged women working in medium sized establishments in Denmark, we uncover negative average peer effects. Allowing for heterogeneous effects by worker type, we find that positive effects dominate across worker types defined by age or education. Negative effects dominate within age groups and among low-education types. Policy simulations show that these estimated effects make the distribution of where women work an important consideration, beyond simply if they work, in predicting population fertility. ...|$|E

Analyses are carried out using <b>register-based</b> Danish <b>data.</b> We find that higher age at school start lowers the propensity to commit crime, but that this reduction is caused by incapacitation while human capital accumulation is unaffected. Importantly, we also find that the individuals who benefit most from being old-for-grade are those with high latent abilities whereas those with low latent ability seem to be unaffected by being old-for-grade in school...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{dynamics}} of employment assimilation of first-generation immigrant men in Sweden using a high-quality, <b>register-based</b> panel <b>data</b> set. It is discussed that when there are significant differences between employment status persistence of immigrants and natives, the standard static assimilation model produces biased predictions for the relative labour market outcomes for immigrants. We find significant persistence of employment status which differs between immigrants and natives, and also across immigrant groups. The static assimilation model overestimates (underestimates) the short-run (long-run) marginal assimilation rates. We find 10 - 15 percentage points lower initial employment probability disadvantage but the years to assimilation are 5 - 10 years longer compared to the standard static assimilation model. dynamic random-effects probit model, employment assimilation, initial values problem...|$|R

40|$|Displacement is {{expected}} to decrease the reservation wage of self-employment by decreasing earnings in paid employment and increasing the probability of unemployment. This paper examines whether displacement increases the probability of self-employment using propensity score matching on Swedish <b>register-based</b> <b>data.</b> The data include all individuals displaced due to plant closures in 1987 and 1988, and {{a random sample of}} 200, 000 employed individuals. The results suggest that displacement almost doubles the probability of entering self-employment the year after displacement. A sub-sample analysis indicates that individuals with a potentially worse position on the labor market react more strongly to displacement in terms of entering self-employment.

40|$|Abstract: Evidence on {{the impacts}} of {{dividend}} taxation on dividend distributions and investment is still unsettled and based mainly on the behaviour of large companies that are listed on the stock exchange. This paper utilises a large, <b>register-based,</b> panel <b>data</b> set, where {{the large majority of}} firms are small and medium sized enterprises, to examine the responses to the Finnish dividend tax increase of 2005. This reform creates a useful opportunity to measure enterprise behaviour, since it involves exogenous variation in the tax treatment of different types of firms. The results, based on differences-in-differences estimation and matching methods, indicate that dividends dropped somewhat in closely held corporations that faced a tax increase, perhaps for timing reasons, while investments did not decline. These findings are probably more in line with the new rather than the old view of dividend taxation...|$|R
40|$|Using <b>register-based</b> panel <b>data</b> {{covering}} all Finnish firms from 1999 to 2004, we examine how corporations anticipated the 2005 dividend tax increase via {{changes in their}} dividend and investment policies. The Finnish capital and corporate income tax reform of 2005 creates a useful opportunity to measure this behaviour, since it involves exogenous variation in the tax treatment {{of different types of}} firms. The estimation results reveal that those firms that anticipated a dividend tax hike increased their dividend payouts in a statistically significant way. This increase was not accompanied by a reduction in investment activities, but rather was associated with increased indebtedness in non-listed firms. The results also suggest that the timing of dividend distributions probably offsets much of the potential for increased dividend tax revenue following the reform.

40|$|This paper uses Danish <b>register-based</b> <b>data</b> for the {{population}} of children born in 1990 - 1997 to investigate the effects on parents of having a child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD). Ten years after birth, parents of children diagnosed with ADHD have a 75 % higher probability of having dissolved their relationship and a 7 - 13 % lower labor supply. Exploiting detailed information about documented risk factors behind ADHD, we find that roughly half of this gap is due to selection. However, a statistically and economically significant gap is left, which is likely related {{to the impact of}} high psychic costs of coping with a child with ADHD.

The comparatively high divorce risks for spouses with little formal education and for spouses in manual worker occupations were found to be specific to marriages of relatively short duration. In contrast, such factors as unemployment, wife's high income, and living in a rented dwelling were found to increase divorce risk at all marital durations. divorce, Finland, life course, marital disruption, registers, socio-economic...|$|E
40|$|In many countries, {{composite}} deprivation indices {{have been}} developed to describe the socioeconomic composition of inhabitants in defined area units, such as municipalities or census districts.

40|$|We analyze serial {{entrepreneurship}} using {{a unique}} cross-sectional survey of employees {{that is for}} this study linked with longitudinal, <b>register-based</b> employer-employee <b>data.</b> Serial entrepreneurship accounts for nearly 30 % of the transitions from paid employment into entrepreneurship. What make an entrepreneur serial are her aspirations and her ability {{to go ahead and}} live by them. Specifically, we document that having worked in the past as an entrepreneur increases both the probability that a person presently in paid employment aspires to again become an entrepreneur and, holding the aspirations constant, the probability of her again becoming an entrepreneur. We also find that an employee with entrepreneurial aspirations is more likely to become an entrepreneur subsequently, than an employee without such aspirations. Finally, holding aspirations constant, working in the public sector and being a union member are negatively correlated with the likelihood of transiting into entrepreneurship.

40|$|The {{decision}} to divorce {{may be affected}} by the characteristics of the local community. Community characteristics may be barriers to divorce, or they may increase the attractiveness of divorcing (e. g., access to a good remarriage market), but our knowledge of such influences is sparse. This study examines two such community-level factors: socio-economic conditions and the local marriage market. In this study, discrete-time hazard models with community-level fixed effects are estimated using <b>register-based</b> <b>data</b> on Norwegian first marriages during the period from 1980 to 1999, with longitudinal information on both the community and couple levels (N =  283, 493).

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that the local environment is important for self-employment. The dynamics of self-employment varies between areas characterized by different labour market conditions, entrepreneurial traditions and other structural factors. This article analyses self-employment spells in Finland with a large <b>register-based</b> <b>data</b> set from the period 1987 to 2002. The main aim is to investigate the role of region-specific factors as compared with individual-specific and other factors on the duration of self-employment spells. First, the descriptive analysis shows that the exit rates from self-employment and the length of self-employment spells depend upon location (urban versus rural area) and the cyclical trends in the economy. Second, self-employment duration is modelled using discrete time survival analysis. It is found that rural areas have significantly lower exit rates {{in the first years of}} self-employment than urban areas. ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Prior {{evidence}} on the relationship betweenhostility andminor health problems is limited to cross-sectional self-report studies. In the present study, this relationship was examined prospec-tively. Methods. Hostility of 1077 municipal employees was measured by a questionnaire survey and minor health problems by using 4 -year <b>register-based</b> absence <b>data</b> including medically certificated diagnoses. Results. High hostility predicted a high total number of long-term sickness absence spells among men, but not among women. In separate diagnostic categories (musculo-skeletal, traumas and injuries, respiratory), hostility related positively and linearly to absences due to traumatic causes and curvi-linearly (U-shape) to absences due to musculo-skeletal causes. Controlling the effects of health risk behaviour and demographic background did not significantly change these figures. However, health risk behaviour moderated the relations of hostility to overall long-term sickness absences, and to traumatic andmusculo-skeletal absences, being significantly stronger in high-risk groups. Noassocia-tion was found between hostility and non-certificated short-term absence spells. Conclusions. The results suggest that hostility {{plays a role in}} the aetiology of minor health problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to produce a cohesive study on how income is related to different events that constitute fertility, such as entry into parenthood, continued childbearing, {{and the risk of}} remaining childless. Relying on <b>register-based</b> longitudinal <b>data</b> on men and women living in Sweden between 1968 and 2009, this study aims to contribute to the literature by providing insight into whether or not income facilitates fertility and how it changes across parity transitions, gender, and educational attainment. The studies contained in this dissertation provide evidence suggesting that income has become a more important factor in the transition to parenthood, household income is positively related to continued childbearing, particularly when the transition to the second parity is considered, the relative income of women within the household has no negative impact on continued childbearing, and finally, a high income in youth decreases the probability of childlessness at later ages for either men or women...|$|R

This birth cohort study included 2, 867 Finnish girls at baseline in 1989. <b>Register-based</b> follow-up <b>data</b> on births was collected until the end of 2001. Information, both on the main exposure and outcome, was available for 2, 507 girls.
