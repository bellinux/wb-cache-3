25|$|The use of {{de-icing}} salts on roadways, used {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, {{is probably one of}} the primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or prestressed concrete bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars and the application of cathodic protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) <b>rebars</b> are known to be less susceptible to chlorides.

Where brick {{was used as a}} shuttering, the bricks essentially formed a mould into which concrete was poured, the bricks being left in place. Otherwise, the pillbox was formed using shuttering of wood (usually planks, but sometimes plywood) and/or corrugated iron. Wood shuttering was removed, whereas corrugated iron was sometimes left in place. Construction often took advantage of whatever materials were available locally (for example, at the coast, beach sand and pebbles would be used) and this expedient use of local materials had the added advantage of aiding camouflage. The reinforced concrete used in construction was generally conventional making use of thin steel <b>rebars</b> with floor, walls and roof all mutually bonded. However, several instances are known where scrap metal had been used such as parts of an old bed or park railings.|$|E

Generally, 1–2wt.% of [...] with respect to cement weight is needed to prevent {{corrosion}} of the <b>rebars.</b> The nitrite anion is a mild oxidizer that oxidizes the soluble and mobile ferrous ions (Fe2+) present at the surface of the corroding steel and causes them to precipitate as an insoluble ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). This causes the passivation of steel at the anodic oxidation sites. Nitrite is a much more active corrosion inhibitor than nitrate, which is a less powerful oxidizer of the divalent iron.|$|E

40|$|Past {{experimental}} {{work on a}} highway bridge in central Iowa [1] suggested that ground penetrating radar (GPR) signals could possibly be used to differentiate intact <b>rebar</b> from those having substantial metal loss due to corrosion. That study made use of the amplitudes of GPR signals reflected by <b>rebar,</b> as obtained using a commercial instrument operated in pulse/echo mode. Many factors {{can contribute to the}} strength of the echo seen from a given <b>rebar,</b> including the <b>rebar’s</b> length, its distance from and tilt angle relative to the antenna, and the location and size of the metal-loss region. In this paper we systematically investigate these geometric effects. We begin with measurements of reflected signals where only an air layer separates the antenna from the <b>rebar.</b> There, using standard ½-inch diameter <b>rebar,</b> the GPR signal is systematically studied {{as a function of the}} length of the <b>rebar,</b> the stand-off distance from the antenna, the <b>rebar</b> tilt angle, and the size of the metal-loss region. The metal loss region is conveniently simulated by taking two parallel and abutting <b>rebar</b> lengths and pulling them apart to introduce a small gap between them. After summarizing the measurements in air, we discuss efforts to extend the study to <b>rebar</b> embedded in concrete. One idea being explored is the use of a powdered “phantom” material (having GPR properties similar to concrete) which can be sandwiched between two concrete blocks. The <b>rebar</b> can then be inserted into the powder layer and its position and orientation can be altered at will. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our studies to the practical detection of corroded <b>rebar</b> in bridge barrier rails...|$|R

Pullout tests were adopted to evaluate the bonding and debonding behaviors of the embedded <b>rebar</b> experiencing different corrosion levels. Both high- and low-strength concrete were considered. Bond-slip curves were recorded to determine the influences of <b>rebar</b> corrosion levels and RCA replacements on the bond strength and debonding energy of the specimens. Test results indicate that increasing <b>rebar</b> corrosion level gradually weakens the antisliding ability of reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) except for a small level corrosion and the degradation rate of ultimate bond strength increases with a decrease of compressive strength at 0. 5 % <b>rebar</b> corrosion. The results also demonstrate that the ultimate bond strength of reinforced RAC slightly decreases with an increase of RCA replacement. However, the relative bond strength between uncorroded <b>rebar</b> and RAC is little affected by RCA content, while it decreases with an increase of RCA replacement in high-strength specimens after <b>rebar</b> corrosion.
