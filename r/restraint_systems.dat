25|$|The list {{of items}} tested has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, including in 1968 – a tyre check; 1977 – checks of windscreen wipers and washers, direction indicators, brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 – checks of the emissions test for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 – introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates. Also rolled out in 2005 {{was the creation of}} the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 – checks of secondary <b>restraint</b> <b>systems,</b> battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.|$|E
500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} is {{the most}} common cause of death among vehicle occupants involved in accidents, and it is thought to contribute significantly in about a quarter of deaths resulting from vehicle collisions. [...] As vehicle use has increased, so has the number of auto accidents, and with it the number of chest injuries. However an increase in the number of airbags installed in modern cars may be decreasing the incidence of pulmonary contusion. [...] Use of child <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> has brought the approximate incidence of pulmonary contusion in children in vehicle accidents from 22% to 10%.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} steel road <b>restraint</b> <b>system,</b> which is currently in use on European public roads. Observations of installed systems indicate that the current road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> design is far too stiff, which results in unacceptable decelerations during the vehicle impact. The global stiffness of the <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> in the initial phase of an impact is largely attributed to the distance spacer design. The purpose {{of this research is}} to improve the currently road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> design by means of computational simulations. The impact severity and stiffness of current and new design have been evaluated with dynamic nonlinear elasto-plastic analysis of a three-dimensional road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> {{within the framework of the}} finite element method with LS-DYNA code. Computational simulations were verified with full scale crash tests. Computational analyses prove that the currently used road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> is impropriate and that the new road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> design assures controllable elasto-plastic deformation and crash energy absorption which in turn decreases the decelerations of an impact vehicle and consequently increases the safety of vehicle passengers...|$|R

40|$|When small {{children}} travel in minibuses, during for example daycare transports, they seldom have adequate protection {{in terms of}} crash safety. To be sufficiently protected the child should travel in a rearward facing child <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> (CRS). The possibility to use such a seat is unfortunately accompanied by several problems. The main issues are {{that it can be}} hard and time consuming to secure a conventional child <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> and that the available space in a minibus is limited. The task is therefore to develop a new system that makes it possible to easily secure the child <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> in the bus, without compromising the space and mobility of the other passengers. This is done by using the newly developed anchorage system, Isofix, in combination with a small stand that replaces the bus seat. Testing and evaluation of the developed system shows that it is achievable with a simple design to rapid and effortlessly secure a rearward facing child <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> in a minibus, and thus giving {{small children}} the highest possible level of safety...|$|R
