Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and <b>rural</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ardhi University (ARU) was {{established}} on 1st July 1996 after transforming the former University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS) {{which was then}} a Constituent College of the University of Dar es Salaam. Historically, Ardhi University, dates back to 1956 when it started as Surveying Training School offering land surveying technician certificate courses at the present location of Mgulani Salvation Army Camp in Dar es Salaam. In 1958, the School {{was moved to the}} present location (i.e. the Observation Hill). In 1972, the School was transformed to Ardhi Institute. Then the Institute offered two-year diploma programmes in the fields of Land Surveying and Land Management and Valuation. In the same year, a three-year Diploma program in Urban and <b>Rural</b> <b>Planning</b> was introduced. Later in 1975, all the three-year diploma programes were upgraded to Advanced Diplomas. The Building Design and Building Economics courses started in 1976 and 1978 respectively. As pointed out earlier, in 1996 Ardhi Institute was affiliated to the University of Dar es Salaam as a Constituent College of the University; subsequently its name changed to the University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS). Within ten (10) years, UCLAS increased the number of academic programmes from six (6) to thirty nine (39). The programmes ranging from diplomas to PhDs were offered by two faculties, that is, the Faculty of Architecture and Planning (FAP) and the Faculty of Lands and Environmental Engineering (FLEE). As a result of these changes, student enrollment increased from only 400 in 1996 to about 1,400 in 2007. At the same time, the number of academic staff with PhD increased from 3 in 1996 to over 60 in 2012. At present there are over 80 PhD holders who have graduated from over 25 universities worldwide. In 2007 Ardhi University came into being following the signing of the Ardhi University Charter by His Excellency the President of United Republic of Tanzania. Concurrently, the structure and number of programmes and academic units has increased significantly. At present, the University comprises four Schools, one Institute and several centres. Schools includes; The School of Architecture,Construction Economics and Management(SACEM), The School of Earth Sciences, Real Estates, Business and Informatics(SERBI), The School of Environmental Science and Technology(SEST), and The School of Spatial Planning and Social Science(SSPSS), alongside Institute of Human Settlements Studies (IHSS). The university offers Undergraduate and Postgraduate studies with Postgraduate, Bachelors, Masters and PhD degrees in various disciplines.|$|E
