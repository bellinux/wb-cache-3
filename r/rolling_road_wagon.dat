50|$|Since 2002, {{regional}} train services have ended at Bardonecchia; previously they continued on to Modane. This {{is to allow}} the enlargement of the tunnel to allow the passage of container trains. Now only TGV trains reach Modane from Italy. Instead of {{regional train}}s, there is a replacement bus service to carry passengers to Modane, although this is a limited service. Freight traffic is still well supported. In particular, special freight trains constitute the Alpine <b>rolling</b> <b>road.</b> Low flat <b>wagons</b> carry trucks through the Alps. These trains are fitted with a passenger carriage for the transport of truck drivers. Four pairs of daily trips each day connect Turin Orbassano goods yard and the French terminal at Aiton {{at the bottom of}} the Maurienne Valley.|$|R

50|$|Wind Shear's tunnel is {{a closed}} air circuit, {{temperature-controlled}} system {{built around a}} <b>rolling</b> <b>road.</b> The <b>rolling</b> <b>road,</b> akin to a giant treadmill, is 3 meters wide by 9 meters long (10' x 29') and accommodates full-size cars. Air and <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> speeds are coordinated up to 180 MPH (290 km/h). Air temperature, critical to repeatable data collection, is maintained at a constant , plus or minus one degree. Air is moved through the massive 15,000 square foot (1500 square meter) air circuit at the maximum rate of 2.85 million cubic feet (80,700 cubic meters) per minute by a 5100 HP (3750 KW) motor and 29 carbon fiber blades 22 feet (6.7 m) in diameter.|$|R

50|$|The land {{passed into}} American hands in 1848 and in early 1858 the Mohave Trail became the Mojave <b>Road,</b> a <b>wagon</b> <b>road</b> {{connected}} to the newly pioneered Beale's <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> across northern New Mexico Territory from Fort Defiance to Beale's Crossing on the Colorado River where it linked up with the Mojave <b>Road.</b> <b>Wagon</b> trains of settlers coming west on the Santa Fe Trail, soon followed Beale's <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> and the Mojave Road into Southern California. Beale's road was shorter than the route via the more southern Southern Emigrant Trail and it was cooler in summer and snow free in winter, had better forage and was better watered. Soon hostiities began between the Mohave's and the settlers, triggering the Mohave War.|$|R

50|$|The R3 and R4 were {{targeted}} at the Citroen 2CV that employed soft springs and long wheel travel to absorb bumps on poorly maintained roads. The Renault 3 & 4 applied {{the same approach}} and two models appeared at the Paris Motor Show in 1961 on a specialized demonstration display that incorporated an irregular <b>rolling</b> <b>road.</b> Visitors could sit inside a car, which remained undisturbed while the suspension absorbed the erratic bumps of the <b>rolling</b> <b>road.</b> In 1962 Renault employed the same display at the Turin Motor Show.|$|R
50|$|Automotive {{aerodynamics}} is studied {{using both}} computer modelling and wind tunnel testing. For {{the most accurate}} results from a wind tunnel test, the tunnel is sometimes equipped with a <b>rolling</b> <b>road.</b> This is a movable floor for the working section, which moves {{at the same speed}} as the air flow. This prevents a boundary layer from forming {{on the floor of the}} working section and affecting the results. An example of such a <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> wind tunnel is Wind Shear's Full Scale, Rolling Road, Automotive Wind Tunnel in Concord, North Carolina and Auto Research Center in Indianapolis, Indiana USA.|$|R
50|$|Wright {{then set}} about experimenting with F1 car body shapes using a wind tunnel and a <b>rolling</b> <b>road,</b> when by happy {{accident}} {{he began to}} get remarkable results {{in one of the}} models. Closer inspection found that as the <b>rolling</b> <b>road's</b> speed increased, the shaped underbody was being drawn closer {{to the surface of the}} road. Wright experimented with pieces of cardboard attached to the side of the model car body, and the level of perceived downforce produced was phenomenal. The results were presented to Colin Chapman, who gave the team free rein to come up with an F1 chassis design.|$|R

50|$|The Santiam <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> was {{a freight}} route in the U.S. state of Oregon between the Willamette Valley and Central Oregon regions from 1865 to the 1930s. It is {{considered}} one of the most important historical routes in the state. Officially known as the Willamette Valley and Cascade Mountain <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road,</b> the Santiam <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> was built between 1861 and 1868 and operated as a toll road until 1915. In 1925, the road was turned over to the State of Oregon for use as a highway. U.S. Route 20 closely follows the original route of the <b>wagon</b> <b>road.</b>|$|R

The blockage effect is the condition where air flow in the wind tunnel is partially blocked by the vehicle. The blockage becomes more critical as the {{cross section of the}} test vehicle increases relative to the size of nozzle and airstream. As the vehicle increases in size relative to the nozzle, test data become less reliable as increased blockage affects the quality of the actual windstream.http://www.scs-europe.net/services/ess2002/PDF/manuf-3.pdf Windshear's solution was to build a sufficiently large air circuit. Nozzle size is a relatively large 180 square feet (16.7 square meters).|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} section between Hamilton and Guelph, {{known as}} the Brock Road, was constructed between 1848 and 1850 over the Guelph and Dundas <b>wagon</b> <b>road.</b> The <b>wagon</b> <b>road,</b> merely a trail through the forest, was cleared by the Canada Company in the 1820s to connect the fledgling town of Guelph with the established harbour at Hamilton, thus encouraging settlers to venture inland.|$|R

5000|$|The Dalles Military Road, {{also known}} as The Dalles [...] - [...] Boise Military <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road,</b> was a mid-19th century <b>wagon</b> <b>road</b> {{surveyed}} and barely built by The Dalles Military Road Company between 1868 and 1870. To qualify for government land grants, the company was supposed to build a <b>wagon</b> <b>road</b> from The Dalles, Oregon to Fort Boise in Idaho. However, the company's road, on which it spent about $6,000 and for which it received nearly 2300 km2 of public land, consisted largely of existing <b>wagon</b> <b>roads</b> and rudimentary trails. In particular, the company took credit for building a well-traveled and pre-existing <b>wagon</b> <b>road</b> between The Dalles and Canyon City, Oregon.|$|R

50|$|In 1846, General Stephen Watts Kearny and his dragoons {{with their}} scout Kit Carson found the route. One year later, Colonel Philip St. George Cooke and the Mormon Battalion {{followed}} Kearnyâ€™s route establishing the first <b>wagon</b> <b>road.</b> This <b>wagon</b> <b>road</b> {{became known as}} Cooke's <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road,</b> or Sonora Road, until the discovery of gold brought a flood of Americans westward in 1849. The discovery of the Tucson Cutoff later that year shortened the route bringing it fully within {{the territory of the}} United States. From this date on, the route was called the Southern Emigrant Trail.|$|R
50|$|Lt. Edward Fitzgerald Beale, a U.S. Navy {{officer in}} the service of the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, was ordered by the U.S. War Department to build a federal <b>wagon</b> <b>road</b> across the 35th Parallel. His {{secondary}} orders were to test the feasibility of the use of camels as pack animals in the southwestern desert. Beale traveled through the present day Kingman in 1857 surveying the road and in 1859 to build the <b>road.</b> Beale's <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> became part of Highway 66 and Interstate Highway 40.

50|$|In 1857 {{following}} the Gadsden Purchase, {{as part of}} the Pacific <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road,</b> a military road being built between El Paso and Fort Yuma, a <b>wagon</b> <b>road</b> was built from Mesilla westward to Cooke's Spring, saving the longer route via the San Diego Crossing. The Pacific <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> then followed Cooke's <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> and the Tucson Cutoff as far as {{the west side of the}} Apache Pass. There it made another shortcut across Sulphur Springs Valley to Dragoon Pass, and then down Dragoon Wash to the San Pedro River. The route then descended northward on the right bank of the river to the Middle Crossing of the San Pedro River. From this crossing the Pacific <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> ran due west to link up again with Cooke's <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> at Mescal Springs to continue on to Tucson, Arizona, then turned northward to the Pima Villages and Maricopa Wells where it turned westward along the Gila River following it to the ferries on the Colorado River across from Fort Yuma. The Pacific <b>Wagon</b> <b>Road</b> shortened the route still further for travelers.|$|R
