5|$|In 1881 {{the wards}} were <b>redrawn,</b> {{so that the}} borough {{comprised}} sixteen wards. The size of the town council remained the same, however, with each new ward returning one alderman and three councillors.|$|E
5|$|Kilroy ran in {{the newly}} <b>redrawn,</b> Columbus-based Ohio's 3rd congressional {{district}} in 2012. Despite being endorsed by former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she lost the Democratic primary to former State Representative Joyce Beatty, who defeated Kilroy, Tyson, and Celeste 38%-35%-15%-12%. Kilroy lost a 2014 election for Franklin County Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Like all wards in Reading, the {{boundaries}} of Southcote ward were <b>redrawn</b> in 2004. The ward holds elections by thirds—three seats are available, and in three years in every four, one seat comes up for election.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{continued}} {{to support the}} RAN and provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific up to {{the early years of}} World War II. In 1958, the boundaries of Australia Station was <b>redrawn</b> again, now to include Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|The WonderSwan Color remake was {{released}} in Japan on December 9, 2000, and featured many new graphical changes. The 8-bit graphics of the original Famicom game were updated, battle scenes incorporated full background images, and character and enemy sprites were <b>redrawn</b> to look more like the ones from the Super Famicom Final Fantasy games.|$|E
5|$|After a 1994 {{plan was}} {{approved}} and a bond issue passed, additional elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans <b>redrawn,</b> {{which resulted in}} the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to Topeka Unified School District No. 501 on July 27, 1999. One of the new magnet schools is named after the Scott family attorneys for their role in the Brown case and civil rights.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Belarus {{was among}} the 51 {{founding}} countries of the United Nations Charter and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN, {{on top of the}} Soviet Union's vote. Vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed {{the end of the war}} and the Byelorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in western USSR, creating jobs and attracting ethnic Russians. The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Poland were <b>redrawn</b> and became known as the Curzon Line.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{less time}} on new Adventures of Tintin, from June to December 1965 Tintin {{magazine}} serialised a <b>redrawn</b> and newly coloured version of The Black Island prepared by staff at Studios Hergé. Supported by his studio, Hergé produced The Calculus Affair between 1954 until 1956 which {{was followed by}} The Red Sea Sharks in 1956 to 1957.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} an enhanced port for the Super Famicom by Japanese developer Opera House, combining {{the game with}} its predecessor. For this version, the graphics were reworked, the gameplay adjusted, and the demon artwork <b>redrawn</b> by Kaneko, who by then was established as the illustrator for the series. The music was arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto. Titled Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei, the port was released on March 31, 1995.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} an enhanced port for the Super Famicom by Japanese developer Opera House, combining {{the game with}} its sequel. For this version, the graphics was reworked, the gameplay adjusted, and the demon artwork <b>redrawn</b> by then-established series illustrator Kazuma Kaneko. The music was arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto. Titled Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei, the port was released on March 31, 1995. This version was re-released on the Virtual Console for Wii on July 3, 2012.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} {{versions of the}} game developed for the NES. The first port was handled and published by Jaleco only in Japan. Released on June 23, 1988, it featured characters <b>redrawn</b> in a cute art style and generally shrunken rooms. No scrolling is present, leading to rooms larger than a single screen to be displayed via flip-screens. Many of the background details are missing, and instead of a save feature an over 100 character long password is required to save progress.|$|E
5|$|His health declining, Baltimore's {{persistence}} {{over the}} charter finally {{paid off in}} 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting <b>redrawn</b> boundaries {{to the north of}} the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 Capuano navigated {{a crowded}} Democratic primary to replace Joseph Kennedy II in Congress {{and has since}} been re-elected nine times. He {{represented}} the state's 8th district until it was <b>redrawn</b> in 2013 into the 7th district. In Congress he is a staunch liberal {{and member of the}} Congressional Progressive Caucus. He ran in the 2010 special election to fill the seat in the United States Senate made vacant by the death of Ted Kennedy, his predecessor's uncle, but lost the primary to Martha Coakley, who in turn lost the general election to Republican Scott Brown.|$|E
5|$|Mary Jo Kilroy (born April 30, 1949) is {{the former}} U.S. Representative for , serving from 2009 until 2011. She {{is a member of}} the Democratic Party from Ohio. In her first term she {{introduced}} a bill to lend $20 million per year to small businesses (HR5322) and an amendment to assign liability to credit reporting agencies. She also contributed to legislation on executive pay. She was defeated in her November 2, 2010 re-election bid. In 2012 she ran in the newly <b>redrawn,</b> Columbus-based 3rd congressional district but lost in the primary.|$|E
5|$|Most coincidentally, a small {{theropod}} dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops {{had been}} discovered while Heilmann was working on his book, and was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. Figure 8 of Osborn's paper, <b>redrawn</b> from the fossil, shows what was later proven to be an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified at the time. If Heilmann had examined this paper as closely as he had much of his source material – or had traveled to New York to see the specimens in person – he may have reversed his conclusions entirely.|$|E
5|$|State law {{requires}} that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed {{the population of the}} smallest by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are <b>redrawn,</b> as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk. Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central Wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered, especially the northeastern portion of the West Ward.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{redevelopment}} involved the demolition of the North Stand, the concreting of all terraces and the building a block of turnstiles around the upper section of the East Terrace. This work, begun in October 1981 and completed in 1986, reduced the capacity to 74,370 and cost £3 million. A second phase had been planned to begin in 1988, but the release of the Taylor Report caused the plans to be <b>redrawn</b> and the proposed costs escalated to £25 million. Scotland hosted the 1989 FIFA Under-16 World Cup, with the Scots contesting the final against Saudi Arabia at Hampden.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest public}} {{transport}} operator in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley is Prasarana Malaysia via its subsidiaries of Rapid Rail and Rapid Bus using Rapid KL brands service. Since the take over from Intrakota Komposit Sdn Bhd, Prasarana Malaysia has <b>redrawn</b> the entire bus network of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley metropolitan area to increase passenger numbers and improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system. The Prasarana Malaysia has adopted the hub and spoke system to provide greater connectivity, {{and cut down}} the need of more buses.|$|E
5|$|The {{works were}} first adapted for the American English market by Golden Books, {{a branch of}} the Western Publishing Company in the 1950s. The albums were {{translated}} from French into American English with some artwork panels blanked except for the speech balloons. This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and free mixing of races. The albums were not popular and only six were published in mixed order. The edited albums later had their blanked areas <b>redrawn</b> by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world.|$|E
5|$|When it {{came time}} to {{translate}} The Black Island, which is set in Great Britain, the opportunity was taken to make the scenes more true-to-life; such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring scenes of the British countryside were more accurate for discerning British readers. Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough, and had compiled a list of 131 errors of detail, which should be put right, asking Studios Hergé to rework it completely. The resulting album is the dramatically updated and <b>redrawn</b> 1966 version that is the most commonly available today. , Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Before 1832, Sleaford {{was in the}} Lincolnshire {{parliamentary}} constituency, which encompassed all of {{the county}} except for four boroughs. In the 1818 election, 49 of the 2,000 people living in New and Old Sleaford and Quarrington qualified to vote. In 1832, the Reform Act widened the franchise and divided Lincolnshire. Sleaford was in the South Lincolnshire constituency that elected two members to parliament. Following the 1867 reforms, the South Lincolnshire constituency's borders were <b>redrawn,</b> but Sleaford remained within it. The franchise was widened by the reforms so that roughly 15% (202) of males in Sleaford and Quarrington could vote in 1868. The constituency was abolished in 1885 and the Sleaford constituency was formed. It merged with the Grantham seat in 1918. In 1997, Sleaford was reorganised into Sleaford and North Hykeham.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be <b>redrawn,</b> but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat changes, the Solo Remix includes <b>redrawn</b> high-definition sprites and is optimized for the Retina display of iOS devices. The original soundtrack and additional remixes {{of these songs}} are included. Wireless and social media features are also included: the Tin Pin Slammer can be played with other players via wireless connections, and the game can connect with the player's social media applications to display these as scanned thoughts from non-player characters within the game. The Solo Remix version features a remixed soundtrack from the original DS release. New assets {{at the conclusion of}} the iOS game hint at a possible sequel, but no confirmation has been made by Square Enix. The iOS version of the game was pulled from the iOS App Store in February 2015 due to an issue that prevented the game from working with the iOS 8 operating system launched in September 2014, though the Android version remains available. It returned to the App Store in June 2015.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1821, the House of Keys had no {{official}} home, but met first at Castle Rushen, and {{later at the}} Bishop of Sodor and Man's library in Castletown. After criticism from a Royal Commission, plans were drawn up for a new meeting house for the Keys in 1813, but after concerns about the cost, they were <b>redrawn</b> and approved in 1819. The building, designed by Thomas Brine, was completed in 1821. It housed the House of Keys until 1874, when the Keys followed the other primary functions of the island and moved to Douglas. After their move, the Old House became a branch of 's Bank, and later Parr's Bank. In 2000, Manx National Heritage acquired the building and began restoring the house to how it appeared in 1866. The building {{opened to the public}} as a museum in November 2001.|$|E
5|$|After Hergé had <b>redrawn</b> The Black Island for {{publication}} in the United Kingdom, his British publishers at that time, Methuen, suggested that alterations be made to Land of Black Gold before releasing it into the UK market. In the original versions Tintin arrived in British-occupied Palestine, where he was arrested by British police before being captured by the Zionist paramilitary organization Irgun, who mistake him for {{one of their own}} agents. In this revised version Tintin arrives in Khemed, where he is arrested by the Arab military police before being captured and taken to Bab El Ehr. The inclusion of forces from the British Palestinian Mandate and the Irgun were no longer seen as relevant and so were removed from the story. Background detail was changed accordingly, with Jewish shop fronts with Hebrew signage being removed. A number of characters were also dropped, including the British officers Thorpe and Lieutenant Edwards. Whereas earlier versions had contained fictional Arabic script, for the 1971 version this was corrected to real Arabic.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, <b>redrawn</b> at higher resolution for modern computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of the original sketches of characters and assets from the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution. As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch {{back and forth between the}} original graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt to switch back to the original interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E
5|$|Post-war Kentucky Democrats {{had split}} into two factions—the more {{conservative}} Bourbon Democrats and the more progressive New Departure Democrats. Stevenson governed moderately, giving concessions to both sides. He urged the immediate restoration of all rights to ex-Confederates and denounced Congress for failing to seat {{a portion of the}} Kentucky delegation because they had sided with the Confederacy. A champion of states' rights, he resisted federal measures he saw as violating the sovereignty of the states and vehemently denounced the proposed Fifteenth Amendment. Following Stevenson's lead, the General Assembly refused to pass either the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, but after their passage by a constitutional majority of the states Stevenson generally insisted that blacks' newly granted rights not be infringed upon. He was silent, however, when state legislators and officials from various cities used lengthy residency restrictions and <b>redrawn</b> district and municipal boundaries to exclude black voters from specific elections. His 1867 plea for legislators to call a constitutional convention to revise the state's pro-slavery constitution to better conform to post-war reality was completely ignored.|$|E
5|$|The remake, {{known as}} Hatoful Boyfriend HD in Japan, was {{originally}} slated for release via Steam on 21 August 2014; however release was later postponed to 4 September 2014 {{to allow for}} final adjustments to the Japanese version. The remake includes a new route for Azami, full screen capability, and <b>redrawn</b> backgrounds. A collector's edition of the remake titled Hatoful Boyfriend Summer of Dove Collector's Edition was released for pre-order along with the normal edition, and bundles together the remake, the original Hatoful Boyfriend: Hurtful Complete Edition, a digital version of the game's soundtrack, a new comic illustrated by Hato, exclusive wallpapers of Okosan, and a St. PigeoNation's Class of 2014 yearbook. The remake was {{also included in the}} Humble Bundle pack for Valentine's Day 2015, which exclusively featured dating sim games, along with a Hatoful Boyfriend pillowcase for the highest price point option. A port of the remake for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was released on 21 July 2015. And one to for iOS on 25 May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} <b>redrawn</b> and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and {{his wife in the}} Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
5|$|While Bungie founder Alex Seropian {{handled the}} {{business}} aspect of Bungie and produced the game's box art and promotional material, Jones programmed the game, wrote the story line, {{and contributed to}} the game's manual. Whereas Jones had single-handedly coded Minotaur, the small staff for Pathways was due to lack of money for a large team. To speed implementation, Jones built a level editor for the game that allowed him to add objects, monsters and walls to the levels. The game's levels and mazes span 40million scaled square feet. Jones' friend, Colin Brent, did much of the art and creature design, reducing Jones' workload and, in the programmer's opinion, improving the art. Each monster was drawn by hand in different states such as stationary, moving, attacking, and dying. They were then scanned into the computer and added to the game; if there were problems, they were <b>redrawn.</b> Once the final drawings were complete, the images were colorized in 24-bit color using Adobe Photoshop. Despite the game's advanced graphics, Pathways was designed to work on any Macintosh model; it was one of 30applications that ran natively on Apple's PowerMacs on launch day.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were <b>redrawn</b> by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the Order of Canada be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.|$|E
5|$|During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States {{initially}} {{supported the}} royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia {{in the spring}} of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks {{in the first years of}} the war. This support took place in the form of extensive clandestine relations between the Office of Strategic Services and Chetniks with William Donovan's administration. Such cooperation was highlighted by complex operations such as Operation Halyard, in which several hundred American pilots were rescued by Chetniks. However, OSS support for the Chetniks was compromised by the United Kingdom's MI6 policy of favoring the Yugoslav Partisans over the Chetniks. In 1943, the US government's support for the Chetniks over the Yugoslav Partisans was such that president Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with Winston Churchill in a private conversation that he imagined that Yugoslavia's boundaries would be completely <b>redrawn</b> into three separate states, with Peter Karađorđević Jr. being the monarch of an independent Serbian kingdom at the end of the war. The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 when they thought that Nazi occupation could not be removed by home-grown resistance alone. The United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British. At the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, John Carmack, a game {{programmer}} for the Gamer's Edge {{video game}} subscription service and disk magazine at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana, developed {{a way to}} create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game. At the time, IBM-compatible general-purpose computers {{were not able to}} replicate the common feat of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, which were capable of redrawing the entire screen fast enough for a side-scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware. Carmack created adaptive tile refresh: a way to slide the majority of the visible screen to the side both horizontally and vertically when the player moved as if it had not changed, and only redraw the newly-visible portions of the screen. Other games had previously <b>redrawn</b> the whole screen in chunks, or like Carmack's earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction. He discussed the idea with coworker Tom Hall, who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating the first level of the recent Super Mario Bros. 3 on a computer. The pair did so in a single overnight session, with Hall recreating the graphics of the game—replacing the player character of Mario with Dangerous Dave, a character from an eponymous previous Gamer's Edge game—while Carmack optimized the code. The next morning on September 20, the resulting game, Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, was shown to their other coworker John Romero. Romero recognized Carmack's idea as a major accomplishment: Nintendo {{was one of the most}} successful companies in Japan, largely due to the success of their Mario franchise, and the ability to replicate the gameplay of the series on a computer could have large implications.|$|E
5|$|The high-definition upgrade {{was not as}} {{difficult}} as it might have been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be <b>redrawn</b> by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed to be set as there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out.|$|E
