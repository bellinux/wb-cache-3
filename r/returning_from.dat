40|$|Firms must {{strike a}} {{delicate}} balance between the exploitation of well-known business models and the exploration of risky, untested approaches. In this paper, we study financial contracting between an investor and a firm with private information about its <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> exploration and exploitation. The investor-optimal mechanism offers contracts with different tolerance for failures to screen <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> exploitation, and with different exposure to the project's revenues to screen <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> exploration. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for private information about <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> exploration to have zero value to the firm. When these conditions fail, private information about exploration may even decrease the firm's payoff...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilise}} {{and improve their}} income situation, rural households are strongly encouraged to diversify their activities {{both within and outside}} the agricultural sector. Often, however, this advice is only moderately pursued. This paper addresses issues of rural household income diversification in the case of Poland. It investigates <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> rural household income strategies using propensity score matching methods and extensive datasets spanning 1998 - 2008. Results suggest that <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> combining farm and off-farm activities were lower than <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> concentrating on farming or on self-employment outside agriculture. This differential is stable over time although <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> diversification have relatively improved after Poland’s accession to the EU. This is also visible in the fact that since 2006 <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> combining farm and off-farm activities have evened with <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> relying solely on hired off-farm labour, thus smoothing the difference observed before the accession. Further, over the analysed period, households pursuing the diversification strategy performed better than those relying solely on unearned income. Finally, in general, the income in households combining farm and off-farm activities was higher than in those combining two off-farm income sources...|$|R
