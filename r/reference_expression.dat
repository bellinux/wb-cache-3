The con-textual questions usually have some cohesive {{relation to their}} context like <b>reference</b> <b>expressions.</b> Therefore, systems have to detect the cohesion and resolve the reference relations to answer the questions.

On the other hand, we address the problem by using the notion “the cohesion with the knowledge. ” First of all, the proposed method detects <b>reference</b> <b>expressions</b> in a given question.

40|$|Since John S. Bell {{demonstrated}} {{the interest of}} studying linear combinations of probabilities in relation with the EPR paradox in 1964, Bell inequalities have lead to numerous developments. Unfortunately, the description of Bell inequalities is subject to several degeneracies, which make any exchange of information about them unnecessarily hard.

30|$|Real-time {{quantitative}} {{reverse transcription}} PCR (qRT-PCR) {{is widely used}} to assess the status of gene expression under variable developmental and environmental conditions (Gachon et al. 2004). Variables for transgene expression (Kohli et al. 2006) also necessitate its analysis by qRT-PCR (Trijatmiko et al. 2016). For the results to be dependable, selection of reference genes that express consistently across the tissue, genotype and developmental stage variables is critical (Wong and Medrano 2005; Guénin et al. 2009). Unless a stably expressed gene is used as a <b>reference,</b> <b>expression</b> level in samples are overestimated or underestimated, and identification of differential expressions is prone to errors. In general, ubiquitously expressed genes that would maintain consistent expression are used. However, these have not been thoroughly tested to be so under different variables. Also, the reference genes generally belong to a gene family and isogenes can be rather variably expressed in different tissues of different genotypes.|$|E

An alternative pathway of T-cell activation independent of antigen stimulation, mediated by the cytokine interleukin (IL) - 15, was recently described. We investigated IL- 15 expression in atherosclerotic plaques in relation to plaque morphology, inflammatory cells, T-cell activation, and oxidation-specific epitopes by use of immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization was used to evaluate IL- 15 mRNA expression. We also studied the proliferative response of plaque-derived T-cell lines to IL- 15 in vitro using [(3) H]thymidine incorporation.

40|$|Figure 1 : High-quality facial {{performance}} capture for two actors. The resulting meshes {{are in full}} vertex correspondence. We {{present a}} new technique for passive and markerless facial performance capture based on anchor frames. Our method starts with high resolution per-frame geometry acquisition using state-of-theart stereo reconstruction, and proceeds to establish a single triangle mesh that is propagated through the entire performance. Leveraging the fact that facial performances often contain repetitive subsequences, we identify anchor frames as those which contain similar facial expressions to a manually chosen <b>reference</b> <b>expression.</b> Anchor frames are automatically computed over one or even multiple performances. We introduce a robust image-space tracking method that computes pixel matches directly from the reference frame to all anchor frames, and thereby to the remaining frames in the sequence via sequential matching. This allows us to propagate one reconstructed frame to an entire sequence in parallel, in contrast to previous sequential methods. Our anchored reconstruction approach also limits tracker drift and robustly handles occlusions and motion blur. The parallel tracking and mesh propagation offer low computation times. Our technique will even automatically match anchor frames across different sequences captured on different occasions, propagating a single mesh to all performances...|$|E

The role of the E-cadherin repressor Snail in ovarian cancer progression remains to be elucidated. We analysed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens of 48 primary ovarian tumours and corresponding metastases for expression of E-cadherin and Snail by immunohistochemistry. We found a significant correlation between E-cadherin expression in primary cancers and their corresponding metastases (P< 0. 001). This correlation was found for Snail expression as well (P< 0. 001). There was a significant (P= 0. 008) association of reduced E-cadherin expression in primary ovarian cancer with shorter overall survival. Similarly, Snail expression in corresponding metastases (P= 0. 047) was associated with reduced overall survival of the patients. Additionally, the group of patients showing reduced E-cadherin and increased Snail immunoreactivity in primary tumours and corresponding metastases, respectively, had a significantly higher risk of death (P= 0. 002 and 0. 022, respectively) when compared to the patient group with the <b>reference</b> <b>expression</b> profile E-cadherin positive and Snail negative.

This study delves into the molecular basis of action of TaMIPS, a heat stress-inducible enzyme that was identified through PCR-select subtraction technology, which is named here as TaMIPS 2. MIPS (l-Myo-inositol-phosphate synthase) {{is important for the}} normal growth and development in plants. Expression profiling showed that TaMIPS 2 is expressed during different developing seed stages upon heat stress. Also, the transcript levels increase in unfertilized ovaries and significant amounts are present during the recovery period providing evidence that MIPS is crucial for its role in heat stress recovery and flower development. Alternatively spliced forms from rice and Arabidopsis were also identified and their expression analysis revealed that apart from heat stress, some of the spliced variants were also inducible by drought, NaCl, Cold, ABA, BR, SA and mannitol. In silico promoter analysis revealed various cis-elements that could contribute for the differential regulation of MIPS in different plant systems. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MIPS are highly conserved among monocots and dicots and TaMIPS 2 grouped specifically with monocots. Comparative analyses was undertaken by different experimental approaches, i. e., semi-quantitative RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, Genevestigator as a <b>reference</b> <b>expression</b> tool and motif analysis to predict the possible function of TaMIPS 2 in regulating the different aspects of plant development under abiotic stress in wheat...|$|E

Different high-throughput expression analysis methods including microarrays, bead-based detection, and small RNA cloning have been applied to quantitatively detect miRNAs in various tissues, cell types, and biological conditions. High-throughput expression data was collected from public repositories and processed to create a database of miRNA expression profiles. Several commonly used normalization methods were compared to identify suitable methods for cross-platform comparison of high-throughput miRNA expression data. The database provides interlaboratory and interplatform validated <b>reference</b> <b>expression</b> levels for miRNAs. The normalized expression profiles were validated by querying for well-established features of miRNA expression.

Secondly, we used the database to compare the expression patterns of miRNAs belonging to the let- 7 family, where the divergence in expression patterns implies {{that they may have}} diversified functionally.

Genome-wide gene expression analysis has proven valuable for identifying biological processes in neurodegenerative diseases using post mortem human brain tissue and numerous datasets are publically available. However, many studies utilize heterogeneous tissue samples consisting of multiple cell types, all of which contribute to global gene expression values, confounding biological interpretation of the data. In particular, changes in numbers of neuronal and glial cells occurring in neurodegeneration confound transcriptomic analyses, particularly in human brain tissues where sample availability and control is limited. To identify cell specific gene expression changes in neurodegenerative disease, we have applied our recently published computational deconvolution method, population specific expression analysis (PSEA). PSEA estimates cell-type-specific expression values using <b>reference</b> <b>expression</b> measures, which in the case of brain tissue comprises mRNAs with cell-type-specific expression in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. As an exercise in PSEA implementation and hypothesis development regarding neurodegenerative diseases, we applied PSEA to Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease (PD, HD) datasets. Genes identified as differentially expressed in substantia nigra pars compacta neurons by PSEA were validated using external laser capture microdissection data.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can identify and quantify proteins in a global and unbiased manner and can highlight the cellular processes that are altered between such systems. We analyzed 11 human cell lines using an LTQ-Orbitrap family mass spectrometer with a “high field” Orbitrap mass analyzer with improved resolution and sequencing speed. We identified a total of 11, 731 proteins, and on average 10, 361 ± 120 proteins in each cell line. This very high proteome coverage enabled {{analysis of}} a broad range of processes and functions. Despite the distinct origins of the cell lines, our quantitative results showed surprisingly high similarity in terms of expressed proteins. Nevertheless, this global similarity of the proteomes did not imply equal expression levels of individual proteins across the 11 cell lines, as we found significant differences in expression levels for an estimated two-third of them. The variability in cellular expression levels was similar for low and high abundance proteins, and even many of the most highly expressed proteins with household roles showed significant differences between cells. Metabolic pathways, which have high redundancy, exhibited variable expression, whereas basic cellular functions such as the basal transcription machinery varied much less.
