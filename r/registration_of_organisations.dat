30|$|The contradictions {{that existed}} in Ubaruku between the COWSO and Village Council raises some questions. For example, to which {{structure}} the COWSO should be responsible? Does the registration at the District Council shift {{the power of the}} Village Council to oversee groundwater governance? Are there clear directives that guide how the COWSO and the Village Council should operate interdependently? A good thing is that the WRMA no 12 of 2009 states clearly the functions of the district authorities, COWSOs and Village Councils on water governance. One of the district authorities’ functions is to facilitate <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> community <b>organisations,</b> while the Village Council is responsible for promoting establishment of COWSOs, coordinating COWSOs’ budgets with Village Council budgets and resolving conflicts arising within the community organisations (URT 2009). The contradiction on groundwater governance between the Village Council and COWSO leadership in Ubaruku village highlights that there was a limited directives on how the COWSO should operate parallel with other water governance structures at a village level.|$|R
