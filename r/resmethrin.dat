50|$|The <b>resmethrin</b> {{molecule}} {{has four}} stereoisomers determined by cis-trans orientation around a carbon triangle and chirality. Technical <b>resmethrin</b> {{is a mixture}} of (1R,trans)-, (1R,cis)-, (1S,trans)-, (1S,cis)- isomers, typically in a ratio of 4:1:4:1. The 1R isomers (both trans and cis) show strong insecticidal activity, while the 1S isomers do not. The (1R,trans)- isomer is also known as Bioresmethrin,(+)-trans-Resmethrin, or d-trans-Resmethrin; although bioresmethrin has been used alone as a pesticide active ingredient, it is not now registered as a separate Active Ingredient (AI) by the U.S. EPA. The (1R,cis)- isomer is known as Cismethrin, but this is also not registered in the U.S. for use alone as a pesticide AI.|$|E
50|$|The first-generation pyrethroids, {{developed}} in the 1960s, include bioallethrin, tetramethrin, <b>resmethrin</b> and bioresmethrin. They are more active than the natural pyrethrum but are unstable in sunlight. Activity of pyrethrum and 1st-generation pyrethroids is often enhanced by addition of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (which itself has some insecticidal activity). With the 91/414/EEC review, many 1st-generation compounds have not been included on Annex 1, probably because the market is simply not big enough to warrant the costs of re-registration (rather than any special concerns about safety).|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} pyrethoids {{are related}} to pyrethrin I and II by changing the alcohol group of the ester of chrysanthemic acid. This relatively modest change can lead to substantially altered activities. For example, the 5-benzyl-3-furanyl ester called <b>resmethrin</b> is only weakly toxic to mammals (LD50 (rat, oral) = 2,000 mg/kg) but is 20-50 times more effective than natural pyrethrum and is also readily biodegraded. Other commercially important esters include tetramethrin, allethrin, phenothrin, barthrin, dimethrin, and bioresmethrin. Another family of pyrethroids have altered acid fragment together with altered alcohol components. These require more elaborate organic synthesis. Members of this extensive class include the dichlorovinyl and dibromovinyl derivatives. Still others are tefluthrin, fenpropathrin, and bioethanomethrin.|$|E

RESULTS: The 1 day LC 50 values for resmethrin+ PBOwere 23. 2, 32. 08 and 307. 18 ng cm− 2 for A. domesticus, H. convergens and S. frugiperda respectively. The 1 day LC 50 values for δ-phenothrin+ PBOwere 26. 9, 74. 91 and 228. 57 ng cm− 2 for A. domesticus, H. convergensandS. frugiperda respectively. Theregression relationshipbetweenspeciesmortalityandconcentrationexplained 51 – 81 %of the variation for resmethrin+ PBO and 72 – 97 %of the variation for δ-phenothrin+ PBO.

40|$|Advances in the {{synthesis}} and utilization of new chemical compounds {{have led to}} improvements in our daily lives. However, new chemicals may be both beneficial and toxic. Thus, exposure to these new compounds should be restricted {{in an attempt to}} limit their potential toxicities. We predicted the safety of three biocides (p-cresol, diazinon and <b>resmethrin)</b> by comparing their skin permeability coefficients and desquamation rate (the counter flux of permeability coefficient for chemical compounds induced by skin turnover) following skin exposure. In vitro skin permeation experiments revealed that the permeability coefficients of diazinon and <b>resmethrin</b> were smaller than the desquamation rate; therefore, these biocides could not permeate the skin, which resulted in very low skin concentrations of these compounds. On the other hand, the skin concentration of p-cresol was high because of its higher permeability coefficient than the desquamation rate. Furthermore, low in vitro cell viability was reported for skin exposed to p-cresol.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of human illnesses associated with West Nile Virus (WNV) occurred in New York City in 1999. Since then, it has gradually spread westwards, reaching northern California {{for the first}} time in 2005. WNV is transmitted by several mosquito species and birds serve as the main reservoir. Several control measures have been used, targeting both the aquatic larvae and the adult mosquitoes. In the latter case, roosting birds in trees are sprayed with pyrethroid insecticides because these are highly toxic to mosquitoes, but have low avian toxicity. A request was made to use a resmethrin-containing insecticide during the month of October 2005 in California.

40|$|Debate {{concerning}} arbovirus control strategies remains contentious because concern {{regarding the}} relative risk of viral infection and environmental toxicant exposure is high but inadequately characterized. Taking this into account, mosquito control agencies employ aerial insecticides only after arbovirus surveillance data indicate high local mosquito-infection-rates. Successfully mitigating the risk of adult-mosquito-control insecticides ('adulticides') to non-target species such as humans, domestic animals, fish, beneficial insects and wildlife, while increasing their efficacy to reduce arbovirus outbreak intensity requires targeted scientific data from animal toxicity studies and environmental monitoring activities. Wild birds are an important reservoir host for WNv and are potentially exposed to insecticides used for mosquito control. However, no risk assessments have evaluated whether insecticides augment or extend the potential transmissibility of West Nile virus (WNv) in birds. In order to augment existing <b>resmethrin</b> risk assessments, we aimed to determine whether synergized <b>resmethrin</b> (SR) may cause chickens to develop an elevated or extended WN viremia and if subacute stress may affect its immunotoxicity. We distributed 40 chickens into four groups then exposed them prior to and during WNv infection with SR (50 {mu}g/l <b>resmethrin</b> + 150 {mu}g/l piperonyl butoxide) and/or 20 mg/I corticosterone (CORT) in their drinking-water. Corticosterone was given for 10 continuous days and SR was given for 3 alternate days starting the 3 rd day of CORT exposure, then chickens were subcutaneously inoculated with WNv on the 5 th day of CORT treatment. Compared to controls, CORT treatment extended and elevated viremia, enhanced WNv-specific antibody and increased the percentage of birds that shed oral virus, whereas SR treatment extended viremia, depressed WNv-specific IgG, and increased the percentage of CORT-treated birds that shed oral virus. Corticosterone and SR independently and interactively altered immunity to WNv in chickens. Further characterization of how variations in SR-exposure to and CORT levels in chickens and wild birds relate to laboratory WNv-infection trials is warranted in order to place these findings into an epidemiological context...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In May 2001 {{a sample}} of Culex pipiens pipiens variety molestus Forskål from Marin County, California, {{collected}} as larvae and reared to adults, was found to show reduced <b>resmethrin</b> and permethrin knock-down responses in bottle bioassays relative to a standard susceptible Cx pipiens quinquefasciatus Say colony (CQ 1). Larval susceptibility tests, using CQ 1 as standard susceptible, indicated that the Marin mosquitoes had LC 50 resistance ratios of 18. 3 for permethrin, 12 for deltamethrin and 3. 3 for pyrethrum. A colony of Marin was established and rapidly developed higher levels of resistance in a few generations after exposure to permethrin as larvae. These selected larvae were shown to cross-resist to lambda-cyhalothrin {{as well as to}} DDT. However, adult knock-down time in the presence of permethrin, <b>resmethrin</b> and pyrethrum was not increased after increase in tolerance to pyrethroids as larvae. Partial and almost complete reversion to susceptibility as larvae was achieved with S, S, S-tributylphosphorotrithioate and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), respectively, suggesting the presence of carboxylesterase and P 450 monooxygenase mediated resistance. Insensitive target site resistance (kdr) was also detected in some Marin mosquitoes by use of an existing PCR-based diagnostic assay designed for Cx p pipiens L mosquitoes.

40|$|Indoor {{pesticide}} {{exposure is}} a growing concern, particularly for pyrethroids, a commonly used class of pesticides. Pyrethroid concentrations may be especially high in homes of immigrant farm worker families, who often live {{in close proximity to}} agricultural fields and are faced with poor housing conditions, potentially causing high pest infestation and pesticide use. We investigate levels of pyrethroids in the house dust of farm worker family homes in a study of mothers and children living in Mendota, CA, within the population-based Mexican Immigration to California: Agricultural Safety and Acculturation (MICASA) Study. We present pesticide use data and levels of pyrethroid pesticides in indoor dust collected in 2009 as measured by questionnaires and a GC/MS analysis of the pyrethroids cis- and trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and <b>resmethrin</b> in single dust samples collected from 55 households. Cis- and trans-permethrin had the highest detection frequencies at 67 %, with median concentrations of 244 and 172 ng/g dust, respectively. Cypermethrin was detected in 52 % of the homes and had a median concentration of 186 ng/g dust. Esfenvalerate, <b>resmethrin</b> and deltamethrin were detected in less than half the samples. We compared the pyrethroid concentrations found in our study to other studies looking at both rural and urban homes and daycares. Lower detection frequencies and/or lower median concentrations of cis- and trans-permethrin and cypermethrin were observed in our study as compared to those studies. However, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and <b>resmethrin</b> were detected more frequently in the house dust from our study than in the other studies. Because households whose children had higher urinary pyrethroid metabolite levels {{were more likely to be}} analyzed in this study, a positive bias in our estimates of household pyrethroid levels may be expected. A positive association was observed with reported outdoor pesticide use and cypermethrin levels found in the indoor dust samples (rs= 0. 28, p= 0. 0450). There was also a positive association seen with summed pyrethroid levels in house dust and the results of a pesticide inventory conducted by field staff (rs= 0. 32, p= 0. 018), a potentially useful predictor of pesticide exposure in farm worker family homes. Further research is warranted to fully investigate the utility of such a measure. 1 R 01 OH 009293 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States 2 U 50 OH 007550 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United StatesP 42 ES 004699 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesP 42 ES 04699 /ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States 2014 - 11 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24096042 PMC 405949...|$|E

40|$|In 2002, West Nile {{virus was}} {{isolated}} {{for the first}} time in Harris County, Texas. The subsequent epidemic led the Harris County Mosquito Control Division to initiate an extensive spraying operation to suppress infected adult mosquitoes. The control program was aimed at the predominate disease-carrying mosquito for the southern United States, Culex quinquefasciatus Say. With the increase of insecticide pressure on the mosquito populations, the possibility of resistance was brought into question. A three year study using a vial bioassay test was conducted in Harris (2004 - 2005) and Brazos (2005 - 2006) counties to determine the resistance status of Cx. quinquefasciatus to the six chemicals (malathion, naled, <b>resmethrin,</b> permethrin, sumithrin, and pyrethrum) used most frequently in adult mosquito control programs. The resistance ratios acquired from the vial bioassay tests were mapped onto shapefiles for Harris and Brazos counties, which revealed clustering of areas with pyrethroid resistance mosquito populations in the northeastern, southeastern, and southwestern corners of Loop 610 in Harris County. An additional six-month preliminary study, involving six operational areas in Harris County and three in Brazos County, was conducted, demonstrating only minor fluctuations in the monthly resistance ratios occurring in both counties in 2005. A significant correlation was documented between the two years of resistance ratios for mosquitoes to the three pyrethroids in Harris County and all the insecticides except pyrethrum in Brazos County. A significant relationship was also found between the <b>resmethrin</b> resistance ratios and the number of spray events performed during the previous year and the malathion resistance ratios with the insecticide treatments conducted in the same year. The correlation analyses provide data used to predict areas where resistance can develop in the mosquito population, thus providing the control agency more data to plan future control tactics. The overall analysis indicated that Harris County has localized pockets of resistant mosquitoes; but, on a whole, it does not seem to have widespread resistance in its mosquito populations. The only resistance that was detected was in the mosquitoes tested against the three pyrethroids.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of a range}} of anti-parasitic chemotherapeutic agents against the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis following topical application was studied in vitro and in vivo. In general, adult and preadult lice were susceptible {{to a wide range of}} compounds with dose rates, following 1 hour exposures, ranging several orders of magnitude (10. 0 - 0. 001 mg/L). Overall the pyrethroid compounds which were tested were found to have the widest therapeutic ratios, indicating the potential of this group of chemotherapeutants for sea lice control. Resistance to the organophosphorus (OP) compounds dichlorvos and azamethiphos was detected in isolated populations of lice. Field trials with azamethiphos indicated that the compound was highly efficacious against sensitive lice (@ 0. 1 mg/L; however, where resistance was present, efficacy (@ 0. 2 mg/L) was highly variable. When used at the above dose rates, azamethiphos was found to be well tolerated by fish as indicated by a lack of significant brain acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Results on cross resistance (between pyrethroids and OPs) were inconclusive which was believed to be, primarily, due to the overall high toxicity of the group; but also to the variable responses from exposed lice. In a series of preliminary trials, one of the pyrethroid compounds, PHRDL-D, was found to effectively remove lice when administered orally to infected salmon, indicating the potential of pyrethroids as oral chemotherapeutants. A comparison of the relative toxicity of azamethiphos (OP), <b>resmethrin</b> (pyrethroid), ivermectin (avermectin) and the structurally similar compound SKB 7 (milbemycin), indicated that chalimus stages were only susceptible to ivermectin and SKB 7 following topical and intra-peritoneal injection to lice infected fish. In contrast, azamethiphos and <b>resmethrin</b> were found to be non toxic to chalimus larvae at dose rates which were highly toxic to both adult lice and treated fish. Preliminary studies on the uptake of r 4 C]azamethiphos in adult lice indicated that uptake was both concentration and time dependant, reaching a plateau at the onset of toxicity. Uptake appeared to be primarily associated with frontal plates, 1 st antennae and anus. The fmdings indicated that several compounds/compound classes are highly active against lice and, given the limited number of compounds available for sea lice control and the development of resistance to OPs, might be considered as alternatives.

Approach: 1) Develop trace methods to analyze pesticides and their metabolites in water, sediment and possibly tissue samples; 2) measure levels occurring in the environment after applications and after significant rain events; 3) conduct toxicity studies on larval and juvenile lobsters to access acute toxicity and immune suppression after exposure to pesticides at stressful and non-stressful temperatures; 4) compare toxic levels to environmental concentrations to access risk.

40|$|The present {{method is}} used to {{determine}} trans-chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid (trans-CDCA) as metabolite of the pyrethroids allethrin, phenothrin, <b>resmethrin,</b> tetramethrin and of pyrethrum as well as cis- and trans- 3 -(2, 2 -dichlorovinyl) - 2, 2 -dimethyl-cyclopropane carboxylic acid (cis- and trans-DCCA), cis- 3 -(2, 2 -dibromovinyl) - 2, 2 -dimethyl-cyclopropane carboxylic acid (cis-DBCA), 4 -fluoro- 3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (FPBA) and 3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (3 -PBA) as metabolites of the pyrethroids permethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin. Additionally, the presented method enables the determination of cis-chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid (cis-CDCA). With the gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric method presented here, the urinary concentration of seven pyrethroid and pyrethrum metabolites can be determined sensitively and reliably in one analytical procedure. Due to its sensitivity the procedure is suitable for detecting exposures relevant to both environmental medicine and occupational medicine. The method comprises alkaline cleavage of the conjugates, the extraction of the carboxylic acids using solid phase extraction, as well as derivatisation by esterisation with hexafluoroisopropanol and diisopropyl carbodiimide. The analytical determination is carried out by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after negative chemical ionisation. Quantitation is performed by use of two internal standards...|$|E
40|$|Pyrethroid {{insecticides}} bind to voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) {{and modify}} their gating kinetics, thereby disrupting neuronal function. Pyrethroids {{have also been}} reported to alter the function of other channel types, including activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. Therefore, the present study compared the ability of 11 structurally diverse pyrethroids to evoke Ca 2 + influx in primary cultures of mouse neocortical neurons. Nine pyrethroids (tefluthrin, deltamethrin, λ-cyhalothrin, β-cyfluthrin, esfenvalerate, S-bioallethrin, fenpropathrin, cypermethrin, and bifenthrin) produced concentration-dependent elevations in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in neocortical neurons. Permethrin and <b>resmethrin</b> were without effect on [Ca 2 +]i. These pyrethroids displayed a range of efficacies on Ca 2 + influx; however, the EC 50 values for active pyrethroids all were within one order of magnitude. Tetrodotoxin blocked increases in [Ca 2 +]i caused by all nine active pyrethroids, indicating that the effects depended on VGSC activation. The pathways for deltamethrin- and tefluthrin-induced Ca 2 + influx include N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, L-type Ca 2 + channels, and reverse mode of operation of the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger inasmuch as antagonists of these sites blocked deltamethrin-induced Ca 2 + influx. These data demonstrate that pyrethroids stimulate Ca 2 + entry into neurons subsequent to their actions on VGSCs...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{efficient}} and environmentally friendly analytical methodology is proposed for extracting and preconcentrating pyrethroids from water samples prior to gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-NCI-MS) analysis. Fourteen pyrethroids {{were selected for}} this work: bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, λ-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenvalerate, fenpropathrin, τ-fluvalinate, permethrin, phenothrin, <b>resmethrin,</b> tetramethrin and tralomethrin. The method is based on ultrasound-assisted emulsification-extraction (UAEE) of a water-immiscible solvent in an aqueous medium. Chloroform was used as extraction solvent in the UAEE technique. Target analytes were quantitatively extracted achieving an enrichment factor of 200 when 20 mL aliquot of pure water spiked with pyrethroid standards was extracted. The method was also evaluated with tap water and river water samples. Method detection limits (MDLs) ranged from 0. 03 to 35. 8 ng L− 1 with RSDs values ≤ 3 – 25 % (n = 5). The coefficients of estimation of the calibration curves obtained following the proposed methodology were ≥ 0. 998. Recovery values were {{in the range of}} 45 – 106 %, showing satisfactory robustness of the method for analyzing pyrethroids in water samples. The proposed methodology was applied for the analysis of river water samples. Cypermethrin was detected at concentration levels ranging from 4. 94 to 30. 5 ng L− 1.

40|$|Abstract—Pyrethroid {{insecticide}} use in California, USA, is growing, {{and there}} is a need to understand the fate of these compounds in the environment. Concentrations and toxicity were assessed in streambed sediment of the San Joaquin Valley of California, one of the most productive agricultural regions of the United States. Concentrations were also measured in the suspended sediment associated with irrigation or storm-water runoff, and mass loads during storms were calculated. Western valley streambed sediments were frequently toxic to the amphipod, Hyalella azteca, with most of the toxicity attributable to bifenthrin and cyhalothrin. Up to 100 % mortality was observed in some locations with concentrations of some pyrethroids up to 20 ng/g. The western San Joaquin Valley streams are mostly small watersheds with clay soils, and sediment-laden irrigation runoff transports pyrethroid insecticides throughout the growing season. In contrast, eastern tributaries and the San Joaquin River had low bed sediment concentrations (< 1 ng/g) and little or no toxicity because of the preponderance of sandy soils and sediments. Bifenthrin, cyhalothrin, and permethrin were the most frequently detected pyrethroids in irrigation and storm water runoff. Esfenvalerate, fenpropathrin, and <b>resmethrin</b> were also detected. All sampled streams contributed to the insecticide load of the San Joaquin River during storms, but some compounds detected in the smaller creeks were not detected in the San Joaquin River. The two smallest streams, Ingram and Hospital Creeks, which had high sediment toxicity during th...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Methoprene is a {{pesticide}} {{that acts}} as a juvenile hormone agonist. Although developed initially against insects, it has since been shown to have toxic effects on larval and adult crustaceans. Methoprene was one of several pesticides applied to the Western Long Island Sound (WLIS) watershed area during the summer of 1999; the other pesticides were malathion, <b>resmethrin,</b> and sumethrin. These pesticides were applied as part of a county-by-county effort to control the mosquito vector of West Nile Virus. Subsequently, the seasonal lobster catches from the WLIS have decreased dramatically. The lethality of the pesticides to lobsters had been unknown. We studied the effects of methoprene while other investigators studied effects of the other pesticides. We questioned whether methoprene, through its effects on larvae, adults or both, could have contributed to this decline. We found that low levels of methoprene had adverse effects on lobster larvae. It was toxic to stage II larvae at 1 ppb. Stage IV larvae were more resistant, but did exhibit significant increases in molt frequency beginning at exposures of 5 ppb. Juvenile lobsters exhibited variations in tissue susceptibility to methoprene: hepatopancreas appeared to be the most vulnerable, reflected by environmental concentrations of methoprene inhibiting almost all protein synthesis in this organ. Our results indicated that methoprene concentrates in the hepatopancreas, nervous tissue and epidermal cells of the adult lobster. Methoprene altered the synthesis and incorporation of chitoproteins (cuticle pro...|$|E
40|$|Pyrethroid {{insecticides}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} commonly used residential and agricultural insecticides. Based on the increased use of pyrethroids and recent studies showing that pregnant women and children are exposed to pyrethroids, there are concerns over the potential for developmental neurotoxicity. However, there have been relatively few studies on the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. In this study, we sought to investigate the developmental toxicity of six common pyrethroids, three type I compounds (permethrin, <b>resmethrin,</b> and bifenthrin) and three type II compounds (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and λ-cyhalothrin), and to determine whether zebrafish embryos may be an appropriate model for studying the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to pyrethroids caused a dose-dependent increase in mortality and pericardial edema, with type II compounds being the most potent. At doses approaching the LC 50, permethrin and deltamethrin caused craniofacial abnormalities. These findings are consistent with mammalian studies demonstrating that pyrethroids are mildly teratogenic at very high doses. However, at lower doses, body axis curvature and spasms were observed, which were reminiscent of the classic syndromes observed with pyrethroid toxicity. Treatment with diazepam ameliorated the spasms, while treatment with the sodium channel antagonist MS- 222 ameliorated both spasms and body curvature, suggesting that pyrethroid-induced neurotoxicity is similar in zebrafish and mammals. Taken in concert, these data suggest that zebrafish may be an appropriate alternative model to study the mechanism(s) responsible for the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroid insecticides and aid in identification of compounds that should be further tested in mammalian systems...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic pyrethroidal {{compounds}} undergo biodegradation in mammals both oxidatively and hydrolytically, {{and depending}} on the type of compound, either of the pathways may predominate. Thus, (+) - or (+/-) -trans isomers of the chrysanthemumate ester of primary alcohols such as fenothrin, furamethrin, proparthrin, <b>resmethrin,</b> and tetramethrin (and possibly permethrin, too) are metabolized mainly through hydrolysis of the ester linkage, with subsequent oxidation and/or conjugation of the component alcohol and acid moieties. On the other hand, the corresponding (+) -cis enantiometers and chrysanthemumate of secondary alcohols like allethrin are resistant to hydrolytic attack, and biodegraded via oxidation at various sites of the molecule. These rapid metabolic degradations, together with the presumable incomplete absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, would generally contribute to the low acute toxicity of synthetic pyrethroids. These compounds are neither skin irritants nor skin sensitizers, and inhalation toxicity as well as dermal toxicity are fairly low. Neither is teratogenic in rats, mice, and/or rabbits or mutagenic on various bacterial strains. Subacute and chronic feeding of higher amounts of the compounds to rats invariably causes some histopathological changes in liver; however, these are neither indicative nor suggestive of tumorigenicity. Based on existing toxicological information, the present recommended use patterns might afford sufficient safety margin on human population. However, in extending usage to agricultural pest control, much more extensive investigations should be forthcoming from both chemical and biological aspects, since there is scant information on the fate of these pyrethroids in the environment. Also several of the compounds may be very toxic to certain kinds of fish and arthropods...|$|E
40|$|Neurotoxicity and {{mechanistic}} {{data were}} collected for six alpha-cyano pyrethroids (beta-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenpropathrin and lambda-cyhalothrin) and up to six non-cyano containing pyrethroids (bifenthrin, S-bioallethrin [or allethrin], permethrin, pyrethrins, <b>resmethrin</b> [or its cis-isomer, cismethrin] and tefluthrin under standard conditions. Factor analysis and multivariate dissimilarity analysis were employed to evaluate four independent data sets comprised of (1) fifty-six behavioral and physiological parameters from an acute neurotoxicity functional observatory battery (FOB), (2) eight electrophysiological parameters from voltage clamp experiments conducted on the Na(v) 1. 8 sodium channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes, (3) indices of efficacy, potency and binding calculated for calcium ion influx across neuronal membranes, membrane depolarization and glutamate released from rat brain synaptosomes and (4) changes in chloride channel open state probability using a patch voltage clamp technique for membranes isolated from mouse neuroblastoma cells. The pyrethroids segregated into Type I (T [...] syndrome-tremors) and Type II (CS syndrome [...] choreoathetosis with salivation) groups based on FOB data. Of the alpha-cyano pyrethroids, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and cypermethrin arrayed themselves strongly in a dose-dependent manner along two factors that characterize the CS syndrome. Esfenvalerate and fenpropathrin displayed weaker response profiles compared to the non-cyano pyrethroids. Visual clustering on multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps based upon sodium ion channel and calcium influx and glutamate release dissimilarities gave similar groupings. The non-cyano containing pyrethroids were arrayed in a dose-dependent manner along two different factors that characterize the T-syndrome. Bifenthrin was an outlier when MDS maps of the non-cyano pyrethroids were based on sodium ion channel characteristics and permethrin was an outlier when the MDS maps were based on calcium influx/glutamate release potency. Four of six alpha-cyano pyrethroids (lambda-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fenpropathrin) reduced open chloride channel probability. The R-isomers of lambda-l-cyhalothrin reduced open channel probability whereas the S-isomers, antagonized {{the action of the}} R-isomers. None of the non-cyano pyrethroids reduced open channel probability, except bioallethrin, which gave a weak response. Overall, based upon neurotoxicity data and the effect of pyrethroids on sodium, calcium and chloride ion channels, it is proposed that bioallethrin, cismethrin, tefluthrin, bifenthrin and permethrin belong to one common mechanism group and deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and cypermethrin belong to a second. Fenpropathrin and esfenvalerate occupy an intermediate position between these two groups...|$|E
