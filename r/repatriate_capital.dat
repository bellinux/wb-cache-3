Preferential policies in the SEZs included a number of features designed to attract foreign investment, such as a 15 percent tax rate, tax holidays of up to five years, and the ability to repatriate corporate profits and to <b>repatriate</b> <b>capital</b> investments after a contracted period.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a general equilibrium trade model to examine {{for a small}} capital-importing and a small capital-exporting country the employment and welfare effects of capital and wage taxes. The supply of capital is variable due to international mobility, while the supply of labour is variable due to endogenous supply adjustments. The paper considers the optimal policy toward one factor when the other is taxed, under three tax systems of <b>repatriated</b> <b>capital</b> earnings - (1) tax credits, (2) tax deductions, and (3) untaxed net <b>repatriated</b> <b>capital</b> earnings. The analysis also determines under which of these tax systems the employment and welfare effects of domestic factor taxes depend on the foreign capital tax rate, and under which ones they do not.

40|$|Just {{like any}} market price, the {{exchange}} rate for the dollar fluctuates based on supply and demand. By observing the constituent elements of the supply and demand for dollar assets, we can thus explain the significant appreciation of the dollar {{during the second half}} of 2008. Over this period, during which the crisis spread to the whole of the global economy, US Treasury bonds acted as a safe haven, but in net terms foreign investors ceased buying US private securities. Americans, on the other hand, <b>repatriated</b> <b>capital</b> on a massive scale, driving up the net demand for dollars. Supply of dollar assets fell more rapidly than the global supply of assets and thus shored up the US currency. The dollar’s future movements remain one of the greatest uncertainties following the crisis, even though the forecast made before the beginning of the crisis remains valid: if the ongoing US deficit is to be resorbed, a weak dollar will continue to be required.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the scope for {{stabilizing}} Latin American economies to <b>repatriate</b> <b>capital</b> for the financing of long-term investments and economic recovery in the region. In particular, a simple two-period investment model is developed {{to show that a}} government seeking capital repatriation may be tempted to introduce investment subsidies on such long-term capital inflows. Typically, however, such a government will be facing the following trade off: small investment subsidies may not be sufficient to attract large-scale repatriation, and high aggregate subsidies may trigger inflationary expectations. A decreasing subsidy scheme is shown to be optimal. Such a scheme has the following properties: it provides an incentive for investors to repatriate their capital early, and at the same time, it keeps government spending low enough not to jeopardize stabilization programmes. A decreasing subsidy scheme could account for the success that the Chilean debt-equity-swap programmes have [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Adverse shocks to rich {{countries}} {{often have a}} large and persistent negative impact on investment and output in developing countries. This paper examines a transmission mechanism that can account for this stylized fact. The mechanism {{is based on the}} existence of international financial frictions. Specifically, if a small, developing country has to collateralize its assets to borrow funds to invest, falling asset prices caused by a negative shock in an advanced economy worsen the developing country's collateral value and reduce its ability to borrow and reinvest. Hence, investment in the developing country declines, and international investors <b>repatriate</b> <b>capital</b> to the advanced country. As less capital now can be pledged as collateral, the developing country's credit constraint is further tightened, which leads to another round of decline in investment. This generates a downward spiral that may cause large output losses to the developing country. The mechanism finds empirical support in the 2008 - 2009 crisis data.

40|$|While {{the freedom}} to move capital is {{necessary}} for foreign investors, {{the power of the}} state to regulate capital transfers is necessary to prevent volatile capital from causing financial crises as well as to mitigate such crises when they occur. Thus, in regulating international capital movement, a balance should be made between the right to transfer funds and the state’s right to protect the stability of its economy. It is in relation to achieving this balance that this thesis argues that bilateral investment treaties’ (BITs) regulation of capital transfers is deficient, both substantively and procedurally. On substance, this thesis identifies three substantive defects that affect obligations under BITs: absoluteness, immediacy, and breadth. First, many BITs adopt an absolute approach in liberalizing capital that does not permit any restrictions or exceptions, nor does it distinguish between different kinds of capital, or between the right to import capital and the right to <b>repatriate</b> <b>capital.</b> Second, the obligation to permit transfers is immediate and does not allow for a gradual liberalization of capital. Third, many BITs’ terms and obligations are broad and therefore vague, such as the broad definition of investment, or the obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment, which is also broad and interpreted in a manner that restricts the regulatory powers of the host state. Such results could have been partly mitigated if there were a dispute settlement mechanism with the power to create precedent and with it a clearer and more coherent body of rules. But BITs’ investor-state arbitration is also deficient since it consists of ad hoc tribunals, which are not bound by precedent; and their decisions are not generally subject to substantive review. This leads to an inconsistent and incoherent body of law that protects neither the state’s regulatory powers nor the legitimate expectation of investorsEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Before the crisis, the {{emerging}} countries (especially those in Asia) and the oil-exporting countries had enormous foreign trade surpluses they were accumulating in their {{foreign exchange reserves}} and which they used to give their sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) capital endowments. It was thus in these countries and SWFs that financing and capital investment capacities were to be found, {{which is what we}} saw {{at the beginning of the}} crisis. But the crisis then led to two developments : first of all, a significant trend towards <b>repatriating</b> <b>capital</b> from {{the emerging}} and oil-exporting countries to the main countries of the OECD, particularly to the United Stares; secondly, the decline in commodity prices. We then saw a very different situation : the emerging and oil countries suffered declines in their foreign exchange reserves. World savings was no longer concentrated in these countries, but in financing the public debts of the main OECD countries : in the United States and in Europe, governments replaced SWFs as « investors of last resort ».

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between foreign direct investment and economic growth in ECOWAS using the System-GMM panel estimation technique covering the period 1970 - 2011. The study adopted System-GMM in order to overcome the weaknesses perceived in the empirical works of earlier studies; majority of these studies failed to control for the presumed challenges of endogeneity inherent in the FDI-Growth argument. The study likewise interacted human capital and institutions indicators with other explanatory variables in explaining the variability of FDI. The results of the System-GMM appears contrary to earlier studies, as the contribution of FDI was insignificant and impacts negatively on growth in ECOWAS despite the controlling {{for the role of}} human capital and quality of institutions in the model. Following this outcome, policy makers in developing Africa needs to exercise cautions in adopting the recommendation from earlier studies; most of which advocates more openness, advancing human capital development and strengthening institutions. This might not be completely helpful considering the pattern of FDI inflow into ECOWAS, which is absolutely resource-seeking. There is need to curtail excessive openness in the extractive industries, encouraging more manufacturing FDI and domestic investment of <b>repatriated</b> <b>capital</b> by ensuring more economic stability and raising domestic interest rate. ...|$|R
50|$|As of 2017, Gilead's {{challenge}} is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of Medicaid in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals. Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it. Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies <b>repatriate</b> offshore <b>capital</b> with minimal further taxation.|$|R

Suitable Project finance option could transfer the financing of projects with public interest to private investors as against the responsibility of the government, such that the private investors are given the privilege to run the project for profit for an agreed duration sufficient for the investor to <b>repatriate</b> the <b>capital</b> outlay for the project and accumulation of sufficient profit margin. At the end of the agreed duration which is usually between 20 to 30  years for a Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) contract, the ownership and management of the project is transferred back to the government (Yescombe, 2014). Project finance can be formally defined as the extension of credit to finance an economic unit where the future cash flows of that unit serve as collateral for the loan (Christopher, et al. 2010).|$|R
