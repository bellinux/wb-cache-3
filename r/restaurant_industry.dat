5|$|In 1991, Brown {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with recording artist Kenny Rogers, co-founding and serving as CEO of Kenny Rogers Roasters, an international chain of wood-roasted chicken restaurants. The founding of Kenny Rogers Roasters {{was part of a}} larger movement in the <b>restaurant</b> <b>industry</b> toward healthier, take-home offerings. Roasters immediately found itself in competition with Boston Chicken (later known as Boston Market) and several smaller roasted chicken chains. Kentucky Fried Chicken also introduced a roasted chicken line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with Roasters and Boston Chicken. In December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in the roasted chicken market, sued Kenny Rogers Roasters, claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until Roasters purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994. Brown then took Roasters public and grew it to a chain of more than 1,000 restaurants before selling his interest in the franchise to the Malaysia-based Berjaya Group in 1996.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} {{and interest in}} food and wine pairings have increased and taken on new connotations. Industries have sprung up with print publications and media dedicated to expounding on the principles and ideals of pairing the perfect wine with the perfect dish. In the <b>restaurant</b> <b>industry,</b> {{there is often a}} dedicated individual or staff of sommeliers who are trained to recommend wine pairings with the restaurant's fare. The origins of this recent phenomenon {{can be traced to the}} United States in the 1980s when the wine industry began to advertise wine-drinking as a component of dining rather than as just an alcoholic beverage meant for consumption and intoxication. Winemakers started to emphasize the kind of food dishes that their wines would go well with, some even printing pairing suggestions on back wine labels. Food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.|$|E
25|$|Some smoking {{restrictions}} {{were introduced in}} German hotels, restaurants, and bars in 2008 and early 2009. The <b>restaurant</b> <b>industry</b> has claimed that some businesses in the states which restricted smoking in late 2007 (Lower Saxony, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, and Hessen) experienced reduced profits. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) claimed that the smoking ban deterred people from {{going out for a}} drink or meal, stating that 15% of establishments that adopted a ban in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50%. However, a study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) finds negative impacts on revenues, if any, only in the very short run. In the medium and long run, a recovery of revenues took place. These results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers. Smoking is not permitted in any public transit or in or around railway stations except for the locations expressly indicated for smoking. Smoking on trains was banned completely by the Deutsche Bahn AG in 2007. Smoking has been restricted in airports and all Lufthansa planes since the late 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The BLT {{became popular}} after World War II {{because of the}} rapid {{expansion}} of supermarkets, which allowed ingredients to be available year-round. The initials, representing [...] "bacon, lettuce, tomato", likely began in the American <b>restaurant</b> <b>industry</b> as shorthand for the sandwich, but it is unclear when this transferred to the public consciousness. For example, a 1951 edition of the Saturday Evening Post makes reference to the sandwich, although it does not use its initials, describing a scene in which: [...] "On the tray, invariably, are a bowl of soup, a toasted sandwich of bacon, lettuce and tomato, and a chocolate milk shake." ...|$|E

500|$|The latest {{chapter in}} the company's {{ownership}} history began in September 2010 when TPG and its partners announced it would sell their 31 percent stake in Burger King to another private equity company, 3G Capital, for $24 per share, or [...] Between March 2004 and March 2009, the company experienced a score of consecutive profitable quarters that were credited with re-energizing the company, however with the slowing of the economy during the financial crisis of 2007-2010 the company's business has declined while its immediate competitor McDonald's grew. Analysts, including John Glass of Morgan Stanley and David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird & Co., part {{of the reasons for}} the company's slowed performance is its continue reliance on the super fan. Market-research firm Sandelman & Associates reported that this segment had seen a decline in visits by this demographic group by more than 50 percent during the recession, while <b>restaurant</b> <b>industry</b> analyst Bonnie Riggs at market-research firm NPD Group reported the 18â€“24 transferred much of its business from the fast food segment to the fast casual segment, compounding the decline.|$|E
500|$|To {{appeal to}} the adult market, BK offers several {{sandwiches}} and other products made with higher-quality ingredients such as whole-breast chicken fillets, Angus beef, and other [...] "premium" [...] ingredients. These sandwiches are usually served on a better-quality roll, such as baguettes or corn-dusted potato rolls. Through 2009 and 2010, the company added other higher-end product such as barbecued ribs, grilled fish, an improved grilled chicken sandwich, kebabs, and an extra-thick burger called the Steakhouse XT. Several industry publications claimed that these new offerings disrupt the differentiation between the fast-food and casual-dining markets {{with a combination of}} taste, competitive pricing, speed of service, and convenience. The adult-oriented products of Burger King and its competitors have been criticized by <b>restaurant</b> <b>industry</b> commentators as a temporary blip. The [...] "indulgent" [...] products are seen as blurring the lines between the fast-food and casual-dining market segments and, while they draw in newer customers looking for value, the effect may only be temporary. Once the economic instabilities of the late-2000s recession fade, customers may return to such casual chains as Chili's and leave the fast food chains back where they started in terms of customer numbers and profits.|$|E
500|$|The {{company is}} not above {{following}} trends within the fast food and fast casual industry; two of examples {{of this can be}} seen in some of its former products. The company's first wrap product, called a BK Wrapper, was introduced in North America as a breakfast option in April 2008, with a lunch/dinner version offered in September 2008. These products were in response to industry trends towards products that are easier to consume on the go, and to trends that began in 2007 regarding smaller foods. Originally a limited time offer, the lunch/dinner version of this product was sold as a regional item through late 2009, when they were eliminated due to weakening sales. The 2009 introduction of BK Burger Shots, Burger King's version of sliders, was part of a wider trend in the <b>restaurant</b> <b>industry</b> for this type of sandwich. European locations sell them as the BK Six Pack. The variation sold in the UK and Ireland is called the Angus 6 Pack; it is six small burgers that are attached together. In the United States they are based on the Burger Bundles/Burger Buddies products of the 1980s, which were originally inspired by the similar products sold at White Castle and Krystal, ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between the presence of the Arts (the arts, and museums) and Entertainment (Sports) industries and the core of the hospitality industry, being hotels and restaurants, in Sweden.

This has been tested by multiple regression models and results do not reject the first hypothesis of the study which is the positive relationship between the development of Entertainment and Art industries and the growth of â€˜Hotels with restaurant, except conference centersâ€™. Nevertheless, only in the model which the dummy variables are applied does the museum industry fail to show any significant relationship for both, the years 2002 and 2010. The results regarding the second hypothesis expressed the growth of sport and art industries and how they are positively significantly associated with the growth of â€˜Restaurantsâ€™ but affirmed that the museum industry has no considerable association. The results do not also reject the third hypothesis. However the growth of hotel and <b>restaurant</b> <b>industries</b> is not strongly related to the growth of museum industry in one model pertaining to the year 2010...|$|R
