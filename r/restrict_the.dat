40|$|AbstractIn {{a series}} of papers, we have {{classified}} the complexity of list homomorphism problems. Here, we investigate <b>the</b> effect of <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> degrees of the input graphs. It {{turns out that the}} complexity does not change (except when the degree bound is two). We obtain similar results on <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> size of the lists. We contrast these results with facts about variants of the list homomorphism problem, where <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> degrees can have an important effect on the complexity...|$|R

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males compete {{for access to}} females. Such competition can {{take the form of}} fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or <b>restrict</b> <b>the</b> movement of a female for weeks at a time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{compensatory}} sweating after lowering or <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> {{level of}} sympathectomy. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted of all randomized controlled trials published in English that compared compensatory sweating after lowering or <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> level of sympathectomy. The Cochrane collaboration tool {{was used to}} assess the risk of bias, and the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio method was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 11 randomized controlled trials were included, including a total of 1079 patients. Five of the randomized controlled trials studied <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> level of sympathectomy, and the remaining six studied lowering the level of sympathectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The compiled randomized controlled trial results published so far in the literature do not support the claims that lowering or <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> level of sympathetic ablation results in less compensatory sweating...|$|R
5|$|For {{ten hours}} in December 1982, the Washington Monument and eight {{tourists}} were {{held hostage by}} a nuclear arms protester, Norman Mayer, claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument's base. U.S. Park Police shot and killed Mayer. The monument was undamaged in the incident, and it was discovered later that Mayer did not have explosives. After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to <b>restrict</b> <b>the</b> possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles.|$|E
