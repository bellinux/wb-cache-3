A methodology {{has been developed}} to extract gait parameters including walking speed and step time using Doppler radar. The gait parameters have been validated with a Vicon motion capture system in the lab with 13 participants and 158 test runs. The study revealed that for an op-timal step recognition and walking speed estimation, a dual radar set up with one radar placed at foot level and the other at torso level is necessary. An excellent absolute agreement with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 97 was found for step time estimation with the foot <b>level</b> <b>radar.</b> For walking speed, although both radars show excellent consistency they all have a system offset compared to the ground truth due to walking direction {{with respect to the}} radar beam.

40|$|On <b>radar</b> <b>level</b> gauges {{currently}} shipped by Saab Rosemount, {{some adjustments}} of the unit's parameters {{has to be}} performed in the field. Presently, this is a cumbersome procedure; the operator {{has to be very}} close to the gauge and he either has to carry with him a bulky configuration unit or use a basic control unit on the gauge. A wireless solution, where a portable device and a receiver replace the control unit, would both allow the operator to work from a distance and eliminate the need for the bulky device. The most conspicuous restraint for such a solution is a very low allowed power dissipation. The {{reason for this is that}} some gauges do not have a separate power supply, but are fed directly off the communication bus. A viable solution should also be commercially available and robust enough to operate in an industrial environment. To meet these requirements both a theoretical and a practical assessment was conducted, where the two techniques for wireless communication, IrDA, and Bluetooth, was given special consideration. As for the portable device, the market for hand-held computers was investigated and ultimately a PDA from Palm was selected for this project. Together with this PDA, a prototype for each of the two wireless techniques was tested to ascertain their performance with respect to power dissipation, communication range, and communication robustness. This investigation revealed that Bluetooth could be used over a much greater distance than IrDA and it did also provide a more robust solution overall. IrDA is nonetheless also a competent technique, and has its primary advantage in terms of much lower power dissipation compared to Bluetooth...|$|E
40|$|Time-lapse cross-well radar {{methods can}} be used to {{dynamically}} image the movement of water and contaminants in electrically resistive environments. Previous work has focused on monitoring the movement of saline tracers in fractured bedrock, the infiltration of water in the vadose zone, and the migration of engineered materials injected into wells or trenches for remediation purposes. Although a variety of time-lapse radar imaging methods have been demonstrated, the technology is still in its infancy. Questions remain about the capabilities and limitations of the methods in different environments as well as how such data {{can be used}} to characterize heterogeneous environments, identify preferential flow paths, and constrain flow and transport models. The goal of this thesis is to test the hypothesis that time-lapse radar attenuation-difference tomography {{can be used to}} monitor a saline tracer moving through an unconsolidated, heterogeneous, fluvial aquifer. In August 2001, a team of researchers performed a tracer test and cross-well radar imaging experiment at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS) in an unconfmed aquifer comprised of coarse, fluvial deposits (dominantly cobbles and gravels with varying amounts of sandy matrix). The team injected a potassium bromide tracer into the shallow aquifer and monitored the movement of the plume across the wellfield using fluid conductivity measurements made in six wells and cross-well radar data collected across several planes using two sets of radar antennas with different center frequencies (100 and 250 MHz). I perform time-lapse imaging in two planes, B 4 -B 1 and B 4 -B 2, by analyzing the changes in trace energy of the cross-well <b>radar</b> <b>level</b> run and tomographic data. Attenuation-difference tomograms were constructed for the B 4 -Bl and B 4 -B 2 planes using data collected at the same locations but at different times. I compare the spatial and temporal position and concentration variations of the plume as indicated by the fluid conductivity data at well Al (central well) to those suggested by the radar attenuation-difference tomograms in the B 4 -Bl plane (which contains well AI) and find good correlation. The resolution and certainty of the attenuation-difference tomograms varies across the imaging planes. Resolution analysis shows that the regions of highest resolution include the regions through which the tracer plume travels. From the time-lapse level runs and attenuation-difference tomograms for the B 4 -Bl and B 4 -B 2 planes, three preferential flow paths were identified between the injection well (B 3) and the withdrawal well (B 6); these flow paths are horizontal and located at 10. 5 - 12 m, 12 - 13 m, and 13 - 15. 5 m depth. I use the fluid conductivity data and attenuation-difference tomograms to identify breakthrough curve characteristics which describe the transport of the tracer plume through {{the central part of the}} BHRS; these characteristics include times, depths, and values of maximum changes in attenuation coefficients (inferred maximum tracer concentration). Finally, a method for converting the attenuation-difference tomograms to maps of bromide concentration in the imaging planes is demonstrated. The results of this study show that time-lapse cross-well radar methods can be used to: (a) monitor the movement of saline water in coarse, fluvial deposits; (b) identify preferential flow paths; and (c) estimate parameter values that can be used to constrain flow and transport models...|$|E

The information generated by such a remote sensing system is intended for use by the entire aviation community, including flight crews. air traffic controllers. airline dispatchers, and aviation weather forecasters. The remote sensing system must be capable of remotely measuring temperature and liquid water content (LWC), and indicating the presence of super-cooled large droplets (SLD). Technologies examined include Profiling Microwave Radiometer, Dual-Band Radar, Multi-Band Radar, Ka-Band Radar. Polarized Ka-Band Radar, and Multiple Field of View (MFOV) Lidar. The assessment of these systems took place primarily during the Mt. Washington Icing Sensors Project (MWISP) in April 1999 and the Alliance Icing Research Study (AIRS) from November 1999 to February 2000. A discussion of the various sensing technologies is included. The result of the assessment is that no one sensing technology can satisfy all of the stated project goals. Therefore a proposed system includes radiometry and Ka-band radar. A multilevel approach is proposed to allow the future selection of the fielded system based upon required capability and available funding. The most basic level system would be the least capable and least expensive. The next level would increase capability and cost, and the highest level would be the most capable and most expensive to field. The Level 1 system would consist of a Profiling Microwave Radiometer.

In this letter, a novel Doppler radar technique is presented for accurate tracking of large-scale displacement of several carrier wavelengths, e. g., the water level variation. The DC-coupled architecture is used to ensure precise measurement of slow motions even with stationary moment. A novel signal processing approach is proposed to in-crease the demodulation linearity to deal with inconstant signal amplitude, dynamic dc offset and phase ambiguity in large-scale displacement tracking. Experiments have been carried out in the outdoor environment to monitor the relative water level position in a rain barrel when the water was pumped in or drained out. It is shown that the proposed technique can accurately gauge the relative water level variation of 3. 5 wavelengths with mm accuracy.
