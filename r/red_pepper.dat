25|$|Although shorter {{swords and}} daggers were used, the katana was {{probably}} the ninja's weapon of choice, and was sometimes carried on the back. The katana had several uses beyond normal combat. In dark places, the scabbard could be extended out of the sword, and used as a long probing device. The sword could also be laid against the wall, where the ninja could use the sword guard (tsuba) to gain a higher foothold. The katana could even {{be used as a}} device to stun enemies before attacking them, by putting a combination of <b>red</b> <b>pepper,</b> dirt or dust, and iron filings into the area {{near the top of the}} scabbard, so that as the sword was drawn the concoction would fly into the enemy's eyes, stunning him until a lethal blow could be made. While straight swords were used before the invention of the katana, the straight ninjatō has no historical precedent and is likely a modern invention.|$|E
