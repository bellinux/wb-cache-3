5|$|B.menziesiis inflorescences {{resemble}} those of no other banksia; its closest relatives were felt by George to be B.speciosa (showy banksia) and B.baxteri (bird's nest banksia), which differs from B.menziesii in having yellow flowers and leaves with deep triangular lobes. In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> be {{the members of the}} series Crocinae.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increasing}} trend of decreased fertility rate, {{there has been an}} increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> depend on in times of need. Because of this phenomenon, families do not have an extended family to depend on when they need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work, and must turn to market substitutes or a member of the immediate family doing both domestic and paid work instead.|$|E

5|$|George placed B.epica in B.subg. Banksia, {{because its}} inflorescences are typical Banksia flower spikes; B.sect. Banksia {{because of its}} {{straight}} styles; and B.ser. Cyrtostylis because it has slender flowers. He considered its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> be B.praemorsa (cut-leaf banksia) and B.media, {{both of which have}} shorter flowers and smaller pollen-presenters than B.epica. In addition, B.praemorsa differs in having a hairless perianth, and B.media has larger, more undulate leaves.|$|E

5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people {{began to wonder if}} he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history at the age of 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio Leti's Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to {{make their}} Nephews Powerful (1667) {{is one example of}} {{contemporary}} criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having all of his publications on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church. According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate their <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> the College of Cardinals due to their distrust of the crown-cardinals, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{species that}} are genetically {{compatible}} may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in pollinators. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that {{have some of the}} characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.|$|E
5|$|Stegosaurus was the first-named genus of {{the family}} Stegosauridae. It is the type genus that gives {{its name to the}} family. The Stegosauridae are one of two {{families}} within the infraorder Stegosauria, with the other being the Huayangosauridae. The infraorder Stegosauria lies within the Thyreophora, or armored dinosaurs, a suborder which also includes the more diverse ankylosaurs. The stegosaurs were a clade of animals similar in appearance, posture, and shape that mainly differed in their array of spikes and plates. Among the closest <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> Stegosaurus are Wuerhosaurus from China and Kentrosaurus from East Africa.|$|E

5|$|The Kalam {{people of}} New Guinea {{highlands}} called it konmayd, and deemed {{it a good}} bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, {{then there would be}} good crops. It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. It may also be the manifestation of the ghost of paternal <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> the Kalam. Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.|$|E
5|$|When Rasputin {{was murdered}} in December 1916, Victoria and Kirill signed a letter along with other {{relatives}} asking the Tsar to show leniency to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, one of those implicated in the murder. The Tsar denied their request. Twice during the war Victoria visited Romania, where her sister Marie was now queen, volunteering aid for war victims. Victoria returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1917. Kirill had been appointed commander of the Naval Guards, quartered in Saint Petersburg, {{so he could be}} with his family for some time. Although publicly loyal to the Tsar, Victoria and Kirill began to meet in private with other <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> discuss the best way to save the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|A devout Buddhist from youth, {{once her}} {{children}} {{had grown up}} Ho decided to serve the Buddhist cause, and to dedicate {{the rest of her}} life to caring for others. In 1958, she became a Buddhist nun at the age of 50. In 1969, aged 61, Ho bought a two-storey detached house in Richards Avenue with her savings, and turned it into the Man Fut Tong Old Peoples' Home for aged sick and single elderly women. Most of the 20 or so residents had neither enough earnings to support themselves nor any <b>relatives</b> <b>to</b> turn to. To raise additional funds for the home, she cultivated and sold prize-winning white orchids at Tanglin, and vegetarian food at Kong Meng San Temple in Bishan. She cleaned, cooked, took her charges to the doctors, helped them to collect their social benefits and even sometimes saw to their last rites.|$|E
