40|$|This paper {{provides}} a unifying framework for studying <b>renegotiation</b> of contracts {{in the presence}} of asymmetric information. We show that interim <b>renegotiation</b> does not constrain the set of contracts attainable with full commitment, regardless of whether <b>renegotiation</b> offers are made by the informed or the uninformed agent. Ex post <b>renegotiation,</b> however, does constrain the set of attainable contracts. These constraints depend on the identity of the agent making the <b>renegotiation</b> offer. We then show how the theory of contract <b>renegotiation</b> can provide insights for organization theory. Specifically, we show how decentralization of decision making can be an optimal response to the threat of ex post <b>renegotiation.</b> Finally, we show that our framework can be used to analyse the trade-off between internal and external markets. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examine the}} effects of <b>renegotiation</b> in an agency relationship. They show how <b>renegotiation</b> affects (1) the set of actions the {{principal}} can induce the agent to take and (2) the cost of implementing a given action. The authors show that, when the principal receives an unverifiable signal of the agent's action, <b>renegotiation</b> can improve welfare. This result stands in contrast to earlier findings that <b>renegotiation</b> lowers welfare when the principal receives no signal about the agent's action prior to <b>renegotiation.</b> Copyright 1991 by The Econometric Society. ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{contracting}} {{and costly}} <b>renegotiation</b> in settings of complete but unverifiable information, using the mechanism-design approach. We show how <b>renegotiation</b> activity is best modelled in {{the fundamentals of}} the mechanismdesign framework, so that noncontractibility of <b>renegotiation</b> amounts to a constraint on the problem. We formalize and clarify the Renegotiation-Proofness Principle (RPP), which states that any state-contingent payoff vector that is implementable in an environment with <b>renegotiation</b> can also be implemented by a mechanism in which <b>renegotiation</b> does not occur in equilibrium. We observe that the RPP is not generally valid. However, we prove a general monotonicity result that confirms the RPP’s “renegotiation is bad ” message. Our monotonicity theorem establishes that the set of implementable state-contingent payoffs increases with the costs of <b>renegotiation.</b> ...|$|R

The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode. Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least-paid cast member, meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced. The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest paid TV actresses of all-time.

40|$|<b>Renegotiation</b> and {{conflict}} resolution are studied in relational contracting under subjective evaluation. <b>Renegotiation</b> has three effects. First, it makes the incentive pay scheme low powered: the maximum variation of compensation across performance levels is compressed and the contract is less extreme compared to the case without <b>renegotiation.</b> This effect is stronger when the players are less patient. Second, <b>renegotiation</b> typically renders termination impossible; the contract relies on a “low morale ” mechanism to enforce mutual cooperation.

40|$|A debt {{contract}} {{usually does}} not include a provision about <b>renegotiation.</b> The right to seize the borrowers asset and the rules of this process are usually stipulated in the contract. Such a promise not to renegotiate is not credible since <b>renegotiation</b> can mitigate the dead-weight loss of liquidating insolvent borrowers. Once the initial contract may not consider the <b>renegotiation</b> procedure and <b>renegotiation</b> may occur, this paper investigates why a complete contract is not offered. It shows that the lender {{does not need to}} stipulate the <b>renegotiation</b> procedure on the initial contract because he is indifferent about committing or not to the terms of a contract. This indicates that a complete contract gives the lender the same expected return as an incomplete contract, in which the <b>renegotiation</b> process is determined after the occurrence of default...|$|R

40|$|Amanufacturer writes supply {{contracts}} with N buyers. Then, the buyers invest in innovation, and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the {{supply contracts}} {{to achieve an}} efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation damages) affects how the firms share the gain from <b>renegotiation,</b> and hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The firms may also engage in <b>renegotiation</b> design, inserting simple clauses into the supply contract to shape the outcome of <b>renegotiation.</b> For example, when a buyer grants a financial "hostage" to the manufacturer or is charged a per diem penalty for delay in bargaining, the manufacturer captures the gain from <b>renegotiation.</b> "Tradable options," which grant buyers the right to trade capacity without intervention from the manufacturer, return the gain from <b>renegotiation</b> to the buyers. This paper proves that, under surprisingly general conditions, the firms can coordinate their investments with the simplest of supply contracts (fixed-quantity contracts). This may require <b>renegotiation</b> design, and certainly requires that the firms understand the breach remedy and set their contract parameters accordingly. <b>renegotiation,</b> bargaining, contract manufacturing, capacity pooling and allocation, <b>renegotiation</b> design...|$|R

40|$|After {{entering}} into supply contracts, firms often later renegotiate {{the terms of}} those contracts. For example, firms that obtain market demand information after signing supply contracts may benefit by renegotiating the contracts to allow buyers facing poor market conditions to purchase less than their contractual commitment and allowing buyers facing favorable conditions to purchase more. Consider a setting in which two buyers invest in innovation (product development, marketing) and obtain supply from a single manufacturer through quantity ‡exibility contracts, which specify the minimum quantity the manufacturer must supply and the minimum quantity the buyer must purchase. The potential for <b>renegotiation</b> of the supply contracts {{has important implications for}} the way firms make investments in innovation and capacity, the way capacity is allocated, and the resulting profits of firms. We provide clear conditions under which the potential for <b>renegotiation</b> stimulates or retards innovation. <b>Renegotiation</b> can greatly increase system profit, provided that contracts are designed to anticipate <b>renegotiation.</b> Anticipating the possibility of <b>renegotiation</b> significantly impacts how contracts should be designed: Failing to anticipate <b>renegotiation</b> typically leads to contracts that contain far too much flexibility. Such contracts perform poorly relative to contracts designed to anticipate <b>renegotiation.</b> Finally, employing tradable options can lead to even greater system profit than optimal quantity flexibility contracts that anticipate <b>renegotiation...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} concept of weak renegotiation-proof {{equilibrium}} (WRP) to allow for costly <b>renegotiation</b> and shows that even small <b>renegotiation</b> costs can have dramatic effects {{on the set of}} equilibria. More specifically, the paper analyzes the infinitely repeated Bertrand game. It is shown that for every level of <b>renegotiation</b> cost there exists a discount factor such that any collusive profit can be supported as an equilibrium outcome. Hence, any arbitrary small <b>renegotiation</b> cost will suffice to facilitate collusive outcomes for sufficiently patient firms. This result stands {{in stark contrast to the}} unique pure-strategy WRP equilibrium without <b>renegotiation</b> costs, which implies marginal-cost pricing in every period. Moreover, in comparison to the findings of McCutcheon (1997), who states that <b>renegotiation</b> costs have to be substantial to facilitate collusion, this result points to a quite different conclusion.

LaRosa, who had to be told what the phrase [...] "swan song" [...] meant, was dumbfounded, since he had not been informed beforehand of his departure and contract <b>renegotiations</b> had yet to happen. In perhaps a further illumination of the ego that Godfrey had formerly kept hidden, radio historian Gerald Nachman, in Raised on Radio, claims that what really miffed Godfrey about his now-former protege was that LaRosa's fan mail had come to outnumber Godfrey's. It is likely that a combination of these factors led to Godfrey's decision to discharge LaRosa. It is not likely Godfrey expected the public outcry that ensued, a result of the incident running directly counter to Godfrey's avuncular image.|$|E

40|$|Consider a {{contract}} between two players, describing the payment an agent obtains from the principal, {{in exchange for}} a good or service supplied.

The Times has raised the possibility that RAF production aircraft will be diverted as early Saudi Arabian aircraft, with the service forced to wait for its full complement of aircraft. This arrangement would mirror the diversion of RAF Tornados to the RSAF. The Times has also reported that such an arrangement will make the UK purchase of its Tranche 3 commitments more likely.

40|$|Contracts adopted with later <b>renegotiation</b> in mind {{may take}} simple forms. In a {{principal}}-agent model, if <b>renegotiation</b> may occur after the agent chooses efforet, the principal protects against unfavorable <b>renegotiation</b> by "selling the project" to the agent via a sales contract. If only singleton (single-scheme) contracts are feasible, the equilibrium initial contract {{must be a}} sales contract if the principal's <b>renegotiation</b> position will be inherently inferior {{in the sense that}} (a) the agent will have the bargianing power; (b) the principal will not observe the agent's effort, and (c) the agent has the talent, i. e. a rich set of feasible efforts, to exploint contractual nuances. <b>Renegotiation</b> necessarily occurs, and it yields (second-best) efficient allocations. Even when meny (multiple-scheme) contracts are available, if the selection of a scheme from a menu entails any cost, then the final contract is a singleton and equilibrium <b>renegotiation</b> occurs.
