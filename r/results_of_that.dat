25|$|During the WFM's {{first major}} strike in Cripple Creek {{just two years}} earlier, Colorado Governor Waite, a Populist, called out the Colorado National Guard to protect strikers. This action, and the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> strike, {{encouraged}} working class support for Populists. However, the fear of union militancy, and particularly a negative reaction to the WFM's successful Cripple Creek strike, helped to sweep Populists from power. Subsequently, the hostility of both Democratic and Republican officials during the Leadville strike caused some workers to distrust both major parties.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on speed and agility is a {{defining characteristic of}} taekwondo and has its origins in analyses undertaken by Choi Hong Hi. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> analysis are known by ITF practitioners as Choi's Theory of Power. Choi based his understanding of power on biomechanics and Newtonian physics as well as Chinese martial arts. For example, Choi observed {{that the power of}} a strike increases quadratically with the speed of the strike, but increases only linearly with the mass of the striking object. In other words, speed is more important than size in terms of generating power. This principle was incorporated into the early design of taekwondo and is still used.|$|E
25|$|The moon {{jellyfish}} {{were identified}} as Aurelia aurita by Hamner. However, since the release of that report in 1981, genetic testing {{has been done on}} specimens of Aurelia collected from locations throughout the world. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> testing indicate in addition to the three named species of Aurelia there are at least six other cryptic species in the Aurelia genus. Three of the cryptic species identified were from Palau. One of these cryptic species is common to four of Palau's marine lakes with jellyfish populations including Jellyfish Lake. Hence, the most accurate designation for the moon jellyfish in Jellyfish Lake (as of February 2001) is Aurelia sp. Despite the close proximity of Palau's moon jellyfish cryptic species, Dawson and Jacobs stated that the molecular data suggested that they had not interbred for millions of years.|$|E

A lawyer for a DPD candidate stated {{that all but}} two of the political parties accepted the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> election in the province of Papua. On 11 June, the Court ordered the General Election Commission to revise its calculations for allocating seats in the DPR on grounds that the Commission has misinterpreted its own regulations. Though the Commission initially refused to abide by the Court's ruling, it reversed its decision less than 24 hours later but would not begin work on the revision before 24 June. As many as 16 candidates who have been declared as victors in their respective districts could lose their seats, including DPR Speaker Agung Laksono.|$|E
500|$|In early 2002, Portland Aerial Transportation, Inc. (PATI) {{was formed}} as a {{non-profit}} board. One of its first public actions was to request the Portland Bureau of Transportation (at the time known as the Portland Office of Transportation, and abbreviated as PDOTsic) to undertake an independent analysis of the connectivity options considered earlier by the university and its development supporters. In May 2002, the city council accepted PDOT's process proposal and also accepted PATI as the project sponsor. PDOT's assessment led {{to the same conclusion}} OHSU had reached earlier: an aerial tram was the preferred approach. PDOT also recommended a second tram linking the Marquam Hill area with a nearby transit center on SW Barbur Boulevard. [...] In July 2002, the city council accepted PDOT's recommendations and asked PDOT and PATI to proceed to the design phase, including a design competition. Both were also asked to work with residents of the affected neighborhoods to identify ways to mitigate the tram's impact and identify other desired neighborhood improvements which should accompany the project. One of the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> process was the Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge, which was completed mid-2012.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} {{the release}} of the game's first four {{versions}} for cartridge-based console systems (Sega's Genesis and Game Gear and Nintendo's SNES and Game Boy), dubbed [...] "Mortal Friday" [...] (September 9, 1994), an unprecedented number of more than 2.5 million copies were shipped to be distributed, with the best opening-week sales in video game history at that point. Acclaim's analysts expected that the number of copies sold would reach at least 2.5 million within the first few weeks of release (at an average retail price of $60) and the sales to top $150 million by end of the year. First-week sales of over $50 million surpassed the initial box office <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> season's Hollywood film blockbusters, such as Forrest Gump, True Lies, The Mask and The Lion King. Mortal Kombat II became the world's best-selling video game (until it was eclipsed by Donkey Kong Country, released in November 1994) and the Genesis version sold 1.78 million copies in the United States alone, along with an additional 1.51 million American copies of the game for the SNES. By 2002, estimated gross sales of Mortal Kombat II home video games exceeded $400 million. Re-released in 2007, the PSN version has continued to occupy the service's top ten monthly sales chart nearly three years later in February 2010.|$|E

500|$|Rathbun's 1992 arrest {{caught the}} {{attention}} of her friend Donald Abrams, clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and a physician at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). He was in Amsterdam attending an AIDS conference when he learned of Rathbun's arrest by way of CNN. [...] Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies read about Rathbun's arrest in the newspaper. [...] He {{sent a letter to the}} AIDS program at SFGH proposing that [...] "Brownie Mary's institution" [...] should consider conducting clinical trials of cannabis on the wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Inspired by Rathbun's arrest, Abrams and Doblin collaborated to develop a protocol to test the effects of cannabis on appetite and body weight. Five years later, after two of their proposed studies were rejected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), their third research protocol, [...] "Short-Term Effects of Cannabinoids in Patients with HIV-1 Infection", was finally approved in 1997. [...] The study was funded with $978,000 from the National Institutes of Health with cannabis supplied by NIDA., DEA. : [...] "The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> study were extremely promising and I think very surprising to NIDA in that we, one of the common concerns that NIDA had put forth was that we know that marijuana hurts the immune system, how could you possibly talk about using marijuana with people who are immuno-compromised? [...] And what Dr. Abrams found is that marijuana did not hurt the immune system, did not increase viral load, did not negatively interact with the protease inhibitors and actually did facilitate, increase caloric intake as well as weight gain, and also oral THC was included in this study as well as a placebo." ...|$|E
