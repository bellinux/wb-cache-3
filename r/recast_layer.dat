50|$|The {{processes}} that affect surface integrity can be conveniently broken up into three classes: traditional processes, non-traditional processes, and finishing treatments. Traditional processes {{are defined as}} processes where the tool contacts the workpiece surface; for example: grinding, turning, and machining. These processes will only damage the surface integrity if the improper parameters are used, such as dull tools, too high feed speeds, improper coolant or lubrication, or incorrect grinding wheel hardness. Nontraditional processes are defined as processes where the tool does not contact the workpiece; examples {{of this type of}} process include EDM, electrochemical machining, and chemical milling. These processes will produce different surface integrity depending on how the processes are controlled; for instance, they can leave a stress-free surface, a remelted surface, or excessive surface roughness. Finishing treatments are defined as {{processes that}} negate surface finishes imparted by traditional and non-traditional processes or improve the surface integrity. For example, compressive residual stress can be enhanced via peening or roller burnishing or the <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> left by EDMing can be removed via chemical milling.|$|E
5000|$|In wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the x-y plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z-u-v axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in x-y-u-v-i-j-k-l-. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to 0.004 mm, and can have a cutting path or kerf as small as 0.021 mm using Ø 0.02 mm wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is 0.335 mm using Ø 0.25 mm brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This [...] "overcut" [...] is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as [...] and the geometry precision is not far from ± [...] The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing {{is an important factor in}} determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.|$|E

The non-traditional manufacturing process of wire-electrical discharge machining (EDM) possesses many advantages over traditional machining during the manufacture of Inconel 718 parts. However, certain detrimental effects are also present. The top layer of the machined surface is melted and resolidified to form {{what is known as}} the <b>recast</b> <b>layer.</b> This layer demonstrates microstructural differences from the bulk workpiece, resulting in altered material properties. An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the main machining parameters which contribute to <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> formation in wire-EDM of Inconel 718. It was found that average <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> thickness increased with energy per spark, peak discharge current, current pulse duration, and open-voltage time and decreased with sparking frequency and table feed rate. Over the range of parameters tested, the <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> was observed to be between 5 and 10 μm in average thickness, although highly variable in nature. Surface roughness of the cut parts showed an increase with energy per spark. Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) revealed the <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> to be alloyed with elements from the wire electrode.

Outdated or coarse EDM processing methods can reduce the fatigue strength of titanium alloy Ti– 6 Al– 4 V by as much as factors of 2 – 5, but a paucity of fatigue data exists for this important aerospace alloy processed with modern EDM techniques. An experimental study is presented in which the degradation of fatigue strength of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V due to improved EDM processing is measured in axial tension at a load ratio of R= 0. 1.

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays alumina ceramic {{substrates}} {{are widely}} used for high precision applications in electronic devices, such as hybrid integrated circuits (HIC). Usually, the alumina ceramic substrates are shaped through tape casting method and sintered in continuous slab kilns. The sintering aids used to enhance densification during sintering give rise {{to the formation of}} an alumino-silicate liquid phase, which is of crucial importance in pressureless and low-temperature sintering (< 1600 °C) of alumina ceramics. The preferential migration of liquid phase to the surface of alumina substrates under the capillary action and its transformation into glassy phase during cooling affects the subsequent processing steps of HIC. A smoothening effect on surface with its enrichment in glassy phase is accompanied by a decrease of the surface toughness. On the other hand, the accumulated glassy phase onto the surface has a great effect on laser cutting. The high temperatures developed during laser cutting turn the superficial glassy phase into liquid again, while rapid solidification will occur after removing laser beam. The fast cooling of the liquid phase causes formation of extensive network of cracks on the surface of alumina substrate. Apparently, the presence of such faults degrades mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance of alumina substrates.

However, the surface roughness will not be easily uniform when a complex hole is polished by this method.

Through the present method, it reveals that the shear forces in the polishing process and the flow properties of the medium in AFM play the roles in controlling the roughness on the entire surface. A power law model was firstly set up by utilizing the effect of shear rates on the medium viscosities, and the coefficients of the power law would be found by solving the algebraic equation from {{the relations between the}} shear rates and viscosities. Then the velocities, strain rates and shear forces of the medium acting on the surface would be obtained in the constant pressure by CFD software. Finally, the optimal mold core put into the complex hole could be designed after these simulations. The results show that the shear forces and strain rates change sharply on the entire surface if no mold core is inserted into the complex hole, whereas they hardly make any difference when the core shape is similar to the complex hole.

The lifespan of the components is reduced due to the defects up to a factor of nine. The aim of this work is the further development of the drilling process to increase the metallurgical quality of cooling air holes with remaining constant productivity. The procedure is divided into three steps: First, pulsed fiber laser radiation is used with pulse durations in the range of a few hundred microseconds. Due to the melt dominated ablation of material, a high productivity is achieved. Since the pulse-to-pulse stability and possible repetition rates are higher than by using flashlamp-pumped Nd:YAG laser radiation, holes with a diameter of 500 microns in 5 mm thick stainless steel can be achieved in 1 s with melt layer thicknesses of approximately 50 microns. In the second step ultrashort pulsed laser radiation is used for the first time for drilling of cooling air holes. The ablation of material is evaporation dominated. By determining suitable laser parameters such as repetition rate and average power, a suitable strategy of laser beam deflection as well as a suitable combination of kind and pressure of process gas, nearly defect-free holes can be obtained. The processing time is approximately 150 s. In order to combine the advantages of both drilling processes, in the third step, a hybrid drilling process is developed.

In Chapter 3 factors affecting the quality of electrodes produced on the machine through the process of Wire Electro-Discharge Grinding (WEDG) are investigated. The effects that electrode material, machining strategy and machine accuracy have on the electrode re-generation are studied. Then, in Chapter 4, the effects of process parameters on the resulting surface finish after performing WEDG are investigated in order to identify an optimum processing window. In addition, a method for predicting the resulting surface finish is proposed. In Chapter 5 a comparative study is carried out to investigate the effects of material microstructure refinement on the resulting surface integrity of samples machined by Micro Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (uWEDM). In particular, the process- material interactions on the resulting micro hardness, phase content changes, Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), surface roughness, micro cracks, <b>recast</b> <b>layers</b> formation, Material Removal Rate (MRR) and element spectrum after both rough and finishing uWEDM cuts are studied. Finally, in Chapter 6 the main contributions to knowledge as a result of the carried out research are presented. They can be summarised as follows: The choice of electrode material used when applying the process of WEDG has a significant effect on achievable aspect ratio and surface roughness. The application of specially developed dressing strategies has a major impact on the quality of the electrode. Due to the inherent process errors related to machine accuracy and repeatability of the WEDG process, specialised 'adaptive control' systems need to be developed and implemented to increase the process accuracy. Technological parameters that are optimised for conventional juWEDM are not directly applicable for use with the WEDG process as they do not provide comparable results in respect to surface finish. The application of inductive learning algorithms is a simple and cost-effective method for identifying patterns in the process behaviour and thus to create models for on-the-machine prediction of the surface roughness. Material microstructure refinement does not only provide superior mechanical properties to workpiece materials but also leads to favourable machining 'footprints' during uWEDM machining and a lower surface roughness. Surface contamination due to the alloying of the tool electrode with the workpiece material is always present regardless of material microstructure, and thus can limit the application areas of this technology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicroholes for {{gasoline}} direct injection (GDI) nozzles were obtained in martensitic stainless steel AISI 440 C with conventional micro-EDM and two laser based processes: water-jet guided μs-laser and fs-laser. Since the analyzed drilling methods heavily differ for their thermal input on materials, the three processes were compared {{from the perspective of}} the microstructural changes induced in the bulk material after drilling. Moreover, the sharpness of the edges was taken into account as distinctive feature for a comparison among the three processes, being the spray atomization maximized by a cavitation process inside the microhole. A tailored procedure was optimized to prepare the samples for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and metallographic analyses. The cross sections of micro-EDM drilled samples revealed the presence of a <b>recast</b> (white) <b>layer</b> of 1 - 2 μm in thickness even using the lowest spark energy in the tested range. Samples drilled by water-jet guided μs-laser are affected by the same phenomenon, with an even more pronounced effect. Moreover, they showed the extrusion of the melt material along the hole axis under the action of the water-jet conveying the beam. The extremely fast cooling of this layer also makes the machined surfaces prone to cracking. Conversely, metallographic analysis of cross sections of ultrashort pulsed laser drilled samples, showed no modification of the base metal microstructure in the sub-surface regions, thus testifying that the fs-pulsed laser drilling was an almost pure ablation process and not affected by a remarkable liquid phase as for the other two thermal processes. Periodicity and dimensions of laser induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) generated by ultrashort pulsed laser were characterized by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy. SEM analysis of the microhole edges revealed burrs for the water-jet guided μs-laser while radii of 3 - 4 μm for micro-EDM and less than 1 μm for fs-lasers were measured...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is {{the most}} widely used non {{conventional}} machining process for removing material from workpiece by means of a series of repeated electric discharges. Electrical Discharge milling (ED-milling) is an emerging technology where a cylindrical tool electrode follows a programmed path in order to obtain the desired shape of a part. During machining of metals by EDM process, a large amount of heat is generated for which the surface characteristics of the metals are affected. This phenomenon is unavoidable but this can be controlled by suitable selection of the process parameters. Though in most of the cases only electrical parameters are chosen but non electrical parameters also play significant role in the area of surface integrity of the machined surface. The present study emphasized to establish a comprehensive analysis of surface integrity, including the micro cracks, <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> thickness and material migration by combining both electrical and non electrical process parameters under a wide range of machining condition. Approach: In this research, experiment was designed by using design expert software (DOE). Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used for designing the experiment. The process parameters varied {{in the present study were}} the rotational speed of the electrode (N), Voltage (V) and feed rate (f). Stainless steel AISI 304 was chosen as work material while a copper electrode was used for EDM milling operation. The EDM milling operations were performed on EDM machine mikrotools integrated multi process machine tools DT 110. In this research, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the effect of machining parameters on <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> thickness, micro cracks on the machined surface as well as the percentage of material migration on the workpiece surface. Results: Electrode rotation reduces <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> thickness of about 16. 58 % than that of stationary electrode with same voltage and feed rate. Moreover, it was observed that migration of C and Cu on the workpiece surface reduces 8. 8 and 60 % respectively when using rotary electrode instead of stationary electrode with same parameters setting. Conclusion: These results indicated that voltage and rotary speed of electrode significantly affect various criteria of surface integrity. Electrode rotation helped to reduce micro cracks, <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> thickness as well as migration of material became less when rotary electrode is used. Besides, the combination of reasonably low voltage and high rpm reduced micro cracks, <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> thickness and minimized the surface contamination on workpiece surface during EDM milling of stainless steel...|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining {{is a very}} accurate non-traditional manufacturing process for creating tiny apertures, complex shapes and geometries within mechanical parts and assemblies. Its performance is evaluated in terms of surface roughness, existence of cracks, voids and <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> {{on the surface of}} product. The high heat generated on the electrically discharged material during the EDM process unfortunately decreases the quality of product. In this paper the high strength and unique electrical and thermal properties of multi-wall carbon nanotubes are used to improve the EDM performance when machining the AISI H 13 tool steel, by means of copper electrodes. Material removal rate, electrode wear rate, surface roughness and <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> were measured in presence of carbon nanotubes in the dielectric, then compared to the outcome of traditional EDM. Experiments show that mixing multi-wall carbon nanotubes within the dielectric makes the EDM more efficient, particularly if machining parameters are set at low pulse of energ...|$|E
40|$|Despite of the {{extensive}} research around spark erosion of ceramics over the last 3 decades, the particular investigation on micro-EDM capabilities in ceramic machining is in the early stage and requires further study [1]. In this work, the micromachining performance of various ceramics, with mechanical properties ranging from high toughness and strength to exceptional hardness and wear resistance, are examined. They include two commercially available materials, a ZrO 2 -TiN ceramic composite and a TiB 2 grade, and an Al 3 O 2 -TiCN lab-scale composite. Experiments were conducted on a SARIX SX- 100 -HPM micro EDM-milling centre in hydrocarbon oil and de-ionized water. WC and brass cylindrical rods, 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 mm in diameter, respectively, were used as the tool electrodes. Negative tool polarity was applied through all experiments. Design of Experiments (DoE) methodologies were employed to systematically investigate {{the influence of the}} machine parameters on the volumetric material removal rate (MRR), relative tool wear (TWR) and surface quality (roughness of the primary profile, Pa). Accordingly, suitable process parameters for the efficient micromachining of the materials at low and medium/high energy conditions could be identified. Similar variation trends to the machining of steel were generally observed; the increasing of the pulse energy leads to higher machining rate, but also to worse surface finishing. The ZrO 2 -TiN and Al 3 O 2 -TiCN composites in oil dielectric provided the most efficient results; the MRR increased up to 0. 3 mm 3 /min {{in the case of the}} zirconia composite at high discharge conditions, the TWR remained below 10 % in both cases, and surface roughness less than 0. 2 m could be achieved by gradually reducing the pulse energy. On the contrary, the TiB 2 shows the worst machining performance with TWR peak of 70 % in oil dielectric and machining rate down to 0. 1 mm 3 /min. Surface roughness less than 0. 35 m were easily achievable on all three materials. As generally comparison against to the processing of Si 3 N 4 –TiN ceramic composite, machining efficiency and tool performance are lower, while the surface quality improves to a large extent [2]. The surface topography and cross section of the EDM samples were inspected with the aid of a SEM; additionally, X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (X-ray EDS) was performed to characterise the chemical composition of the specimens. Melting and evaporation are recognized as the prevailing material removal mechanisms during machining of Zr 2 O 2 -TiN and Al 3 O 2 -TICN ceramic composites; the <b>recast</b> <b>layers</b> are characterized by the formation of regular craters of increasing diameter with the rising of the pulse energy and within the range of ~ 7 - 50 m (Fig. 1). The presence of cracks was also observed, especially in the alumina composite due to the lowest toughness and strength; the cracks propagate parallel to the surface leading to the detachment of large flakes, even at low energy conditions (Fig. 2). With the variation of the type of dielectric and discharge conditions, different material removal mechanisms, including oxidation, melting and spalling, were observed during machining of TiB 2 samples. Oxidation specifically occurs during the process in de-ionized water at short discharge duration; the formation of TiO 2 and B 2 O 3, which evaporates above 1200 °C, give as result an oxygen-rich, and boron-poor, spongy like structure, weekly attached to the bulk. The damage induced is severe and the generation of cracks deeply propagating vertically into the bulk is observed. On the contrary, melting and spalling become predominant during the process in water as the pulse duration and energy increase [3]. Droplets of molten material are visible on the EDM layer; additionally, pieces of material break off from the surface leading to the exposure of the underlying grains (Fig. 3). No material removal mechanisms different from melting and spalling were observed during machining of TiB 2 in oil dielectric. As proof of the strategies developed, various demonstrators were fabricated. As an example, a 6 mm Ø aerodynamic thrust bearing surface was realized in ZrO 2 -TiN (Fig. 4). The component has a 2 D 1 / 2 structure of geometry similar to a compressor; the curved grooves are 15 m deep and 200 m wide at the rounded tip. A layer by layer approach with a depth of cut of 0. 5 m was employed as milling strategy; the component fabrication took approximately 40 minutes. The geometries of all the grooves show very good consistency and geometric accuracy within +/- 2 m. The component is illustrative of the potential applications that can be developed, such as wear resistance moulds and micro machinery components. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Even though laser {{micromachining}} {{has been}} investigated by scientists for years, interest {{of research in the}} field is still increasing. Recent advances in laser technology enabled machining of micro-nano scale structures employing ultrashort pulses, therefore this particular method is applied for wide range of industrial and scientific applications. Current work describes methods for patterning of microstructures employing lasers as well as discusses laser – material interactions and their parameters. Most popular laser systems and their constructions, operation principles, types, methods and applications are reviewed. The main focus is concentrated on micromachining of aluminum oxide ceramics using femtosecond laser pulses. Since micromachining of materials strongly depends on their properties as well as laser beam parameters, a number of experiments were carried out: determination of focal distance, ablation threshold, micromachining quality and defocusing under different ablation rate, energy density, pulse overlap and ablation cycles count were performed. These experiments enabled obtaining optimal laser micromachining parameters which were used for further formation of more complex microstructures. The surface morphology has been analyzed using optical microscope (“OPTIKA”) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) “FEI Quanta 200 FEG”. The depth of microstructures was measured using profilometer (TR 200), computer controlled vertical translation stage ANT 130 - 5 -V (AeroTech) and monitoring CCD camera view of the sample surface trough a 50 x and 0, 42 NA microscope objective (Mitutoyo) of the “FemtoLAB” system. The height of the trenches was obtained by subtracting the translation stage coordinates at the focus of non-ablated surface and the bottom of the ablated crater surfaces respectively. During the experiments optimal height of sample with respect to the lens was obtained where laser beam energy is concentrated into smallest area. The ablation threshold of aluminum oxide ceramics was found to be – 1, 69 J/cm 2. Furthermore, the surface quality after micromachining depends on the pulse overlap and pulse density. Best surface quality was achieved using 84, 4 % pulse overlap and 11, 2 J/cm 2 energy density. Experimentally obtained depth of focus was compared with the theoretical calculations. 9, 5 – 19, 5 µm variation in height between two ablation cycles was selected for further formation of microstructures because using higher values resulted in reduction of surface quality and formation of <b>recast</b> debris <b>layer.</b> Optimal micromachining parameters were used for formation of 3 D pyramids, microfluidic device and scanning acoustic microscope calibration block...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{for the first time}} a general {{multiple}}-input multiple output (MIMO) fuzzy fuzzy-nets framework where the output parameters have different sets of inputs parameters and conflicting rules are generated. This is a significant departure from current fuzzy net approaches which are restricted to only one output. The proposed framework is based on a new model of the rule base architecture and of the predictive algorithm facilitating the resolution of conflicting rules. We demonstrate the application of the new framework for part quality prediction and input process parameter selection in Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) with two part quality characteristics (surface roughness and average <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> thickness) and three input process parameters (pulse-off time, feed rate and voltage); as a result a new technological paradigm for process planning in WEDM has been validated where not only surface roughness (the current situation) but also the average <b>recast</b> <b>layer</b> thickness is optimally planned...|$|E
