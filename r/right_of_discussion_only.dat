40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a collection of}} problems for natural language analysis derived mainly from theoretical linguistics. Most of these problems present major obstacles for computational systems of language interpretation. The set of given sentences can easily be scaled up by introducing more examples per problem. The construction of computational systems could benefit from such a collection, either using it directly for training and testing or {{as a set of}} benchmarks to qualify the performance of a NLP system. 1 Introduction The main part of this paper consists of a collection of problems for semantic analysis of natural language. The problems are arranged in the following way: example sentences concise description of the problem keyword for the type of problem The sources (first appearance in print) of the sentences have been left out, because they are sometimes hard to track and will usually not be of much use, as they indicate a starting-point <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>only.</b> The keywords howeve [...] ...|$|R

Chapter 2 ("History of the Present and the Presence of History: Traffic in Symbols, Knowledge, and Experience") focuses on three writers. Poet Fowziyha Abu-Khalid, is interested in the relationship of literature and religion. She believes [...] "that the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> and <b>of</b> participation in discourse should be accorded to everybody." [...] Change, she believes, depends on the masses, not intellectuals. Ruqayya Ash-Shabib, best known as a short story writer, focuses on ordinary women who profoundly changed history. Two examples are Sheherazade and Balqees, the Queen of Sheba. She believes [...] "that the problem is not male dominance, but rather female submission."

It {{is true that the}} emperor intended it to be a strictly general or truly ecumenical council, at which the Protestants should have a fair hearing. He secured, during the council's second period, 1551–1553, an invitation, twice given, to the Protestants to be present and the council issued a letter of safe conduct (thirteenth session) and offered them the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>discussion,</b> but denied them a vote. Melanchthon and Johannes Brenz, with some other German Lutherans, actually started in 1552 on the journey to Trento. Brenz offered a confession and Melanchthon, who got no farther than Nuremberg, took with him the Confessio Saxonica. But the refusal to give the Protestants the right to vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.|$|R

And what else?) {{to a group of}} K- 12 teachers {{in the context of a}} professional development program and how we have come to interpret the events and knowledge. In that paper, we illustrate how participants used a number of interpretive devices and metaphors to explain multiplication, unpacked the program of studies and explore strategies for linking multiplication across the K- 12 school curriculum. Two years later while working with members of this same cohort but this time on subtraction and division we initiated a conversation by asking the participants what metaphors and ways of thinking about subtraction and division did they use in their teaching. The examples were few and slow in coming. 1 However, a couple of metaphors were raised: subtraction as the opposite of addition; the difference between two sets; the differenc...|$|R
