5|$|A special <b>relativistic</b> {{redshift}} formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special <b>relativistic,</b> gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its <b>relativistic</b> mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when <b>relativistic</b> electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{periodic}} law, dubnium should belong to group 5, under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies investigated {{the properties of}} element 105 and found a general agreement with the predictions from {{the periodic}} law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to <b>relativistic</b> effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. (<b>Relativistic</b> effects arise when an object moves on velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.) These properties have remained challenging to measure: studies have only been performed on single atoms; they generally confirm the assignment of dubnium to the position under tantalum in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Although {{francium}} is {{the heaviest}} alkali metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring <b>relativistic</b> effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the <b>relativistic</b> stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to <b>relativistic</b> effects. The <b>relativistic</b> stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. <b>Relativistic</b> effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Francium is also {{predicted}} {{to show some}} differences due to its high atomic weight, causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions {{of the speed of}} light and thus making <b>relativistic</b> effects more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are {{predicted to}} be higher than caesium's due to the <b>relativistic</b> stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low. Thus, contrary to expectation, caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals, not francium. All known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium, such as the first ionisation energy, electron affinity, and anion polarisability, though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values, ignoring that <b>relativistic</b> effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium. Some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity (47.2 kJ/mol) and the enthalpy of dissociation of the Fr2 molecule (42.1 kJ/mol). The CsFr molecule is polarised as Cs+Fr−, showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by <b>relativistic</b> effects than the 6s subshell of caesium. Additionally, francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have significant covalent character, unlike the other alkali metal superoxides, because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{publishing}} the special {{theory of relativity}} in 1905, Einstein started {{thinking about how to}} incorporate gravity into his new <b>relativistic</b> framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a <b>relativistic</b> theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|The {{probable}} {{properties of}} further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium {{have not been}} explored yet as of 2015; in fact, it is suspected {{that they may not}} be able to exist. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, <b>relativistic</b> and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the <b>relativistic</b> and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between <b>relativistic</b> and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from the fact that both elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities, centered at elements 122 (306Ubb) and 164 (482Uhq).|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, oganesson (Og), is not known—it {{may or may not}} be a noble gas. It was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to <b>relativistic</b> effects. On the other hand, if <b>relativistic</b> effects peak in period 7 at element 112, copernicium (as is thought to be the case), oganesson may turn out to be a noble gas after all, albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon. Regardless, oganesson is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E
5|$|Various {{calculations}} {{show that}} hassium {{should be the}} heaviest known group 8 element, consistent with the periodic law. Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of osmium, with a few deviations arising from <b>relativistic</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 <b>relativistic</b> calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their <b>relativistic</b> mass increases significantly.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{building}} on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul Dirac produced {{a model of}} the electron– the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying <b>relativistic</b> and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field. In order to resolve some problems within his <b>relativistic</b> equation, Dirac developed in 1930 {{a model of the}} vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, dubnium is located in group 5 as the third member of the 6d series of transition metals. Limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has demonstrated that dubnium behaves as a typical group 5 element and the heavier homologue to tantalum; however, some deviations from periodic trends occur due to <b>relativistic</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|Interest in copernicium's {{chemistry}} was {{sparked by}} predictions {{that it would}} have the largest <b>relativistic</b> effects in the whole of period7 and group12, and indeed among all 118 known elements. Copernicium has the ground state electron configuration 5f146d107s2 and thus should belong to group12 of the periodic table, according to the Aufbau principle. As such, it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold. Experiments probing the reactivity of copernicium have focused on the adsorption of atoms of element112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures, in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy. Owing to <b>relativistic</b> stabilization of the 7s electrons, copernicium shows radon-like properties. Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes, allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Like other groups, {{the members}} of this family show {{patterns}} in their electron configurations, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior. However, lawrencium is an exception, since its last electron is transferred to the 7p1/2 subshell due to <b>relativistic</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer did {{important}} {{research in}} theoretical astronomy (especially {{as related to}} general relativity and nuclear theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and quantum field theory, including its extension into quantum electrodynamics. The formal mathematics of <b>relativistic</b> quantum mechanics also attracted his attention, although he doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds, which include the neutron, meson and neutron star.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.2g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61g/cm3. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and <b>relativistic</b> effects, although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium {{is expected}} to be around 150pm. Due to the <b>relativistic</b> stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|While {{developing}} general relativity, Einstein became {{confused about}} the gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated {{an argument that}} led him to conclude that a general <b>relativistic</b> field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} a four {{dimensional}} second order antisymmetric tensor is the <b>relativistic</b> angular momentum, which has six components: three are the classical angular momentum, {{and the other three}} are related to the boost of the center of mass of the system. The derivative of the <b>relativistic</b> angular momentum with respect to proper time is the <b>relativistic</b> torque, also second order antisymmetric tensor.|$|E
25|$|Angular {{momentum}} in quantum mechanics differs in many profound respects from angular {{momentum in}} classical mechanics. In <b>relativistic</b> quantum mechanics, it differs even more, {{in which the}} above <b>relativistic</b> definition becomes a tensorial operator.|$|E
25|$|He {{found the}} {{standing}} waves of this <b>relativistic</b> equation, but the <b>relativistic</b> corrections disagreed with Sommerfeld's formula. Discouraged, he put away his calculations and secluded himself {{in an isolated}} mountain cabin in December 1925.|$|E
25|$|The <b>relativistic</b> {{conservation}} law {{for energy}} and momentum replaces the three classical conservation laws for energy, momentum and mass. Mass {{is no longer}} conserved independently, {{because it has been}} subsumed into the total <b>relativistic</b> energy. This makes the <b>relativistic</b> conservation of energy a simpler concept than in nonrelativistic mechanics, because the total energy is conserved without any qualifications. Kinetic energy converted into heat or internal potential energy shows up as an increase in mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiment}} {{observed the}} light produced by <b>relativistic</b> electrons {{in the water}} created by neutrino interactions.

25|$|A {{number of}} sources of error exist due to <b>relativistic</b> effects that would render the system useless if uncorrected. Three <b>relativistic</b> effects are the time dilation, {{gravitational}} frequency shift, and eccentricity effects. Examples include the <b>relativistic</b> time slowing due to {{the speed of the}} satellite of about 1 part in 1010, the gravitational time dilation that makes a satellite run about 5 parts in 1010 faster than an Earth-based clock, and the Sagnac effect due to rotation relative to receivers on Earth. These topics are examined below, one at a time.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{probability}} density now appears as the fourth {{component of a}} <b>relativistic</b> vector and not a simple scalar as in the Schrödinger equation, it {{will be subject to}} the usual effects of the Lorentz transformations such as time dilation. Thus, for example, atomic processes that are observed as rates, will necessarily be adjusted in a way consistent with relativity, while those involving the measurement of energy and momentum, which themselves form a <b>relativistic</b> vector, will undergo parallel adjustment which preserves the <b>relativistic</b> covariance of the observed values.|$|E

25|$|Planck (1906a) {{defined the}} <b>relativistic</b> {{momentum}} {{and gave the}} correct values for the longitudinal and transverse mass by correcting a slight mistake of the expression given by Einstein in 1905. Planck's expressions were in principle equivalent to those used by Lorentz in 1899. Based {{on the work of}} Planck, the concept of <b>relativistic</b> mass was developed by Gilbert Newton Lewis and Richard C. Tolman (1908, 1909) by defining mass as the ratio of momentum to velocity. So the older definition of longitudinal and transverse mass, in which mass was defined as the ratio of force to acceleration, became superfluous. Finally, Tolman (1912) interpreted <b>relativistic</b> mass simply as the mass of the body. However, many modern textbooks on relativity don't use the concept of <b>relativistic</b> mass anymore, and mass in special relativity is considered as an invariant quantity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Relativistic</b> fluid {{dynamics}} studies the macroscopic and microscopic fluid motion at large velocities {{comparable to the}} velocity of light.

25|$|Today, special relativity's {{predictions}} {{are routinely}} confirmed in particle accelerators {{such as the}} <b>Relativistic</b> Heavy Ion Collider.
