40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to {{understand}} the science behind <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of chocolate used in the Frozen Cone® process. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study the effect of slow and <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> on tempered chocolate. On <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling,</b> lower melting polymorphs of cocoa butter were generated. Upon heating these recrystallised into the more stable Form V. Results were confirmed by similar observations with tempered chocolate fats. A hypothesis was formed whereby upon <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling,</b> lower melting polymorphs nucleate and grow at the expense of Form V nuclei produced during tempering. Upon subsequent warming, these polymorphs melt and recrystallise into Form V. <b>Rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> on untempered chocolate did not show any recrystallisation during warming; proving that tempering is required for the formation of Form V crystals in the final matrix. These results were confirmed by temperature-controlled X-ray diffraction on cocoa butter and chocolate fats. The polymorph generated upon <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> was identified as Form I. This co-existed and eventually transformed to Form II and Form V upon warming. X-ray results showed that following <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling,</b> Form V crystals created during tempering did not grow until above 5 °C. Direct contact cooling at different temperatures was carried out to mimic the Frozen Cone® process. It was found that above - 15 °C, the adhesion of the sample to the holder increases and seems to be correlated to the presence of Form II. These results suggest that the molecular structure and adhesive property of the polymorphs formed at specific temperatures are important for the release of chocolate. Stepscan differential scanning calorimetry was used to separate the simultaneous melting and recrystallisation events occurring in chocolate following slow and <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling,</b> by deconvoluting the total heat flow into reversing and non-reversing components. The general applicability and limitations of Stepscan DSC are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Temperature distributions in packages are predicted by solving the heat conduction equations. The effects of cool-down history on thermomechanical responses of a lead-on-chip (LOC), thin small outline package (TSOP) are investigated. Three linear cool down temperature histories are considered. Numerical results show that residual stresses in a LOC TSOP are significantly influenced by the manufacturing temperature history. Residual stresses in plastic packages are strongly time-temperature dependent due to the thermoviscoelastic behavior of molding compounds. Substantial residual stresses arise when a LOC TSOP has cooled to room temperature and <b>rapid</b> <b>cool</b> down permits small viscoelastic effects. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In this work, a newly {{developed}} UHV-based high precision low background setup for hydrogen thermal desorption analysis (TDA) of metallic samples is presented. Using an infrared heating {{with a low}} thermal capacity enables a precise control of the temperature and <b>rapid</b> <b>cool</b> down of the measurement chamber. This novel TDA-set up is superior in sensitivity to almost every standard hydrogen analyzer available commercially due to the special design of the measurement chamber, resulting in a very low hydrogen background. No effects of background drift characteristic as for carrier gas based TDA instruments were observed, ensuring linearity and reproducibility of the analysis. This setup {{will prove to be}} valuable for detailed investigations of hydrogen trapping sites in steels and other alloys. With a determined limit of detection of 5. 9 * 10 (- 3) gg(- 1) hydrogen the developed instrument is able to determine extremely low hydrogen amounts even at very low hydrogen desorption rates. This work clearly demonstrates the great potential of ultra-high vacuum thermal desorption mass spectroscopy instrumentation. Copyright 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Disch et al. 1 Synthesis of nanoparticles The particles were prepared by thermal decomposition of an iron(III) oleate R 1.

The mixture was refluxed for 4 h, the organic phase was separated and washed with deionized H 2 O, and the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator. The iron oleate was dissolved in 200 mL 1 -octadecene (Sigma-Aldrich, 90 %) {{and subjected to}} a vacuum for 90 min at 120 °C. The mixture was transferred to a 1 L three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a Dean-Stark condenser to which 5. 7 g oleic acid (20 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 90 %) were added. Truncated maghemite nanocubes were produced by slowly heating the solution to 320 °C at 2. 6 °C min- 1 where the mixture was refluxed for 30 minutes, prior to a <b>rapid</b> <b>cool</b> down.
