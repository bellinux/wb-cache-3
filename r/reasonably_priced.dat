30|$|In addition, {{in order}} to {{encourage}} potential trusted wireless nodes to participate in collaboration and optimize the allocation of overall energy consumption, on the one hand, the source node needs a paid use of the power consumed by the cooperative jamming node; on the other hand, the jamming nodes involved in cooperation can <b>reasonably</b> <b>price</b> the power cost and adjust the market price dynamically according to the importance of their own energy, which depends on the number of nodes involved in cooperation, the channel state information of the node itself, and the relative relationship between the node and the source node, the destination node, and the eavesdropper node.

25|$|The first {{business}} model that dissuades illegal file sharing {{is to make}} downloading digital media easy and cheap. The use of noncommercial sites makes downloading digital media complex. For example, misspelling an artist's name in a search query will often fail to return a result, and some sites limit internet traffic, which can make downloading media a long and frustrating process. Furthermore, some illegal file sharing websites are host to viruses and malware which attach themselves to the files (see torrent poisoning).If digital media (for example, songs) are all provided on accessible, legitimate sites, and are <b>reasonably</b> <b>priced,</b> consumers will purchase media legally to overcome these frustrations.|$|E

Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain.

25|$|Political {{instability}} in the 20th century, coupled with bureaucratic regulations and high taxes tempered {{the growth of the}} Chilean wine industry. Prior to the 1980s, the vast majority of Chilean wine was considered low quality and mostly consumed domestically.

25|$|A major {{result of}} the full {{employment}} at high wages was a sharp, long lasting decrease {{in the level of}} income inequality (Great Compression). The {{gap between rich and poor}} narrowed dramatically in the area of nutrition, because food rationing and price controls provided a <b>reasonably</b> <b>priced</b> diet to everyone. White collar workers did not typically receive overtime and therefore the gap between white collar and blue collar income narrowed.

Overtime provided large paychecks in war industries, and average living standards rose steadily, with real wages rising by 44% in the four years of war, while the percentage of families with an annual income of less than $2,000 fell from 75% to 25% of the population.|$|E

5000|$|The {{show has}} {{received}} mixed reviews from numerous critics. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter judged {{the show as}} a whole, noting, [...] "It's a promising beginning for a show most thought {{would end up in}} a ditch." [...] Goodman noted the shaky history of the show being brought over to the US (including Jay Leno's take on the Star in a <b>Reasonably</b> <b>Price</b> Car segment for his short-lived show) and the venom of online comments, to which Goodman replies: [...] "Everyone gets it." [...] Mike Hale of the New York Times had mixed reactions to the show, going from how History's version almost slavishly follows the formula the BBC version uses ("that any subject or concept can appeal to a wide audience if you find the right balance of competition and destruction (the childlike smashing of large objects) with humor, sentiment and pretty locations.") to how the show has gaps between the BBC and History Channel version. Hale had concerns the show was not translating well, as the History version lacks the [...] "going out of the lines" [...] aspect of the original, and the host lineup for History's version being younger and more callow than the BBC version's hosts.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{financial}} performance, 1962 {{turned out to}} be the busiest year in Silver City's 16-year history. During that year, the airline and its French partner CAT carried 96,272 vehicles and 238,748 passengers on 43,064 flights, representing increases of 10%, 6% and 12% compared with 1961. In addition, over 43,000 tonnes of cargo were carried. However, these record-breaking traffic statistics did not alter the fact that the airline's air ferry operation was no longer economically viable. With the advent of new, high-capacity roll-on/roll-off ferries competition intensified. Established aircraft manufacturers were not interested in producing <b>reasonably</b> <b>priced</b> replacements for the ageing Bristol Freighters/Superfreighters that were suffering from wing fatigue. The airline's long-standing policy of stimulating the market by continuously reducing fares had resulted in uneconomic yields in the absence of a corresponding reduction in costs. The Hermes fleet had continued in operation serving several UK airports, mainly on inclusive tour flights, with the last example being retired from service in late 1962.|$|E
25|$|In early 1968, he was {{contacted}} {{by a friend}} from Chicago who said that Toyota wanted to establish a dealer network in the Southeast U.S. and {{wanted to talk to}} Jim Moran, who asked what a Toyota was. The company had been unsuccessful at breaking into the American market {{at the end of the}} 1950s and was trying again. Moran declined, but his friend was insistent that Moran drive one. According to Moran, he tested everything to see if it would break. While cruising at 55mph on the interstate, Moran shifted into reverse, and the engine and transmission survived. Moran concluded that although Toyotas weren't as stylish or comfortable as domestic vehicles, they were well-built, <b>reasonably</b> <b>priced,</b> and destined to change the automotive business. On October 26, 1968 he entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the port in Jacksonville, Florida to the states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina. His Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) was founded that year and in 2006, distributed over 400,000 vehicles, 20% of all new Toyotas sold in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The White Rock Boat Club {{was formed}} in 1961 as the brainchild of {{three members of the}} Corinthian Sailing Club. CSC was having a problem with {{tracking}} davit ownership and the price of davits escalated due to demand since the club had no control over prices. Two of the founders, the Oetkings, had also developed a fine catamaran called the Hellcat and had gone into production with growing sales, but they couldn't find davits at CSC. WRBC was constructed not only to supply <b>reasonably</b> <b>priced</b> davits, but to help sell Hellcats. The club sold davits {{to help pay for the}} construction of the club, with the provision that the club could buy the davit back if the owner left the club. The club has exercised this right and now owns and leases most of its davits. The club was constructed with a few differences from its present configuration as can be seen in the 1968 photo above. In order to promote organized class sailing, WRBC at one time limited the type of boats kept at the club to racing classes. In the 1970s, the following classes of sailboats were eligible for membership: Butterfly, Coronado 15, Flying Scot, Harpoon, Lido, Lone Star 13, MC Scow, M16 Scow, M20 Scow and Rebel. The club remains active on the lake today.|$|E
