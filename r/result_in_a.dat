5|$|After a {{star has}} {{finished}} generating energy through thermonuclear fusion, it evolves {{into a more}} compact, degenerate state. During this process {{the dimensions of the}} star are significantly reduced, which can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corresponding increase in angular velocity.|$|E
5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. This could <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake {{tends to}} be moist due to the liquid content present in the apple sauce. However, using a chunky-style apple sauce can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cake with less moisture, {{compared}} to using standard apple sauce. Letting it sit {{for one or two}} days before serving can increase its flavor, as this allows time for the ingredients to intermingle within the cake.|$|E

5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables {{him or her}} to deal with intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer may <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{shedding}} {{of the outer}} layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer {{is located on the}} lip, ulceration may occur as a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Disease-modifying {{treatments}} only {{reduce the}} progression {{rate of the}} disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease {{is associated with a}} variety of symptoms and functional deficits that <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> range of progressive impairments and handicap. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.|$|E

5|$|For contact or semi-detached binaries, the {{transfer}} of mass from a star to its companion can also <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> significant transfer of angular momentum.

5|$|Front flat tire. Braking a {{wheel with}} a flat tire can cause the tire {{to come off the}} rim which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, {{in the case of a}} front wheel, <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of balance.|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in the temperature of <b>a</b> semiconducting material <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> charge-carrier concentration. This <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> higher number of charge carriers available for recombination, increasing the conductivity of the semiconductor. The increasing conductivity causes the resistivity of the semiconductor material to decrease with the rise <b>in</b> temperature, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negative temperature coefficient of resistance.|$|R
25|$|This <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of {{function}} of the cycle, and <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accumulation of glutamate. This glutamate further stimulates the NMDA receptors, thus acting synergistically with quinolinic acid to increase its neurotoxic effect by increasing the levels of glutamate, as well as inhibiting its uptake. In this way, quinolinic acid self-potentiates its own toxicity. Furthermore, quinolinic acid <b>results</b> <b>in</b> changes of the biochemistry {{and structure of the}} astrocytes themselves, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> apoptotic response. A loss of astrocytes <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pro-inflammatory effect, further increasing the initial inflammatory response which initiates quinolinic acid production.|$|R

5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is {{an altered}} level of consciousness {{as a result}} of liver failure. Onset may be gradual or sudden.
