40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was made of}} the problem of separated flow with reattachment at subsonic speeds in various geometrical configurations. It was found that when the boundary layer thickness at separation was small, the values of the <b>reattachment</b> <b>pressure</b> rise coefficient agreed with those from the Korst-Chapman theory. The importance of the relative positions of the transition and reattachment was investigated. In the free shear layer, transition occurred at Reynolds numbers as low as 3 x 10 [superscript 3], based on distance from the separation point...|$|E

An examination of the <b>reattachment</b> <b>pressure</b> distributions and the parameters at the entrance of the abrupt channel expansion was made. A smooth transition of mean flow quantities was found to occur in the transition from a free jet to a partially confined jet and then to a fully confined jet. The distance to reattachment was measured for various shroud lengths and shown to exhibit an asymptotic value which was Reynolds number dependent.

30|$|Face C has {{slightly}} positive pressure {{near the}} bottom and negative elsewhere. The negative pressure {{is due to the}} formation of vortex, and slight positive pressure at the bottom is because the <b>reattachment</b> wind <b>pressure</b> is higher than the suction pressure.

For θ =  0 ^∘, Faces A, B, C and E do not experience much variation in pressure for different models. Faces F, G and H have negative value at top and positive value at bottom. With the increase in area of opening these faces experience high increase in pressure at bottom of its surface.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the steady}} {{two-dimensional}} motion of an incompressible Newtonian fluid between two parallel plates with heat transfer {{in the presence}} of a cosine shaped stenosis is studied. The governing equations are transformed into a compatibility and energy equations, which is solved analytically with the help of the regular perturbation technique. The solutions obtained from the present analysis are given in terms of streamlines, wall shear stress, separation and <b>reattachment</b> points, <b>pressure</b> and temperature distributions through the stenosed channel. The accuracy of the results are verified from available literature. It is found that the wall shear stress, pressure gradient and temperature increase with the development of the stenosis, causing separation and reattachment points in the region. It is also observed that even at low velocity, separation occurs if the thickness of the stenosis is increased. We present the results in graphical form...|$|R

40|$|Supersonic flow over a downstream-facing {{step on the}} {{circumference}} of a large, ducted, axisymmetric body was used to study flow reattachment. Step heights h were 0. 25, 1. 00, and 1. 68 in., compared to a body radius of 6 in. Freestream Mach numbers were in the range 2 to 4. 5. Theturbulent boundary-layer thickness {{just ahead of the}} step varied from 0. 14 to 0. 19 in. (momentum thicknesses of about 0. 01 in.). Surface pressure distributions throughout the region of separation and reattachment were measured, and points of reattachment were determined. Comparison of the shapes of the pressure distributions for various step heights shows that the initial (steepest) parts of the <b>reattachment</b> <b>pressure</b> rise, up to the point of reattachment, tend to become superimposed when plotted against x/h. Downstream reattachment the curves branch out, exhibiting a dependence on geometry and probably on initial shear layer profile. In the region of the initial pressure rise (near the end of the "dead air" region) dynamic pressures are low; the pressure rise there apparently is balanced by turbulent shear stress...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTime {{series of}} {{pressure}} measured {{on the periphery}} of the central section of acircular cylinder of aspect ratio 22 are used to investigate the dynamics of thelocal reattachments during the drag crisis transitions. A succession of multi-stabledynamics are identified and characterized through conditional statistical analysis asthe Reynolds number is increased. The first transition marking an abrupt weakeningof the periodic pressure fluctuations associated to the global shedding dynamics isaccompanied by the appearance of symmetric and bistable perturbations. Afterwards,two scenarii of asymmetric and symmetric boundary layer reattachments are found. The asymmetric scenario leads to two transitions. During the first transition, theflow explores randomly three stable states to eventually stabilize on the state correspondingto the permanent reattachment on one side of the cylinder. The secondtransition is bistable and leads to the permanent reattachment on both sides. For thesecond symmetric scenario, the boundary layer reattachments occur simultaneouslyon both side of the cylinder. In that case, the flow explores randomly two stablestates to eventually stabilize on the state of full <b>reattachment.</b> <b>Pressure</b> distributionsof all of these states are characterized as well as their corresponding probabilitiesduring the drag crisis transitions of the critical regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of a hypersonic boundary {{layer on a}} flat plate with an impinging shock - {{an order of magnitude}} stronger than that required for incipient separation of the boundary layer - near sharp and blunt leading edges (with different bluntness radii from 2 to 6 mm) is investigated experimentally, complemented by numerical computations. The resultant separation bubble is of length comparable to the distance of shock impingement from the leading edge, rather than the boundary layer thickness at separation; it is termed large separation bubble. Experiments are performed in the IISc hypersonic shock tunnel HST- 2 at nominal Mach numbers 5. 88 and 8. 54, with total enthalpies 1. 26 and 1. 85 MJ kg(- 1) respectively. Schlieren flow visualization using a high-speed camera and surface pressure measurements using fast response sensors are the diagnostics. For the sharp leading edge case, the separation length was found to follow an inviscid scaling law according to which the scaled separation length. (L-sep/x(r)) M-er(3) er is found to be linearly related to the <b>reattachment</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio p(r) /p(er); where L-sep is the measured separation length, x(r) the distance of reattachment from the leading edge, M the Mach number, p the static pressure and the subscripts r and e denote the conditions at the reattachment location and {{at the edge of the}} boundary layer at the shock impingement location respectively. However, for all the blunt leading edges. (L-sep/x(r)) M-er(3) was found to be a constant irrespective of Mach number and much smaller than the sharp leading edge cases. The possible contributions of viscous and non-viscous mechanisms towards the observed phenomena are explored...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and design of}} a submarine propulsor requires the ability to predict the characteristics of both laminar and turbulent flows to {{a higher degree of}} accuracy. This report presents results of certain benchmark computations based on an upwind, high-resolution, finite-differencing Navier-Stokes solver. The purpose of the computations is to evaluate the ability, the accuracy and the performance of the solver in the simulation of detailed features of viscous flows. Features of interest include flow separation and <b>reattachment,</b> surface <b>pressure</b> and skin friction distributions. Those features are particularly relevant to the propulsor analysis. Test cases {{with a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers are selected; therefore, the effects of the convective and the diffusive terms of the solver can be evaluated separately. Test cases include flows over bluff bodies, such as circular cylinders and spheres, at various low Reynolds numbers, flows over a flat plate with and without turbulence effects, and turbulent flows over axisymmetric bodies with and without propulsor effects. Finally, to enhance the iterative solution procedure, a full approximation scheme V-cycle multigrid method is implemented. Preliminary results indicate that the method significantly reduces the computational effort...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} primary shape parameters, such as side wall angle, offset {{distance}} and splitter distance, {{on the internal}} flow in classical wall-attachment devices has been examined experimentally at a Reynolds number of 16 ×(10) ^ 3. The results show how the <b>reattachment</b> distance, <b>pressure</b> distribution and velocity profile in the device {{are affected by the}} shape parameters. In particular, the influence of splitter distance was examined in detail. The reattachment distance decreases continuously from a value in the case of without a splitter to a minimum as the splitter distance decreases from the fully far downstream distance. In contrast, the maximum value of the reattachment distance becomes partially and slightly larger than that without a splitter. Thus, the effective range of splitter distance where the reattachment distance varies from the maximum equivalent almost to the value without a splitter to the mimimum is determined as the range where the ordinary wall-reattachment flow pattern is directly affected by a splitter. It is shown that the effective range of reattachment and splitter distances nondimensionalized by the correctly defined upper-limit values becomes similar for all devices reported here...|$|R
40|$|A three-dimensional, {{incompressible}} jet issuing from {{a rectangular}} nozzle {{with a smaller}} height (height : a) than the flow passage (height : H) oscillates periodically when the jet is issued into a suddenly enlarged flow passage. In order to obtain some basic knowledge on this oscillatory phenomenon, reattachment properties of a three-dimensional, rectangular jet flow from the nozzle with a/H < 1 to an adjacent flat plate, side wall, are examined. A theoretical analysis using momentum principle is developed for the <b>reattachment</b> distance, mean <b>pressure</b> within separation bubble, etc. The agreement with the experimental results is fairly good. Measurements of velocity profile were made {{not only about the}} mean properties of the reattached jet but also about the turbulent properties, √u' 2, √v' 2, √w' 2, and Reynolds shear stress. These theoretical and experimental results are compared with ones for a two-dimensional reattached jet...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} in the T 5 Hypervelocity Shock Tunnel to investigate nonequilibrium real-gas effects on separation length using a double-wedge geometry and nitrogen test gas. Local external flow conditions were estimated by computing the inviscid nonequilibrium flow field. A new scaling parameter was developed to approximately account for wall temperature effects on separation length for a laminar nonreacting boundary layer and arbitrary viscosity law. A classification was introduced to divide mechanisms for real-gas effects into those acting internal and external to viscous regions of the flow. Internal mechanisms were further subdivided into those arising upstream and downstream of separation. Analysis based on the ideal dissociating gas model and a scaling law for separation length of a nonreacting boundary layer showed that external mechanisms due to dissociation may decrease separation length at low incidence but depend on the free-stream dissociation at high incidence. A limited numerical study of reacting boundary layers showed that internal mechanisms due to recombination occurring in the boundary layer upstream of separation cause a slight decrease in separation length relative to a nonreacting boundary layer with the same external conditions. Correlations were obtained of experimentally measured separation length using local external flow parameters computed for reacting flow, which scales out external mechanisms but not internal mechanisms. These showed {{the importance of the}} new scaling parameter in high-enthalpy flows, a linear relationship between separation length and <b>reattachment</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio, and a Reynolds-number effect for transitional interactions. A significant increase in scaled separation length was observed in the experimental data at high enthalpy. The increase was attributed to an internal mechanism arising from recombination in the free-shear layer downstream of separation, perhaps altering its velocity profile. This real-gas effect depends on the combined presence of free-stream dissociation and a cold wall...|$|E
40|$|Interaction {{between a}} shock wave and a {{boundary}} layer at a compression corner {{can produce a}} region of separated flow. The length of separation is important in determining aerodynamic forces, and the heat transfer at reattachment {{is important for the}} design of thermal protection systems. The effects of high-enthalpy flow on these phenomenon, particularly separation length, are not well known. Experiments to measure separation length and reattachment heating are performed in the T 5 Hypervelocity Shock Tunnel using nitrogen test gas and a double-wedge geometry which allows greater control over local flow conditions at separation and, at high incidence angle, may produce real-gas effects due to dissociation behind the leading shock. Local external flow conditions were found by computational reconstruction of the inviscid nonequilibrium flow field. Application of results from asymptotic theory to a simple model for separation leads to a new scaling parameter which approximately accounts for wall temperature effects on separation length for a laminar nonreacting boundary layer and extends previous results to arbitrary viscosity law. A. classification is introduced which divides mechanisms for real-gas effects into those acting internal and external to viscous regions of the flow, with internal mechanisms further subdivided into those arising upstream and downstream of separation. Application of the ideal dissociating gas model to a scaling law based on local external flow parameters and a nonreacting boundary layer shows that external mechanisms due to dissociation decrease separation length at low incidence but depend on the free-stream dissociation at high incidence, and have only a small effect on peak heating. A limited numerical study of reacting boundary layers shows that internal mechanisms due to recombination in the upstream boundary layer cause a slight decrease in separation length and a large increase in heat flux relative to a nonreacting boundary layer with the same external conditions. Correlations are presented of experimentally measured separation length using local external flow parameters computed for reacting flow, which scales out external mechanisms but not internal mechanisms. These show the importance of the new scaling parameter in high-enthalpy flows, a linear relationship between separation length and <b>reattachment</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio as found previously for supersonic interactions, and a Reynolds-number effect for transitional interactions. A significant increase in scaled separation length is observed for high-enthalpy data in the laminar regime, and this is attributed to an internal recombination mechanism occurring in the separated shear layer. Experimental data for reattachment heat flux are found to agree roughly with existing correlations and to exhibit an increase due to an internal recombination mechanism, but cannot provide further insight due to large scatter...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Axial flow over a circular cylinder is very complex, particularly around {{the leading edge of}} the cylinder, comprising separation bubble/cavitation, shear-layer <b>reattachment,</b> etc. <b>Pressure</b> fluctuations in the separation region may induce structural vibrations and generate noise. This paper presents the results of wall pressure measurement and flow visualization done around the cylinder leading edge with blunt, conical and hemispherical noses at Reynolds number (ReD, based on cylinder diameter D) ranging from 1. 5 × 103 to 4. 2 × 104. The yaw angle is varied from 0 ° (axial) to 3. 5 °. Attention has been paid to investigate the effects of nose shape, ReD and on the flow features as well as time-mean pressure coefficient Cp and fluctuating (rms) pressure coefficient Cp. At = 0 °, blunt nose engenders longer reattachment length xR, wider bubble width W and shorter transition length xTr, compared with conical and hemispherical noses. Cp and Cp’ are found to be highly sensitive to ReD for hemispherical nose. Blunt nose presents highest Cp’, while hemispherical nose corresponds to the lowest Cp’. With increasing from 0 ° to 3. 5 °, Cp declines and Cp’ increases for both blunt and conical noses, while those for hemispherical nose vary less regularly. A slight increase in influences the flow separation with enhanced XR and W, and reduced XTr for all the three noses. cf 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the structural response of carbon fiber sandwich panels subjected to blast loading through an integrated experimental and numerical approach. A total of nine experiments, corresponding to three different blast intensity levels were conducted in the 28 -inch square shock tube apparatus. Computational models were developed to capture the experimental details and further study the mechanism of blast wave-sandwich panel interactions. The peak reflected overpressure was monitored, which amplified to approximately 2. 5 times of the incident overpressure due to fluid-structure interactions. The measured strain histories demonstrated opposite phases at the center of the front and back facesheets. Both strains showed damped oscillation with a reduced oscillation frequency as well as amplified facesheet deformations at the higher blast intensity. As the blast wave traversed across the panel, the observed flow separation and <b>reattachment</b> led to <b>pressure</b> increase at the back side of the panel. Further parametric studies suggested that the maximum deflection of the back facesheet increased dramatically with higher blast intensity and decreased with larger facesheet and core thickness. Our computational models, calibrated by experimental measurements, could be used as a virtual tool for assessing the mechanism of blast-panel interactions, and predicting the structural response of composite panels subjected to blast loading...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{reducing}} the impulse and the required mass flow needed in active separation control by pulsed actuation systems. The investigated strategy {{to achieve this}} is based on the cooperative action of multiple rows of actuators positioned downstream of each other. As shown by the analysis of PIV measurements in conjunction with pressure measurements, the fluidic rows can be actuated such that the flow tructures (vortices) they produce are strengthened and stabilized by subsequent actuator rows while they propagate downstream. This strategy was applied to the <b>reattachment</b> of <b>pressure</b> induced separation on a planar half diffuser with variable step angle. A maximum reduction of 67 % in total actuation momentum could be achieved compared with a single row of actuators. The authority requirements on the single actuator can be reduced by 89 % cµ, thus smaller and lighter actuation devices can be used to solve the flow control problem in future. A mass flow reduction up to 21 % can be achieved by using a non-optimized cooperative actuation system. In future, a saving of approximately 30 % is estimated if the system parameters, e. g. the duty cycle or a control algorithm regarding to the propagation velocities of the vortices, are fine tuned further. It is shown that this system is suitable to reattach the flow with less resources and therefore it is worth the additional effort. Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab den Impuls und den Massenstrom eines gepulsten aktiven Systems zur Beeinflussung abgelöster Strömungen zu verringern. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen wurden mehrere Reihen von Aktuatoren hintereinander in Strömungsrichtung angeordnet. Mit Hilfe von PIV und Druckmessungen kann gezeigt werden, dass die verantwortlichen Strömungsstrukturen stabilisiert und verstärkt werden. Dieses System wurde dann auf einen Halbdiffuser übertragen, bei dem der Stufenwinkel stufenlos eingestellt werden kann und somit eine Druck induzierte Ablösung erzeugt wird. Die kooperative Aktuatorik erreicht hier eine Reduzierung des gesamten Impulsbeiwertes von 67 % und eine Reduzierung des Impulsbeiwertes beim Einzelaktuator von bis zu 89 %. Damit lassen sich in Zukunft kompaktere und leichtere Aktuatoren verwenden oder verworfene Aktuator-Konzepte neu beleben. Der Massenstrom lässt sich mit einem nicht optimierten System um 21 % reduzieren. Es wird angenommen, das bei einer weiteren Optimierung der Aktuatorparameter, wie z. B. der Pulsweite oder durch die Installation eines Algorithmus der den Phasenwinkel kontrolliert, bis zu ca. 30 % eingespart werden können. Es wird gezeigt, dass mit dieser Art der Strömungsbeeinflussung die Anforderungen an den benötigten Massenstrom sowie an den Impulsbeiwert der Aktuatoren reduziert werden können. Mit den erbrachten Einsparungen lässt sich der höhere Systemaufwand insgesamt durchaus rechtfertigen...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveParaplegia after thoracoabdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} (TAAA) repair mainly occurs {{in patients with}} Crawford extent I and II. We assessed the impact of monitoring spinal cord integrity and the subsequent adjusted surgical maneuvers on neurologic outcome in repairs of type I and II TAAAs. MethodsSurgical repair of TAAAs was performed in 112 consecutive patients with extent type I (n = 42) and type II (n = 70) aneurysms. The surgical protocol included cerebrospinal fluid drainage, moderate hypothermia, and left heart bypass with selective organ perfusion. Spinal cord function was assessed by means of monitoring motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Significant decreased MEPs always generated adjustments, including raising distal aortic and mean arterial <b>pressure,</b> <b>reattachment</b> of visible intercostal arteries, or endarterectomy of the excluded aortic segment with revascularization of back bleeding intercostal arteries. ResultsMotor evoked potential monitoring could be achieved in all patients. By maintaining a mean distal aortic pressure of 60 mm Hg, MEPs were adequate in 82 % of patients. Increasing distal aortic pressure restored MEPs in all patients. In 19 patients (17 %), MEPs decreased significantly during aortic cross-clamping because of critical spinal cord ischemia. MEPs returned in all patients after spinal cord blood flow was re-established except in three patients with type II TAAA in whom MEPs could not be restored, and absent MEPs {{at the end of}} the procedure corresponded with neurologic deficit. Delayed paraplegia developed in two patients owing to hemodynamic instability with insufficient mean arterial blood pressure to maintain adequate spinal cord perfusion. ConclusionMonitoring MEPs is a highly reliable technique to assess spinal cord ischemia during TAAA repair. A surgical protocol including cerebrospinal fluid drainage, left heart bypass, and monitoring of MEPs can reduce the paraplegia rate significantly. Adjusted hemodynamic and surgical strategies induced by changes in MEPs could restore spinal cord ischemia in most patients, preventing early and late paraplegia in all type I patients. In type II patients, early paraplegia occurred in 4. 2 % and delayed neurologic deficit in 2. 9 %. Despite all available measures, complete prevention of paraplegia in type II aneurysms seems to be unrealistic...|$|R
40|$|A {{small-scale}} {{wind tunnel}} previously used for {{turbulent boundary layer}} experiments was modified for two sets of boundary layer transition studies. The first study concerns a laminar separation/turbulent <b>reattachment.</b> The <b>pressure</b> gradient and unit Reynolds number {{are the same as}} the fully turbulent flow of Spalart and Watmuff. Without the trip wire, a laminar layer asymptotes to a Falkner & Skan similarity solution in the FPG. Application of the APG causes the layer to separate and a highly turbulent and approximately 2 D mean flow reattachment occurs downstream. In an effort to gain some physical insight into the flow processes a small impulsive disturbance was introduced at the C(sub p) minimum. The facility is totally automated and phase-averaged data are measured on a point-by-point basis using unprecedently large grids. The evolution of the disturbance has been tracked all the way into the reattachment region and beyond into the fully turbulent boundary layer. At first, the amplitude decays exponentially with streamwise distance in the APG region, where the layer remains attached, i. e. the layer is viscously stable. After separation, the rate of decay slows, and a point of minimum amplitude is reached where the contours of the wave packet exhibit dispersive characteristics. From this point, exponential growth of the amplitude of the disturbance is observed in the detached shear layer, i. e. the dominant instability mechanism is inviscid. A group of large-scale 3 D vortex loops emerges {{in the vicinity of the}} reattachment. Remarkably, the second loop retains its identify far downstream in the turbulent boundary layer. The results provide a level of detail usually associated with CFD. Substantial modifications were made to the facility for the second study concerning disturbances generated by Suction Holes for laminar flow Control (LFC). The test section incorporates suction through interchangeable porous test surfaces. Detailed studies have been made using isolated holes in the impervious test plate that used to establish the Blasius base flow. The suction is perturbed harmonically and data are averaged on the basis of the phase of the disturbance, for conditions corresponding to strong suction and without suction. The technique was enhanced by using up to nine multiple probes to reduce the experimental run-time. In both cases, 3 D contour surfaces in the vicinity of the hole show highly 3 D TS waves which fan out in the spanwise direction forming bow-shaped waves downstream. The case without suction has proved useful for evaluating calculation methods. With suction, the perturbations on the centerline are much stronger and decay less rapidly, while the TS waves in the far field are similar to the case without suction. Downstream, the contour surfaces of the TS waves develop spanwise irregularities which eventually form into clumps. The spanwise clumping is evidence of a secondary instability that could be associated with suction vortices. Designers of porous surfaces use Goldsmith's Criterion to minimize cross-stream interactions. It is shown that partial TS wave cancellation is possible, depending on the hole spacing, disturbance frequency and free-stream velocity. New high-performance Constant Temperature Hot-Wire Anemometers were designed and built, based on a linear system theory analysis that can be extended to arbitrary order. The motivation was to achieve the highest possible frequency reponse while ensuring overall system stability. The performance is equal to or superior to commercially available instruments at about 10 % of the cost. Details, such as fabrication drawings and a parts list, have been published to enable the instrument to be construced by others...|$|R
