25|$|The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally {{authorized}} {{appropriation of}} oil <b>revenues,</b> <b>established</b> by voters in 1976 {{to manage a}} surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely {{in anticipation of the}} then recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller {{on the eve of the}} 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.|$|R

Processing was {{completed}} on IBM system-34 machine. There were standalone systems in every Collectorate.

Data, regarding value {{was used to}} be given by the computer operator {{in the form of}} an assessment sheet (at this stage some customs brokers managed to get values of their choice as values could be maneuvered by the computer operator). The print out of the sheet was attached with the bill of entry (B/E) and sent to the group in routine. After completion of B/E and out of customs charge, manual feeding in the computer system was done by KPOs of Computer Bureau through batch processing. [...] In December, 1992 computer processing (online processing) of bill of entries was started in Appraisement Collectorate. Between 1992 and 1999 feeding of hard copies of B/Es in the computer was done by the KPOs of import section. A running number was allocated to B/Es by the computer, which was manually affixed on the B/E. Assessment was used to be made in the relevant groups and simultaneously entry was recorded in the computer. The system automatically calculated duty. A batch of eight bills of entry was forwarded to the bank with a summary. The bank verified that summary with pay orders which they received. Account section was responsible to make consignments out of customs charge after satisfying that all the taxes and duties are paid in the national exchequer.|$|E
