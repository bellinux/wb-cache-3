Thus, based on observed lighting levels {{in a wide range}} of Swiss towns, SAFE has defined target values for electric power consumption per metre for roads of various categories. Thus, SAFE currently recommends an SEC of 2 to 3 watts per meter for roads of less than 10 metre width (4 to 6 watts per metre for wider roads). Such a measure provides an easily applicable environmental protection constraint on conventional [...] "norms", which usually are based on the recommendations of lighting manufacturing interests, who may not take into account environmental criteria. In view of ongoing progress in lighting technology, target SEC values will need to be periodically revised downwards.|$|E

50|$|Lighting-up {{time was}} first {{introduced}} {{in the nineteenth century}} in local by-laws and enforced nationally by the Lights on Vehicles Act of 1907. In the 1920's, service stations started displaying cardboard clock-face displays, set to the lighting-up time for the day. The <b>Road</b> <b>Lighting</b> Act of 1942 stipulated 1 hour after sunset/before sunrise. It was amended to 30 minutes by the Road Traffic Act of 1956 because of the increasing speed of traffic. These were the required times for showing all lights on all vehicles, including bicycles and horse-drawn carts, hence the name lighting-up time.|$|E
50|$|Globally 70% of all {{electricity}} {{is generated by}} burning fossil fuels, a source of air pollution and greenhouse gases, and also globally there are approximately 300 million street lights using that electricity. Cities are exploring more efficient energy use, reducing street light power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours and switching to high-efficiency LED lamps. A British county council has turned off 5% of its street lights on a trial basis. Typical collector <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> in New York State costs $6400/mile/year for high pressure sodium at 8.5 kW/mile or $4000 for light-emitting diode luminaires at 5.4 kW/mile.|$|E

50|$|The Soke Parkway {{consists}} of the entire section of the A47 that runs through Peterborough. As a trunk route, the stretch of road is maintained by the Highways Agency, who have recently undertaken an update of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> on the route. This section of road is called the Soke Parkway (named after the Soke of Peterborough). When this was first built, in the mid-1970s, the A47 followed {{what is now the}} A1139 Paston Parkway. Apart from a roundabout on {{the eastern edge of the}} city, the parkway is an unbroken major dual carriageway. The road passes over the A15 (Paston Parkway) as a roundabout and than heads westwards passing one grade separated junction with a local road. The road then meets the city section of the A15 on an unusual junction. It crosses the East Coast Main Line near to a Morrisons (former Safeway), and Boulevard and Brotherhood retail parks in New England. After passing the A15 the A47 quickly heads south-westwards, where after passing another grade separated junction for local traffic the road meets the A1260 at Longthorpe. The Nene Parkway terminates in the Peterborough Longthorpe Grade separated junction (GSJ) (which opened in December 1987) where it meets the A1260 Nene Parkway. There is a GSJ for Bretton and a Sainsbury's, and it passes the Bretton Woods Community School. The £1.2m Peterborough Westwood GSJ opened in January 1987. After passing this junction the A47 heads westward into open countryside where it bypasses Castor and Ailsworth before the road becomes a single carriageway before reaching the A1 at Wansford.|$|E
40|$|It is {{observed}} that the power consumption of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is increased with the length of trafficable road in Hong Kong. The energy used in <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is increasing, {{which means that the}} greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from power plant for generating electricity for <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is at the same time}} increasing. To compare the performance of light emitted diode (LED) <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> with <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> of other lamp sources, literature review, life cycle assessment (LCA) and technical assessment are adopted to give an overall comparison. This research focuses more on the environmental impacts of <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> LCA is adopted in order to give a comprehensive view on the environmental impact of <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> A total of 3 different lamp sources are compared: high pressure sodium (HPS) lamp, induction lamp and light emitted diode (LED) lamp. From the model result, it is found that due to the low power consumption and long life time, LED and induction lamp <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> gives generally less environmental impact than HPS <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> As induction lamp has a longer life span than LED, the environmental impact of induction lamp <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is found slightly less than that of LED <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> Taking account the future development in LED technology, leading to longer life time, higher efficacy and lower production cost, LED <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is expected to be a replacement for <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> in Hong Kong for the future. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
