5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to <b>ridging</b> from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Upon first forming, {{the system}} contended with the {{entrainment}} of dry {{air to the}} northwest of the storm, which was expected to limit intensification. The storm steadily intensified, and early on June 2 the IMD upgraded it to deep depression status. Later in the day the IMD classified the system as Cyclonic Storm Gonu about 760km (470mi) southwest of Mumbai, India. As a mid-latitude trough developed over Pakistan, Gonu turned {{to the north and}} northeast, though it resumed a westward track after <b>ridging</b> built {{to the north of the}} storm. With a solid area of intense convection, it rapidly intensified to attain severe cyclonic status early on June 3, and with good outflow the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. The dry air ultimately had a smaller impact on the intensification than previously estimated. A well-defined eye developed in the center of convection, and after moving over a local increase in ocean heat content, Gonu rapidly deepened.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July30, the cloud pattern of system quickly became better organized. Later after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, ships and satellite images confirmed that Tropical Depression Four had formed offshore {{of the north}} coast of the Yucatán Peninsula; although it was likely that the depression formed 80miles (129km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula several hours earlier than confirmed. The following morning after development occurred, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm 575miles (920km) southeast of Texas; the National Hurricane Center assigned it to the name Chantal. Although it became a tropical storm early that morning, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm until a reconnaissance flight confirmed tropical storm force winds about six hours later, when sustained winds were already 50mph (85km/h). Tropical Storm Chantal rapidly strengthened thereafter, with weather satellites indicating t–numbers increasing from 2.5to 3.5within twelve hours using the Dvorak technique. Chantal continued to intensify, and headed northwestward at 11mph (18km/h) due to weak <b>ridging</b> over Florida.|$|E

5|$|Increasing upper-level {{westerlies}} caused Alberto {{to weaken}} {{as it moved}} east-northeastward, with the cyclone losing most of its convection. Early on August14, Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm. A westerly trough that had been guiding Alberto outran the storm, and strong <b>ridging</b> developed {{to the north and}} west. As a result, Alberto turned southward on August15, southwestward on August16, and then to the west on August17. While curving northwestward and then northward, Alberto began to re-strengthen, and was upgraded to a hurricane for a third time on August18. Alberto reached a third peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane with winds of 105mph (205km/h) on August20. After weakening back to a Category1 hurricane, Alberto conducted an unusually large cyclonic loop, spanning approximately 5degrees latitude and 8degrees longitude. The cyclone was downgraded to a tropical storm on August23, shortly before completing its extratropical transition. Although it did not affect land while tropical, the precursor tropical wave caused light rainfall in Senegal. The remnant extratropical cyclone also likely produced tropical storm-force winds in Iceland and Jan Mayen.|$|E
5|$|At around 18:00 UTC on October 22, the {{hurricane}} made landfall near Santiago de Cuba at its initial peak intensity, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). It started weakening {{early the next}} day after encountering the Sierra Maestra mountain range and moving southwestward, away from the coast. Steered by persistent high-pressure <b>ridging</b> over the eastern United States and western Atlantic, the cyclone would maintain this highly unusual path {{for the remainder of}} its duration in open waters. It brushed Cuba's Cape Cruz and deteriorated to a tropical storm before passing relatively close to the western tip of Jamaica. On the morning of October 24, the barometer aboard a ship in the storm's eye fell to , its lowest recorded pressure. The ship measured winds outside of the lull only up to , but the storm was reintensifying, and once again achieved hurricane strength later in the day. It matched its previous peak intensity at 12:00 UTC on October 25 as it approached Cabo Gracias a Dios on the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. Shortly thereafter, {{the hurricane}} crossed the Honduran coast for its final landfall. The mountainous terrain of Central America worked to diminish the storm, which curved westward and steadily lost force, though observation of its decay was minimal. The cyclone likely dissipated on October 27 over Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Upon peaking in intensity, Julia {{accelerated}} {{slightly as}} it re-curved toward the northwest along a mid to upper-level low to its southwest. In addition, this system generated unfavorable southerly flow aloft, inducing a slight {{weakening of the}} storm. By early September16, Julia's eye became indistinguishable on satellite images, and the storm further dropped to below major hurricane status. Upon doing so, Julia became embedded within a south-southeasterly steering current along deep-layer <b>ridging</b> in its vicinity, resulting in a more westward track. Though still a hurricane, the relatively small tropical system moved {{to the east of}} the much larger Hurricane Igor. Concurrently, Igor's outflow began impinging on Julia's circulation, and due to colder sea surface temperatures, the storm weakened below hurricane intensity late on September17. Henceforth, Julia re-accelerated as it further curved northward around the contiguous ridge, nearly merging with Igor as a result. Progressively tracking to the north over the next hours, Julia subsequently executed a turn to the northeast, then to the east. Proceeding eastward, the low-level center of the storm became partially exposed on September 18; however, for several hours thereafter, convection gradually redeveloped over its center. Despite the deep convection, vertical wind shear again increased over the system, causing the storm to enter an extratropical transition. It is estimated Julia degenerated into a post-tropical low by 1800 UTC on September 20, while located about 1095mi (1750km) west of the Azores. The resultant storm meandered around over the Atlantic for several days, continuing generally eastward before executing an elongated loop to the south. Following this erratic track, the remnants of Hurricane Julia proceeded northwestward and came within 350mi (563km) of Bermuda, where they were once again briefly monitored by the NHC. However, chance of redevelopment dwindled, as conditions were not conducive for tropical formation; convection nearly diminished entirely, and the NHC discontinued monitoring the system on September 28.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{parameters}} (namely <b>ridge</b> height, <b>ridge</b> clearance, <b>ridge</b> nose radius, <b>ridge</b> shoulder radius, ridge-to-punch nose distance, {{and number of}} <b>ridges)</b> were specified for the microridge punch. An excessively high <b>ridge</b> height induces the <b>ridges</b> to be deeply pressed into the blank, whereas an extremely low <b>ridge</b> height causes the <b>ridges</b> to generate unsatisfactory drawing effects. Moreover, an extremely high <b>ridge</b> clearance results in the excessive distribution of the <b>ridge</b> drawing force to the blank. The minimum <b>ridge</b> clearance {{is limited to the}} thickness of the grinding blade. An extremely long <b>ridge</b> nose radius reduces the drawing force of the ridges; however, an excessively short <b>ridge</b> nose radius causes the <b>ridge</b> to be deeply pressed into the blank. In addition, an excessively long <b>ridge</b> shoulder radius induces the <b>ridges</b> to deliver limited drawing force. The minimum <b>ridge</b> shoulder radius is limited to the nasal fillet radius of the grinding blade. An extremely long ridge-to-punch nose distance results in increased thickness difference percentages, whereas an excessively short ridge-to-punch nose distance leads to changes in the appearance of components. In addition, an extremely high number of <b>ridges</b> increases the punch manufacturing costs, whereas an extremely low number of <b>ridges</b> reduces the drawing effect.|$|R

500|$|An area of {{disturbed}} {{weather in}} association with a weak surface trough and a [...] stronger upper-level trough between the Bahamas and Bermuda developed on September 6. High pressure <b>ridging</b> strengthened by Tropical Storm Fay caused the trough to become more organized and close off into a broad non-tropical low on September 7. By September 8, the system had developed enough convection near its center of circulation to be classified Subtropical Depression Eight while located southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

Additional <b>ridging</b> was forecast to build behind the trough, which would turn Mitch to the west to an area near the Yucatán Channel in five days. [...] Significant intensification was initially hampered by the upper-level low to the northwest generating wind shear over Mitch.

Tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated significant strengthening to winds of 115mph (185km/h) once an anticyclone aloft became established, although the NHC noted that [...] "it [...] difficult to visualize such intensification with the present poorly defined pattern observed on satellite, and knowing that the global models tend {{to get rid of}} westerlies too fast."

2500|$|Snow {{cover is}} an {{extremely}} important storage component in the water balance, especially seasonal snowpacks in mountainous areas of the world. Though limited in extent, seasonal snowpacks in the Earth’s mountain ranges account for {{the major source of}} the runoff for stream flow and groundwater recharge over wide areas of the midlatitudes. For example, over 85% of the annual runoff from the Colorado River basin originates as snowmelt. Snowmelt runoff from the Earth’s mountains fills the rivers and recharges the aquifers that over a billion people depend on for their water resources. Further, over 40% of the world’s protected areas are in mountains, attesting to their value both as unique ecosystems needing protection and as recreation areas for humans. Climate warming is expected to result in major changes to the partitioning of snow and rainfall, and to the timing of snowmelt, which will have important implications for water use and management. These changes also involve potentially important decadal and longer time-scale feedbacks to the climate system through temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture and runoff to the oceans.(Walsh 1995). Freshwater fluxes from the snow cover into the marine environment may be important, as the total flux is probably of the same magnitude as desalinated <b>ridging</b> and rubble areas of sea ice.

2500|$|On 9 February 1999, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} low, that had developed within the monsoon trough about [...] {{to the northeast}} of Cairns, in Queensland, Australia. At this time strong westerly winds persisted around the northern side of the low, however, a weak pressure gradient and light winds existed {{to the south of}} the system and the monsoon trough. This was because of a deep area of low pressure near south-eastern Queensland, had an intense pressure gradient to its south, which prevented the trade winds extending up to the monsoon trough. Throughout 9 February the tropical low moved eastwards under the influence of a middle-to upper-level trough over eastern Australia, however, over the next day the trough dissipated along with the deep area of low pressure. As a result, an area of strong <b>ridging</b> developed to the south of the system, while the trade winds rapidly extended northwards to the monsoon trough. The upper level pattern also became favorable for further development, with an outflow channel forming on the equator-ward side of the system. The low subsequently rapidly intensified during 10 February, with atmospheric convection surrounding the system dramatically improving. The system was subsequently named Rona by the BoM later that day, after it had developed into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. At around the same time the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories and designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 20P, after it had become equivalent to a tropical storm.
