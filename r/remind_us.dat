5|$|My {{heart goes}} out to the {{families}} of those lost in the Challenger disaster. The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E
25|$|We {{eat only}} Maror, a bitter herb, to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of the {{bitterness}} of slavery that our ancestors endured while in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Living {{as we do}} in a {{world of}} many faiths, this {{experience}} has served to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that we must all be conscious of the sensibilities of others.|$|E
50|$|The V {{for victory}} <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> {{to work for}} {{personal}} achievement.|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{we teach}} writing {{only as the}} act of [...] "bringing out what is within," [...] we risk {{undermining}} our own efforts. Intertextuality <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "carrying out ritual activities" [...] {{is also part of}} the writing process. Barthes <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "the 'I' which approaches the text is already itself a plurality of other texts, of codes which are infinite".|$|R
60|$|The {{mention of}} Skipping Rabbit <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> {{that we have}} {{something}} {{more to say about}} her.|$|R
25|$|At Quéménéven, Henry Prigent was the {{sculptor}} {{of the statue}} of Saint Lawrence who carries a closed book and a gridiron to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of the nature of his martyrdom.|$|E
25|$|Fairfield Road had {{originally}} been used by Hicks Brothers, a bus operator which Eastern National took over in 1949. A house adjacent to the old depot site survives, to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of a link with the Hicks era.|$|E
25|$|The {{illusion}} of spatial extension through paint, the grandiose theme and {{the skill of}} execution could only astonish and impress the visitor. However, Cortona's panegyric trompe-l'œil extravaganzas may be less popular in a world familiar with minimalism and such like, yet they are precursors of the sunny figures and cherubim infested with rococo excesses. They contrast markedly with the darker naturalism prominent in Caravaggisti works and with the classicising compositions by painters such as Domenichino and Andrea Sacchi, and <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that Baroque painting could be grand in an epic manner and exuberant in spirit.|$|E
5000|$|Shelli Sonstein of New York's Q104.3 FM remarked: [...] "...it's {{a really}} unusual movie ...with an {{interesting}} twist. There {{is a spiritual}} voice in this movie that I had not heard before or seen before in a movie, so it's done in a really creative way. It <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> of our history and it also <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> {{of the reality of}} today for the Lakota...very educational." ...|$|R
25|$|Anonymity is {{the spiritual}} {{foundation}} {{of all our}} traditions, ever <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> to place principles before personalities.|$|R
5000|$|A happy ending, with a narrating Cheech <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "hey, {{things are}} tough all over." ...|$|R
25|$|With the {{so-called}} Primary Chronicle, also attributed to Nestor, begins the {{long series of}} the Russian annalists. There is a regular catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the seventeenth century. Besides the work attributed to Nestor the Chronicler, we have chronicles of Novgorod, Kiev, Volhynia and many others. Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists, Pskov and Suzdal among others. In some respects these compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters, <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of Herodotus, dry details alternating with {{here and there a}} picturesque incident; and many of these annals abound with the quaintest stories.|$|E
25|$|The next eleven poems {{relate to}} the loves of Sulpicia and Cerinthus. Sulpicia was a Roman lady of high station and, {{according}} to Moritz Haupt's conjecture, the daughter of Valeria, Messalla's sister. The Sulpicia elegies divide into two groups. The first comprises iv. 2-6, containing ninety-four lines, in which {{the theme of the}} attachment is worked up into five graceful poems. The second, iv. 8-12, consists of Sulpicia's own letters. They are very short, only forty lines in all; but they have a unique interest as being the only love poems by a Roman woman that have survived. Their frank and passionate outpourings <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of Catullus. The style and metrical handling betray a novice in poetical writing. The thirteenth poem (twenty-four lines) claims to be by Tibullus; but it is hardly more than a cento from Tibullus and Propertius. The fourteenth is a little epigram of four lines with nothing to determine its authorship. Last of all comes the epigram or fragment of Domitius Marsus already referred to.|$|E
500|$|Peter Cleminson, {{national}} chairman of The Royal British Legion, thanked Radiohead {{for their support}} and said [...] "Radiohead has picked up the torch from Harry Patch to hold it high. [...] Radiohead uses Harry's own words to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of the horrors of war, and we believe Harry would be pleased." ...|$|E

50|$|Gangs of Wasseypur - For <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> that s***a Hindustan mein jab tak cinema hai, log bante rahenge.|$|R
5000|$|The Indian Express writes, [...] "The title song <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> of the {{dramatic}} highs of SS Rajamouli film." ...|$|R
500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan {{rated the}} episode a B−. Sarah Stegall awarded the episode five stars {{out of five}} and noted [...] "Being dead has done wonders for Fox Mulder." [...] Stegall {{concluded}} that the episode [...] "is {{one of the best}} episodes of the new era. Mulder and Scully get one last chance to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> why we will miss them, and Doggett and Reyes get a chance to earn their stripes. [...] If this is the season where the torch gets passed, it's good to see that it's got one last flare in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Widmerpool's egotism and will-power enable him, once set, {{to carry}} all before him, {{although}} before his ultimate downfall his powers develop in somewhat sinister directions. [...] In {{a review of}} the early novels in the sequence, Arthur Mizener wrote: [...] "Powell makes his great egoists, for all their absurdity, something not essentially different from all the rest of us; even Widmerpool, the most extravagant of the lot, is not. However sublimely ridiculous he becomes, he continues to <b>remind</b> <b>us,</b> not so much, perhaps, of what we have done, as what we have, in our time, known we might do".|$|E
500|$|The Audubon society, {{reviewing}} {{the importance of}} birds in 2013, obtained statements from many people with differing perspectives. Among them, the society's science director, Gary Langham, noted that {{what is good for}} birds is also good for humans. The writer David Allen Sibley observed that birds bring a little wildness into parks and gardens. The writer Barbara Kingsolver noted that birds are part of life on earth. The actress Jane Alexander wrote [...] "Birds <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that there are angels." [...] The forensic ornithologist Carla Dove noted that birds are biological indicators of habitat health, climate change, and the coming of spring.|$|E
5000|$|Paan Singh Tomar - For <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> why {{we always}} (secretly) loved the dacoits {{more than the}} heroes.|$|R
5000|$|The Laurel Wreath - {{a symbol}} of Victory, <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> to give the best in all that we do ...|$|R
5000|$|The Pacific won a Peabody Award in 2010 for [...] "this series <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> of the necessities—and the costs—of service." ...|$|R
500|$|The fungus is {{associated}} with Judas Iscariot because of the belief that he hanged himself on an elder tree after his betrayal of Jesus Christ. Folklore suggests that the ears are Judas's returned spirit, and are all that are left to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of his suicide. The common name of the fungus was originally [...] "Judas's ear", but this was later shortened to [...] "Judas ear" [...] and, in the late 19th century, shortened again to [...] "Jew's ear". Common names for the fungus which refer to Judas {{can be traced back}} to at least the end of the 16th century; for instance, in the 17th century, Thomas Browne wrote of the species: ...|$|E
500|$|... 'Dance for You' puts [...] in the bedroom. Clocking in at over 6 minutes, {{the song}} of {{seduction}} plays {{as if it was}} being undressed, much like [...] is, piece by piece, lyric for lyric. As with'Speechless' and 'Cater 2 U', [...] often forgoes the independent woman anthems and beautiful power ballads to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that she is a real sexual being rather than a formulated sex symbol. It is breathy, but not boring. It does not chronicle innocent lovemaking with sugarcoated terms, but the grittier things that really go down when you are completely comfortable (and overly confident) with, as she puts it, the person 'you'd like to thank, in case you don't thank them enough'.|$|E
500|$|The 25th piece came {{suitably}} Halloween-themed. Located on the Bowery, it {{exhibited a}} Grim Reaper riding a bumper car in circles to an elaborate light show, fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult's (Don't Fear) The Reaper. The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mockery interpretation, with Banksy stating that often [...] "the role {{of art is}} to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of our mortality," [...] implying that with this mounted art show that goes on [...] "for so long we wish we were dead already." [...] The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installations message, paying homage to the [...] "ghosts of Bowry," [...] as the antique store owner suggested.|$|E
50|$|Published by Durieux in 2013 {{her novel}} X with themes ranging from love, over {{symbolism}} {{in art and}} in nature, through the friction a woman artist is often facing in contemporary society. Art critic Nađa Bobičić nevertheless <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> of the struggle towards the end, {{at which point the}} reader is awarded with an ending devoid of naivete, one which is full of optimism, one which <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> of the cycles of creation and renewal.|$|R
50|$|Paul Is Gay Guy - A {{frequent}} caller to {{the show}} who always <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> that Paul, in fact, is gay.|$|R
5000|$|... "This {{designation}} <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> all of thecontributions of this immigrant {{woman whose}} {{life and work}} illustrates the mostnoble of Canadian values." ...|$|R
500|$|Newsdays Diane Werts {{rendered}} a more mixed verdict, {{saying the}} episode [...] "veer wildly from bull's-eye satire to gotta-fill-time-now exposition", {{and was not}} as enjoyable for non-Star Wars fans. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic also gave it a mixed review, criticizing the writers for using the character of Herbert and the episode's musical moment which he called an [...] "un-amusing waste of time", although he did praise {{the way that the}} episode satirized the Star Wars universe; he ended his review by saying that [...] "Chances are the more you like Star Wars, the more you will enjoy this. For those of us who know Family Guy better than Star Wars, there is plenty of bad material here to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that nothing much has changed". He gave the episode sixty-five out of a possible one-hundred.|$|E
500|$|Falle is a {{professor}} at Humber College in Toronto, where she teaches in the police foundations program, educating on the subject of social justice. One of her students, Brittany Swartzentruber, said that Falle's lectures would {{have a significant impact on}} Swartzentruber's career as a police officer, saying, [...] "She was one of the best speakers I have ever heard." [...] Falle partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit, which developed the statistic that the average age for a girl to become involved in prostitution in Canada is 14. According to Falle's research, the average age is between 13 and 16. York Regional Police drugs and vice unit Detective Thai Truong said that all law enforcement personnel should hear stories like Falle's because [...] "they <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that they are not just prostitutes or escorts, but they are somebody's daughter, somebody's sister, somebody's wife." ...|$|E
500|$|On release, [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)"'s lyrical affectations {{provoked}} {{comment from}} American reviewers in particular. Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone remarked {{that there were}} [...] "lots of 'Ye's' to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> it's a ballad", but identified the song {{as part of the}} album's [...] "musical core", the [...] "brooding essays on living, loving, and dying". Village Voice contributor Nicholas Schaffner recognised it as an [...] "olde English ballad" [...] dedicated to what he mistakenly called [...] "George's 17th-century castle". To the NMEs Alan Smith, the track was a [...] "meandering song-tale... which may take a little longer for me to appreciate". Acknowledging that listeners in 1970–71 might have been [...] "mystified" [...] by Harrison's lyrics, Bruce Spizer has written of this [...] "catchy ballad": [...] "its beautiful melody and hook-laden refrain ensured that it {{would be one of the}} album's highlights." ...|$|E
5000|$|The CAST <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> of the {{importance}} to [...] "See it Now" [...] (Reprise) before {{the wonders of the}} world disappear.|$|R
60|$|In {{those words}} Sergeant Cuff <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> that, {{even in the}} Detective Police, a man may have a {{reputation}} to lose.|$|R
2500|$|... "Anonymity is {{the spiritual}} {{foundation}} {{of all our}} traditions, ever <b>reminding</b> <b>us</b> to place principles before personalities." [...] (12th Tradition, Basic Text) ...|$|R
