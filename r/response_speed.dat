If the particle travels slowly then the disturbance elastically relaxes back to mechanical equilibrium as the particle passes.

25|$|The neurobehavioral {{assessment}} battery {{that was}} used in the Van Dongen et al. study included the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). The PVT - which determines alertness and the effects of fatigue on cognitive performance (as determined by lapses in response time and accuracy of responses) by measuring the speed with which subjects respond to a visual or auditory stimulus (by pressing a response button) - has become a standard laboratory tool for the assessment of sustained performance in a variety of experimental conditions. The PVT detects changes in basic neurobehavioral performance that involve vigilant attention, <b>response</b> <b>speed,</b> and impulsivity; and it has been extensively validated in ground-based laboratory studies to detect cognitive deficits that are caused by a variety of factors (e.g., restricted sleep, sleep/wake shifts, motion sickness, residual sedation from sleep medications). The PVT is an optimal tool for repeated use, in contrast to some other cognitive measures, as studies have shown no minimal learning effects and aptitude differences when using the PVT.|$|E

In Experiment 1, participants (N = 20) were exposed to a 5 -phase temporal relational responding task.

2500|$|The next area of {{responsibility}} involves the triage of incoming calls, providing expert systematized caller interrogation, using the script provided by the Emergency Medical Dispatch system, {{in order to determine}} the likely severity of the patient's illness or injury, so that the most appropriate type of response resource may be expedited. [...] All calls are prioritized by medical symptom/condition acuity. [...] This process may be further complicated by panic-stricken callers who scream, cry, or make unreasonable demands. [...] The trained EMD uses interpersonal and crisis management skills to sort through these distractions, taking control of the conversation, calming the caller, and extracting the necessary information. [...] This inquiry begins with the obvious questions regarding whether the patient is conscious or breathing. [...] The questioning will continue until the EMD is able to qualify a potentially life-threatening condition, at which time the closest appropriate response resource (such as a paramedic-staffed ambulance service) is notified to initiate pinpointing the call location. [...] When this occurs, the EMD will continue the questioning, attempting to gather additional relevant information, useful to determine <b>response</b> <b>speed,</b> the type of resources dispathed, or the type of equipment that the paramedics will bring to the site when they arrive. [...] In most cases, this 'pre-alert' function will not be required, and the resource will simply be dispatched when all of the required information has been gathered. [...] Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed, or when to interrupt the established process, requires the judgment of the EMD handling the call. [...] Otherwise, the manner in which this questioning proceeds is often governed by protocols, or by decision-support software.|$|E

40|$|To compare {{direct and}} {{indirect}} indices of attention we used the ANTI-V paradigm (Roca et al., 2011), which includes a primary task (providing independent measures of phasic alertness, orienting, and executive control) and a secondary task (providing direct measures of vigilance). Fifty-four students participated in the experiment. Accuracy in the primary task was at ceiling, while the pattern of <b>response</b> <b>speeds</b> displayed the expected effects related to phasic alertness, orienting, and executive control. An unexpected correlation between phasic alertness and executive control speed scores was also obtained. As regards the secondary task, both accuracy and speed scores were obtained, allowing us to discover a moderate speed-accuracy trade-off between the two tasks: higher accuracy in the secondary go/no go task {{was associated with the}} slowing down of speed in the primary yes/no task. Averaging over various conditions of the primary task (i. e., independent of alerting tone presence, cue validity, and flanker congruency) a strong correlation was obtained between <b>response</b> <b>speeds</b> in primary and secondary tasks.

Deriving such relations results in lower accuracy and slower <b>response</b> <b>speeds</b> compared to derived relations identical to those trained. The ability of an individual to derive relations different to those trained {{is a measure of}} relational flexibility and predicts performance on standard cognitive tests. In the current study, 23 younger (M&# 8201;=&# 8201; 19 years) and 23 older (M&# 8201;=&# 8201; 61 years) participants observed pairs of stimuli presented consecutively (A B) and then evaluated statements including the stimuli in the same (A BEFORE B) or reversed order (B AFTER A).

Older adults exhibited deficits in relational flexibility compared to younger adults, such as slower progression through experimental phases, particularly in correctly responding to reversed statements.

50|$|The {{ability to}} learn {{temporal}} patterns in sequenced actions was investigated in elementary-school age children. Temporal learning depends upon a process of integrating timing patterns with action sequences. Children ages 6-13 and young adults performed a serial response time task in which a response and a timing sequence were presented repeatedly in a phase-matched manner, allowing for integrative learning. The degree of integrative learning was measured as the slowing in performance that resulted when phase-shifting the sequences. Learning was similar {{for the children and}} adults on average but increased with age for the children. Executive function measured by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) performance as well as a measure of <b>response</b> <b>speed</b> also improved with age. Finally, WCST performance and <b>response</b> <b>speed</b> predicted temporal learning.

The UV-light irradiation effectively reduced the resistances of all sensors, enhanced their NO 2 responses in some cases, and tended to accelerate their <b>response</b> and recovery <b>speeds</b> in dry air, because the UV-light irradiation promoted the adsorption and desorption of NO 2 -species on the surface. The SnO 2 sensor showed the largest NO 2 response in dry air, among all the pristine oxide sensors, especially under weak UV-light irradiation (≤ 35 mW cm− 2), together with relatively fast <b>response</b> and recovery <b>speeds.</b> The Pd or Pt loading onto SnO 2 enhanced the NO 2 response of the SnO 2 sensor and accelerated their <b>response</b> and recovery <b>speeds</b> in dry air, while XPS analysis indicated {{that most of the}} Pd and Pt nanoparticles loaded on the surface were oxidized after heat treatment at 500 °C.

40|$|Undergraduates {{participated in}} two {{experiments}} to develop methods {{for the experimental}} analysis of self-reports about behavior. The target behavior was the choice response in a delayed-matching-to-sample task in which monetary reinforcement was contingent upon both speed and accuracy of the choice. In Experiment 1, the temporal portion of the contingency was manipulated within each session, and the presence and absence of feedback about reinforcement was manipulated across sessions. As the time limits became stricter, target <b>response</b> <b>speeds</b> increased, but accuracy and reinforcement rates decreased. When feedback was withheld, further reductions in speed and reinforcement occurred, but only at the strictest time limit. Thus, the procedures were successful in producing systematic variation in the speed, accuracy, and reinforcement of the target behavior. Experiment 2 was designed to assess the influence of these characteristics on self-reports. In self-report conditions, each target response {{was followed by a}} computer-generated query: “Did you earn points?” The subject reported by pressing “Yes” or “No” buttons, with the sole consequence of advancing the session. In some cases, feedback about reinforcement of the target response followed the reports; in other cases it was withheld. Self-reports were less accurate when the target responses occurred under greater time pressure. When feedback was withheld, the speed of the target response influenced reports, in that the probability of a “Yes” report increased directly with the speed of accurate target responses. In addition, imposing the self-report procedure disrupted target performance by reducing <b>response</b> <b>speeds</b> at the strictest time limit. These results allow investigation of issues in both behavioral and cognitive psychology. More important, the overall order in the data suggests promise for the experimental analysis of self-reports by human subjects...|$|R
