5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich <b>recipes</b> prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the <b>recipes</b> often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E

5|$|English tastes evolved {{during the}} sixteenth century {{in at least three}} ways. Firstly, <b>recipes</b> emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Secondly, butter becomes an {{important}} ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Thirdly, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the <b>recipes</b> for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat <b>recipes</b> still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and dried fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes alongside familiar Medieval <b>recipes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Everything Tastes Better with Bacon: 70Fabulous <b>Recipes</b> for Every Meal of the Day is a {{book about}} cooking with bacon written by Sara Perry.

5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian <b>recipes</b> and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are <b>recipes</b> for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the <b>recipes</b> in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian <b>recipes</b> including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables.

Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal <b>recipes</b> in addition to <b>recipes</b> from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the effects {{and characteristics of}} Fuzheng Huayu <b>recipe,</b> a compound Chinese herbal medicine, and its decomposed therapies against hepatocyte apoptosis in mice with hepatic injury. Methods: A total of 50 male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: control group, untreated group, Fuzheng Huayu <b>recipe</b> group, Fuzheng <b>recipe</b> group and Huayu <b>recipe</b> group. Hepatocyte apoptosis in mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (10 μg/kg) and galactosamine (900 mg/kg). The mice in drug-treated groups were administered with Fuzheng Huayu <b>recipe,</b> Fuzheng <b>recipe</b> and Huayu <b>recipe</b> by garvage respectively 3 days before injection of lipopolysaccharide and galactosamine. The mice were sacrificed 6 hours after the administration of lipopolysaccharide and galactosamine. The activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and superoxide dimutase (SOD) and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) were examined by colorimetric method. Inflammation and necrosis in liver tissue were observed with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Hepatocyte apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining. Protein expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor type Ⅰ (TNFR 1) was analyzed with Western blotting. Expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA was analyzed with real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Compared with the untreated group, Fuzheng Huayu <b>recipe,</b> Fuzheng <b>recipe</b> and Huayu <b>recipe</b> attenuated hepatocyte apoptosis, decreased the serum ALT and AST activities and MDA content, and improved the SOD activity in liver tissues. Of the three groups, the effect of Fuzheng Huayu <b>recipe</b> group was the best, Fuzheng <b>recipe</b> group was better than Huayu <b>recipe</b> group. Compared with the untreated group, all drugs exerted good effects in decreasing TNF-α mRNA expression, and Fuzheng Huyu <b>recipe</b> {{was better than the}} others. The expression of TNFR 1 protein in the untreated group was increased with the occurrence of hepatocyte apoptosis, however, only Fuzheng Huayu <b>recipe</b> decreased the elevated TNFR 1 protein expression. Conclusion: Fuzheng <b>recipe</b> exerts a good effect in attenuating hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo, which has synergistic effects with Huayu <b>recipe</b> in attenuating hepatocyte apoptosis, and the potential mechanism is partially due to their different effects in alleviating oxidative stress in liver and down-regulating the expression of TNFR 1 protein...|$|R
