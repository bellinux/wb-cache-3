5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers,</b> producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
25|$|The <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> try to {{maintain}} an arterial CO2 pressure of 40mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO2 content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.|$|E
25|$|The {{breathing}} rate increases when the partial pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} in the blood increases. This is detected by central blood gas chemoreceptors on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata. The aortic and carotid bodies, are the peripheral blood gas chemoreceptors which are particularly sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of O2 though they also respond, but less strongly, to the partial pressure of CO2. At sea level, under normal circumstances, the {{breathing rate}} and depth, is determined primarily by the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide rather than by the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, which is allowed to vary within a fairly wide range before the <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> in the medulla oblongata and pons respond to it to change the rate and depth of breathing.|$|E

25|$|Caffeine is an {{antagonist}} at {{all four}} adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), although with varying potencies. The affinity (KD) values of caffeine {{for the human}} adenosine receptors are 12μM at A1, 2.4μM at A2A, 13μM at A2B, and 80μM at A3. Knockout mouse studies have specifically implicated antagonism of the A2A receptor as responsible for the wakefulness-promoting effects of caffeine. Antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine stimulates the medullary vagal, vasomotor, and <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers,</b> which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels. Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., monoamines and acetylcholine), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects; adenosine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. Heart palpitations are caused by blockade of the A1 receptor.|$|E
2500|$|Ventilation of {{the lungs}} in mammals occurs via the <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. These areas form a series of neural {{pathways}} which receive information about the partial pressures of oxygen and {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood. [...] This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli {{of the lungs}}, to keep these pressures constant. The respiratory center does so via motor nerves which activate the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration.|$|E
2500|$|The iron lung {{now has a}} {{marginal}} place in modern respiratory therapy. Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern mechanical ventilators that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and {{have the advantage of}} not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [...] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as central hypoventilation syndrome, in which failure of the medullary <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> {{at the base of the}} brain results in patients having no autonomic control of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, Dianne Odell, had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be contraindicated. There are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts. Joan Headley of Post-Polio Health International said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung. That figure may be inaccurately low; Houston alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008. Martha Mason of Lattimore, North Carolina, died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, faintness, and {{in severe}} cases, {{seizures}} and coma. If brain herniation occurs, respiratory symptoms or respiratory arrest can also occur due to compression of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> in the pons and medulla oblongata.|$|E
5000|$|The {{neurological}} pathway for involuntary respiration {{is called}} the bulbospinal pathway. It is {{also referred to as}} the descending respiratory pathway. [...] “The pathway descends along the spinal ventralateral column. The descending tract for autonomic inspiration is located laterally, and the tract for autonomic expiration is located ventrally.” [...] Autonomic Inspiration is controlled by the pontine respiratory center and both medullary <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers.</b> In our case, the VRG controls autonomic exhalation. Signals from the VRG are sent along the spinal cord to several nerves. These nerves include the intercostals, phrenic, and abdominals. [...] These nerves lead to the specific muscles they control. The bulbospinal pathway descending from the VRG allows the <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> to control muscle relaxation, which leads to exhalation.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>{{respiratory}}</b> <b>centers</b> {{are divided}} into four major groups, two in the medulla and two in the pons. The two groups in the medulla are the dorsal respiratory group and the ventral respiratory group. The two groups in the pons are the pneumotaxic center (also known as the pontine respiratory group), and the apneustic center.|$|E
50|$|The {{rate and}} depth of {{breathing}} is automatically controlled by the <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> that receive information from the peripheral and central blood gas chemoreceptors. These chemoreceptors continuously monitor the partial pressures {{of carbon dioxide and}} oxygen in the arterial blood. The sensors are, firstly, the central blood gas chemoreceptors {{on the surface of the}} medulla oblongata of the brain stem which are particularly sensitive to pH as well as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The second group of sensors measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. Together the latter are known as the peripheral blood gas chemoreceptors which are situated in the aortic and carotid bodies. Information from all of these blood gas chemoreceptors is conveyed to the <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> in the pons and medulla oblongata, which responds to deviations in the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood from normal by adjusting the rate {{and depth of}} breathing, in such a way as to restore partial pressure of carbon dioxide back to 5.3 kPa (40 mm Hg), the pH to 7.4 and, to a lesser extent, the partial pressure of oxygen to 13 kPa (100 mm Hg). For instance, exercise increases the production of carbon dioxide by the active muscles. This carbon dioxide diffuses into the venous blood, and ultimately raises the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This is immediately sensed by the carbon dioxide chemoreceptors on the brain stem. The <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> respond to this information by causing the rate and depth of breathing to increase to such an extent that the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood return almost immediately to the same levels as at rest. The <b>respiratory</b> <b>centers</b> communicate with the muscles of breathing via motor nerves, of which the phrenic nerves, which innervate the diaphragm, are probably the most important.|$|E
