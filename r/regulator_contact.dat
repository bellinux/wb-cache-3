40|$|Contact {{inhibition}} of cell movement and proliferation {{is critical for}} proper organogenesis and tissue remodeling. We show here a novel regulatory mechanism for this contact inhibition using cultured vascular endothelial cells. When the cells were confluently cultured, Necl- 4 was up-regulated and localized at cell-cell contact sites where it cis-interacted with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor. This interaction inhibited the tyrosine-phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor through protein-tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 13 (PTPN 13), eventually reducing cell movement and proliferation. When the cells were sparsely cultured, Necl- 4 was down-regulated but accumulated at leading edges where it inhibited the activation of Rho-associated protein kinase through PTPN 13, eventually facilitating the VEGF-induced activation of Rac 1 and enhancing cell movement. Necl- 4 further facilitated the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2, eventually enhancing cell proliferation. Thus, Necl- 4 serves as a novel <b>regulator</b> for <b>contact</b> {{inhibition of}} cell movement and proliferation cooperatively with the VEGF receptor and PTPN 13...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{wide variety}} of {{different}} cell types {{have been shown to}} respond to nanofabricated growth surfaces via the process of contact guidance, however {{little is known about the}} intracellular mechanisms that control these events. In the present study we have identified the multi-functional signalling adaptor protein, RACK 1, as a novel negative <b>regulator</b> of <b>contact</b> guidance on custom-engineered nanometric grooves. We found that over-expression of RACK 1 in human breast cancer cells leads to a pro-adherent morphology characterised by the formation of stress fibres and focal adhesions. Enforced expression of RACK 1 also limits the response of cells to contact guidance on nanometric grooves. In contrast, ablation of RACK 1 protein with specific anti-sense oligonucleotides led to a dramatic enhancement of bi-directional extension of cells on nanometrically deep grooved surfaces, with a corresponding loss of focal adhesions and stress fibres. RACK 1 therefore exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on cell contact guidance, while positively promoting an adhesive phenotype. This is the first example of an intracellular signalling molecule involved in the regulation of cell contact guidance on nanometric growth surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Horse-spleen {{ferritin}} or {{bovine serum}} albumin conjugated to colloidal gold (BSA-gold) were injected subcutaneously in preimmunized mice. In draining lymph nodes both antigens {{were located in}} macrophages or between the cytoplasmic processes of follicular dendritic cells (FDC). Some of the antigens remained trapped on FDC until day 31 after injection. Simultaneous injection of both antigens showed that they were located between the infoldings of the same FDC. These cells are thus able to retain at least two different antigens on their surface. The peculiar arrangement of ferritin between the cytoplasmic infoldings suggests that this antigen is fixed on both cell membranes by specific antibodies. The trapped immune complexes could thus stabilize the FDC membrane system. The antigen retention requires the presence of specific antibodies since BSA-gold or ferritin injected without preimmunization were not found between FDC processes. Nonantigenic materials, such as colloidal gold or carbon particles, are not trapped by FDC, except when injected in large amounts. The antigens were trapped {{on the surface of}} FDC, however unfrequently in close contact with lymphocytes.

40|$|Contact {{inhibition}} is {{a fundamental}} process in multicellular organisms aimed at inhibiting proliferation at high cellular densities through poorly characterized intracellular signals, despite availability of growth factors. We have previously identified the protein kinase p 38 α as a novel <b>regulator</b> of <b>contact</b> inhibition, as p 38 α is activated upon cell-cell contacts and p 38 α-deficient cells are impaired in both confluence-induced proliferation arrest and p 27 Kip 1 accumulation. Here, we establish that p 27 Kip 1 {{plays a key role}} downstream of p 38 α to arrest proliferation at high cellular densities. Surprisingly, p 38 α does not directly regulate p 27 Kip 1 expression levels but leads indirectly to confluent upregulation of p 27 Kip 1 and cell cycle arrest via the inhibition of mitogenic signals originating from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Hence, confluent activation of p 38 α uncouples cell proliferation from mitogenic stimulation by inducing EGFR degradation through downregulation of the EGFR-stabilizing protein Sprouty 2 (Spry 2). Accordingly, confluent p 38 α-deficient cells fail to downregulate Spry 2, providing them in turn with sustained EGFR signaling that facilitates cell overgrowth and oncogenic transformation. Our results provide novel mechanistic insight into the role of p 38 α as a sensor of cell density, which induces confluent cell cycle arrest via the Spry 2 -EGFR-p 27 Kip 1 network...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe nuclear lamina (NL) {{interacts with}} {{hundreds}} of large genomic regions termed lamina associated domains (LADs). The dynamics of these interactions and the relation to epigenetic modifications are poorly understood. We visualized the fate of LADs in single cells using a “molecular contact memory” approach. In each nucleus, only ∼ 30 % of LADs are positioned at the periphery; these LADs are in intermittent molecular contact with the NL but remain constrained to the periphery. Upon mitosis, LAD positioning is not detectably inherited but instead is stochastically reshuffled. Contact of individual LADs with the NL is linked to transcriptional repression and H 3 K 9 dimethylation in single cells. Furthermore, we identify the H 3 K 9 methyltransferase G 9 a as a <b>regulator</b> of NL <b>contacts.</b> Collectively, these results highlight principles of the dynamic spatial architecture of chromosomes in relation to gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRecent {{evidence}} suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules mark the sites where the GTPase Drp 1 promotes mitochondrial fission via a largely unknown mechanism. Here, we show that the SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (Syn 17) is present on raft-like structures of ER-mitochondria contact sites and promotes mitochondrial fission by determining Drp 1 localization and activity. The hairpin-like C-terminal hydrophobic domain, including Lys- 254, but not the SNARE domain, is important for this regulation. Syn 17 also regulates ER Ca 2 + homeostasis and interferes with Rab 32 -mediated regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Starvation disrupts the Syn 17 -Drp 1 interaction, thus favoring mitochondrial elongation during autophagy. Because we also demonstrate that Syn 17 is an ancient SNARE, {{our findings suggest that}} Syn 17 is one of the original key <b>regulators</b> for ER-mitochondria <b>contact</b> sites present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. As such, Syn 17 acts as a switch that responds to nutrient conditions and integrates functions for the ER and autophagosomes with mitochondrial dynamics...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) -related {{proteins}} (ORPs) are conserved from yeast to humans, and {{implicated in}} the regulation of lipid homeostasis and in signaling pathways. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has seven ORPs (Osh 1 –Osh 7) that share one unknown essential function. Here, we report the 1. 5 – 2. 3  Å structures of the PH domain and ORD (OSBP-related domain) of yeast Osh 3 in apo-form or in complex with phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PI[4]P). Osh 3 recognizes PI(4) P by the highly conserved residues in the tunnel of ORD whereas it lacks sterol binding due to the narrow hydrophobic tunnel. Yeast complementation tests suggest that PI(4) P binding to PH and ORD is essential for function. This study suggests that the unifying feature in all ORP homologs is the binding of PI(4) P to ORD and sterol binding is additional to certain homologs. Structural modeling of full-length Osh 3 {{is consistent with the}} concept that Osh 3 is a lipid transfer protein or <b>regulator</b> in membrane <b>contact</b> sites...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn {{the process}} of {{neuronal}} wiring, axons derived from the same functional group typically extend together, resulting in fascicle formation. How these axons {{communicate with one another}} remains largely unknown. Here, we show that protocadherin- 17 (Pcdh 17) supports this group extension by recruiting actin polymerization <b>regulators</b> to interaxonal <b>contact</b> sites. Pcdh 17 is expressed by a subset of amygdala neurons, and it accumulates at axon-axon boundaries because of homophilic binding. Pcdh 17 knockout in mice suppressed the extension of these axons. Ectopically expressed Pcdh 17 altered the pattern of axon extension. In in vitro cultures, wild-type growth cones normally migrate along other axons, whereas Pcdh 17 null growth cones do not. Pcdh 17 recruits the WAVE complex, Lamellipodin, and Ena/VASP to cell-cell contacts, converting these sites into motile structures. We propose that, through these mechanisms, Pcdh 17 maintains the migration of growth cones that are in contact with other axons, thereby supporting their collective extension...|$|R

Expression of this gene is controlled by the HlyU <b>regulator</b> by direct <b>contact</b> of the DNA upstream of the rtxA 1 toxin operon acting as a derepressor of the H-NS protein. The crystal structure suggests that HlyU forms a homodimer in vitro. However, knowledge of the biological implications of these findings in vivo is limited. In this work, we endeavored to dissect, using genetic and biochemical approaches, the domains of this protein that are essential for homodimer formation and the interaction of HlyU with the target DNA. We identified that residues L 18, N 22, R 25, S 54, Q 55, L 57, W 59, R 61, K 70, and Y 77 are essential for the HlyU protein binding to the DNA and that amino acids L 17 and L 91 are important for HlyU dimerization.

However, cellobiosepositive (Cel^+) mutants arise upon prolonged incubation on media containing cellobiose {{as the sole}} carbon source. We show that the Cel^+ derivatives carry two classes of mutations that act concertedly to alter the regulation of the chb operon involved in the utilization of N,N^'-diacetylchitobiose. These consist of mutations that abrogate negative regulation by the repressor NagC as well as single base-pair changes in the transcriptional regulator chbR that translate into singleamino-acid substitutions. Introduction of chbR from two Cel^+ mutants resulted in activation of transcription from the chb promoter {{at a higher level}} in the presence of cellobiose, in reporter strains carrying disruptions of the chromosomal chbR and nagC. These transformants also showed a Cel^+ phenotype on MacConkey cellobiose medium, suggesting that the wild-type permease and phospho-β-glucosidase, upon induction, could recognize, transport and cleave cellobiose respectively. This was confirmed by expressing the wild-type genes encoding the permease and phospho-β-glucosidase under a heterologous promoter. Biochemical characterization of one of the chbR mutants, chbRN 238 S, showed that the mutant <b>regulator</b> makes stronger <b>contact</b> with the target DNA sequence within the chb promoter and has enhanced recognition of cellobiose 6 -phosphate as an inducer compared with the wild-type regulator...|$|R
40|$|Background—Persistently high plasma endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) {{levels in}} {{diabetic}} patients {{have been associated}} with the development of cardiac fibrosis, which results from the deposition of extracellular matrix and fibroblast recruitment from an as-yet unknown source. The underlying mechanism, however, remains elusive. Here, we hypothesize that ET- 1 might contribute to the accumulation of cardiac fibroblasts through an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in diabetic hearts. Methods and Results—We induced diabetes mellitus in vascular endothelial cell–specific ET- 1 knockout [ET- 1 f/f;Tie 2 -Cre () ] mice and their wild-type littermates using the toxin streptozotocin. Gene expression and histological and functional parameters were examined at 8, 24, and 36 weeks after the induction of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus increased cardiac ET- 1 expression in wild-type mice, leading to mitochondrial disruption and myofibril disarray through the generation of superoxide. Diabetic mice also showed impairment of cardiac microvascularization and a decrease in cardiac vascular endothelial growth factor expression. ET- 1 further promotes cardiac fibrosis and heart failure through the accumulation of fibroblasts via endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. All of these features were abolished in ET- 1 f/f;Tie 2 -Cre () hearts. Targeted ET- 1 gene silencing by small interfering RNA in cultured human endothelial cells ameliorated high glucose–induced phenotypic transition and acquisition of a fibroblast marker through the inhibition of transforming growth factor- signaling activation and preservation of the endothelial cell-to-cell <b>contact</b> <b>regulator</b> VE-cadherin...|$|R
40|$|The MTERF {{family is}} a large protein family, {{identified}} in metazoans and plants, which consists of four subfamilies, MTERF 1, 2, 3 and 4. Mitochondrial localisation was predicted {{for the vast majority}} of MTERF family members and demonstrated for the characterised MTERF proteins. The main structural feature of MTERF proteins is the presence of a modular architecture, based on repetitions of a 30 -residue module, the mTERF motif, containing leucine zipperlike heptads. The MTERF family includes transcription termination factors: human mTERF, sea urchin mtDBP and Drosophila DmTTF. In addition to terminating transcription, they are involved in transcription initiation and in the control of mtDNA replication. This multiplicity of functions seems to flank differences in the gene organisation of mitochondrial genomes.

Regulation of MTERF gene expression in human and Drosophila depends on nuclear transcription factors NRF- 2 and DREF, respectively, and proceeds through pathways which appear to discriminate between factors positively or negatively acting in mitochondrial transcription.

The intriguing balance between these risks is more complex than once thought, as endogenous clotting factors and their <b>regulators</b> come into <b>contact</b> with bioincompatible dialyzer membranes, in the setting of an extracorporeal circuit of blood flow, {{in the face of the}} uremic state. In this review, we summarize the current data on the interaction between the physiologic inhibitors of coagulation and hemodialysis. Data sources and study selection were obtained from research and review articles related to the endogenous anticoagulation pathway published in English on MEDLINE from 1972 to 2002. While protein C activity and protein S antigen concentrations are increased, there is no change in antithrombin III levels during hemodialysis in relation to predialysis levels. Plasma protein Z, which has only recently been studied in uremic subjects, is increased as well. In addition, hemodialysis leads to elevated tissue factor plasminogen inhibitor, thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 activities. The potential functional significance of these observations is discussed. Finally, as erythropoietin is commonly prescribed to uremic patients and is recognized to be prothrombotic, an appraisal of its interaction with the naturally occurring anticoagulants is presented. It is apparent that we are only beginning to realize the complexity of the interplay between this myriad of serum factors and hemodialysis.

40|$|This {{draft report}} {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} the multiple-regulator model in supporting a single national consumer policy framework, and invites feedback from the public. This draft report was released on 8 December 2016. You are invited to examine the draft report and to make written submissions by Monday 23 January 2017. The final report is expected to be handed to the Australian Government by March 2017. Key points 	Despite the adoption of a single Australian Consumer Law (ACL) in 2011, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s consumer protection framework remains complex: 	 		Two Commonwealth and eight State and Territory regulators administer and enforce the generic ACL. 		Numerous specialist safety regulatory regimes complement the ACL. 		Redress is provided via ombudsmen, tribunals and courts, as well as most ACL regulators. 	 	 	The multiple-regulator model for the ACL appears to be operating reasonably effectively given the intrinsic challenges in having 10 regulators administer and enforce one law. 	 		The ACL regulators communicate, coordinate and collaborate with each other through well-developed governance arrangements. 		Some regulators have been criticised for undertaking insufficient enforcement. Limited resources may partly explain this. 		However, the limited evidence available on regulators 2 ̆ 7 resources and performance makes definitive assessments difficult. 	 	 	There is scope to strengthen the ACL 2 ̆ 7 s administration and enforcement. Matters to be addressed include: 	 		developing a national database of consumer complaints and incidents 		providing all State and Territory ACL regulators with the full suite of enforcement tools 		increasing maximum financial penalties for breaches of the ACL 		exempting interim product bans from Commonwealth regulatory impact assessments 		centralising powers for interim product bans and compulsory recalls in the ACCC 		improving the transparency of the resourcing and performance of the ACL regulators. 	 	 	The ACL regulators and specialist safety regulators generally understand the delineation of their remits and interact effectively, notwithstanding a handful of problematic cases. Consumers and suppliers are not always clear about which <b>regulator</b> to <b>contact</b> but they are typically redirected to the right regulator in a timely manner. 	Interactions between ACL and specialist safety regulators could be enhanced through: 	 		greater information sharing between ACL and specialist regulators 		addressing deficiencies in the tools and remedies available to specialist regulators 		regular national forums of building and construction regulators 		greater national consistency in the laws underpinning electrical goods safety.

Its importance is demonstrated by hereditary angioedema (HAE), a severe disease with potentially life-threatening attacks due to deficiency or dysfunction of C 1 -INH. C 1 -INH replacement is the therapy of choice in HAE. In addition, C 1 -INH showed to have beneficial effects in other diseases characterized by inappropriate complement and contact system activation. Due to some limitations of its clinical application, {{there is a need for}} improving the efficacy of therapeutically applied C 1 -INH or to enhance the activity of endogenous C 1 -INH. Given the known potentiating effect of heparin on C 1 -INH, sulfated glycans (SG) may be such candidates. The aim of this study was to characterize suitable SG by evaluating structure-activity relationships. For this, more than 40 structurally distinct SG were examined for their effects on C 1 -INH, C 1 s and FXIIa. The SG turned out to potentiate the C 1 s inhibition by C 1 -INH without any direct influence on C 1 s. Their potentiating activity proved to depend on their degree of sulfation, molecular mass as well as glycan structure. In contrast, the SG had no effect on the FXIIa inhibition by C 1 -INH, but structure-dependently modulated the activity of FXIIa. Among the tested SG, β- 1, 3 -glucan sulfates with a Mr ≤ 10 000 were identified as most promising lead candidates for the development of a glycan-based C 1 -INH amplifier. In conclusion, the obtained information on structural characteristics of SG favoring C 1 -INH potentiation represent an useful elementary basis for the development of compounds improving the potency of C 1 -INH in diseases and clinical situations characterized by inappropriate activation of complement and contact system...|$|R
40|$|The core {{problem in}} robotic tasks {{that require the}} robot {{end-effector}} interaction with its environment, is the control of both robot motion and interaction force. The thesis deals {{with the problem of}} force/motion control under surface kinematic uncertainties that practically arise when the manipulator interacts with objects of unknown geometrical characteristics (flat or curved surfaces) or known objects with unknown position in the robot workspace. Initially, the thesis studies the distortion of the desired force/position trajectories that occurs in cases of surface position and orientation uncertainties. Furthermore, the thesis investigates the effect of kinematic uncertainty introduced by the erroneous estimate of the surface normal direction on the stability and steady state errors of the controlled system for the parallel and hybrid control schemes as well as for a proposed adaptive controller which considers constant estimates. The aforementioned controllers using constant and erroneous estimates of the surface normal direction cannot achieve the actual control target. The other proposed control schemes are designed based on online estimates of the surface normal direction that converge to their actual values enabling the convergence of the actual force/position errors to zero. The surface slope learning can be regarded as the most important contribution of this thesis in the force/position control design problem in contrast with other schemes that use accurate or approximate calculation of the surface slope from force or force/velocities measurements. In particular, the following force/motion control schemes are proposed: a) a force/position <b>regulator</b> for compliant <b>contact</b> without using force measurements, b) a force/motion tracking controller for compliant contact using feedback of the normal force magnitude and c) a force/motion tracking controller for rigid contact using force/torque measurements; the latter can be applied also in case of compliant contact for the force regulation and position trajectory tracking problem. The asymptotic stability of the control system equilibrium is proved by using Lyapunov theory and simulation studies show the performance and robustness of the proposed controllers in operating conditions met in practical applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Adherens {{junctions}} (AJs) {{are responsible}} for the adhesion of cells to their neighbours and influence a range of cellular processes. The formation and maintenance of AJs is governed by members of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases. Activation of the GTPases Rac 1 and RhoA is necessary for the formation of cell-cell contacts in keratinocytes. However, how the GTPases themselves are regulated is not well understood. Rho GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate GTPases by promoting the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Whilst a large number of proteins containing Rho GAP domains have been identified, knowledge of this large family of proteins remains limited. It is predicted that multiple Rho GAPs are required in order to coordinate precise processes that are necessary for the formation and maintenance of cell-cell contacts to occur. However, relatively few Rho GAPs have been identified as <b>regulators</b> of cell-cell <b>contacts.</b> The aims of this project are to 1) identify GAPs involved in the regulation of cell-cell contact formation in keratinocytes and 2) to specifically investigate the role of CdGAP in junction formation and maintenance. To this end, 20 GAPs have been identified from a siRNA screen as potential regulators of junction formation, the vast majority of which have not previously been linked to this process. Subsequently, two Rho-specific GAPs have been investigated to probe their roles in the regulation of Rho in both junction formation and maintenance. The second part of this thesis focuses on the Rac and Cdc 42 -specific GAP CdGAP, which I demonstrate is an important regulator of AJs in keratinocytes. I show that CdGAP is able to interact with the scaffold protein Ajuba. Ajuba is known to localise to cell-cell adhesions, where it is necessary for maintaining Rac activation at junctions. However, Ajuba itself has no catalytic activity. My data suggests cooperation between CdGAP and Ajuba allows Rac levels to be fine-tuned at AJs. Overall, this data identifies numerous Rho GAPs as potential regualtors of junction formation, and confirms {{for the first time the}} importance of three Rho GAPs, ARAP 1, ARHGAP 6 and CdGAP, in the regulation of cell-cell contact formation and maintenance. Ultimately, this work provides further insight into the regulation of AJs by GAPs and enhances our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as Ajuba, are able to influence this tightly controlled process.
