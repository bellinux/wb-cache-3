Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to {{that there was no}} case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) {{in the implementation of}} the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E

5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face is parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane.

5|$|Worrying {{that the}} {{rebellion}} might rapidly reignite and spread, the colonial authorities instigated arbitrary reprisals against the Nyasa population, including mass hut burnings. All weapons were confiscated and fines of 4 shillings per person were levied in the districts {{affected by the}} revolt, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> people in question had been involved. The colonial government also begun attacking the rights of missionaries in Nyasaland and banned many independent churches, including Kitawala, from Nyasaland, and placed restrictions on other African-run churches. Public gatherings, especially those associated with African-initiated religious groups, were banned until 1919. Fear of similar uprisings in other colonies, notably Northern Rhodesia, also led to similar repression of independent churches and foreign missions beyond Nyasaland.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built for the sport, and are unavailable for purchase by the general public because they cannot be legally ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the phasing out of two-stroke engines.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> former slaves were allowed to vote. Republicans began {{looking for a way to}} offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Madagascar {{is unique in}} Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the {{architecture of}} southern Borneo from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar {{are believed to have}} emigrated. Traditional construction in this part of Borneo, also known as South Kalimantan, is distinguished by rectangular houses raised on piles. The roof, which is supported by a central pillar, is steeply sloped; the gable beams cross to form roof horns that may be decoratively carved. The central Highlands of Madagascar are populated by the Merina, peoples who bear strong physiological and cultural resemblance to their Kalimantan ancestors; here, the traditional wooden houses of the aristocracy feature a central pillar (andry) supporting a steeply sloped roof decorated with roof horns (tandro-trano). In the southeast of Madagascar, actual zebu horns were traditionally affixed to the gable peak. Throughout Madagascar, houses are rectangular with a gabled roof as in Kalimantan, central pillars are widespread, and in all but a handful of regions, traditional homes are built on piles in a manner handed down from generation to generation, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> feature is suited to local conditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} granted a {{production}} budget of $60 million, with $30 million funded by New Regency. Brett Ratner's RatPac-Dune Entertainment, {{a joint venture between}} Ratner's RatPac Entertainment and 20th Century Fox's former financing partner, Dune Entertainment, also funded the film. Worldview Entertainment, who also co-financed Birdman, was originally set to fund the film but backed out in July 2014 due to the departure of its CEO, Christopher Woodrow. New Regency approached 20th Century Fox for additional funding, but the company declined, citing the pay-or-play contracts made for both DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, which would require that the actors be paid <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> film is completed. Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison entered negotiations to finance the film shortly after. The Chinese company Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture Company partially financed the film.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2.

In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but {{will be more than}} compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{wanted to}} make a game that was cinematic, yet {{distinguished}} from actual films. Takumi Kawagoe, who creates cutscenes for Nintendo, says that his top priority is to have the player feel in control of the action. To promote this instantaneous continuity of cinematic gameplay, the cutscenes in Ocarina of Time are completely generated with real-time computing on the Nintendo 64 console and do not use prerendered full-motion video. Miyamoto's vision required this real-time architecture for the total of more than 90 minutes of cutscenes, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> console had a vast medium like CD-ROM on which to store prerendered versions. Toru Osawa created the scenario for the game, based on a story idea by Miyamoto and Yoshiaki Koizumi. He was given support by A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening script writer Kensuke Tanabe. Miyamoto said the real-time rendering engine allowed his small team of 3 to 7 cinematic developers to rapidly adjust the storyline and to focus on developing additional gameplay elements even up to the final few months of development, instead of waiting on a repeated prerendering process. The dungeons were designed by Eiji Aonuma.|$|E
