40|$|It is {{conceivable}} that early generations of patterned media will utilize <b>read</b> <b>heads</b> whose dimensions are several times larger than an “island ” of magnetization. For such a scenario, we propose a “multiple islands per <b>read</b> <b>head</b> ” model where the output from the <b>read</b> <b>head</b> {{is a function of}} the magnetization from several independently written tracks of islands. In particular, we focus on a “ 3 islands per <b>read</b> <b>head</b> ” model where the output from the <b>read</b> <b>head</b> {{is a function of the}} magnetization from three independently written tracks of islands. The readback signal is determined from a finite track-width magnetoresistive (MR) head model using reciprocity calculations, and two noise sources—island position jitter and AWGN electronics noise—are considered. By sampling the noisy signal at intervals corresponding to the down-track island separation, we obtain a discrete-time readback channel model whose performance is obtained under maximum-likelihood sequence detection.

5000|$|A {{write head}} magnetises a region by {{generating}} a strong local magnetic field, and a <b>read</b> <b>head</b> detects the magnetisation of the regions.

Later versions of inductive heads included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and thin film heads. As data density increased, <b>read</b> <b>heads</b> using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according {{to the strength of}} the magnetism from the platter.

50|$|Rivalry {{between the}} club and Durham is also a strong theme {{throughout}} the club's history, especially when the club moved up to competing at a university rather than a college level.

50|$|A typical {{cassette}} adapter uses a single-sided writing {{tape head}} (similar to the recording {{head on a}} traditional tape deck) connected to a stereo minijack connector with a cord.

This magnetic signal is then received by the tape deck's <b>reading</b> <b>head,</b> converted back into an electrical signal, and amplified by the sound system. Because most cassette adapters use a single-sided head, they only work in one direction. There are, however, some cassette adapters that have double-sided heads that work in either direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1892, when the University was {{established}} as an extension college of Oxford University.

The boathouse burnt down in 1989, destroying a number of boats worth around £150,000. The current boathouse was built in 1992. The Ortner Boat Club is a club for alumni of RUBC, founded in 1997 and named after former Reading University coach Frank Ortner.|$|E

50|$|Together {{with colleagues}} (in {{particular}} Joël Pynte in Paris) Kennedy has recently addressed {{the problem of}} serial order in <b>reading</b> <b>head</b> on. Proponents of the view that reading {{is a kind of}} “surrogate listening” assume that the reader deals with each word in a strict serial order. You either process a word while looking directly at it, or, in certain cases, manage to attend to the next word without ever looking at it directly (in which case the word concerned may be skipped). In both circumstances words are processed, either overtly or covertly, in their correct serial order. Furthermore, this is a necessary order: the phrases “run home” and “home run” mean quite different things and the only way the two meanings can be disambiguated is to ensure they are looked at in the right order.|$|E

In addition to four one-word registers, the drum has four 32-word channels of working storage from which instructions are picked up to be carried out and data picked up to be operated on in the arithmetic registers.
