5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, <b>rather</b> than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, <b>rather</b> than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards <b>rather</b> than downwards, and leaflets having 9 <b>rather</b> than 7 lateral veins.|$|E
5|$|Air {{transport}} particularly favors light, {{expensive and}} small products: electronic media <b>rather</b> than books, for example, and refined drugs <b>rather</b> than bulk food.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} electronic organs, the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical <b>rather</b> than electronic organs, because the sound is produced by moving parts <b>rather</b> than electronic oscillators.|$|E
5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices <b>rather</b> in quantities (Bertrand competition <b>rather</b> than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax <b>rather</b> a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.|$|E
5|$|However, {{most of the}} {{production}} was for personal use <b>rather</b> than sale.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adult females, {{but have}} broken narrow pale edges of underpart feathers, which give a slightly streaked <b>rather</b> than scalloped appearance, {{and the overall}} appearance is browner <b>rather</b> than uniformly blackish. Juvenile males have brownish-orange feet while juvenile females have brownish feet and a dusky greyish-green bill.|$|E
5|$|Mary, however, is {{depicted}} as authentic <b>rather</b> than artificial, detesting fashionable life <b>rather</b> than yearning after it. Mary's charitable works, for example, are not a passing fad: they are a heartfelt reaction to social injustice. Even though she is older and intellectual instead of young and pretty, Mary asserts her right to sexual desire <b>rather</b> than sublimating it.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} have long, broad wings, are strong fliers and, <b>rather</b> surprisingly, given their size and weight, very capable soarers. The body tends to be elongated, the neck more so, with <b>rather</b> long legs. The bill is also long, decurved {{in the case of}} the ibises, {{straight}} and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills.|$|E
5|$|The final {{song of the}} Bat trilogy is a {{short one}} written by Steinman. A few lyrics of Cry to Heaven begin <b>rather</b> sweet, but turning <b>rather</b> bitter: (Cry baby cry/Cry, cry to heaven/If that doesn't do it for you/Go ahead and cry like hell.) The two parts are bridged by an {{instrumental}} dominated by an Irish flute.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of times}} <b>rather</b> than {{time-out}} and I've got times <b>rather</b> than I call time {{appears to have}} been influenced by older forms such as kings and I've got kings X. There was also one report of times X. Similarly derivatives of time-out are often accompanied by the traditional crossed fingers.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most English public schools, Stonyhurst is {{organised}} horizontally by year groups (known as playrooms) <b>rather</b> than vertically by houses, {{although the}} girls are also split into junior and senior houses. Each playroom has an assigned playroom master, with each cohort moving through the playrooms, having a sequence of playroom masters (<b>rather</b> than a single housemaster).|$|E
5|$|While {{some critics}} have feared the {{revision}} of the Champagne region is about expanding production irrespective of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson {{has pointed out that}} the proposed additions constitute a consolidation <b>rather</b> than expansion. The villages under discussion are situated in gaps inside the perimeter of the existing Champagne regions <b>rather</b> than outside it.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but <b>rather</b> days to weeks after the event; <b>rather</b> than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; <b>rather,</b> it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|All bonus {{songs are}} master recordings, and where marked, include rhythm guitar <b>rather</b> than bass guitar tracks.|$|E
5|$|Angus (performed by Matt Vogel) is a high-strung {{friend of}} Oobi's whose eyes are below his fingers <b>rather</b> than on top.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{immigration}} from New England and New York—regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers <b>rather</b> than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota were laid out so as to heavily favor the business districts <b>rather</b> than the city halls or courthouses. This plan and the philosophy behind it spurred the growth of economic links between the communities and with {{other parts of the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|August: Mark Oliphant {{travels to}} USA to urge {{development}} of a bomb <b>rather</b> than power production.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Bauer (1809–1882) {{taught that}} the first Gospel was a work of {{literature}} that produced history <b>rather</b> than described it.|$|E
5|$|Companions can {{be killed}} upon being reduced to zero hit points, <b>rather</b> than losing consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Doppler bubble {{detection}} allows {{models to}} use bubble formation as an endpoint <b>rather</b> than symptomatic DCS.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} 1279–1281, Przemysł II had a <b>rather</b> {{friendly}} (or at least neutral) relationship {{with all of}} his immediate neighbors.|$|E
5|$|German industry, <b>rather</b> {{than being}} fragile and fixed, {{proved to be}} {{resilient}} and mobile.|$|E
5|$|Gleason was a frog: {{he worked}} as a problem solver <b>rather</b> than a visionary formulating grand theories.|$|E
5|$|Growth control– {{bacteriostatic}} toxins, {{as mentioned}} above, restrict growth <b>rather</b> than killing the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Géza Vermes {{says that}} the {{doctrine}} of the virgin birth of Jesus arose from theological development <b>rather</b> than from historical events.|$|E
5|$|However, the PlayStation 2 version {{does not}} include this {{challenge}} feature. <b>Rather</b> than doing the challenges to unlock avatars/content, all one must do is complete the gig by successfully completing all songs. Not all gigs have content to unlock, <b>rather</b> just those to which a particular unlockable applies (for example the Johnny Cash gig allows Johnny Cash to be unlocked as a playable avatar).|$|E
5|$|Huxley {{identified}} agnosticism {{not as a}} creed but <b>rather</b> as {{a method}} of skeptical, evidence-based inquiry.|$|E
5|$|I would <b>rather</b> say I {{had won a}} race. I {{have never}} been a person for bells and whistles.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that hexamethylbenzene contains a carbon atom with six bonds, <b>rather</b> {{than the usual}} four.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the belief that}} an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium <b>rather</b> than expand outward. In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency <b>rather</b> than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures. This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion. According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural <b>rather</b> than territorial growth.|$|E
5|$|In medusae {{the only}} {{supporting}} structure is the mesoglea. Hydra and most sea anemones close their mouths {{when they are}} not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, <b>rather</b> like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as Tubularia use columns of water-filled cells for support. Sea pens stiffen the mesoglea with calcium carbonate s and tough fibrous proteins, <b>rather</b> like sponges.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages sheep were {{probably}} kept mainly for their milk and wool <b>rather</b> than their meat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, when the Hayden Planetarium was {{undergoing}} a $100 million renovation, Tyson refused {{to refer to}} Pluto as the ninth planet at the planetarium. He explained that he would <b>rather</b> group planets according to their commonalities <b>rather</b> than counting them. This decision resulted in Tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail, primarily from children. In 2009, Tyson wrote a book detailing the demotion of Pluto.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that Corzine would pay his own medical bills <b>rather</b> than bill taxpayers.|$|E
5|$|John Smith's Original (3.6% ABV). The same as Extra Smooth, but carbonated, <b>rather</b> than nitrogenated.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, <b>rather</b> than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (<b>rather</b> than in August as he claimed), received regular pay <b>rather</b> than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
