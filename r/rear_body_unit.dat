5000|$|The LVS is {{composed}} of a Front Power Unit (FPU) coupled to a <b>Rear</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Unit</b> (RBU). The FPU can be driven on its own, but is front-heavy in this mode and prone to nose-diving when the brakes are applied. A suspension lockout strut reduces this problem. When describing a truck it is remarked by the combination of both units, for example, an MK48 FPU attached to an MK18 RBU is called a [...] "48/18". For MK16's, which tow M870 semi-trailers, the type of trailer is added as well, i.e. [...] "48/16/870A2".|$|E
50|$|The LVS was fielded in 1985 as the Marine Corps heavy {{tactical}} vehicle system. It {{was designed}} and manufactured by the Oshkosh Corporation. The United States Army does not use the LVS, it uses the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT). The key {{differences between the two}} is the LVS's ability to interchange Front Power Units with Rear Body Units. The LVS also steers through both standard wheel pivoting (as on a typical automobile) and hydraulic yaw steering (by articulating the Front Power Unit against the <b>Rear</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Unit).</b> This enabled the LVS to meet the turning radius requirements of the U.S. Marines. LVS is rated to haul up to 22.5 t on highways.|$|E
