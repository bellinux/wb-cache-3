5|$|De Lucía {{lived for}} five years in Yucatan, Mexico, but {{returned}} to his native Spain in 2003 after professing to have become <b>really</b> <b>tired</b> with spending his whole life touring for six to eight months a year, getting up {{at the crack of}} dawn and living in hotels. He continued to keep a holiday home in Mexico though and regularly visited with his family.|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist Jeff Ament wasn't made {{aware that the}} band was recording until three days into the sessions, {{and said that he}} [...] "wasn't super involved with that record on any level." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "I'm sure Jeff was pissed, but it was more about separating, because if we played all together nothing would get done. We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more on-the-fly during the making of No Code, and some good things happened out of that, but we were also <b>really</b> <b>tired.</b> It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run but I hope he will be back soon, we have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became <b>really</b> <b>tired.</b> They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E

500|$|... 10 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and noted {{it as an}} 'Album Pick', calling it [...] "one {{of the best and}} most long-awaited greatest-hits albums in recent memory". Johnson praised the amount of content, saying [...] "For fans, the videos alone make this worth picking up". Jenna DeWitt of The Baylor Lariat gave it an A-, praising [...] "I Can Only Imagine (Symphony Edition)" [...] as [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] as well as the DVD content, and saying [...] "the only mistake in buying this album is if you are <b>really</b> <b>tired</b> of the extensive radio airplay that these hits have gotten". Dave Derbyshire of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, calling it a [...] "brilliant introduction" [...] to the band. His only criticism on the album was that he considered a few of the songs as being overly sentimental. Matt Johnson of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album three out of five stars. Johnson noted the DVD content as being [...] "what really makes this worth your money", but was critical of the interface; he also felt the CD content, while solid, did not include enough songs and that the new recordings weren't particularly impressive. He noted the orchestra and Millard's vocals as conflicting on the re-recording of [...] "I Can Only Imagine", but also said that it [...] "takes the song to new heights than previously conceived". Justin Michael of Sight Magazine gave the album a positive review, calling it [...] "A must for all MercyMe fans, for those who need a hooky melody with a message and for people who love getting a free DVD with their albums!"; he also praised the one-camera tour videos, but noted [...] "Ten Simple Rules" [...] is [...] "not their brightest musical moment".|$|E
2500|$|The final vocal {{track was}} {{recorded}} between March and April 1966 at CBS Columbia Square, Hollywood, with the session engineered by Ralph Balantin and produced by Brian. The song features three {{voices on the}} track. Carl is featured on lead vocals, with Brian and Johnston backing him. Johnston explained that, [...] "The really cute thing {{is that at the}} end of the session, Carl was <b>really</b> <b>tired,</b> and he went home. So Brian ... remember, this was 8-track, so, he now has these extra tracks at his disposal. But there were just the two of us. So in the fade, he's singing two of the three parts. He sang the top and the bottom part and I sang in the middle." [...] Brian used the production technique of double-tracking Carl's voice, so that his voice is simultaneously singing the same part twice, to give the vocal a fuller and richer sound; Brian used this technique often during the recording of Pet Sounds. The song's sessions concluded on April 11.|$|E
2500|$|Nozomi {{continued}} to enjoy sex {{both within and}} outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm <b>really</b> <b>tired</b> nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|One of his comedies, Saps (Подкопы), was so {{outright}} in its {{critique of}} higher spheres it was banned by censors. Others were staged, but enjoyed only short-lived success, {{having to do}} mostly with the sensationalist aspect, for the public could recognize in certain characters real life officials and financiers. Artistically they were flawed, and even The Russian Messenger, which traditionally had supported the author, refused to publish The Financial Genius. After the stage production of the play flopped, Pisemsky returned to {{the form of the}} novel and in his last 4 years produced two of them: The Philistines, and Masons, the later being notable for its picturesque historical background created with the help of Vladimir Solovyov. Skabichevsky described both as [...] "anemic and dull", and even Ivan Turgenev, who made great efforts to cheer Pisemsky up, still noted a streak of [...] "tiredness" [...] in the author's latest prose. [...] "You were absolutely right: I am <b>really</b> <b>tired</b> of writing, and even more – of living. Of course old age is no fun for anybody, but for me it's especially bad and full of dark torment I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy," [...] Pisemsky wrote back in a letter.|$|E
2500|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 316. Busch {{controlled the}} race for the next 32 laps before losing the lead to Harvick on lap 348. Busch radioed to his team that a part on his car had failed. His car got loose going into turn 1, slid down the track, turned back up the track and came to a stop backwards. Justin Allgaier, driving in place of Michael Annett, clipped the left-front of Busch's car. He went up the track and collected Larson and Martin Truex Jr., which brought out the sixth caution. Busch said afterwards that the part failure was [...] "a shame. The last few times we’ve been here, we’ve had really fast M Toyota Camrys and we haven’t been able to finish. We’ve been having parts failures here, so something we’ve got to address and fix. I’m <b>really</b> <b>tired</b> of losing races here with parts falling apart, so they’ll hear about it on Tuesday." [...] He also said that the [...] "biggest moron out there is the spotter of the 46 and the driver of the 46 (Justin Allgaier). I’ve been wrecking for half a lap and they just come on through and clean us out. That’s stupid, so I don’t know – frustrating day. Let’s go home." [...] Allgaier went on to finish 40th. Kurt Busch assumed the race lead.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{very sad}} to relate, but poor Netta, her pent-up {{feelings}} all let loose by the smallness of the evil, {{as it seemed}} to her, actually began to smile, and then to laugh merrily, in the very face of this awful revelation.

60|$|The other globe {{was all in}} pale green, {{with pink}} and yellow {{outlines}} on it, and quantities of names.

6000|$|I {{could not}} make out from their manner with each other whether they had been {{speaking}} of the great matter in hand or not. I am rather at a loss about people of that Philistine make as to what their procedure will be in circumstances where I know just what people of my own sort of sophistication would do. These would come straight at the trouble, but I fancy that with the other sort the convention is a preliminary reserve. I found Mr. Gage disposed to prolong, with me at least, a discussion of the weather, and the aspects of Saratoga, the events of his journey from De Witt Point, and the hardship of having to ride all the way to Mooer's Junction in a stage-coach. I felt more and more, while we bandied these futilities, as if Mr. Gage had an overdue note of mine, and was waiting for me, since I could not pay it, to make some proposition toward its renewal; and he did <b>really</b> <b>tire</b> me out at last, so that I said, [...] "Well, Mr. Gage, I suppose Miss Gage has told you something of the tremendous situation that has developed itself here?" ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{was flown}} {{back to the}} United States, {{arriving}} at John F.

Upon his return he vowed to fight the charges against him, but said that [...] "it's good {{to be back in the}} United States".

60|$|My {{responsibilities}} {{were now}} {{those of a}} man. I was nearly full grown, quick and powerful of hand, and vain of my strength, which was, in fact, unusual and of decided advantage to me.

Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller. I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how hard they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired.|$|E
