5000|$|Pdof. Dr. von Freytag-Löringhoff, a {{professor}} of philosophy specialized in logic at the University of Tübingen built the first replica of Schickard's machine in 1960 {{but he had to}} improve on the design of the carry mechanism: [...] This simple-looking device actually presents a host of problems to anyone attempting to construct an adding machine based on this principle. The major problem is caused {{by the fact that the}} single tooth must enter into the teeth of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel,</b> rotate it 36 degrees (one tenth of a revolution), and exit from the teeth, all while only rotating 36 degrees itself. The most elementary solution to this problem consists of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel</b> being, in effect, two different gears, one with long and one with short teeth together with a spring-loaded detente (much like the pointer used on the big wheel of the gambling game generally known as Crown and Anchor) which would allow the gears to stop only in specific locations. It is not known if Schickard used this mechanism, but it certainly works well on the reproductions constructed by von Freytag Loringhoff. Michael R. Williams ...|$|R

The platter functions as a motor armature. This requires good engineering, with advanced electronics for acceleration and speed control. Matsushita's Technics division introduced the first commercially successful direct drive platter, model SP10, in 1969, which was joined by the Technics SL-1200 turntable, in 1972. Its updated model, SL-1200MK2, released in 1978, had a stronger motor, a convenient pitch control slider for beatmatching and a stylus illuminator, which made it the long-standing favourite among disc jockeys (see [...] "Turntablism"). By the beginnings of the 80s, lowering of costs in microcontroller electronics made direct drive turntables more affordable.|$|R

40|$|Cape {{fur seals}} (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) and 121 strikes on towed seal-shaped decoys were {{documented}} from observation vessels at Seal Island, South Africa. White sharks at Seal Island appear to selectively target lone, incoming young {{of the year}} Cape fur seals {{at or near the}} surface. Most attacks lasted 51 min and consisted of a single breach, with predatory success rate decreasing rapidly with increasing duration and number of subsequent breaches. A white shark predatory ethogram, composed of four phases and 20 behavioural units, is presented, including four varieties of initial strike and 11 subsequent behaviour units not previously de¢ned in the literature. Behaviour units scored from 210 predatory attacks revealed that, for both successful and unsuccessful attacks, Polaris Breach was the most commonly employed initial strike, while Surface Lunge was the most frequent second event, closely followed by Lateral Snap. Examination of video footage, still images, and tooth impressions in decoys indicated that white sharks at Seal Island bite prey obliquely using their anterolateral teeth via a sudden lateral snap of the jaws and not perpendicularly with their anterior teeth, as previously supposed. Analysis of white shark upper tooth morphology and spacing suggest the <b>reversed</b> <b>intermediate</b> teeth of white sharks occur at the strongest part of the jaw and produce the largest wound.

Schickard's machine used clock wheels which were made stronger and were therefore heavier, to prevent them from being damaged by the force of an operator input.

The great innovation in Pascal's calculator was that it was designed so that each input wheel is totally independent from all the others and carries are propagated in sequence. Pascal chose, for his machine, a method of re-zeroing that propagates a carry right through the machine. It is the most demanding operation to execute for a mechanical calculator and proved, before each operation, that the carry mechanism of the Pascaline was fully functional. This could be taken as a testament {{to the quality of the}} Pascaline because none of the 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet this feature was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.|$|R

The result was that the greatest inside width obtainable on a firebox which was arranged between the wheels of a Cape gauge locomotive was 27+1/2 in. He overcame this by designing an 8th Class locomotive with a deep curve in the foundation ring (mud ring) to clear the <b>intermediate</b> coupled <b>wheels</b> and a steep slope towards the rear to clear the trailing wheels.
