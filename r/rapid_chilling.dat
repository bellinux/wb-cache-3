50|$|Sideromelane is a {{vitreous}} basaltic volcanic glass, usually {{occurring in}} palagonite tuff, {{for which it}} is characteristic. It is a less common form of tachylite, with which it usually occurs together; however it lacks the iron oxide crystals dispersed in the glass, and therefore appearing transparent and pure, with yellow-brown color, instead of tachylite opaque black. It forms at higher temperatures and with more <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling.</b> Presence of sideromelane indicates higher temperature of the lava, and solidifying of the flow closer to the vent, probably by rapid quenching in a wet environment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{repeated}} {{exposure to the}} heat of the fire followed typically by <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> in water leads to great thermal stress on the stone's fabric due to the thermal expansion and contraction. This typically leads to partial glazing of the stone's surface and a fine network of cracks on the stone's surface (often described as [...] "crazing"). Eventually the stone shatters. Individual fragments may be re-used until it becomes infeasible to manipulate the stone {{into and out of the}} fire, at which point the fragments are discarded and a new pot boiler (or many new ones) are acquired. Often the broken pot boilers are discarded into middens or domestic waste deposits, which on long-established sites can amount to many tonnes of material.|$|E
50|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the initial reaction to immersion in cold water. It generally {{starts with a}} gasp reflex in response to sudden and <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> of the skin, and if the head is immersed {{there is a risk}} of inhaling water and drowning. This is followed by a reflexive hyperventilation, with a risk of panic and fainting if not controlled. Cold induced vasoconstriction causes the heart to work harder and the additional work can overload a weak heart, with a possible consequence of cardiac arrest. Cold incapacitation is the next stage, and generally occurs within 5 to 15 minutes in cold water. Blood flow to the extremities is reduced by vasoconstriction as the body attempts to reduce heat loss from the vital organs of the core. This accelerates the cooling of the periphery, and reduces the functionality of the muscles and nerves. The duration of exposure to produce hypothermia varies with health, body mass and water temperature. It generally takes in the order of 30 minutes for an unprotected person in water to become hypothermic.|$|E

A total of 12 tests were conducted. Models of the test facility fill and vent systems, as well as the tank, were constructed. The objective of achieving tank fill in 5 minutes was met during the test series. However, liquid began to accumulate in the tank before it was chilled. Since the tank was not chilled until the end of each test, vent valve closure during fill was not possible. Even though the chill and fill process did not occur as expected, reasonable model correlation with the test data was achieved...|$|R

5000|$|The {{business}} {{called the}} Oliver Chilled Plow Works {{was established by}} James Oliver in 1853. [...] James Oliver first settled in Mishawaka, Indiana in 1836 where he worked in a local foundry business. Later he bought into an already existing small foundry in South Bend, Indiana. Plows with cast iron bottoms and moldboards had been successfully used by farmers and planters in the eastern states of the United States {{since the time of}} Thomas Jefferson. [...] However, in the sticky soils of North Dakota and various other portions of the Midwest, the cast iron plows would not [...] "scour"; that is, the sticky soil would cling to the plow, disrupting the flow of soil over the plow's surface, making plowing impossible. Thus, when settlement of North America moved over the Allegheny Mountains into the Midwest, there was a real need for a new plow that would scour in the soils of the Midwest. To allow a cast iron bottom to scour in sticky soil, various methods of heat treating for creating a hardened surface on the metal plow bottom had been attempted. All of these processes failed because the hard surface created was very thin and would soon wear through to the soft iron under the heat-treated surface. James Oliver developed his sand casting process to include <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> of the molten iron near the outside surface of the casting, which resulted in a bottom that had a thick hardened surface with far greater wearability than competing plow bottoms.|$|E

Membrane permeabilization induced by cold shock was assessed by uptake of the fluorescent dye 1 -N-phenylnapthylamine. Slow chilling (2 degrees C min(- 1)) did not induce transient susceptibility to nisin. Combining <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> (2, 000 degrees C min(- 1)) and nisin causes a dose-dependent reduction in the population of cells in both exponential and stationary growth phases.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} if rapid slurry chilling would retard or prevent blown pack spoilage (BPS) of vacuum-packaged beef primals. Beef primals were inoculated with Clostridium estertheticum subspp. estertheticum (DSMZ 8809), C. estertheticum subspp. laramenise (DSMZ 14864) and C. gasigenes (DSMZ 12272), and vacuum-packaged with and without heat shrinkage (90 °C for 3 s). These packs were then subjected to immediate chilling in an ice slurry or using conventional blast chilling systems and stored at 2 °C for up to 100 days. The onset and progress of BPS was monitored using the following scale; 0 -no gas bubbles in drip; 1 -gas bubbles in drip; 2 -loss of vacuum; 3 -‘blown’; 4 -presence of sufficient gas inside the packs to produce pack distension and 5 -tightly stretched, ‘overblown’ packs/packs leaking. Rapid slurry chilling (as compared to conventional chilling) did not significantly affect (P > 0. 05) the time to the onset or progress of BPS. It was therefore concluded that <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> of vacuum-packaged beef primals, using an ice slurry system, may not be used as a control intervention to prevent or retard blown pack spoilage. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study adds to our growing understanding of blown pack spoilage of vacuum-packaged beef primals and suggests that <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> of vacuum-packaged beef primals is not a control option for the beef industry.

It is shown {{that only a}} fraction of the nanoparticles that have a truncated octahedron shape show orientation relation with the matrix. The solidification of the embedded Bi melt was found to take place over a wide temperature range. The micron sized particles do not show any solidification peak while a broad shallow peak can be observed for nano-scaled particles. The observed broad differential scanning calorimetry exotherm has been deconvoluted into two peaks, one sharp and the other broad in shape. The exotherms are also simulated using classical theory of heterogeneous nucleation using a parametric approach and matched with the experimental one. It is shown that the broad peak can be best explained by a spread of contact angles during nucleation while the sharp peak can be fitted with a single contact angle. The latter is most likely associated with particles showing orientation relation and represents nucleation of Bi on the 111 plane of aluminium.

We use the thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), a hibernating mammal, to better understand the impact of these changes on blood parameters, and in this case on platelets and leukocytes. The knowledge gained from this study may have direct importance in platelet transfusion medicine. To determine the role of the spleen in the sequestration of blood cells during hibernation, we compared platelet and white blood cell counts from splenectomized and sham-operated animals. Results showed that splenectomy had little effect on the circulating levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, or monocytes during hibernation, but high variability and small sample size may have limited findings of significance. In addition, we followed the in vivo clearance rate of platelets stored at 3 7 ?C and 4 oc in ground squirrels to determine whether chilled ground squirrel platelets were resistant to the rapid clearance that is observed when chilled human platelets are injected into humans.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Large blood-based {{epidemiological}} studies require simple, cost-effective sample collection methods. Immediate sample separation or <b>rapid</b> transport of <b>chilled</b> blood samples {{to a central}} laboratory may be impractical or prohibitively expensive. To assess the feasibility and reliability of transporting blood samples over several days at ambient temperature (e. g. by mail), we evaluated the stability of various plasma analytes in samples stored at room temperature or chilled. METHODS: Multiple vacutainers of blood, containing EDTA and aprotinin as preservative, were drawn from 12 volunteers and stored at 21 degrees C or 4 degrees C. Immediately after collection and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days later, vacutainers stored at each temperature were centrifuged, and the plasma was aliquoted and stored at - 80 degrees C. Subsequently, all aliquots from each individual were analysed in one analytical run {{for a range of}} chemistries. RESULTS: In whole blood stored at room temperature for up to 7 days, concentrations of albumin, apolipoproteins A 1 and B (apoA 1 and apoB), cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), total protein, and triglycerides changed by less than 4 %, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) by less than 7 %. Whilst alanine transaminase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) concentrations changed substantially at room temperature, there was less than 4 % change during chilled storage up to 7 days. By contrast, aspartate transaminase (AST) concentrations increased markedly under both conditions.

A temperature of 10 °C was achieved in the centre of M. longissimus dorsi (LD) within 3. 5 h in rapidly chilled carcasses and within 8 h in slowly chilled carcasses. In deep M. semimembranosus (SM) a temperature of 10 °C was achieved within 11. 5 h in rapidly chilled carcasses and within 14 h in slowly chilled carcasses. LD from slowly chilled RN− carriers suspended by the pelvis exhibited the greatest tenderness, while LD from rapidly chilled non-carriers suspended from the Achilles tendon exhibited the lowest tenderness. Pelvic suspension or slow chilling of non-carriers produced the same improvement in tenderness, and when combined the tenderness increased further. However, the tenderness of the RN− carriers was already high, and no significant improvement was seen following any of the studied post-slaughter treatments. Pelvic suspension prevented shortening of muscle fibres, as seen by longer sarcomeres in LD from pelvic-suspended sides. However, longer sarcomeres were associated with greater tenderness only in LD from non-carriers of the RN− allele. The presence of the RN− allele and a slow chilling regime increased the rate of pH decline in LD. Achilles suspension also increased the rate of pH fall in SM, {{in addition to the}} RN− allele and slow chilling. The overall tenderness of LD was mainly related to the course of pH decline during rigor; lower pH values between 3 and 7 h post-mortem contributing to greater tenderness. The myofibrillar length was predominantly related to RN genotype and was shorter in RN− carriers than in non-carriers. The RN− allele and slow chilling contributed to higher evaporation losses and RN− carriers exhibited increased frequency of PSE meat in the ham muscles. The use of pelvic suspension appears advantageous over slower chilling, since it improved tenderness without any negative influence on drip loss, evaporation or cooking loss...|$|R
40|$|Export-oriented {{pastoral}} {{livestock production}} {{is an important}} source of livelihood of the Somali people. The country is largely food deficient, with imports forming a significant proportion of basic food requirements and which are largely financed through earnings from exports of live animals and meat. The export of meat products offers more avenues for increased earnings and tax revenue by exploiting the available opportunities for domestic value addition, than does live animal trade. This study characterizes the Somali chilled export meat value chain in terms of actors, institutions and practices, and provides an initial analysis of their profitability in handling four species of livestock. It also canvasses actors’ views on opportunities and constraints faced. Its main objective is to provide information that will enable development of strategies to improve the efficiency of the Somali chilled meat export value chain as a way of increasing incomes to market actors. Primary data used was obtained from a <b>rapid</b> appraisal of <b>chilled</b> meat export marketing value chains in Somalia and a formal survey of market actors (brokers, small-scale traders, agents of exporters, exporters and airfreight operators). Secondary data obtained from a review of relevant literature and interviews with expert informants was also generated. The study identified a widely-recognized and consistently-applied grading system for slaughter stock. Quality requirements in importing countries were revealed to be well known throughout the chain, in that actors’ rankings of attributes were consistent within and between actor stages. Conversely, knowledge of health and safety requirements in the importing countries was known only to exporters. Other inconsistencies throughout the chain included the nature and strength of trading relationships: long-lived at exporter and agent level but short term and cash-based at producer level. Although exporters made payments mostly on the basis of carcass weight, agents of exporters paid based on per head of live animals. There is evidence of economies of scale, and of financial advantage in species specialization (specifically, goats) by traders. Most actors’ aspirations feature expansion, but they report investment funding as their main constraint.

In particular, poly(I) samples that could induce interferon production differed from non-inducer poly(I) s; the inducers reacted weakly with anti-poly(I) antiserum and {{were the only ones}} that reacted with antibodies to double-stranded RNA. One inducer poly(I) did not inactivate complement, and differed from non-inducer poly(I) in quantitative aspects of poly(I). poly(C) formation with varying amounts of poly(C). An additional type of poly(I) preparation reacted poorly with anti-poly(I) antiserum, did not react with anti-double-stranded-RNA antibodies and failed to induce interferon production.

40|$|Summary. Twenty-five new {{analyses}} of 10 spilitic pillows from the British Isles offer evidence of considerable variability in distribution of components, notably Si, Na, Mg. Fe 2 +, Ca, Fe 3 +, and water. Selvedges of pillows have compositions strongly contrasted with but essentially complementary {{to those of}} cores. Re-distribution of components i believed to have occurred uring devitrification. Geosynclinal spilites are regarded as basalts which have suffered such redistribution under conditions of diagenesis orlow-grade metamorphism. M OST pillowy bodies, both ancient and modern, display textural contrast between margin or selvedge and core. In pillows of recent age the selvedges are typically glass-rich and surround more crystalline cores. Textures (divergent, arborescent, intersertal, etc.) within such pillows indicate <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling.</b> Calcic plagioelase, with high-or transitional-optics, and pyroxene {{are the most common}} crystalline phases. Few chemical data concerning these recent basaltic pillows are available. The Pliocene example from Poggio Raffo, Sicily, studied by Vuagnat (1959) is taken as representative (table I, nos. 1, 2).

40|$|Our {{objectives}} were {{to examine the}} effects of prerigor excision and <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> vs. conventional carcass chilling of two muscles on proteolysis and tenderness during the postmortem storage, as well as the effects of fast and slow rates of cooking on myofibrillar characteristics and tenderness. The longissimus thoracis (LT) and triceps brachii (TB), long head muscles were removed 45 min after exsanguination from the left side of 12 carcasses and chilled in an ice bath to induce cold shortening (excised, rapidly chilled). At 24 h postmortem, the corresponding muscles were removed from the right side (conventionally chilled). All muscles were cut into 2. 54 -cm-thick steaks and assigned to one of two postmortem times (1 or 14 d), and to raw and cooking treatments. Steaks were cooked at 260 °C(FAST) or 93 °C(SLOW) in a forced-air convection oven to an internal temperature of 70 °C. Cooking loss, cooking time, and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) were measured on cooked steaks. Sarcomere length (SL) and the extent of proteolysis of desmin were measured on raw and cooked steaks. As expected, the excised, rapidly chilled muscles had a much more rapid (P 0. 05) on SL of rapidly chilled steaks. Generally, TB steaks required longer (P < 0. 05) cooking times and had higher (P < 0. 05) cooking losses than LT steaks, and FAST-cooked steaks had greater (P < 0. 05) cooking losses than SLOW-cooked steaks. Rapidly chilled steaks had less (P < 0. 05) degradation of desmin than conventionally chilled steaks (31 vs. 41 %). Aging for 14 d increased (P < 0. 05) desmin degradation. <b>Rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> of muscles resulted in much higher (P < 0. 05) WBSF values, whereas aging resulted in lower (P < 0. 05) WBSF values. The SLOW-cooked TB steaks were more tender (P < 0. 05) than FAST-cooked TB steaks and LT steaks cooked at either rate. Excised, rapidly chilled muscles underwent proteolysis, but it occurred at a slower rate during the first 24 h postmortem than it did in conventionally chilled muscles. Cooking rate did not affect tenderness of LT steaks, but SLOW cooking resulted in more tender TB steaks...|$|E
40|$|Chilling of meat {{carcasses}} {{immediately after}} slaughter {{is important for}} microbial safety {{and quality of the}} meat. <b>Rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> may reduce potential bacterial growth, and may help control post-mortem biochemical changes affecting color and texture of the meat (e. g., pale, soft, exudative meat). However, excessive <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> may lead to other quality issues (e. g., ‘cold shortening’), and reduced yield due to excessive moisture loss. Therefore, optimization of carcass chilling is important for producing high quality and safe meat, without compromising yield. Computer models to simulate heat and mass transfer during chilling of meat carcasses can be used to determine optimal operating conditions to maximize chilling rates and minimize moisture loss and potential growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. The objective of this research was to develop and validate computer models for simulating air-chilling of meat carcasses; particularly chicken, pork, and beef carcasses. The models considered heat conduction and internal moisture diffusion subjected to convection, surface-to-ambient thermal radiation, and moisture evaporation. Three-dimensional geometries of the carcasses were generated from computer tomography images. Thus, the effect of non-uniform thermal properties corresponding to the meat, bone and fat sections was considered. The models were developed using a combination of computer aided engineering software (e. g., COMSOL Multiphysics®, Materialise Mimics, and Matlab®). The models provided accurate predictions using input parameters available for meat processors such as air relative humidity, air velocity, chiller set-point temperature, and carcass weight. RMSE for temperature predictions was 1. 3 ± 0. 6 °C, 1. 48 ± 0. 41 °C, 1. 6 ± 0. 3 °C for chicken, pork, and beef carcasses, respectively. In addition, moisture loss predictions resulted in RMSE values of 0. 11 %, 0. 31 %, and 0. 24 % for chicken, pork, and beef carcasses, respectively. The developed models were integrated with predictive microbial models of pathogens of interest including Salmonella spp. and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli. The proposed models can be used not only for process optimization, but can help support food safety management systems in developing critical limits for hazard analysis, estimating potential impact of chilling deviations, and simulating multiple processing scenarios for quantitative microbial risk assessment. ...|$|E
40|$|Mineral assemblages in {{volcanic}} rocks record both pre-eruptive {{conditions and}} changes experienced by magma as it rises. Titanomagnetite in andesitic magmas is especially sensitive {{to changes in}} temperature and oxygen fugacity immediately prior to and during eruptions. Two end-member eruption states can be distinguished by examining titanomagnetite textures in erupted rocks. Slow-ascent eruptions - characterized by near-stagnant magma bodies and slow effusion of lava domes - show solid-state exsolution of titano-hematite/ilmenite lamellae within titanomagnetite hosts. By contrast, fast-ascent eruptions - characterized by <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> of magma in sub-Plinian eruptions - contain titanomagnetites without such exsolution features. This mineralogical distinction is particularly useful in examining very fine-grained distal tephra layers where other characteristic properties of the two eruptions types are not present. Such tephra records in lake deposits typically provide the most precise long-term eruption records from andesitic volcanoes. Using an example from Mount Taranaki, New Zealand, we show that by classifying eruption sty les within such sequences, the underlying magmatic system processes at a volcano can be elucidated and separated from other environmental factors such as vent/ crater configuration. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Phloem {{transport}} stops transiently within dicot stems {{that are}} cooled rapidly, but the cause remains unknown. Now {{it is known}} that (1) rapid cooling depolarizes cell membranes giving a transient increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2 +), and (2) a rise of free calcium triggers dispersion of forisomes, which then occlude sieve elements (SEs) of fabacean plants. Therefore, we compared the effects of <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> on SE electrophysiology, phloem transport and forisomes in Vicia faba. Forisomes dispersed after rapid cooling with a delay that was longer for slower cooling rates. Phloem transport stopped about 20 s after forisome dispersion, and then transport resumed and forisomes re-condensed within similar time frames. Transport interruption and forisome dispersion showed parallel behaviour [...] a cooling rate-dependent response, transience and desensitization. Chilling induced both a fast and a slow depolarization of SE membranes, the electrical signature suggesting strongly that the cause of forisome dispersion was the transient promotion of SE free calcium. This apparent block of SEs by dispersed forisomes may be assisted by other Ca(2 +) -dependent sealing proteins that are present in all dicots...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of <b>rapid</b> <b>chilling</b> (RC) on beef quality and the degradation of cytoskeletal proteins. Twenty Chinese Yellow crossbred bulls were selected and randomly divided into two groups. RC and conventional chilling (CC) were applied to left and right sides of the carcasses respectively after slaughtering. To determine whether electrical stimulation (ES) treatment can alleviate the potential hazard of RC on meat quality, ES was applied to one group. The effects of RC and ES were determined by meat color, shear force and cytoskeletal protein degradation postmortem (PM). The results showed that RC decreased beef tenderness at 1 d and 3 d postmortem, but had no detrimental effect on meat color. Western blotting showed that RC decreased the degradation rate of desmin and troponin-T, but the effects weakened gradually as postmortem aging extended. Degradation rates of both desmin and troponin-T were accelerated by ES. The combination of RC and ES could improve beef color, accelerate degradation rate of cytoskeletal protein and improve beef tenderness...|$|E
