40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> of elective cases on scheduled date of surgery in pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: The audit {{was conducted in}} a 216 beds tertiary care pediatric super-specialty hospital. Two operation theatres (OT) provide elective surgical services to pediatric surgery, orthopedics, ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology. The audit included all those patients who were posted for elective surgery {{over a period of}} one year. Cancelled cases were identified from predesigned OT utilization formats and the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> were evaluated. Results: A total of 2473 cases were posted for the elective surgery in the year 2009 and 189 (7. 64 &#x 0025;) patients had their surgery cancelled. The main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> were upper respiratory infections (30. 68 &#x 0025;) and shortage of time (29 &#x 0025;). Other reasons were medically unfit patients (15. 34 &#x 0025;), precedence of emergency cases (3. 7 &#x 0025;); non-availability of ventilator and intensive care bed (4. 7 &#x 0025;); no-show by patient (4. 76 &#x 0025;); non-availability of blood (4. 2 &#x 0025;); incomplete work up (2. 64 &#x 0025;); administrative reasons (1. 58 &#x 0025;); patient not fasting (1. 58 &#x 0025;) and unspecified reasons (2. 1 &#x 0025;). Overall, 38. 6 &#x 0025; causes were preventable. Conclusions: Elective surgery cancellation is a significant problem with multifactorial etiology. Most common <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> of planned surgery were sudden onset of respiratory tract infection in the admitted patient and shortage of time. It suggests that on many occasions, surgeons take more time than anticipated for performing the procedure...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{characterize}} cancellations of elective surgeries {{according to}} clinical and non-clinical reasons, {{as well as}} to verify seasonal influence and determine the estimated reduction of the index. Method: Quantitative, descriptive and retrospective study with secondary data extracted from the Public Hospital of the State of São Paulo database. Results: Out of the 8, 443 (100 %) elective surgeries scheduled, 7, 870 (93. 21 %) were performed and 573 (6. 79 %) were canceled. Out of these 573 (100 %) people, 48. 33 % were canceled <b>for</b> clinical <b>reasons</b> and 46. 40 % were <b>for</b> non-clinical <b>reasons.</b> Among the non-clinical <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> surgery <b>cancellations,</b> those related to medical reasons stood out: {{at the request of the}} surgeon/change of approach (17. 93 %), followed by non-hospitalized patient (8. 96 %). There was no indication of seasonality regarding the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> in the assessed period. Conclusion: Although the rate of elective surgeries cancellations is lower than that of other hospitals with similar characteristics, it is still possible to reduce it from 6. 79 % to 1. 36 %, considering that 80 % of the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> are avoidable...|$|R

Comparing the game to other M rated titles such as Grand Theft Auto and 25 to Life, the officer strongly suggested the event not take place on school property.

5000|$|In 1998 the Turkish {{government}} {{signed a}} contract with MBDA to replace the Turkish Armed Forces' aging 3.5-inch rocket launchers and RPG-7s. The deal, worth approximately €404 million, would see the licensed production of 1,600 Eryx launchers, and 20,000 missiles in Turkey. The project encountered setbacks after the Turkish Army claimed that missile failed to meet accuracy requirements of a 72 percent hit rate (i.e. this claim is [...] "unofficially" [...] rejected by MBDA). The poor performance was attributed to technical difficulties, and later corrected by MBDA. [...] In 2004 the Turkish Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) canceled the contract citing MBDA's failure to meet the terms of the agreement in a timely manner, and MBDA was blacklisted in Turkey. MBDA, in turn, stated that the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> was an excuse, and that the systems were simply no longer needed. This is likely based on the 2004 decision by the Turkish Armed Forces to disband four army brigades, and downsize remaining army units, thereby decreasing the requirement for new anti-armor systems. According to MBDA, the ERYX is still in service though with the Turkish Army. [...] The blacklisting has been attributed to a largescale souring of Franco-Turkish relations. According to report by Undersecretariat for Defense Industries of Turkey, MBDA and Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding on to acquire 632 Eryx launchers, 3920 missiles and modification systems for a total package of 404m €.|$|E

[...] In June 2016, Fuller stated, [...] "The cast is game, I'm game, it's just a matter of finding the right time where everybody's schedules sync up, but I would love to continue to tell the story with Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen. They're such fantastic collaborators, {{and one of the most}} satisfying actor-showrunner relationships I've ever had in this industry. So I would love to continue this story." [...] He also revealed other information dealing with rights: [...] "Two years after the last airing of the show, we can investigate our options ... August 2017 is when we can actually start talking about it. That's when we would have to see what the rights are for the character and for the story, and see who's interested and how we get it done. I have the story, and the cast is excited for the story, so we're ready to go if somebody wants to go." [...] In December 2016, Fuller confirmed his plans for a Silence of the Lambs miniseries in an interview on the Blumhouse Productions podcast, stating, [...] "I think the film adaptation is a perfect film, but there are a lot of interesting nooks and crannies in that book to explore in a television series." [...] In August 2017, formal conversations on the revival had begun.|$|E
40|$|Background: This study investigates case {{cancellations}} on {{the intended}} day of surgery (DOS) at a paediatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The hospital in Melbourne treats over 32 000 inpatients annually and handles both elective and emergency cases. Methods: The {{data for this}} paper were collected {{over a period of}} 12 months, from June 2004 to June 2005. The data were extracted retrospectively from the theatre computer system. A nurse researcher reviewed the full written details of all cancellations to clarify their cause and confirm the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> cancellation; the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> were then sorted into one of 14 groups. Results: There were 16 559 theatre bookings, and of these, 1198 (7. 2 %) were cancelled on the DOS. There was a mean of 3. 28 cancellations of surgery on the intended day. The hospital-initiated postponements accounted for 18. 5 % of DOS cancellations. The top four <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> accounted <b>for</b> 65 % of all cancelled surgeries and were all patient initiated. Conclusions: There was also evidence that some specialties were more susceptible to DOS cancellation than others.
