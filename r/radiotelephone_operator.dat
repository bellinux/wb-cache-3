However, they didn't live in the villages as the Marines did. Typically they were a 3-man team including an officer, enlisted instructor and <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator.</b> The HQ was in a nominally secure area, and they ventured out to arranged meeting places to provide instructional support in weapons maintenance, etc. One such element was an adjunct of the 1st/502d Inf, 101st Airborne Division and was sited at Eagle Beach in June 1970.

50|$|Pilots do {{not need}} FCC {{licenses}} to use the radio within the United States (pilot certificates double as FCC radio licenses); however, other countries may require that a pilot have an FCC Restricted <b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>Operator</b> Permit (RR), and the aircraft radio station be licensed.|$|E
50|$|At age seventeen, Ally Acker {{became the}} first woman to obtain a First Class <b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>Operator</b> license through the FCC, {{enabling}} the operation of radio transmitters. WOR AM radio in New York hired her at age eighteen to become their first female engineer. At WOR, Acker worked closely with radio legends Jean Shepherd, Joe Franklin, and Arlene Francis.|$|E
50|$|Dudley A. Buck {{was born}} in San Francisco, California on April 25, 1927. Dudley and his {{siblings}} moved to Santa Barbara, California, in 1940. In 1943 Dudley Buck earned his Amateur Radio License W6WCK and a First Class <b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>Operator</b> license for commercial work. He worked part-time at Santa Barbara radio station KTMS until he left to attend college.|$|E
50|$|Ranger {{infantry}} company rifle squads {{consist of}} three four-man teams. The headquarters team {{is led by}} the squad leader and consists of the squad machine gunner (MG), the squad assistant gunner (AG), and the squad <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator</b> (RTO). The other two teams are led by a team leader (TL) and in one of the teams a squad rifleman/compassman (R/CM) replaces the basic rifleman.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the first}} {{commercial}} operator licenses were issued by the Department of Commerce and then later by the Federal Radio Commission {{under the authority of}} the Radio Act of 1927. When the FCC was created in 1934 it took over this function. The Commission issued First and Second Class <b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>Operator</b> Licenses. In 1953 a Third Class permit was added.|$|E
5000|$|An active amateur radio {{operator}} with the call sign WB0RPA, he held an amateur extra class license, the highest grade issued. [...] As {{shown in the}} Federal Communications Commission database, he also earned both a General <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator</b> license and a commercial radiotelegraph operator's license, {{as well as a}} ship radar endorsement on these certificates. He {{was also one of the}} few people to qualify for the now-obsolete aircraft radiotelegraph endorsement on the latter license.|$|E
50|$|For the Maintainer license, written exam element 9 must be passed. However, {{to obtain}} this {{certificate}} an applicant must also hold a General <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator</b> license (GROL), which requires passing commercial written exam elements 1 and 3 (and thus supersedes the MROP). Upon the further passing of optional written exam element 8 the ship radar endorsement {{will be added}} to both the GROL and Maintainer licenses. This allows the holder to adjust, maintain, and repair shipboard radar equipment.|$|E
50|$|The General <b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>Operator</b> License (GROL) is {{a license}} {{granted by the}} U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The GROL does not convey the {{authority}} to operate an amateur radio station, for which the FCC has a separate licensing system, nor is it required for any engineering jobs in radio and television broadcast. However, some services such as aviation, marine and international fixed public stations still require repair and maintenance to be performed by a person holding a GROL.|$|E

5000|$|Despite this he {{continued}} performing before live audiences from 1937 onwards, {{as well as}} in film, where he had a successful, if undistinguished, career from 1931. However, he was banned from the Reichskulturkammer in 1939 and, threatened with arrest again, he joined the Wehrmacht armed forces in the rank of a private <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator</b> to avoid imprisonment. A member of the 23rd Infantry Division, he was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd class and the Eastern Front Medal, which he called [...] "Frozen Meat Medal" [...] (Gefrierfleischorden).|$|E
5000|$|In {{later years}} new disc jockeys were Juniors who {{learned from the}} {{previous}} year's students, applied for a <b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>Operator</b> Permit, and as the school year progressed shifted away mid-year from music to begin writing public service announcements and conducting on-air interviews. Carol Shakely, a teacher who oversaw the station, said in 1989 [...] "It's really a radio station. We're really subject {{to the whims of}} the FCC. We really have to read public service announcements every half-hour. People really can pick it up on their radios." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{since the}} Communications Act of 1934 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued various {{commercial}} [...] "radiotelephone operator" [...] licenses and permits to qualified applicants. These {{allow them to}} install, service, and maintain voice-only radio transmitter systems for use on ships and aircraft. (Until deregulation in the 1990s they were also required for commercial domestic radio and television broadcast systems. Because of treaty obligations they are still required for engineers of international shortwave broadcast stations.) The certificate currently issued is the general <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator</b> license.|$|E
5000|$|To obtain any {{of these}} {{licenses}} a person must be a U.S. citizen or otherwise eligible for work in the country, {{be able to communicate}} in English, and take written examinations approved by the Federal Communications Commission. Like the amateur radio examinations, these are given by private, FCC-approved groups. These are generally not the same agencies who administer the ham tests. Written test elements 1 and 7 are required for the Operator license, and elements 1 and 7R for the Restricted Operator. (Passing element 1 also automatically qualifies the applicant for the Marine <b>Radiotelephone</b> <b>Operator</b> Permit, the MROP.) ...|$|E

Corva also learns that the Army has found Dan Kelly, Tyson's <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator.</b> Kelly's testimony is similar to Brandt's but with glaring differences. He first explains Tyson's sarcastic order to shoot the civilians the morning of the Hue massacre. He explains how it was Tyson's men who were overly aggressive in attacking them and that Tyson was irate and sarcastically left them with that remark. In fact, Kelly even reports on hearing Simcox and Farley talking about how Tyson is [...] "too soft of the gooks." ...|$|E
5000|$|As of , Hisar Aviation Club, a {{separate}} legal entity {{based on the}} airport under Haryana Institute of Civil Aviation, had two air crafts, a 4-seater Cessna 172 built in 2008 and an old 2-seater Cessna 152 built in 1986. The institutes has 15 approved seats to impart training for the Student pilot license, Glider pilot license, private pilot licence (PPL), commercial pilot licence (CPL), FLight <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator</b> license, Flight instructor Instrument rating and apprentice internship for all BE/BTech.

50|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, use of {{transmitters}} is strictly controlled by law because of the potential for dangerous interference with other radio transmissions (for example to emergency communications). Transmitters must be licensed by governments, under a variety of license classes depending on use such as broadcast, marine radio, Airband, Amateur and are restricted to certain frequencies and power levels. A body called the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) allocates the frequency bands in the radio spectrum to various classes of users. In some classes each transmitter is given a unique call sign consisting of a string of letters and numbers which must be used as an identifier in transmissions. The operator of the transmitter usually must hold a government license, such as a general <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>operator</b> license, which is obtained by passing a test demonstrating adequate technical and legal knowledge of safe radio operation.|$|E
