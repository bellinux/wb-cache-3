40|$|Extraction {{of juice}} from {{shredded}} sugar cane is commonly performed using sets of counter-rotating rolls. Increases in crushing rate through factory mills {{have traditionally been}} achieved by increasing blanket thickness rather than roll surface speed due to concerns regarding loss of extraction efficiency at higher <b>rolling</b> <b>speeds.</b> Recent factory experience has shown that good extraction performance can be achieved at higher speeds than previously thought, provided that adequate drainage of expressed juice away from the rolls is provided. This study uses finite element methods to predict internal energy dissipation levels due to solid matrix deformation and liquid flow during rolling of prepared sugarcane, and to compare milling parameters for thick blanket, low <b>speed</b> <b>rolling</b> versus thin blanket, high <b>speed</b> <b>rolling.</b> The finite element results suggest that higher roll speeds and thinner blankets (than those currently used in industry practice) would maintain crushing rates and juice extraction levels while reducing roll load, torque, and power consumption, and decreasing frictional sliding between rolls and cane blanket. 1 Notation a,b,c coefficients in permeability relatio...|$|R

40|$|A {{temperature}} sensor with a thermocouple placed at ~ 0. 5 mm from roll surface {{is used in}} hot rolling conditions to evaluate by inverse calculation heat transfers in the roll bite. Simulation analysis under industrial hot rolling conditions with short contact lengths (e. g. short contact times) and high <b>rolling</b> <b>speeds</b> (7 m. /sec.) show that the {{temperature sensor}} + inverse analysis with a high acquisition frequency (> 1000 Hz) is capable to predict accurately (5 to 10 % error) the roll bite peak of temperature {{as well as the}} roll surface temperature evolution all around the roll rotation.

50|$|Mills are {{designed}} {{in different types}} of configurations, with the most basic being a two-high non-reversing, which means there are two rolls that only turn in one direction. The two-high reversing mill has rolls that can rotate in both directions, but the disadvantage is that the rolls must be stopped, reversed, and then brought back up to <b>rolling</b> <b>speed</b> between each pass. To resolve this, the three-high mill was invented, which uses three rolls that rotate in one direction; the metal is fed through two of the rolls and then returned through the other pair.

All of these mills are usually used for primary rolling and the roll diameters range from 60 to 140 cm.|$|E

50|$|Roll bonding {{is a solid}} state, {{cold welding}} process, {{obtained}} through flat rolling of sheet metals. In roll bonding, two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers. The pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the clad material. The mating surfaces must be previously prepared (scratched, cleaned, degreased) {{in order to increase}} their friction coefficient and remove any oxide layers.The process can be performed at room temperature or at warm conditions. In warm roll bonding, heat is applied to pre-heat the sheets just before rolling, in order to increase their ductility and improve the strength of the weld. The strength of the rolled bonds depends on the main process parameters, including the rolling conditions (entry temperature of the sheets, amount of thickness reduction, <b>rolling</b> <b>speed,</b> etc.), the pre-rolling treatment conditions (annealing temperature and time, surface preparation techniques, etc.) and the post-rolling heat treatments.|$|E
50|$|The bunny hop is {{executed}} by approaching an obstacle with a medium <b>rolling</b> <b>speed,</b> {{arms and legs}} slightly bent. Upon reaching the obstacle, the rider first needs to shift their center of gravity towards the rear wheel of the bike and pull back on the handlebars, causing the front wheel to lift as if doing a manual. As the front wheel reaches maximum height, they 'scoop' up {{the rear of the}} bike by pointing their toes downwards and applying backwards and upwards force to the pedals, while pushing down and forward on the handlebars. It helps to think about the lifting of the back tire as snapping one's wrist forward and shifting their weight at the same time. The combination of these two motions allows the rider to first raise their centre of gravity, and then tuck the bike underneath them, to achieve greater ground clearance.The second technique, more easily performed on a bicycle with full suspension, is applying a weighting compression force downwards into bars and pedals, once full compression is achieved then springing upwards un-weighting both bars and pedals equal amounts so that both front and rear wheels leave the ground. This technique can also be combined with a lifting of the bike through clip less pedals and is sometimes termed the English bunny hop.|$|E
50|$|Almost all longboard {{wheels are}} made from urethane. The {{performance}} of longboard wheels is determined by five characteristics: height, lip shape, contact patch, durometer, and hub setting. Typical longboard wheels range from 65 to 107 mm in diameter. A taller wheel will have slower acceleration but a faster <b>rolling</b> <b>speed.</b> Smaller wheels have the opposite effect. The durometer of a wheel is how hard the urethane is. A softer wheel will be ultimately slower than a harder wheel on smooth surface. When the road surface gets rougher a softer wheel provides a smoother, faster ride. The fastest duro for the normal road is around 80a. Softer wheels have more grip than harder wheels on any surface. The contact patch of a wheel is {{the width of the}} section of the wheel that makes contact with the road. Generally, the wider the wheel, the more traction it will have. Wheels can be anywhere from 50 to 100 mm in width, but most commonly between 60 and(-) 70 mm. The shape of the lip has a noticeable effect on traction. Rounded lips are made to break loose into a slide and square lips are made to grip. Square lipped wheels do break loose but the slide is not as smooth as that of a round lipped wheel. A wheel hub (or core) is the plastic (or sometimes aluminum) center of a wheel that holds the bearings. The position of the hub affects the properties of the wheel.|$|E
