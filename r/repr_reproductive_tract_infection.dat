Women consulted a variety of healthcare providers in their pursuit for treatment, mainly allopathic doctors and hakims. The different treatments prescribed to women ranged from oral and intravaginal medications to various home remedies including refraining from specific foods. Causes of <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> reported were "melting bones", consuming foods with perceived hot composition, poor personal hygiene and procedures like dilatation and curettage, delivery and induced abortions. None reported sexually transmitted diseases as the perceived cause of their problem. Interference with religious activities, sexual relationships or socializing was reported as consequences of <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections,</b> in addition to lower abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, backache and kamzori (weakness). Pakistani women seek care for <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> and visit a variety of providers, though causes and treatments offered are usually not related to sexually transmitted diseases.

40|$|Background: In {{the recent}} years, {{the issue of}} gynaecological {{problems}} of poor women in the developing countries has been receiving increasing attention. High levels of gynaecological morbidity, especially <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> and sexually transmitted infections {{may turn out to}} be fatal if not treated properly. The objective of this study was to assess the health seeking attitude of women regarding <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections,</b> to elicit the past history pertaining to it, to assess the personal hygiene measures relevant to it. Methods: Various community based studies carried out in the different regions world showed the prevalence of <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> 36 - 84 %. The sample size of study as per statistical calculation (4 pq/l 2, where p = 50, q= 100 -p and l= 10 % of p) came out to be 400. Prior enlisting all villages of Surendranagar district, one village was selected randomly. After random selection the village found was Khodu. Results: 75. 3 % of women narrated treatment was necessary; 44 % told that preferably to be taken from doctor and 24. 7 % told treatment should not be taken because of social and personal reason. 56. 5 % of women having one or the other kind of symptom of <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections.</b> Women with poor menstrual and personal hygiene has got 2. 5 times chances of <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> (OR= 2. 35, CI= 1. 374 - 4. 01, P value: 0. 001). Thus the overall prevalence in our study is 56. 5 %. On statistical analysis it was found that women who used clothes were two times more symptomatic as compared to women who used sanitary pads, a significant association between women having symptoms of <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> and their sexual history. The present study showed 61. 94 % of women had taken treatment which shows that the health seeking behavior had improved. Conclusions: Women who used sanitary pads during menstrual periods had lower prevalence. Women with complaints of dyspareunia, bleeding during and or after intercourse and history of forceful intercourse had maximum prevalence of <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections.</b> 19. 8 % of women gave past history of <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> and out of that 15. 16 % of women had taken treatment for it. Regarding health seeking attitude of symptomatic women, 61. 94 % of women had taken treatment and majority of them had taken treatment from doctors.

METHODS: In the Matlab area a systematic sample of married non-pregnant women aged 15 - 50 years was drawn from a comprehensive household registration system for married women. A systematic sample of married and unmarried men in the same age group was drawn from a census-derived demographic surveillance list. Private interviews were conducted with 804 women in a clinic, and cervical, vaginal, urinary and serological samples were collected. Urine and blood specimens were obtained from 969 men who were interviewed at home. FINDINGS: The prevalence of bacterial and viral <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> was low to moderate. For example, fewer than 1 % of the women had a cervical infection.

The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of bacterial agents will also be determined. Patients and Methods: High vaginal swabs or endocervical swabs and blood were collected from 957 patients consisting of 755 out-patients and 202 in-patients. The swabs were processed and microbial isolates identified using standard technique. Disc susceptibility tests were also performed on microbial isolates. The blood samples were used for serological diagnosis of syphilis. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in the prevalence of female <b>reproductive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>infections</b> between in-patients (52. 48 %) and out-patients (47. 02 %), although in-patients showed a significantly higher risk of developing mixed infections (in-patients vs. out-patients; 34. 91 % vs. 22. 25 %, OR = 1. 873 95 % CI = 1. 169, 3. 001; P = 0. 01).

Most vaginal infections could be identified through simple, clinic-based diagnostic tests, although further research into the cost-effectiveness of establishing and maintaining these services would be useful.
