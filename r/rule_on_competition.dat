40|$|Energy {{sector has}} been one of {{priorities}} of the EU regarding competition law. As stated in introduction, fair competition is applied to the gas sector through application of the Articles 101 and 102 TFEU when the actions of gas companies make it applicable. On the other hand, it is also included to the market through sector specific legislation. It has been rather successful at imposing competition rules to gas sector both through case law, as through sector specific legislation, such as energy legislative packages. But the market of gas is not completely liberalized yet, especially not in the Central European countries. One of the reasons is that in the whole European Union, there are seven big energy utilities that are present in several Member States. Most of them are cooperating with each other, mainly through mergers and acquisitions and trying to strengthen their position in the market, which sometimes presents a violation of the provisions of TFEU. Instead, the companies should, according to the Commission work {{in a way that is}} compatible with the EU law. A rather common action that was seen from the companies’ side is joint marketing of gas, that Commission also investigated. In those cases it was deciding according to the Article 101 (1) TFEU and it found two variations of violation of the abovementioned article. In the Corrib case there was an obvious territorial sales restriction within the production and sales of gas, in a form of horizontal agreements. The latter are one of the agreements that fall within the scope of provisions of Article 101 (1) TFEU, and are therefore not permitted. In the GFU case the joint selling of gas was happening in a form of cartel, which is one of the hardcore restriction of the Article 101 (1) TFEU and therefore the Commission once again proved that it is exercising its competence in a way of protecting fair competition that leads towards a fully competitive internal market of gas. Another hardcore restriction that appeared in the investigations is also the actions in DUC case where the Commission interpreted the collective negotiation of the DUC members as joint coordination of sales that restricted competition. In this case the Commission did not allow the joint marketing to be interpreted as a block exemption and therefore did not allow it, which shows the Commission’s strong stand against hardcore restrictions of Article 101 TFEU. Another type of restrictive actions that the Commission did not tolerate and therefor investigated is destination clauses. Therefore the Commission was looking upon the vertical restrictions on commercial freedom of gas sales. Because of damaging effects of vertical restrictions, was the Commission acting rather strict when deciding upon the cases. In the GDF it found that the two clauses that restricted the territory where ENI and ENEL were able to resell the gas caused partitioning of the market. Therefore it did not allow to impose an exemption of the prohibition of Article 101 TFEU. Commission was also showing its strong position on not allowing destination clauses in the Gazprom cases. But although Commission showed its relatively strong position in the protection of fair competition in the gas markets, the gas utilities were still violating the EU <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition.</b> Therefore the Commission investigated more cases regarding horizontal restriction, such as in the case of E. ON Ruhrgas and GDF. The Commission showed its strong stand and it looked into any types of arrangements that could distort competition, which is in accordance with the interpretation of Article 101 TFEU. Additionally, in the case of ENI group the Commission applied sector specific legislation and showed that the companies need to consider Gas Directive and Regulations as well when acting on the gas market. Commission’s work on progression of fair competition in gas market is constant. In the last round of investigation it investigated that was, first of all abusing its dominant position that affected interstate trade in the five Central and Eastern European countries and therefore violated the prohibition of Article 102 TFEU. Second of all, it imposed territorial restrictions that might result in unfair prices of gas that clearly violates the provisions of Article 101 TFEU. Therefore it is important that the Commission recognized the violation by Gazprom and investigated on the case. But it is not just upon the gas companies to change their businesses, it is also upon the Member States to impose the rules that help providing a fully liberalized market in the States and therefore provide a free choice for the consumers. As seen, one of the tools to achieve it is trading hubs. They have consequences for fair competition in the gas market to the extend that there is no long-term obligation for the buyers to buy a certain amount of gas in a long term. If we i. e. take a look at the NBP hub, we can see that 70 % of the gas sold is over the Counter volumes and the price is not oil indexed, but it reflects commodity price with no geographic differentials. Developed trading hubs within the EU would bring a very liberalized financial market of gas trade that would be within the policy of the EU regarding fair competition. As seen at the two advanced hubs, the price of gas is not prone to oil prices, but is based on the economical situation of supply and demand. As the sales of gas are anonymous, there is less possibility for restrictive agreements between companies, which brings the situation a step closer to the fully liberalized market. Another aspect of gas market that plays an important role at liberalization is access to transmission system in a form of Third Party Access that can be plausible for both the owner, and the users of pipelines that would be able to transfer their gas through pipelines that are already built and not have enormous expenses in building their own pipelines, especially if the gas providers are smaller entities. Another important aspect regarding transmission systems is also making transmission system operators independent from gas companies. As that was not fully achieved after the second energy legislative package, it is important that both the Member States and the EU develop and supervise the development of unbundling in the markets. Central European countries will in the near future have a lot of work at achieving fully developed market in terms of fair competition and liberalization. On the other hand, the European Commission might need to help them in order to become less dependent from the Russian gas imports. That is important because, as seen in example of Hungary, because of the dominance of the Russian gas there has been a lack of competition. But some of the Central European countries are slowly moving towards liberalized gas market with various competitors present. One example is Czech Republic, where there were recently imposed national rules on unbundling, that are implementing provisions of the Third GasDirective. The regulation imposed an Independent Operator and it unbundled distributor of gas from the TSOs, gas trading companies and storage operators, which will should lead to a better choice for customers and more fair prices. Another aspect of market liberalization that will in the future play a relevant role is also that the process is being controlled by the Commission, CJEU and National Competition Authorities. The first two were involved in the case of regulation of Polish regulation of natural gas prices and showed that the supervision of the development of the fully-competitive, liberalized market. National Competition Authority of the Republic of Slovenia on the other hand, showed its big involvement on supervision of imposing of fair market and gas trade. It investigated the biggest national gas provider several times, on the terms of merger control, as also on abuse of dominant position and showed its strong stand regarding competition protection. Achieving a state of a fully liberalised market with fair competition rules and totally liberalised market of gas trade is a lengthy and complicated procedure. Because of all the aspects that need to be considered and 27 different situations of the market of gas in the EU, the common internal market is a very high goal to be achieved, but not impossible. As long as the Member States cooperate with the Commission and supervise the acts of the companies in accordance with the Energy Legislative package and with the Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, the tendency will go towards the achievemnt of fully competitive internal market...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of decisions made by government and market structure on productivity of innovation activities. People expect state representatives to manage public resources accurately and pursuit the most desirable community's surplus in terms of economic welfare.

Based on an international empirical survey conducted in five European countries, this paper finds a sound mediating effect of new service development. The higher the propensity towards innovation activities the higher the probability of obtaining benefits from competitive pressure. In fact innovation oriented firms outperform the market by converting ideas into business, as a consequence, enhancing, updating or consolidating their offer portfolio. Results stem from two structural equation models that constitute the originality of this study.

The thesis comes to the conclusion that Art. 85 (1) as well as Art. 86 EEC Treaty can be applied and indeed have to be applied to all anticompetitive measures on the electricity market. In doing so, special consideration has to be given to the technical and economic peculiarities of this branch.

40|$|The {{interest}} in decentralising governance is increasing worldwide. In Europe too, {{a policy of}} decentralisation is being applied. In economic law, notably in both the cases of EC competition and financial services law, new rules {{are in the process}} of being introduced. In competition law, the regulation on the implementation of the <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> has lead to a decentralised model of law enforcement. In financial services law, the directive on markets in financial instruments has proposed the introduction of a four-level rule-making model, which may represent a participative, decentralised approach, but has resulted in a centralisation of that process, while the enforcement remains decentralised. This essay provides a brief overview of these models of regulation. Then, it examines these regulatory structures and focuses on the question of the impact of the decentralisation process in the context of decentred understandings of regulation. It points to the paradox of law being decentralised where it is a centralised function and thus represents an oxymoron. The paper argues that decentralisation results in an oxymoron depending on the function of law considered.

At that time, a standard for providing stereophonic TV sound had been developed by the Institut für Rundfunktechnik. In 1980, the IGR GmbH acquired the then pending patent applications related to this standard for 150.000 DM (about 75.000 €) and granted patent licenses to its members only. The IGR GmbH planned to grant limited licenses to non-members at a later date. In 1981, Salora, a Finnish TV set manufacturer, was unable to fulfill its contracts with major German mail-order firms after the IGR GmbH obtained an injunction from a court. Following a complaint by Salora, the European Commission started antitrust investigations against IGR GmbH but terminated the proceeding when IGR GmbH agreed to immediately grant unlimited licenses to Salora. However, IGR GmbH and its members continued to leverage their position by requiring other European manufacturers to pay royalties.

40|$|Includes bibliographySummary Competition {{policy has}} become an {{important}} topic {{in the context of}} the global trade and capital liberalization processes of the past decade. The average tariff rate on imports has decreased substantially and various non-tariff restrictions have been abolished. Barriers to trade erected by private parties have hardly been tackled, however, although these business practices can distort trade and investment flows and lead to conflicts between countries. Competition policy deals with anti-competitive business practices (sometimes called restrictive business practices). Competition laws were first introduced in the United States and later in European countries. Latin American countries have only recently adopted competition laws. The subject is complex and interdisciplinary. It combines the fields of international law, corporate law, industrial organization, innovation policy, transnational corporations, international trade and transport. Competition policy seeks to prevent companies from reducing the efficiency of market mechanisms. It is aimed at keeping firms from forming cartels or monopolies and from abusing a dominant market position and at ensuring that mergers and acquisitions and subjected to proper scrutiny. These practices often limit competition and take away incentives to excel, innovate, reduce prices and improve customer service. Anti-competitive practices mayalso act as trade barriers that distort trade and investment flows. They may reduce gl obal welfare and lead to conf l i ct s between countries. Hence, some sort of international agreement may be necessary to forestall or eliminate these new kinds of trade barriers. Such an agreement could, in addition, take the place of anti-dumping measures and thus avoid their detrimental effects. The United States was the first country to introduce competition policies. The European Union has a supranational system of competition policies that regulate anti-competitive practices, mergers and acquisitions having transborder effects. Competition laws in Latin American countries are relatively new, and their structure and wording resemble those of Western countries. Enforcement activity in these countries has, however, been less than energetic. There have been various unsuccessful attempts in the past to establish a multilateral agreement <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> policy. International organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) have studied and discussed the topic extensively. UNCTAD has been involved in many competition policy initiatives and has assisted developing countries with the introduction of suitable legislation. In addition, UNCTAD has made available a set of non-binding multilateral rules to control restrictive practices. OECD perceives competition policies as a step towards the creation of contestable markets at the international level. It recommends that all countries adopt competition policies and establish the required enforcement agencies. The OECD countries should cooperate to restrain anti-competitive practices that have effects on more than one country. Currently, competition policies are being discussed in various international organizations. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a working group that is studying the subject, and some countries even want to establish a multilateral agreement <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> <b>rules.</b> Furthermore, the OECD are also studying the topic and have published several proposals. In Latin America, discussion groups are taking place on the theme. Various subregional groups, including the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), Group of Three, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) have formed working groups that are examining questions related to competition policy. The topic is also included in the preparatory work for the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The United States does not support a new international agreement <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> policy. Instead, it advocates bilateral agreements whose scope would be confined to cooperation between national competition-policy enforcement agencies. Furthermore, the United States prefers to keep its domestic anti-dumping legislation. The European Union, on the other hand, is more enthusiastic about multilateral <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> policy. The European Union would also like other countries to make their courts accessible to foreign firms. The next step would be the adoption of common rules by all countries and international cooperation between enforcement agencies. The developing countries position <b>on</b> multilateral <b>rules</b> governing <b>competition</b> policy is more vague. Before Latin American countries commit themselves to international agreements <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> policy, they should carefully study the issue as it relates to their development needs. On the one hand, it is in their own interest to adopt competition policies. However, there are a number of as yet unanswered questions concerning the impact of <b>competition</b> policies <b>on</b> foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, certain modifications can be made in the legislation to address those concerns. For instance, exemptions for certain practices and sectors might be given. The authority of the enforcement agency might even be extended to such an extent that it could act as a general promoter of economic liberalization. It is sometimes argued that developing countries should adopt more lenient policies in order to build large, competitive domestic enterprises. This probably has a negative overall welfare effect, however, and should be avoided. The final point made in this study is that multilateral negotiations are more in the interest of Latin American countries than bilateral agreements with industrialized countries. This paper reviews the current debate <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> policy. It starts with an introduction to the subject, followed by a short survey of competition policy in the United States, Europe and Latin America. An overview of anti-competitive business practices is then provided. Subsequently, the paper examines the reasons for the adoption of multilateral <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> policy. Chapter II describes the different domestic competition policies in the United States, Europe and Latin American countries. The following chapter deals with the rationale for multilateral <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> policy and reviews previous attempts to establish multilateral rules, as well as the work of UNCTAD and OECD <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> policies. The current discussions at WTO are outlined in chapter IV, with emphasis on the negotiating positions of the United States, the European Union and developing countries. The paper closes with a discussion of issues that could be important to the formulation of a negotiating position for Latin American and Caribbean countries. It addresses questions such as (1) whether it is favourable or necessary for Latin American countries to adopt domestic competition laws, (2) whether these laws need a specific form (different from the laws in developed countries) to meet their development needs and (3) whether multilateral rules are in the interest of developing countries...|$|R

40|$|Both the European Commission’s {{decision-making}} and the EU case-law {{on state aid}} schemes are symptomatic of the uncertainty, and sometimes even contradiction, that is implicit in treatments of State aid, a discipline which form part of the Treaty’s <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition,</b> in which, nonetheless the rights that undertakings enjoy are quite limited. This article examines the current position in the case-law on whether {{it is possible for}} undertakings (whether aid beneficiaries, or their competitors) to challenge the Commission’s decision on aid schemes, meaning state measures, often implemented in the form of legislation, that address a number of beneficiaries and that may fall under the prohibition set forth in Articles 107 et seq. TFEU. This is an area in which the Commission and the Community judicature are constantly doing battle. The Commission tends to view its decisions as purely general measures, and as such not open to challenge, the judicature has shown greater flexibility towards the undertakings that bring actions before it, frequently finding that these decisions affect applicants’ positions, and are thus subject to review. The article looks in particular at recent developments in the case-law that have applied Article 263 (4) TFEU, final limb, to State aid, finding that a decision on an aid scheme may in some cases constitute a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures.
