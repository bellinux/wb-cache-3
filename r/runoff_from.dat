5|$|Agricultural <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> {{farms and}} ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. <b>Runoff</b> <b>from</b> several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E

5|$|The {{waters of}} Catawissa Creek are highly acidic, with a pH of 4.5, due to <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> an {{abandoned}} {{mine in the}} creek's watershed. Catawissa Creek is smaller than the nearby Fishing Creek {{due to a lack}} of major tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Flat Creek, a small southeast-flowing stream, {{rises in}} two forks and empties into the Sacramento River {{upstream}} of Spring Creek. The stream receives contaminated <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> the Minnesota Flats Tailing Pile, {{but is not}} nearly as polluted or acidic as Spring Creek. Another stream, Rock Creek, rises in three forks and flows east to meet the Sacramento River downstream of Spring Creek and the Keswick Reservoir.|$|E

5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
5|$|The meltwater {{from the}} glaciers drains {{primarily}} to the Cauca River and Magdalena River via the western and eastern flanks of the volcano, respectively. <b>Runoff</b> <b>from</b> these glaciers and those on the surrounding volcanoes {{is a source of}} fresh water for forty surrounding towns, and Colombian scientists and government officials are concerned about the towns' water supply should the glaciers melt completely.|$|E
5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E

40|$|The use of coal {{for fuel}} {{in place of}} {{oil and natural gas}} has been {{increasing}} in the United States. Typically, users store their reserves of coal outdoors in large piles and rainfall on the coal creates runoffs which may contain materials hazardous to the environment and the public 2 ̆ 7 s health. To study this hazard, rainfall on model coal piles was simulated, using deionized water and four coals of varying sulfur content. The simulated surface runoffs were collected during 9 rainfall simulations spaced 15 days apart. The runoffs were analyzed for 13 standard water quality parameters, extracted with organic solvents and then analyzed with capillary column GC/MS, and the extracts were tested for mutagenicity with the Ames Salmonella microsomal assay and for clastogenicity with Chinese hamster ovary cells. ^ The <b>runoffs</b> <b>from</b> the high-sulfur coals and the lignite exhibited extremes of pH (acidity), specific conductance, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids; the low-sulfur coal runoffs did not exhibit these extremes. Without treatment, effluents from these high-sulfur coals and lignite would not comply with federal water quality guidelines. ^ Most extracts of the simulated surface runoffs contained at least 10 organic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, their methyl and ethyl homologs, olefins, paraffins, and some terpenes. The concentrations of these compounds were generally less than 50 (mu) g/l in most extracts. ^ Some of the extracts were weakly mutagenic and affected both a DNA-repair proficient and deficient Salmonella strain. The addition of S 9 decreased the effect significantly. Extracts of <b>runoffs</b> <b>from</b> the low-sulfur coal were not mutagenic. ^ All extracts were clastogenic. Extracts of <b>runoffs</b> <b>from</b> the high-sulfur coals were both clastogenic and cytotoxic; those from the low-sulfur coal and the lignite were less clastogenic and not cytotoxic. Clastogenicity occurred with and without S 9 activation. Chromosomal lesions included gaps, breaks and exchanges. These data suggest a relationship between the sulfur content of a coal, its mutagenicity and also its clastogenicity. ^ The <b>runoffs</b> <b>from</b> actual coal piles should be investigated for possible genotoxic effects in view of the data presented in this study. ...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of the Project, many CVP operations have had considerable environmental consequences, including a decline in the salmon population of four major California rivers, and the reduction of riparian zones and wetlands. Many historical sites and Native American tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{with water}} quality {{in some of}} the former Manchester Docks basins became {{apparent}} with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality {{to such an extent that}} the number of invertebrate species present, like freshwater shrimp, increased by more than30. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.|$|E
5|$|The most Mesa Verdeans practiced dry farming, which {{relied on}} rain to water their crops, but others {{utilized}} runoff, springs, seeps, and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand. Archaeologists believe {{that prior to}} the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited {{to members of the}} surrounding community.|$|E
30|$|Turbidity is {{a measure}} of {{suspended}} minerals, bacteria, plankton, and dissolved organic and inorganic substances. Turbidity often is associated with surface water sources. The turbidity values were observed to be higher during the wet season than in the dry season. This was probably due to the high-natural erosion and <b>runoffs</b> <b>from</b> the surrounding as well as the waste generated from the municipal activities within the river.|$|R

5|$|The {{sandstone}} formations {{from which}} Silver Reef gets its name were formed when tectonic stresses forced long, longitudinally aligned sections of Navajo Sandstone to buckle and {{stand on their}} sides, giving them the appearance of ocean reefs. Over {{long periods of time}} silver ore, sediments, and vegetation were carried in water <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> the Chinle Formation to the White, Buckeye, and East reefs. The ore settled as deposits and the vegetation became petrified. The Silver Reef Mining District's geologic resources consist mainly of silver deposits, with smaller deposits of copper, gold, lead, and uranium oxide. Iron oxide deposits in the soil rocks cause a red coloration, and dinosaur tracks from the early Jurassic period have been found in the area.|$|E
5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E

5|$|Eleven U.S. {{national}} parks – Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Petrified Forest, Rocky Mountain, Saguaro, and Zion – {{are in the}} watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and recreation areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado's major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming, and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding Glen Canyon National Recreation Area received more than twomillion visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9million people visited Lake Mead and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in 2008. Colorado River recreation employs some 250,000 people and contributes $26billion each year to the Southwest economy.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E
5|$|Following summer floods of 1997 and the {{prolonged}} flooding of 1999-2000 the Parrett Catchment Project was formed, partly {{funded by the}} European Union Regional Development Fund, by 30 organisations, including British Waterways, Campaign to Protect Rural England, Countryside Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Kings Sedgemoor and Cary Vale Internal Drainage Board (now part of Parrett Internal Drainage Board), Levels and Moors Partnership, National Farmers Union, Sedgemoor, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council, Taunton Deane and Wessex Water. They aim to tackle twelve areas, which, when combined, will make {{a significant contribution to}} reducing the adverse effects of flooding. These include the conversion of arable land, adoption of the Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) approach to controlling rainwater <b>runoff</b> <b>from</b> developed areas, dredging, raising riverbanks and improving pumping facilities. Further studies of the possible beneficial effects of woodland in reducing flooding have also been undertaken.|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} coral {{recruits}} in Yenliao Bay showed a negative correlation with depths (Table  3). Moreover, {{the number of}} coral recruits on top and vertical surfaces decreased with increasing depths (Figure  8). Since water turbidity in Yenliao Bay is frequently high due to constant input of <b>runoffs</b> <b>from</b> adjacent rivers and resuspension of sediment, light intensity {{in the water column}} reduces rapidly with increasing depths. Light availability at different depths is likely the primary factor controlling the settlement pattern of coral recruits in Yenliao Bay.|$|R
