Later, two more cases, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, were identified. It was the first outbreak in Syria since 1999. Doctors and international public health agencies <b>report</b> <b>more</b> than 90 cases of polio in Syria, with fears of contagion in rebel areas from lack of sanitation and safe-water services.|$|E

40|$|Relationships between {{patterns}} of extradyadic involvement (EDI) and adult attach-ment were examined separately with undergraduates and community adults reporting prior EDI.

Fearful and preoccupied undergraduates and community males <b>reported</b> a <b>more</b> obsessive extradyadic relationship. However, dismissive individuals did not re-port more casual EDI. Gender effects also emerged, with females <b>reporting</b> <b>more</b> inti-macy motivations than males, and undergraduate males <b>reporting</b> <b>more</b> casual EDI than undergraduate females.

40|$|Drawing upon feminist {{analyses}} of double jeopardy and {{the cult of}} true womanhood, we examine race, rank, sexual harassment frequency, and psychological distress for Black and White female military personnel (N = 7, 714). Results indicated that White women <b>reported</b> <b>more</b> overall sexual harassment, gender harassment, and crude behavior, whereas Black women <b>reported</b> <b>more</b> unwanted sexual attention and sexual coercion; enlisted women reported higher rates of each subtype than officers. Black enlistees <b>reported</b> <b>more</b> sexual coercion than White enlistees, and enlistees <b>reported</b> <b>more</b> than officers, {{but there were no}} racial differences across officers. Black women <b>reported</b> <b>more</b> psychological distress following gender harassment than White women, and enlisted women <b>reported</b> <b>more</b> distress following gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion than officers. Although Black officers were less distressed at low levels of sexual coercion, as coercion became more frequent, their distress increased significantly, and at high levels, all groups were similarly distressed. Sexual harassment is an occupational hazard directly affecting the majority of women across a variety of workplace settings (Fitzgerald & Shullman, 1993; Ilies, Hauserman, Schwochau, & Stibal, 2003).

25|$|In {{line with}} the {{salience}} hypothesis, there is considerable evidence {{that people who have}} more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall. There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who <b>report</b> <b>more</b> bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also <b>report</b> <b>more</b> frequent nightmares.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{forms of}} {{adolescent}} autonomy (emotional autonomy, voice, and cognitive autonomy) were examined as correlates of parental and partner relationships. Measures included parental warmth and psychological control, and romantic support and negative interactions. Participants were 206 students (age 17 to 20, Mage= 18) who had romantic partners. Those who <b>reported</b> <b>more</b> emotional autonomy from parents (e. g., individuation and nondependence) reported less voice {{with parents and}} less cognitive autonomy. Adolescents reported less independence from their parents, more voice with parents and more confidence in their own choices when they <b>reported</b> <b>more</b> parental warmth.

25|$|Since {{hedge funds}} are private {{entities}} and have few public disclosure requirements, this is sometimes {{perceived as a}} lack of transparency. Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud. New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 require hedge fund managers to <b>report</b> <b>more</b> information, leading to greater transparency. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements. The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions and leverage exposure.|$|E
25|$|Tom Daschle was Obama's {{original}} {{nominee for}} Health and Human Services Secretary. However, he owed over $128,000 in taxes over three years, failed to <b>report</b> <b>more</b> than $83,000 in consulting fees in 2007, and owed $12,000 in interest and penalties. He also provided insufficient documentation for $15,000 of the $276,000 in charitable contributions {{that he and}} his wife, Linda, gave during the three-year period being studied by the panel. Daschle also had some miscommunications with his accountant on the $255,000 use of a luxury car service that was used 80% for personal services. Daschle paid his back taxes six days before his first confirmation hearings with the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. On February 3, The New York Times called the Daschle nomination into question both for his tax issues and for his extensive private sector work in the health services industry. The editorial noted that although Daschle was aware of his tax problem in June 2008, he did not correct it until his cabinet nomination. Later that day, Daschle withdrew his nomination.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{construction}} of the new camp site west of Lang Vei, Willoughby and his CIDG soldiers concentrated their efforts on strengthening the campâ€™s defenses, and they made relatively few contacts with the North Vietnamese. However, unbeknown to Willoughby, the North Vietnamese 304th Division had assembled on the battlefield, reinforced by the 198th Tank Battalion, with the following orders: the 66th Regiment was given the task of capturing Khe Sanh village, part of Huong Hoa District, to begin their Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign; the 24th Regiment was ordered to destroy the enemy strongholds of Ban Houei Sane and Lang Vei; while the 9th Regiment was ordered to destroy any reinforcements that may try to relieve those bases areas. From December 1967, CIDG soldiers operating from Lang Vei began to <b>report</b> <b>more</b> frequent contacts with the North Vietnamese. By mid-January, U.S. military intelligence also reported movements of North Vietnamese formations across the Xe Pone River from Laos into South Vietnam.

At Time 1, 5019 Australian employees were surveyed, of whom 3220 responded to a repeat survey a year later. Beyond organizational, job and individual variables, gender differences arose in the links of mentor support to career advancement, differently for career and psychosocial support.

Additionally, the role of others â€Ÿ autonomy support was investigated. General self-determination was associated with perceptions of fewer body image pressures and lower body dissatisfaction.
