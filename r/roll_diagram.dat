On another page there was a third, fourth. All leading to me. ? Routed in the margins of those diagrams, and I was sowing my own. Books everywhere, with strips of paper protruding from them like dry and shriveled tongues. The need for both biological and social absorption. Dilute the strain.|$|R
60|$|So the {{equatorial}} was unscrewed, and the stand taken down; the astronomer's barrow-load of precious memoranda, and rolls upon <b>rolls</b> of <b>diagrams,</b> representing {{three years of}} continuous labour, were safely packed; and Swithin departed for good and all from the shores of Cape Town.|$|R
25|$|By 1894, the VR's <b>Rolling</b> Stock Branch <b>Diagram</b> Book noted their {{allocation}} {{around the}} state, with 2 at Stawell, 6 at Melbourne, 5 at Bendigo, 3 at Geelong, 6 at Ballarat, 4 at Benalla, and 3 at Seymour.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem was}} {{printing}} the diagrams. GM solved {{this problem by}} using an approach developed by Boeing, replacing the milling head of a computerized milling machine with a ball-point pen and connecting the inputs of the mill to the 704 computer. To address the extremely limited amount of memory available on the 704, they broke the diagrams down into 32-by-32-inch squares, which could be plotted with enough accuracy {{that they could be}} loaded up as separate tiles and still line up perfectly when plotted as part of complete diagrams. A set of rollers were added to allow the plotter to move a single 96 in piece of paper around the drawing surface on demand, meaning that the paper {{did not have to be}} cut into pieces. The paper was delivered in <b>rolls,</b> allowing <b>diagrams</b> to be any length.|$|R
50|$|The FERMIAC {{used this}} method to create {{two-dimensional}} neutron genealogies {{on a scale}} diagram of a nuclear device. A series of drums on the device were set according to the material being crossed and a random choice between fast and slow neutrons. Random numbers also determined the direction of travel and the distance until the next collision. Once the drums were set, the trolley was <b>rolled</b> across the <b>diagram,</b> drawing a path as it went. Any time a change in material was indicated on the diagram, the drum settings were adjusted accordingly before continuing.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Roll waves of finite amplitude on {{a thin layer of}} non-Newtonian fluid modeled as a power-law fluid are considered. In the long wave approximation, the flow is governed by a non-homogeneous hyperbolic system of equations. As the linearized instability analysis of a uniform flow delivers only a diagnosis of instability, the nonlinear stability is investigated and the criterion for roll waves based on the hyperbolicity of the modulation equation is suggested. The main problem in defining the roll wave stability region on a <b>roll</b> wave <b>diagram</b> is due to the singularities of functions for the mean values and their derivatives near the boundaries of roll wave existence. Asymptotic formulae for nonlinear stability of roll waves of small and maximal amplitudes are derived. Numerical calculation reveals that for a Newtonian fluid, as the bottom inclination decreases downwardly the amplitude of admissible waves diminishes, and the stability domain reduces until it disappears. These results remain valid for a slightly non-Newtonian fluid. For highly non-Newtonian fluid, an inversion in the nature of stability is observed. cf 201...|$|R
60|$|The {{morning was}} bright and spring-like. A pale blue sky arched over London, with a few gauzy white clouds {{drifting}} lazily across it. At eleven o'clock Brown might have been seen entering the Patent Office with a great <b>roll</b> of parchment, <b>diagrams,</b> and plans under his arm. At twelve he emerged again smiling, and, opening his pocket-book, he packed away very carefully a small slip of official blue paper. At five minutes to one his cab rolled into Victoria Station. Two giant canvas-covered parcels, like enormous kites, were handed down by the cabman from the top, and consigned {{to the care of}} a guard. On the platform Pericord was pacing up and down, with long eager step and swinging arms, a tinge of pink upon his sunken and sallow cheeks.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMarangoni {{convection}} in a differentially heated {{binary mixture}} is studied numerically by continuation. The fluid {{is subject to}} the Soret effect and is contained in a two-dimensional small-aspect-ratio rectangular cavity with one undeformable free surface. Either or both of the temperature and concentration gradients may be destabilizing; all three possibilities are considered. A spectral-element time-stepping code is adapted to calculate bifurcation points and solution branches via Newton's method. Linear thresholds are compared to those obtained for a pure fluid. It is found that for large enough Soret coefficient, convection is initiated predominantly by solutal effects and leads to a single large <b>roll.</b> Computed bifurcation <b>diagrams</b> show a marked transition from a weakly convective Soret regime to a strongly convective Marangoni regime when the threshold for pure fluid thermal convection is passed. The presence of many secondary bifurcations means that the mode of convection at the onset of instability is often observed only over a small range of Marangoni number. In particular, two-roll states with up-flow at the centre succeed one-roll states via a well-defined sequence of bifurcations. When convection is oscillatory at onset, the limit cycle is quickly destroyed by a global (infinite-period) bifurcation leading to subcritical steady convection...|$|R
40|$|We {{expand the}} {{velocity}} {{field in the}} vicinity of the wall in empirical eigenfunctions obtained from experiment. Truncating our system and using Galerkin projection, we obtain a closed set of non-linear ordinary differential equations with ten degrees of freedom. We find a rich dynamical behavior, including in particular a heteroclinic attracting orbit giving rise to intermittency. The intermittent jump from one attracting point to the other resembles in many respects the bursts observed in experiments. Specifically, the time between jumps and the duration of the jumps, is approximately that observed in a burst; the jump begins with the formation of a narrowed and intensified updraft, like the ejection phase of a burst, and is followed by a gentle, diffuse downdraft like the sweep phase of a burst. The magnitude of the Reynolds stress spike produced during a burst is limited by our truncation. The behavior is quite robust, much of it being due to the symmetries present (Aubry's group has examined dimensions up to 128 with persistence of the global behavior). We have examined eigenvalues and coefficients obtained from experiment, and from exact simulation, which differ in magnitude. Similar behavior is obtained in both cases; in the latter case, the heteroclinic orbits connect limit cycles instead of fixed points, corresponding to cross-stream waving of the streamwise <b>rolls.</b> The bifurcation <b>diagram</b> remains structurally similar, but somewhat distorted. The role of the pressure term is made clear - it triggers the intermittent jumps, which otherwise would occur at longer and longer intervals, as the system trajectory is attracted closer and closer to the heteroclinic cycle. The pressure term results in the jumps occurring at essentially random times, and the magnitude of the signal determines the average timing. Stretching of the wall region shows that the model is consistent with observations of polymer drag reduction. Change of the third order coefficients, corresponding to acceleration or deceleration of the mean flow, changes the heteroclinic cycles from attracting to repelling, increasing or decreasing the stability, in agreement with observations. The existence of fixed points is an artifact introduced by the projection; however, a decoupled model still displays the rich dynamics. Numerous assumptions made in Aubry et al. (1988) can now be proved exactly. Feeding back eigenfuncitons with the proper phase can delay the bursting, (the heteroclinic jump to the other fixed point), decreasing the drag. It is also possible to speed up the bursting, increasing mixing to control separation. Our approach is optimal for short time tracking in control...|$|R
