40|$|Many of the 600 {{species of}} Acacia found in Australia {{form part of}} the diet of several groups of marsupials. Acacia foliage is {{generally}} high in tannins but is consumed by several folivorous possums and by some macropods (kangaroos and wallabies), but the macropods eat it mainly as dry leaf litter during times of food shortage (in dry seasons and drought). Acacia gum is an important diet component of two omnivorous possums (Petaurus breviceps, Gymnobelidius leadbeateri) and, to a lesser extent, two <b>rat-kangaroos</b> (<b>Bettongia</b> sp.). Acacia seeds are consumed by marsupials to a limited extent, but are an important seasonal component of the diet of the mountain brushtail possum (Trichosurus cunninghami), and possibly the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) on Kangaroo Island. Likewise, Acacia arils (lipid-rich appendages to the seeds of some species) are an important seasonal component of the diet of the mahogany glider (Petaurus gracilis). Acacia pollen and nectar are consumed by several omnivorous possums (e. g., Petaurus norfolcensis) {{as well as by}} at least one species of rock-wallaby (Petrogale sp.), but the quantitative contributions made by these floral products to the protein and energy budgets of the consumers have been difficult to determine.

Disparate hopping marsupials (Suborder Macropodiformes), a kangaroo (Macropus rufus) and a <b>rat-kangaroo</b> (<b>Bettongia</b> penicillata), show aerobic capabilities as high as those of 'athletic' placentals. Equivalent muscle mitochondrial volumes and cardiovascular features support these capabilities. We examined S. crassicaudata to determine whether highly developed aerobic capabilities occur elsewhere in marsupials, rather than being restricted to the more recently evolved Macropodiformes. This was the case. Treadmill-trained S. crassicaudata attained a maximal aerobic metabolic rate (VO 2,max or MMR) of 272 ml O₂min⁻¹kg ⁻¹ (N= 8), similar to that reported for a small (~ 20 g), 'athletic' placental, Apodemus sylvaticus, 264 ml O₂min⁻¹kg⁻¹. Hopping marsupials have comparable aerobic levels when body mass variation is considered. Sminthopsis crassicaudata has a basal metabolic rate (BMR) about 75 % of placental values {{but it has a}} notably large factorial aerobic scope (fAS) of 13; elevated fAS also features in hopping marsupials. The VO 2,max of S. crassicaudata was supported by an elevated total muscle mitochondrial volume, which was largely achieved through high muscle mitochondrial volume densities, Vv(mt,f), the mean value being 14. 0 ± 1. 33 %. These data were considered in relation to energy use levels in mammals, particularly field metabolic rate (FMR). BMR is consistently lower in marsupials, but this is balanced by a high fAS, such that marsupial MMR matches that of placentals. However, FMR shows different mass relationships in the two clades, with the FMR of small (< 125 g) marsupials, such as S. crassicaudata, being higher than that in comparably sized placentals, with the reverse applying for larger marsupials. The flexibility of energy output in marsupials provides explanations for this pattern. Overall, our data refute widely held notions of mechanistically closely linked relationships between body mass, BMR, FMR and MMR in mammals generally. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the concentration of mercury in fish consumed in Marabá, Brazil which is located close to the Serra Pelada gold mines. Methods: Fish species which have great economic impact on the city of Marabá were selected for study in a pilot research programme. The species sampled were collected from fish sold at the Feira da 28, were from the species Cichla spp, Mylossoma spp and Pimelodus spp. The samples were processed through the Allegra method. Results: The measured mercury concentrations were Cichla <b>spp.</b> <b>I</b> (0. 750 kg) 600 μg/kg, Cichla spp. II (1. 254 kg) 1000 μg/kg, Cichla spp III (2. 750 kg) < 2000 μg/kg; Mylossoma <b>spp</b> <b>I</b> (1. 300 kg) 100 μg/kg, Mylossoma spp II (2. 100 kg) < 300 μg/kg; Pimelodus <b>spp</b> <b>I</b> (0. 850 kg) 100 μg/kg, Pimelodus spp II (1. 050 kg) < 300 μg/kg.

This study aims to isolate and identify endophytic Trichoderma in roots of healthy banana plants from three districts in Yogyakarta, {{which will be}} used as biological control agent against the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. Isolation was conducted using TSM (Trichoderma Selective Medium). We obtained six isolates of endophytic Trichoderma <b>spp.,</b> <b>i.</b> e., Swn- 1, Swn- 2, Ksn, Psr- 1, Psr- 2, and Psr- 3. Molecular identification was done by using ITS 1 and ITS 2 primer pain and sequenced. The sequence of DNA obtained was analysed and compared with NCBI database by using BLAST-N programe. The results showed that all isolates were amplified at 560 -bp. Phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates Swn- 1, Swn- 2 and Psr- 1 are homologous to Trichoderma harzianum, isolate Ksn homologous to Trichoderma asperrellum, isolate Psr- 2 homologous to Trichoderma gamsii, and isolate Psr- 3 homologous to Trichoderma koningiopsis, with the homologous value of 99 %...|$|R
40|$|Four {{hundred and}} thirty-right Aeromonas, 31 Vibrio and 3 Plesiomonas strains {{isolated}} from moribund and healthy fish, water samples and humans, including 36 reference strains, were compared using numerical taxonomy based on 128 unit characters. Data were {{examined by the}} simple matching (S-SM) and Jaccard (S-J) coefficients, and by unweighted average linkage clustering. As expected, Aeromonas spp. were clearly distinct from those of Vibrio and Plesiomonas. The motile Aeronomas <b>spp.,</b> <b>i.</b> e. Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas caviae and Aeromonas veronii biotype sobria formed discrete homogeneous clusters, distinct from the nonmotile species Aeromonas salmonicida. Furthermore, A. caviae was divided into two biotypes with D-mannose fermentation {{as the most important}} differentiating characteristic. Of the recently described species, A. veronii biotype veronii (type strain ATCC 35624) was phenotypically closest to A. hydrophila, although from DNA:DNA hybridisation studies it was classified within the A. sobria group. Aeromonas schubertii (type strain ATCC 43 700) was well defined and formed a single member cluster The phenotypic boundaries of Aeromonas media (type strain ATCC 33907) and Aeromonas eucrenophila (type strain CDC 0859 - 83) were not clear. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Ticks are obligate hematophagous {{arthropods}} {{of significant}} importance to human and veterinary medicine. They transmit {{a vast array}} of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths. Most epidemiological data on ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) in the West Indies are limited to common livestock pathogens such as Ehrlichia ruminantium, Babesia <b>spp.</b> (<b>i.</b> e., B. bovis and B. bigemina), and Anaplasma marginale, and less information is available on companion animal pathogens. Of note, human tick-borne diseases (TBDs) remain almost completely uncharacterized in the West Indies. Information on TBP presence in wildlife is also missing. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the ticks and TBPs affecting human and animal health in the Caribbean, and introduce the challenges associated with understanding TBD epidemiology and implementing successful TBD management in this region. In particular, we stress the need for innovative and versatile surveillance tools using high-throughput pathogen detection (e. g., high-throughput real-time microfluidic PCR). The use of such tools in large epidemiological surveys will likely improve TBD prevention and control programs in the Caribbean...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} ancient DNA (aDNA) {{involves}} the isolation and retrieval of trace amounts of degraded DNA {{from a variety}} of substrates including fossils, sediments and historical material. The fragmentary nature of aDNA necessitates the use of methods with the ability to capture and amplify short segments of DNA. Collectively aDNA studies have made significant and unique contributions to a wide field of research including conservation, population genetics, taxonomy and phylogeny. The primary aim of this thesis research is to explore the utility of aDNA techniques to study extirpation, extinction and past biodiversity of Australian macropods. Using a combination of historical, Holocene and Pleistocene aged fossils, this research will attempt to investigate what ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can add to our knowledge of Australia’s macropods. Traditional aDNA techniques have largely been used to isolate mtDNA from single fossil samples - an example of this approach is shown in Chapter Two where a wellpreserved wallaby fossil bone from Depuch Island (Western Australia) was studied. The ancient mtDNA (cytochrome b and control region) data produced strong phylogenetic signal and shows that the Depuch Island rock-wallaby specimen is most similar to the mainland Petrogale lateralis lateralis. This finding has conservation implications for ongoing rehabilitation and translocation efforts in the Pilbara region. Chapter Three of this thesis also uses mitochondrial aDNA techniques, to explore questions regarding interrelationships and former distribution of a macropod species complex; <b>Bettongia</b> <b>spp.</b> Cytochrome b and control region data retrieved from 88 historical samples, along with 214 already sequenced samples, place the most recent common ancestor of the brush-tailed bettongs at c. 2. 5 Myr. Ancient mtDNA is suggestive of connectivity between what are now highly fragmented populations, a result that has implications for how critically endangered brush-tailed bettongs should be managed. Ancient DNA analyses and DNA sequencing technology have evolved over recent years and {{during the course of this}} study. Therefore in keeping up with the latest high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology, aDNA analyses in 70 bones and 20 sediment samples excavated from a Late Pleistocene–Holocene cave deposit on Kangaroo Island, South Australia was undertaken. Samples were selected from 15 stratigraphic layers, ranging in age from > 20 ka to 6. 8 ka. The successful retrieval of bona fide aDNA sequences, back to at least 20 ka, demonstrates excellent longterm DNA preservation at the site. All unidentified bones that were screened revealed a number of taxa from the assemblage including, Macropus, Onychogalea, Potorous, Bettongia, Dasyurus, Rattus and Notechis. The results from this study add significant value to the late Pleistocene-mid-Holocene paleontological record, detailing the past diversity of flora and fauna on Kangaroo Island. Lastly, Chapter 5 introduces the latest molecular techniques in capturing and enriching highly fragmented aDNA bone from four sites across Australia. Ancient DNA extractions techniques, targeting ultra-short DNA fragments, were employed in an attempt to obtain Pleistocene-aged material. The warm conditions, a factor common in Australian caves, are not conductive to long-term DNA preservation at many sites. Shotgun sequencing was only successful on six bone samples (including one incisor) from a total of 25 samples that were screened. Three samples were successfully captured and enriched for endogenous DNA; one bettong sample generated 89. 6...|$|R
40|$|Sessile {{invertebrates}} {{are important}} for their contributions to community assemblages {{in terms of their}} competitive and trophic interactions. Colonial invertebrates make excellent model organisms for the study of ecological processes. Bryozoans, modular colonial filter feeders, are important competitors in a range of habitats and represent a potentially significant source of diversity. Little work has been done to catalog the Bryozoa of Mo’orea, French Polynesia. By examining coral rubble, artificial substrates and Turbinaria <b>spp.</b> algal fronds, <b>I</b> quantified the distribution of bryozoans in a shallow lagoon and simultaneously recorded their competitive interactions. I also quantified patterns of bryozoan richness and abundance with respect to depth and location. Finally, I conducted an experiment to determine the degree to which predation effects an abundant genus, Rhynchozoon <b>spp.</b> <b>I</b> found more bryozoans further from the barrier reef and in deeper water. There were vastly more cheilostomates than either cyclostomates or ctenostomates, though it remains unclear whether they are competitively dominant. A few genera dominated the epibiotic algal habitat, showing abundance patterns opposite those seen on coral rubble. I did not find any successional patterns on algae. I did not find a significant effect of predation on uncaged Rhynchozoon spp. colonies in the field. This study suggests that abiotic factors may be more important than trophic and competitive interactions in determining bryozoan abundance, but their relative influences remain unclear. This work lays the foundation for future ecological work on factors limiting bryozoans in French Polynesia and provides a guide to the genera found in this study...|$|R
