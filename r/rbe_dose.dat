40|$|Relative {{biological}} effectiveness (RBE) {{plays an}} important role in designing a uniform dose response for ion beam therapy. In this study the biological effectiveness of a carbon ion beam delivery system was investigated using Monte Carlo simulation. A carbon ion beam delivery line was designed for the Korea Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator (KHIMA) project. The GEANT 4 simulation tool kit was used to simulate carbon beam transporting into media. An incident energy carbon ion beam in the range between 220 MeV/u and 290 MeV/u was chosen to generate secondary particles. The microdosimetric-kinetic (MK) model is applied to describe the RBE of 10 % survival in human salivary gland (HSG) cells. The <b>RBE</b> weighted <b>dose</b> was estimated as a function of the penetrating depth of the water phantom along the incident beam direction. A biologically photon-equivalent Spread Out Bragg Peak (SOBP) was designed using the <b>RBE</b> weighted absorbed <b>dose.</b> Finally, the <b>RBE</b> of mixed beams was predicted as a function of the water phantom depth...|$|R
40|$|In two {{fast neutron}} data sets, {{comprising}} in vitro and in vivo experiments, {{an inverse relationship}} is found between the low-linear energy transfer (LET) α/β ratio and the maximum value of relative biological effect (RBE(max)), while the minimum relative biological effect (RBE(min)) is linearly related to the square root of the low-LET α/β ratio. RBE(max) is the RBE at near zero dose and can be represented by {{the ratio of the}} α parameters at high- and low-LET radiation exposures. RBE(min) is the RBE at very high dose and can be represented by the ratio of the square roots of the β parameters at high- and low-LET radiation exposures. In principle, {{it may be possible to}} use the low-LET α/β ratio to predict RBE(max) and RBE(min,) providing that other LET-related parameters, which reflect intercept and slopes of these relationships, are used. These two limits of RBE determine the intermediate values of <b>RBE</b> at any <b>dose</b> per fraction; therefore, it is possible to find the <b>RBE</b> at any <b>dose</b> per fraction. Although these results are obtained from fast neutron experiments, there are implications for charged particle therapy using protons (when RBE is scaled downwards) and for heavier ion beams (where the magnitude of RBE is similar to that for fast neutrons). In the case of fast neutrons, late reacting normal tissue systems and very slow growing tumours, which have the smallest values of the low-LET α/β ratio, are predicted to have the highest RBE values at low fractional doses, but the lowest values of <b>RBE</b> at higher <b>doses</b> when they are compared with early reacting tissues and fast growing tumour systems that have the largest low-LET α/β ratios...|$|R

The paper by Hoel and Li (Health Physics 75 : 241 - 50) shows how the linear-quadratic model has basic non-linearities at the low dose region for the leukemias including CML. Pierce et. al., (Radiation Research 123 : 275 - 84) have developed distributions for the uncertainty in the estimated exposures of the A-bomb cohort. Kellerer, et. al., (Radiation and Environmental Biophysics 36 : 73 - 83) has further considered possible errors in the estimated neutron values and with changing <b>RBE</b> values with <b>dose</b> and has hypothesized that the tumor response due to gamma may not be linear. We have incorporated his neutron model and have constricted new A-bomb doses based on his model adjustments.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{considers}} why the {{proton therapy}} relative biological effect (RBE) should be variable rather than constant. Methods: The reasons for a variable proton RBE are enumerated, with {{qualitative and quantitative}} arguments. The heterogenous data sets collated by Pagenetti et al and the more homogenous data of Britten et al are further analysed using linear regression fitting and RBE-inclusive adaptations of the linear quadratic (LQ) radiation model. Results: The in vitro data show <b>RBE</b> increasing as <b>dose</b> per fraction is lowered. In the Paganetti et al (2002) data sets, the differences between observed and expected effects are smaller when the linear quadratic model is used, but with such data heterogeneity firm statistical conclusions cannot be obtained. The more homogeneous data set shows an unequivocal variation in <b>RBE</b> with <b>dose</b> per faction. The in vivo data are inappropriate for assessments of late normal tissue effects in radiotherapy. Also, if there is {{the same degree of}} uncertainty in an RBE of 1. 1 or in an RBE of 2 - 3 for C ions, the fractional and biological effective doses (BED) can vary considerably and be greater in the proton case. So, errors in RBE assignment are important for protons, just as with C ions. Conclusions: Further experimental programmes are proposed, including late normal tissue endpoints. Better RBE allocations might further improve proton therapy outcomes. Advances in Knowledge: This study provides a rigorous critique of the 1. 1 RBE used for protons, from theoretical and practical standpoints. The data analysis shows that the linear quadratic model is more appropriate than simple linear regression. Comprehensive research programmes are suggested...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A novel {{treatment}} planning technique using proton {{pencil beam}} scanning (PBS) is proposed that {{takes advantage of}} the increased Linear Energy Transfer (LET) at the distal edge of proton beams to deposit the increased biological effective dose related to the elevated LET protons within prostate tumors. Background: The availability of proton treatment for cancer has increased the latest decade and will continue to increase rapidly in the coming decade. The Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) of protons earlier considered to be 1. 10 has started to be questioned in the latest decade. This thesis investigates what would be the effect of a variable RBE on the effective dose to the target. Method: Uniform dose distributions were planned using two different beam arrangements: (1) Full-Target Plans (FTP), with two lateral fields, each field targeting the entire target; (2) Patched Integrated Edge (PIE) plans, with 2, 4, and 7 fields, each field targeting only the respective proximal segment of the target. Dose distributions were calculated and optimized with Eclipse in order to deliver the same dose to the target as well as to maintain the same OARs dose constrains for all the plans. Beam properties (range, modulation, spot map and weights) were used to calculate dose and dose averaged LET distributions with Monte Carlo. The RBE for each plan was calculated using radiobiological models taking into account the dose and LETd distribution as well as published values of  for the irradiated tissues as input parameters. The <b>RBE</b> weighted <b>dose</b> (DRBE) was calculated for each planning approach and evaluated with respect to three different aims. Results: An increase of the number of fields using PIE increased the LETd within the target. The increased LETd resulted in an increase of the <b>RBE</b> weighted <b>dose,</b> DRBE, of up to 12. 7 Gy (RBE) to the target, which is a 14 % increase. However, if the same DRBE is to be delivered to the target with FTP and PIE the increase of LETd in the target implied a decrease of dose per fraction, d, of up to 0. 21 Gy, a decrease of 13 %. Conclusions: A modified distribution of proton’s linear energy transfer in PBS allows to deposit highly effective biological dose by the elevated-LET protons within the target, which might help to increase the effectiveness of prostate radiotherapy. This might also serve as a platform to investigate how the physical prescribed dose can be reduced by increasing the LETd in the target in order to maintain a constant DRBE in the prostate. ...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{treatment}} {{planning for}} intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) usually disregards {{variations of the}} relative biological effectiveness (RBE). To investigate the potential clinical relevance of a variable RBE for beam scanning techniques, new strategies {{for the evaluation of}} radiobiological effects and for the incorporation of the RBE into the inverse planning process are presented. These strategies are based on a fast algorithm for three-dimensional calculations of the dose averaged linear energy transfer (LET) as a measure of the local radiation quality, and on a simple phenomenological approach for the RBE as a function of dose, LET and tissue type. It was found that the biological effect depended strongly on the type of scanning technique used, mainly due to differences in the LET distributions. New objective functions that account for LET and RBE were integrated into an inverse planning software, which now allows simultaneous multi-field optimization of the biological effect in a reasonable time. With these methods, unfavourable RBE effects can be identified and compensated for by direct optimization of the product of <b>RBE</b> and <b>dose,</b> which is demonstrated for several clinical examples. The proposed strategies are therefore valuable tools to evaluate and improve the quality of treatment plans in IMPT...|$|R

Dose and fluence computation algorithms using the Monte Carlo (MC) technique have served for decades as reference tools for accurate dose computations for radiotherapy. In this work, a novel MC-based treatment-planning (MCTP) tool for ion beam therapy using the pencil beam scanning technique is presented.

40|$|Radiations {{encountered}} in space include protons and heavy ions such as iron {{as well as}} their secondaries. The relative biological effect (RBE) of these ions is not known, particularly at the doses and dose-rates expected for planetary missions. Neutrons, are not particularly relevant to space travel, but have been found experimentally to have an increase in their <b>RBE</b> with decreasing <b>dose.</b> If a similar trend of increasing <b>RBE</b> with decreasing <b>dose</b> is present for heavy ions and protons during irradiation in space, the small doses received during space travel could potentially have substantial carcinogenic risk. Clearly more investigation of the effects of heavy ions and protons is needed before accurate risk assessment for prolonged travel in space can be done. One means to mitigate the increased risk of cancer due to radiation exposure in space is by developing effective countermeasures that can reduce the incidence of tumor development. Tamoxifen has recently been shown to be an effective chemopreventive agent in both animal models and humans for the prevention of mammary tumors. Tamoxifen is a unique drug, with a highly specific mechanism of action affecting a specific radiation-sensitive population of epithelial cells in the mammary gland. In human studies, the annual incidence of a primary tumor in the contralateral breast of women with previous breast cancer is about 8 per 1000, making them an exceedingly high-risk group for the development of breast cancer. In this high risk group, treated with tamoxifen, daily, for 2 years, the incidence of a new primary tumor in the contralateral breast was approximately one third of that noted in the non-tamoxifen treatment group. Tamoxifen antagonizes the action of estrogen by competing for the nuclear receptor complex thereby altering the association of the receptor complex and nuclear binding sites. Its effects in reducing the development of breast cancer could be accomplished by controlling clinically undetectable microcancers, arresting preneoplastic lesions, or correcting abnormal environments which predispose to high risk of malignant transformation...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiation}} effects induced by Co 60 {{serve as a}} reference system for the consideration of LET and RBE in normal and tumor tissue dose-effect relations are usually handled by the linear-quadratic model (LQ). This approximation excellently works up to the shoulder domain. In particle therapy we have strictly differ between RBE in the initial plateau and environment of the Bragg peak. Thus for protons LET and RBE of the initial plateau agree with Co 60, whereas in the Bragg peak domain both properties are increased,, but RBE of SOBP only varies between 1. 1 and 1. 17. The RBE of carbon ions is increased once again Their dose-effect curves are much steeper with a rather small shoulder domain due to dense ionizing radiation effect. Thus protons are also dense ionizing in the Bragg peak region, but with rather smaller magnitude compared to carbon ions. A generalization of the LQ-model based on the nonlinear reaction-diffusion model is proposed to describe LET and RBE of dense ionizing particles, which accounts for properties of micro- and nano-dosimetry. A linear term of a reaction diffusion formula describes the destroy of cells, the nonlinear term is related to repair and the diffusion term accounts for {{the density of the}} radiation damages. Based on dose-effect properties of Co 60 the parameters of dense ionizing particles can be determined and compared with measurement data.

Additionally, a refinement of the radial dose distribution seems to be appropriate. Radial Dose Distribution In the original dose distribution of the LEM, the radical diffusion was taken into account by using a minimal radius of 10 nm below which the dose is constant. However, recent experiments suggest that the diffusion length is shorter. Therefore, we modified the physical dose distribution by reducing the minimal radius to 0. 3 nm according to experimental data for the dose distribution [2] and convolving the physical dose distribution D(r) with a Gaussian distribution of width σ= 4 nm to account for radical diffusion [5...|$|R

The validity of the linear extrapolation then rests on the demonstration that a single electron transit through a cell nucleus can cause inactivation or mutation or can lead to cancer induction. The extrapolation made is a huge one, of some three orders of magnitude, from thousands of electrons traversing a cell to a single cell traversal, and with only qualitative and rhetorical foundation (one track-two tracks), and ignoring the statistical fluctuations of track intersections with targets. Existing data obtained with beams of electrons, protons, X ray photons, incorporated tritium, and 125 I demonstrate that hundreds of electrons may traverse a cell for inactivation and millions may be required for cancer induction. If linear extrapolation were valid these numbers would be reduced to one. These contradictions suggest serious reconsideration of accepted radiation protection standards...|$|R

This fact is really amazing because the use of the high LET particles, neutrons and heavy ions was strongly motivated by radiobiological arguments. Presently, the use of protons with a better physical dose distribution is more widely accepted than neutrons or heavy ions where the expected high LET benefit could not be verified clinically. This demonstrates that predictions {{made on the basis of}} radiobiological experiments cannot be transferred directly from in vitro experiments to the therapy situation.

Current systems are for interstitial radiosurgery and for intravascular insertion for irradiation to prevent re-stenosis. Typical generating voltages are low, in the 20 to 40 kV range. It is well established that the biological effectiveness of such low-energy photons is large compared with higher-energy gamma rays, because of the dominance of photoelectric absorption at low energies. We have used microdosimetric analyses to estimate RBEs for such devices, both at low doses and clinically relevant doses, relative to radiations from 60 Co, 192 Ir, 125 I and 90 Sr= 90 Y. The RBEs at clinically relevant doses and dose rates for these low-energy x-ray sources are considerably above unity, both relative to 60 Co and to 192 Ir photons, and also relative to 125 I and 90 Sr= 90 Y brachytherapy sources.

The range of (alpha/beta) (x) values reported for prostate tumors (1. 2 - 5. 0 Gy), brain tumors (10 - 15 Gy) and liver tumors (13 - 17 Gy) imply that the proton RBE for these tissues could vary significantly compared to the commonly used generic value of 1. 1. Our aim is to evaluate the impact of this uncertainty on the proton dose in Gy(RBE) absorbed in normal and tumor tissues. This evaluation was performed for standard and hypofractionated regimens. RBE-weighted total dose (RWTD) distributions for 15 patients (five prostate tumors, five brain tumors and five liver tumors) were calculated using an in-house developed RBE model as a function of dose, dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) and (alpha/beta) (x). Variations of the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the gross tumor volume (GTV) and the organs at risk due to changes of (alpha/beta) (x) and fractionation regimen were calculated and the RWTD received by 10 % and 90 % of the organ volume reported. The goodness of the plan, bearing the uncertainties, was then evaluated compared to the delivered plan, which considers a constant RBE of 1. 1. For standard fractionated regimens, the prostate tumors, liver tumors and all critical structures in the brain showed typically larger RBE values than 1. 1. However, in hypofractionated regimens lower values of RBE than 1. 1 were observed in most cases. Based on DVH analysis we found that the RBE variations were clinically significant in particular for the prostate GTV and the critical structures in the brain. Despite the uncertainties in the biological input parameters when estimating RBE values, the results show that the use of a variable <b>RBE</b> with <b>dose,</b> LETd and (alpha/beta) (x) could help to further optimize the target dose in proton treatment planning.

The ERD distribution virtually represents the biological effect of the treatment regardless of radiation modality or fractionation scheme. We applied the ERD formulation to simplistic model treatments and to a preclinical survey for hypofractionation based on an actual prostate-cancer treatment of carbon-ion radiotherapy. The proposed formulation was demonstrated to be practical and to offer theoretical implications. In the prostate-cancer case, the ERD distribution was very similar to the RBE-weighted-dose distribution of the actual treatment in 12 fractions. With hypofractionation, while the RBE-weighted-dose distribution varied significantly, the ERD distribution was nearly invariant, implying that the carbon-ion radiotherapy would be insensitive to fractionation.

These two energies, which are available by multilayer monochromatization of the synchrotron output spectrum, exhibit equal attenuation within living cells. Such an isoattenuating energy pair allows the direct examination of how biological effectiveness varies with the energy of the ultrasoft X-rays. In comparing survival results, we find similar biological effectiveness of these two energies for both the C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 and the V 79 cells. These results are no consis-tent with previous findings of increasing RBE with decreasing ultrasoft X-ray energies. In addition, after correcting for mean nuclear dose based on measurements of cell thickness obtained with confocal micros...|$|R
40|$|Currently, most {{clinical}} range-modulated proton beams {{are assumed}} to have a fixed overall relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1. 1. However, {{it is well known}} that the RBE increases with depth in the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) and becomes about 10 % higher than mid-SOBP RBE at 2 mm from the distal edge (Paganetti 2003 Technol. Cancer Res. Treat. 2 413 - 26) and can reach values of 1. 3 - 1. 4 in vitro at the distal edge (Robertson et al 1975 Cancer 35 1664 - 77, Courdi et al 1994 Br. J. Radiol. 67 800 - 4). We present a fast method for applying a variable RBE correction with linear energy transfer (LET) dependent tissue-specific parameters based on the alpha(ref) /beta(ref) ratios suitable for implementation in a treatment planning system. The influence of applying this variable RBE correction on a clinical multiple beam proton dose plan is presented here. The treatment plan is evaluated by <b>RBE</b> weighted <b>dose</b> volume histograms (DVHs) and the calculation of tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) values. The variable RBE correction yields DVHs for the clinical target volumes (CTVs), a primary advanced hypopharynx cancer and subclinical disease in the lymph nodes, that are slightly higher than those achieved by multiplying the absorbed <b>dose</b> with <b>RBE</b> = 1. 1. Although, more importantly, the RBE weighted DVH for an organ at risk, the spinal cord is considerably increased for the variable RBE. As the spinal cord in this particular case is located 8 mm behind the planning target volume (PTV) and hence receives only low total doses, the NTCP values are zero in spite of the significant increase in the RBE weighted DVHs for the variable RBE. However, high NTCP values for the non-target normal tissue were obtained when applying the variable RBE correction. As RBE variations tend to be smaller for in vivo systems, this study-based on in vitro data since human tissue RBE values are scarce and have large uncertainties-can be interpreted as showing the upper limits of the possible effects of utilizing a variable RBE correction. In conclusion, the results obtained here still indicate a significant difference in introducing a variable RBE compared to applying a generic RBE of 1. 1, suggesting it is worth considering such a correction in clinical proton therapy planning, especially when risk organs are located immediately behind the target volume...|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} algorithm of {{a modern}} treatment planning system for ion-beam radiotherapy should ideally {{be able to deal}} with different ion species (e. g. protons and carbon ions), to provide relative biological effectiveness (RBE) evaluations and to describe different beam lines. In this work we propose a new approach for ion irradiation outcomes computations, the beamlet superposition (BS) model, which satisfies these requirements. This model applies and extends the concepts of previous fluence-weighted pencil-beam algorithms to quantities of radiobiological interest other than dose, i. e. RBE- and LET-related quantities. It describes an ion beam through a beam-line specific, weighted superposition of universal beamlets. The universal physical and radiobiological irradiation effect of the beamlets on a representative set of water-like tissues is evaluated once, coupling the per-track information derived from FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations with the radiobiological effectiveness provided by the microdosimetric kinetic model and the local effect model. Thanks to an extension of the superposition concept, the beamlet irradiation action superposition is applicable for the evaluation of <b>dose,</b> <b>RBE</b> and LET distributions. The weight function for the beamlets superposition is derived from the beam phase space density at the patient entrance. A general beam model commissioning procedure is proposed, which has successfully been tested on the CNAO beam line. The BS model provides the evaluation of different irradiation quantities for different ions, the adaptability permitted by weight functions and the evaluation speed of analitical approaches. Benchmarking plans in simple geometries and clinical plans are shown to demonstrate the model capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{increasing}} use of {{proton therapy}} (PBT), several systematic literature reviews show limited gains in clinical outcomes, with publications mostly devoted to recent technical developments. The lack of randomised control studies has also hampered progress in the acceptance of PBT by many oncologists and policy makers. There remain two important uncertainties associated with PBT, namely: (1) accuracy and reproducibility of Bragg peak position (BPP); and (2) imprecise knowledge of the relative biological effect (RBE) for different tissues and tumours, and at different doses. Incorrect BPP will change dose, linear energy transfer (LET) and RBE, with risks of reduced tumour control and enhanced toxicity. These interrelationships are discussed qualitatively {{with respect to the}} ICRU target volume definitions. The internationally accepted proton RBE of 1. 1 was based on assays and dose ranges unlikely to reveal the complete range of RBE in the human body. RBE values are not known for human (or animal) brain, spine, kidney, liver, intestine, etc. A simple efficiency model for estimating proton RBE values is described, based on data of Belli et al. and other authors, which allows linear increases in α and β with LET, with a gradient estimated using a saturation model from the low LET α and β radiosensitivity parameter input values, and decreasing <b>RBE</b> with increasing <b>dose.</b> To improve outcomes, 3 -D dose-LET-RBE and bio-effectiveness maps are required. Validation experiments are indicated in relevant tissues. Randomised clinical studies that test the invariant 1. 1 RBE allocation against higher values in late reacting tissues, and lower tumour RBE values in the case of radiosensitive tumours, are also indicated...|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo {{investigate}} the clinical {{implications of a}} variable relative biological effectiveness (<b>RBE)</b> on proton <b>dose</b> fractionation. Using acute exposures, the current clinical adoption of a generic, constant cell killing RBE {{has been shown to}} underestimate the effect of the sharp increase in linear energy transfer (LET) in the distal regions of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). However, experimental data for the impact of dose fractionation in such scenarios are still limited. Methods and MaterialsHuman fibroblasts (AG 01522) at 4 key depth positions on a clinical SOBP of maximum energy 219. 65  MeV were subjected to various fractionation regimens with an interfraction period of 24  hours at Proton Therapy Center in Prague, Czech Republic. Cell killing RBE variations were measured using standard clonogenic assays and were further validated using Monte Carlo simulations and parameterized using a linear quadratic formalism. ResultsSignificant variations in the cell killing RBE for fractionated exposures along the proton dose profile were observed. RBE increased sharply toward the distal position, corresponding to a reduction in cell sparing effectiveness of fractionated proton exposures at higher LET. The effect was more pronounced at smaller doses per fraction. Experimental survival fractions were adequately predicted using a linear quadratic formalism assuming full repair between fractions. Data were also used to validate a parameterized variable RBE model based on linear α parameter response with LET that showed considerable deviations from clinically predicted isoeffective fractionation regimens. ConclusionsThe RBE-weighted absorbed dose calculated using the clinically adopted generic RBE of 1. 1 significantly underestimates the biological effective <b>dose</b> from variable <b>RBE,</b> particularly in fractionation regimens with low doses per fraction. Coupled with an increase in effective range in fractionated exposures, our study provides an RBE dataset that can be used by the modeling community for the optimization of fractionated proton therapy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Ovarian {{cancer is}} often {{diagnosed}} at an advanced stage with dissemination in the peritoneal cavity. Most patients achieve clinical remission after surgery and chemotherapy, but approximately 70 % eventually experience recurrence, {{usually in the}} peritoneal cavity. To prevent recurrence, intraperitoneal (i. p.) targeted a therapy has been proposed as an adjuvant treatment for minimal residual disease after successful primary treatment. In the present study, we calculated absorbed and relative biological effect (<b>RBE)</b> -weighted (equivalent) <b>doses</b> in relevant normal tissues and estimated the effective dose associated with i. p. administration of At- 211 -MX 35 F(ab') (2). Methods and Materials: Patients in clinical remission after salvage chemotherapy for peritoneal recurrence of ovarian cancer underwent i. p. infusion of (211) AtMX 35 F(ab') (2). Potassium perchlorate was given to block unwanted accumulation of At- 211 in thyroid and other NIS-containing tissues. Mean absorbed doses to normal tissues were calculated from clinical data, including blood and i. p. fluid samples, urine, gamma-camera images, and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography images. Extrapolation of preclinical biodistribution data combined with clinical blood activity data allowed us to estimate absorbed doses in additional tissues. The equivalent dose was calculated using an RBE of 5 and the effective dose using the recommended weight factor of 20. All doses were normalized to the initial activity concentration of the infused therapy solution. Results: The urinary bladder, thyroid, and kidneys (1. 9, 1. 8, and 1. 7 mGy per MBq/L) received the 3 highest estimated absorbed doses. When the tissue- weighting factors were applied, the largest contributors to the effective dose were the lungs, stomach, and urinary bladder. Using 100 MBq/L, organ equivalent doses were less than 10 % of the estimated tolerance dose. Conclusion: Intraperitoneal At- 211 -MX 35 F(ab') 2 treatment is potentially a well-tolerated therapy for locally confined microscopic ovarian cancer. Absorbed doses to normal organs are low, but because the effective dose potentially corresponds to a risk of treatment-induced carcinogenesis, optimization may still be valuable.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{no human}} {{epidemiology}} data available {{to estimate the}} heavy ion cancer risks experienced by astronauts in space. Studies of tumor induction in mice are a necessary step to estimate risks to astronauts. Previous experimental data can be better utilized to model dose response for heavy ion tumorigenesis and plan future low dose studies. DOSE RESPONSE MODELS: The Harderian Gland data of Alpen et al. [1 - 3] was re-analyzed [4] using non-linear least square regression. The data set measured the induction of Harderian gland tumors in mice by high-energy protons, helium, neon, iron, niobium and lanthanum with LET s ranging from 0. 4 to 950 keV/micron. We were able to strengthen the individual ion models by combining data for all ions into a model that relates both radiation dose and LET for the ion to tumor prevalence. We compared models based on Targeted Effects (TE) to one motivated by Non-targeted Effects (NTE) that included a bystander term that increased tumor induction at low doses non-linearly. When comparing fitted models to the experimental data, we considered the adjusted R 2, the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) to test for Goodness of fit. In the adjusted R 2 test, the model with the highest R 2 values provides a better fit to the available data. In the AIC and BIC tests, the model with the smaller values of the summary value provides the better fit. The non-linear NTE models fit the combined data better than the TE models that are linear at low doses. We evaluated {{the differences in the}} relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and found the NTE model provides a higher <b>RBE</b> at low <b>dose</b> compared to the TE model. POWER ANALYSIS: The final NTE model estimates were used to simulate example data to consider the design of new experiments to detect NTE at low dose for validation. Power and sample sizes were calculated for a variety of radiation qualities including some not considered in the Harderian Gland data set and with different background tumor incidences. We considered different experimental designs with varying number of doses and varying low doses dependant on the LET of the radiation. The optimal design to detect a NTE for an individual ion had 4 doses equally spaced below a maximal dose where bending due to cell sterilization was < 2 %. For example at 100 keV/micron we would irradiate at 0. 03 Gy, 0. 065 Gy, 0. 13 Gy, and 0. 26 Gy and require 850 mice including a control dose for a sensitivity to detect NTE with 80 % power. Sample sizes could be improved by combining ions similar to the methods used with the Harderian Gland data...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy with ions, {{also known}} as {{particle}} therapy, is increasing rapidly. Shifting from photons to protons and carbons {{is not only a}} great technological transition, but also a shift in physics and in radiobiology. To adapt from the higher biological effectiveness of particles compared to photons, the concept of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is used. Protons are slightly more effective than photons, and the RBE is set to be constant 1. 1. The constant RBE value is not a physical property of the beam, it is simply assigned to be 1. 1 by a consensus in the scientific community. Experiments indicate that the RBE in reality is marginally increasing along with the treatment depth. For carbon ions the variations in RBE are significantly higher and typically range between 1 and 3. The variation is taken into account in treatment planning, however, relatively large uncertainties are present in the radiobiological models applied. Many of these models are based on correlations between the calculated linear energy transfer (LET) and experimentally measured RBE. Most phenomenological models are based on the dose averaged LET. However, it should also be possible to correlate the biological effect to the full dose weighted LET spectrum, $d(L) $. By using a biological weighting function (BWF), it is possible to estimate the <b>RBE</b> from either <b>dose</b> average LET or dose weighted LET spectrum. In this work, several proton and carbon ion beams were simulated with the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The physical absorbed dose and the LET spectrum were estimated at different depths in a water phantom. A BWF was created upon existing cell experiments databases and applied to quantify the effect of the averaging. The biological effective dose (BED) was then estimated on either the average or the full LET spectrum. The difference between the calculated BED of the two methods are under 2 % for protons, as long as the BWF is close to linear in the relevant LET range. If the BWF is non-linear in the low LET region, the two estimates differ up to 17 %, specially in the distal part of the spread out Bragg Peak (SOBP) and the in the distal dose falloff. However, for carbon ions, the dose estimates are significantly different. In particular, this is observed along the SOBP, where the BED estimated by the spectrum method is approximately 15 % under the BED of the average method. The results show that calculating the RBE by the averaging the dose weighted LET spectrum has little impact on the estimated BED from protons, as long as a linear approximation of the LET-RBE relation is chosen. The two estimates differs considerably for carbon ions, due to the peak in relevant LET region of the BWF. This difference should not be neglected, ergo it is not recommended to average the LET spectrum in radiobiological models used for carbon ion therapy. The implementation of the LET spectrum method could also be adapted to other radiobiological models based upon average LET...|$|R
40|$|Around the world, {{the use of}} protons as an {{alternative}} to photons radiation therapy of cancer is becoming more widespread. The motivations for this is that protons enable a reduction of the radiation dose to health tissue or increase the dose to the tumor when compared to photons. However, there is currently an uncertainty related to the biological effectiveness of protons. Protons are known to be slightly more efficient in cell inactivation then photons, and this can be taken into account by applying a scaling factor for the proton dose. The scaling factor is known as the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and in current clinical practice a constant RBE factor of 1. 1 is applied. However, several studies including data from cell irradiation experiments suggest that a variable RBE factor is more appropriate. The primary objective of this project was to calculate and compare the dose-to-patient results of constant RBE versus variable RBE calculated by different models for protons. The calculations were done by a combination of FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and post-processing using custom scrips written in Python. CT images and treatment plan information for a medulloblastoma patient was imported into FLUKA, where the dose and linear energy transfer (LET) was calculated. The RBE values were subsequently calculated for four different models, assuming constant tissue parameters. An in-depth investigation of the different model properties was performed by systematically varying the model parameters. RBE calculations with a simple treatment plan on a water phantom were also performed. The models consistently predicted an equal or lower dose in the beam-entrance region compared to predictions for RBE = 1. 1 (RBE 1. 1) while greatly exceeding the predicted <b>RBE</b> 1. 1 <b>dose</b> in the distal part of the PTV and in the distal dose-falloff. There was also a considerable increase in dose distributed in the lateral direction for the PTV. The dose volume histograms (DVHs) revealed that structures/OARs located in close proximity to the PTV receive considerably higher levels of dose than predicted by RBE 1. 1 due to a high RBE factor, at times double that of the constant RBE. The RBE models also show a strong dependence on dose. The models appear to be largely in agreement, and the mean RBE varies about 1. 4 % in the PTV. However, the mean RBE variation increases at lower doses, such as in the esophagus with 6. 3 % variation. For a prescribed dose of 23. 4 Gy to the PTV, the mean dose to the PTV varied between 24. 9 and 25. 7 for the different models, while for the lungs and esophagus the mean dose varied between 3. 79 - 4. 03 and 10. 2 - 11. 5, respectively. The results show that while the models do have differences, they consistently deviate from the <b>dose</b> predicted using <b>RBE</b> of 1. 1. For the investigated patient case RBE values from 1. 1 to 1. 4 were seen for the target volume, while similar and higher RBE values were also observed for several healthy tissues, and this could be of clinical relevance. This leads to the conclusion that implementing a variable RBE into clinical scenarios should be considered. At least, practitioners should use the results provided by MC as guidance for assessing the dose until more experimental data and accurate models becomes available...|$|R
