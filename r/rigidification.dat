5000|$|A {{solution}} containing ammonium thioglycolate contains {{a lot of}} free ammonia, which swells hair, rendering it permeable. The thioglycolic acid in the perm solution reduces the disulfide cystine bonds in the cortex of the hair. [...] In a sense, the thioglycolate removes crosslinks. After washing, the hair is treated with a mild solution of hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes the cysteines back to cystine. These new chemical bonds impart the structural rigidity necessary for a successful perm. The <b>rigidification</b> process is akin to the vulcanization of rubber, where commonly polysulfide linkages are used to crosslink the polymer chains. However, not as many disulfide bonds are reformed as there were before the permanent. As a result, the hair is weaker than before the permanent was applied and repeated applications over the same spot may eventually cause strand breakage.|$|E

Western and Northern blotting demonstrated that, after cells had undergone irreversible photoinhibition, the precursor to D 1 protein in PSII was synthesized but not processed properly.

Such structures are omnipresent in natural biomaterials from cells to tissues, {{as well as}} in man-made materials from polymeric composites to paper and textiles. Here, we demonstrate that fibrous networks of the blood clotting protein fibrin undergo a strong and irreversible increase in their mechanical rigidity in response to compression. This <b>rigidification</b> can be precisely predetermined from the level of applied compressive strain, providing a means to program the network rigidity without having to change its composition. To identify the mechanism underlying this programmable <b>rigidification,</b> we measure single fiber-fiber interactions using optical tweezers. We further develop a minimal computational model of adhesive fiber networks that shows that load-induced bond formation can explain the adaptation of the fibrin networks to compressive loading. The model predicts that the network stiffness after compressive programming obeys a universal power-law dependence on the prestress built in by new bond formation, which we confirm experimentally. The generality of this functional stiffening mechanism together with our ability to quantitatively predict it provides a new powerful approach to program the stiffness of fibrous materials and dynamically adapt them to different loading conditions...|$|E

Expansin protein abundance and endogenous expansin activity were not considerably reduced after pollination.

Treatment of young cut flowers with aminoethoxyvinylglycine prevented the appearance of petal-inrolling and delayed the rise in membrane microviscosity until day 9 after cutting. When freshly cut flowers or aminoethoxyvinylglycine-treated flowers were exposed to exogenous ethylene (1 microliter per liter), the microviscosity of microsomal membranes rose sharply within 24 hours, and inrolling of petals was clearly evident.

The results of Badzioch and Bergner showed that an interesting feature of this formalism is the following <b>rigidification</b> property.
