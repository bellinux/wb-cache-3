5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> first-person shooter genre.

5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> concepts of space and time.|$|E

5|$|Since its {{introduction}} to the United States, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire has been credited with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it. The series <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> {{look and feel of}} game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the highest-rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history, and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s.|$|E

5|$|As {{kerosene}} {{and gasoline}} grew in importance, Rockefeller's wealth soared {{and he became}} the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak. Oil was used throughout {{the country as a}} light source until the introduction of electricity and as a fuel after the invention of the automobile. Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry, which transported his oil around the country. Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States. Rockefeller <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> petroleum industry, and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, defined the structure of modern philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> game, {{though not}} always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related {{the story of how}} he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman {{had turned out to be}} Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E

5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a missing {{documentary}} film crew who had gone to the Amazon to film cannibal tribes. A rescue mission, led by the New York University anthropologist Harold Monroe, recovers the film crew's lost cans of film, which an American television station wishes to broadcast. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions, and after learning their fate, he objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. The presentation of the crew's lost footage, functioning similarly to a flashback, <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> found footage style of narrative filmmaking, later popularized by such films as The Blair Witch Project.|$|E
5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> sport with the {{formation}} of the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E

5|$|Game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto considers Space Invaders to be {{the game}} that <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. John Romero and John Carmack cited Space Invaders as their introduction to video games. Several publications ascribed {{the expansion of the}} video game industry from a novelty into a global industry {{to the success of the}} game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} in 1803–15 known as the Napoleonic Wars, various European powers formed five coalitions against the First French Empire. Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution (1789), these further <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> formation, organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militarization, mainly due to mass conscription. Under the leadership of Napoleon, French power rose quickly as the Grande Armée conquered most of Europe, and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–14 campaigns, resulting in {{the restoration of the}} Bourbon monarchy in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the Hundred Days, his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication and banishment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Jean Beliveau's number 4 was {{retired in}} 1971 {{after he left}} the game as the all-time leading scorer in Stanley Cup playoff history. Beliveau was offered, but declined, the {{position}} of Governor General of Canada in 1994; he is the only hockey player known to have been asked to serve in this capacity. Guy Lafleur's number 10 followed in February 1985 after his first retirement. Lafleur was a six-time All-Star with the Canadiens, and won three scoring titles and two most valuable player awards. Also in 1985, Doug Harvey's number 2 was raised to the rafters. The defenceman won six Norris Trophies as the NHL's top defenceman in seven years between 1955 and 1961. Jacques Plante's number 1 was retired on October 17, 1995. Plante <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> way goaltenders played the game, and he leads the Canadiens with 314career wins.|$|E

5|$|Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz {{beginning}} in 1873 described {{how to avoid}} weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent's position. The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> game. Steinitz {{was the first to}} break a position down into its components. Before Steinitz, players brought their queen out early, did not completely develop their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan. In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} development {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became {{a major part of}} the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status. These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format {{instead of the}} more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and <b>revolutionized</b> <b>the</b> genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E
