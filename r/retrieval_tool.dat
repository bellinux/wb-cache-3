40|$|In this study, the {{relevance}} amount of documents {{has been investigated}} by using google cross-language <b>retrieval</b> <b>tools</b> about a agriculture subject area in cross-language retrieval form, are retrieved. For this purpose, by using Persian journals articles that have had English abstracts, Persian phrases and subject terms with their English equivalent were extracted. In three class us, thirty number of phrases and subject terms of agriculture area were extracted: First class, subject phrases that only in agriculture are used; Secondary, agriculture subject terms that in other fields are used too; Third class, agriculture subject terms that out of this field are considered as public term. Then by these phrases and terms, documents were searched, and relevance amount of search results are investigated. Results of study showed that google cross-language <b>retrieval</b> <b>tools</b> for two classes of phrases and terms, in cross-language retrieval of relevance document about agriculture subject area, aren`t succeed: one class, agriculture subject terms that in other fields are used too. other class, agriculture subject terms that out of agriculture field are considered as public term.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, the {{information}} representation and retrieval sector {{in the area of}} Documentation and Biblioteconomy has had to assume the important repercussions of the Internet and its associated technologies, and in particular, the World Wide Web (WWW). Technological modifications arising from these important changes are leading to the gradual digitalisation of the information representation and retrieval sector, affecting information artefacts, representation and <b>retrieval</b> <b>tools</b> and user requirements. In the light of this growing context of digitalisation, diverse information representation and <b>retrieval</b> <b>tools</b> exist, which must be studied in addition to diverse fields of knowledge in which these tools have originated: Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence, Documentation, Linguistic Engineering [...] . Hence, in specialised literature, analyses are performed on information representation and <b>retrieval</b> <b>tools,</b> taxonomies, classification systems, computational lexicons, lexical databases, thesauruses, titles lists, knowledge bases, conceptual maps, ontologies, synonym rings and semantic networks, among others. Among this wide spectrum of information representation and <b>retrieval</b> <b>tools</b> are thesauruses and ontologies, which are most often linked in bibliography, even though they come from completely different disciplinary areas. However, the conceptualisation applied by authors to the terms "thesaurus" and "ontology" is quite diverse, and sometimes authors confuse, oppose, complement or overlap both these concepts. The overall objective of the present article [1] is to establish the relationship between the concepts of thesaurus and ontology in the Documentation and Biblioteconomy field. Two specific objectives have been established for this purpose. Firstly, to make an analysis of the thesaurus-based concept with a view to defining its most important characteristics and to verify the similarities and differences it shares with ontologies. And secondly, to establish a definition for the ontology concept, also for the purpose of verifying its characteristics and analysing the similarities and differences it has with thesauruses...|$|R

40|$|Annotation and <b>retrieval</b> <b>tools</b> for {{multimedia}} {{digital libraries}} {{have to cope}} with the complexity of multimedia content. In particular, when dealing with video content, annotation and <b>retrieval</b> <b>tools</b> have to use appropriate knowledge structures that can effectively relate high level concepts to low and mid level visual features and, at the same time, integrate temporal information which is crucial when defining an abstract model for video. In this paper we present a multimedia ontologies that include both linguistic and visual ontology. Moreover provided that appropriate low level descriptors are used to detect simple events, subjects or objects, we propose usage of Semantic Web Rule Language in order to provide a formal definition of complex events based on temporal relations between simple entities. Results for complex event inferencing are shown for the news broadcast domain. 1...|$|R
