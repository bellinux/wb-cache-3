25|$|Whether or not qualia or {{consciousness}} {{can play}} any causal {{role in the}} physical world <b>remains</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>question,</b> with epiphenomenalism acknowledging the existence of qualia while denying it any causal power. The position has been criticized by a number of philosophers, if only because our own consciousness seem to be causally active. In order to avoid epiphenomenalism, one who believes that qualia are nonphysical would need to embrace something like interactionist dualism; or perhaps emergentism, the claim that there are as yet unknown causal relations between the mental and physical. This in turn would imply that qualia can be detected by an external agency through their causal powers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Classifying fractals under bi-Lipschitz {{mappings}} in fractal geom-etry just {{as important}} as classifying topology spaces under homeomorphisms in topology. This paper concerns the Lipschitz equivalence of totally discon-nected self-similar sets in Rd satisfying the OSC and with commensurable ratios. We obtain the complete Lipschitz invariants for such self-similar sets. The key invariant we found is an ideal related to the IFS. This discovery estab-lishes a one-to-one correspondence between the Lipschitz equivalence classes of self-similar sets and the ideal classes in a related ring. Accordingly, two self-similar sets A and B with the same dimension and ratio root are Lipschitz equivalent if and only if their ideals IA and IB are equivalent, i. e., aIA = bIB for some elements a and b in the related ring R. This result reveals an inter-esting relationship between the Lipschitz class number problem and the Gauss class number one problem for real quadratic fields, which was proposed by Gauss in 1801 but still <b>remains</b> <b>a</b> <b>open</b> <b>question</b> today.

Similarly, demand for further research on possible connections of individual and collective intelligence exists within plenty of other potentially transferable logics of individual intelligence, such as, for instance, the development over time or the question of improving intelligence. Whereas it is controversial whether human intelligence can be enhanced via training, a group's collective intelligence potentially offers simpler opportunities for improvement by exchanging team members or implementing structures and technologies.

25|$|From {{publication}} {{until about}} 1700, few astronomers were convinced by the Copernican system, though {{the book was}} relatively widely circulated (around 500 copies {{of the first and}} second editions have survived, which is a large number by the scientific standards of the time). Few of Copernicus' contemporaries were ready to concede that the Earth actually moved, although Erasmus Reinhold used Copernicus' parameters to produce the Prutenic Tables. However, these tables translated Copernicus' mathematical methods back into a geocentric system, rejecting heliocentric cosmology on physical and theological grounds. The Prutenic tables came to be preferred by Prussian and German astronomers. The degree of improved accuracy of these tables <b>remains</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>question,</b> but their usage of Copernican ideas led to more serious consideration of a heliocentric model.

25|$|The second-oldest {{published}} {{account is}} {{known by the}} opening words of its long title: Huei tlamahuiçoltica ("The great event"). It was published in Nahuatl by the then vicar of the hermitage at Guadalupe, Luis Lasso de la Vega, in 1649. In four places in the introduction, he announced his authorship of {{all or part of}} the text, a claim long received with varying degrees of incredulity because of the text's consummate grasp of a form of classical Nahuatl dating from the mid-16th century, the command of which Lasso de la Vega neither before nor after left any sign. The complete work comprises several elements including a brief biography of Juan Diego and, most famously, a highly wrought and ceremonious account of the apparitions known from its opening words as the Nican Mopohua ("Here it is told"). Despite the variations in style and content which mark the various elements, an exclusively textual analysis by three American investigators published in 1998 provisionally (a) assigned the entire work to the same author or authors, (b) saw no good reason to strip de la Vega of the authorship role he had claimed, and (c) of the three possible explanations for the close link between Sánchez's work and the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, opted for a dependence of the latter upon the former which, however, was said to be indicated rather than proved. Whether the role to be attributed to Lasso de la Vega was creative, editorial or redactional <b>remains</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>question.</b> Nevertheless, the broad consensus among Mexican historians (both ecclesiastical and secular) has long been, and remains, that the Nican Mopohua dates from as early as the mid-16th century and (so far as it is attributed to any author) that the likeliest hypothesis as to authorship is that Antonio Valeriano wrote it, or at least had a hand in it.The Nican Mopohua was not reprinted or translated in full into Spanish until 1929, although an incomplete translation had been published in 1895 and Becerra Tanco's 1675 account (see next entry) has close affinities with it.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{historian}} Matthew Gordon, Ibn Tulun's relations with, and quest for autonomy from, the Abbasids is a [...] "central problem of Tulunid history". Modern scholars see in Ibn Tulun's policies a [...] "careful balancing act" [...] and {{notice that he}} never fully severed himself from the Caliphate, remaining conspicuously loyal to the person of al-Mu'tamid, who, after all, was a powerless figurehead. Nevertheless, the move towards increasing autonomy is evident throughout his reign. His relations with the Abbasid government were dominated by his conflict with al-Muwaffaq, resulting from the latter's attempts to establish control over Egypt—whose wealth was direly needed during the costly war against the Zanj—and prevent the further rise of Ibn Tulun. In a certain sense, writes Matthew Gordon, many of Ibn Tulun's measures [...] "were as much {{the means by which}} imperial interests were protected against the ambitions of al-Muwaffaq and his (largely Turkish) military coterie in Iraq as they were efforts to secure Tulunid authority". Given that Ibn Tulun at least twice (in 871 and 875/6) remitted huge sums to the caliphal treasury, it <b>remains</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>question</b> whether without the conflict with al-Muwaffaq, this would have been a more regular occurrence.|$|E
