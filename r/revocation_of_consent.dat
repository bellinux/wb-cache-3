5000|$|Once {{consent to}} search is given, an {{individual}} may withdraw consent with an “unequivocal act or statement of withdrawal.” Consent may be withdrawn by statements, actions, {{or a combination}} of statements and actions. In United States v. Bily, a federal district court found that Bily's statement to the agents of “That’s enough, I want you to stop,” was a <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent.</b> [...] And in United States v. Al Doc Ho, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that Ho's attempts to retrieve his portfolio from the officer during a search constituted a revocation of his earlier consent to search. In this decision the court recognized his acts constituted a valid <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent.</b>|$|E
5000|$|However, the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> must {{clearly be}} a {{statement}} revoking consent: {{an expression of}} impatience or dislike {{is not sufficient to}} terminate consent. [...] For example, in United States v. Gray, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that Gray did not revoke consent with the statements “this is ridiculous,” and “how long is the search going to take.” The district court found that while Gray and his passenger had made “protests to leave,” “there was no specific request to leave, and under the circumstance,... officer was reasonable in continuing the search.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Though {{similar in}} principle, consent and {{acquiescence}} are distinguishable temporally: [...] "The consent defense involves the petitioner's conduct {{prior to the}} contested removal or retention, while acquiescence addresses whether the petitioner subsequently agreed to or accepted the removal or retention." [...] When the defense of consent is raised, the trial court must examine [...] "the nature and scope of petitioner's consent and any conditions or limitations". Where a party exceeds the scope of any prior consent given, that consent will be deemed revoked upon express communication of the objecting party's <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent,</b> and may {{give rise to a}} claim for wrongful retention. Analysis of an [...] "acquiescence" [...] defense is more focused, and requires proof of [...] "an act or statement with the requisite formality" [...] or [...] "a consistent attitude of acquiescence over a significant period of time." ...|$|E
40|$|Requiring data {{subjects}} to authorise organisations, {{from which they}} request some services, to use their personal data in order for these services be provided has become common practice. This, partly because {{in order to provide}} a service to the right individual, an organization needs to know who that individual is. But also, because personal data are an asset that organisations have an interest in keeping. In this context, individuals are in situations where they are constrained to give away their personal data without being capable of stopping these data to be used for operations that are not necessary profitable to them. In this paper, we discuss the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>consent</b> to use or access personal data. We study the technical challenges that need to be overcome in order to allow {{data subjects}} to revoke their consent as well as the requirements that should be fulfilled to provide such a revocation...|$|R

5000|$|In Case E-5/15, Matja Kumba, the {{national}} court asked, firstly, whether an average weekly working time of 84 hours (7-7 rotation) in a cohabitant care arrangement constitutes {{a breach of}} Article 6 of the Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC); secondly, whether a national provision, under which an employee’s consent to working more than 60 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement cannot be revoked, {{is compatible with the}} rights that employees have under the Directive; and thirdly, whether a dismissal following a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment” within the meaning of the Directive. With regard to the first question, the Court noted that it is for {{the national}} court to assess the amount of working time in the case at hand, taking into account the factors clarified by the Court. Working time amounting to an average of 84 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement is compatible with Article 6 of the Directive, in circumstances governed by Article 22(1)(a), provided that the worker has explicitly, freely and individually agreed to perform such work, and the general principles of the protection of the safety and health of the worker are observed. With regard to the second question, the Court noted that the Directive does not contain a provision concerning <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent.</b> It is for national law to determine whether such <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> is possible. However, a complete inability to revoke consent, even in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, may prove incompatible with the Directive, since the possibility for a worker to consent to exceeding the maximum weekly working time is expressly conditional on the EEA State respecting the general principles of the protection of {{the health and safety of}} workers, cf. Article 22(1)(a) of the Directive. With regard to the third question, the Court noted that, typically, a dismissal due to a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment”. However, a notice of dismissal and offer of re-engagement on new terms, following a refusal by a worker to agree to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period, is not to be considered a “detriment” if the termination of the employment is based upon reasons that are fully independent of the worker’s refusal to agree to perform such additional work.|$|E

40|$|Some {{countries}} such as Australia, Spain, Norway, Italy and Canada allow next of kin to override the consent of registered organ donor candidates if they personally do not concur with the donation desire of their relative. This form of surrogate decision-making represents a double standard {{in terms of the}} principle of substituted judgment (the surrogate 2 ̆ 7 s duty). Further, double-standard surrogate decision-making in the setting of organ donation is a slippery slope to unethical surrogate decision-making while patients are alive. Concerns about family distress and donor candidate <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> can still be managed without permitting double-standard surrogate decision-making...|$|E
50|$|The {{provision}} {{allowing for}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> naturalisation {{as a consequence}} of residence abroad has been criticised as creating two classes of Liberian citizens and for reducing the capabilities of naturalised Liberians to pursue employment and educational opportunities abroad.

40|$|Excerpt] The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) {{provides}} {{federal funding}} {{for the education of}} children with disabilities and requires, as a condition for the receipt of such funds, the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE). The statute also contains detailed due process provisions to ensure the provision of FAPE. On December 1, 2008, the Department of Education (ED) issued a final regulation to “clarify and strengthen current regulations” promulgated under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The areas covered by the regulation include (1) parental <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> after consenting to the initial provision of services; (2) a state’s or local educational agency’s (LEA’s) obligation to make positive efforts to employ qualified individuals with disabilities; (3) representation of parents by non-attorneys in due process hearings; (4) state monitoring, technical assistance, and enforcement of the Part B program; and (5) the allocation of funds, under Sections 611 and 619 of the act, to LEAs that are not serving any children with disabilities. The regulations take effect on December 31, 2008. This report will briefly discuss the issues raised by these changes...|$|E

40|$|Credential-based {{authorization}} offers interesting {{advantages for}} ubiquitous scenarios involving limited {{devices such as}} sensors and personal mobile equipment: the verification can be done locally; it offers a more reduced computational cost than its  competitors for issuing, storing, and verification; and it naturally supports rights delegation. The main drawback is the revocation of rights. Revocation requires handling potentially large revocation lists, or using protocols to check the revocation status, bringing extra communication costs not acceptable for sensors and other limited devices. Moreover, the effective revocation consent—considered as a privacy rule in sensitive scenarios—has not been fully addressed. This paper proposes an event-based mechanism empowering a new concept, the sleepyhead credentials, which allows to substitute time constraints and explicit revocation by activating and deactivating authorization rights according to events. Our approach is to integrate this concept in IdM systems in a hybrid model supporting delegation, which can be an interesting alternative for scenarios where <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> and user privacy are critical. The delegation includes a SAML compliant protocol, which we have validated through a proof-of-concept implementation. This article also explains the mathematical model describing the event-based model and offers estimations of the overhead introduced by the system. The paper focus on health care scenarios, where we show {{the flexibility of the}} proposed event-based user consent revocation mechanism...|$|E
