This descriptive-correlational study determined the level of classroom climate dimensions among teacher education students specializing in Mathematics at Mindoro State College of Agriculture and Technology. Employing a self-structured questionnaire adapted to the WIHIC (What Is Happening In this Class) questionnaire, the surveyed data were treated statistically using Pearson’s r.

Also, it revealed that equity and teacher support were both positively related to the students-directed classroom climate dimensions.

Moreover, faculty should provide greater opportunitiesfor the students to achieve higher level of <b>responsibility,</b> involvement, cohesiveness, <b>and</b> <b>task</b> orientation as these could motivate them to develop positive learning attitude, perform to the best of their ability, as well as maximize their full potential in school...|$|R
