60|$|Even {{if there}} had been on board the Adamant the means for <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> another {{arrangement}} of the kind for perpendicular artillery practice, it would have required {{a long time to get}} it into working order, and the director of Repeller No. 7 hoped that now the British captain would see the uselessness of continued resistance.|$|E

60|$|Having little {{confidence}} in this {{promise of a}} mere boy, the goat grumbled and the King laughed; but Inga paid no heed to their ridicule and set himself to work <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> a fishing rod, with line and hook.

6000|$|The {{evening was}} {{exceptionally}} fine and calm; and we expected on the morrow (February 11th) a quiet return to El-Muwaylah.

I know she could never stand the exposure, and canvas don't keep out the rain well; so I thought of <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> a large box, into which she can creep.

60|$|Watching the <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> of {{the barbed}} wire, Jerry's next {{adventure}} was {{an encounter with}} Lerumie, the return boy from Meringe, who, only that morning, on the beach embarking, had been rolled by Biddy, along with his possessions into the surf. The encounter occurred on the starboard side of the skylight, alongside of which Lerumie was standing as he gazed into a cheap trade-mirror and combed his kinky hair with a hand-carved comb of wood.|$|E
6000|$|I stopped, for I did {{not know}} what was coming, and saw the galley door slide shut with a bang. Then I saw Henderson leaping like a madman for the main <b>rigging,</b> <b>up</b> which he shot, on the inside, till he was many feet higher than my head. Also I saw a great wave, curling and foaming, poised far above the rail. I was {{directly}} under it. My mind did not work quickly, everything was so new and strange. I grasped that I was in danger, but that was all. I stood still, in trepidation. Then Wolf Larsen shouted from the poop: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{whole place}} was a scene of activity. Stephen stood {{on the edge of}} the cliff with the old whaler and the chief boatman and some of the women. The rest of the coastguards were by orders of their chief <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> a whip which they thought might be {{necessary}} to hoist the men up from the water, if they could ever get close enough. One of the young men who had ridden with the rocket-cart kept tight hold of Hector's bridle; he knew it would be wanted if the horse ever had a chance of landing.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't be {{too sure}} of that," [...] said her father. [...] "But no matter. The two friends started out on Monday morning after breakfast for Thompsontown. Considerable delay was occasioned at the livery-stable by certain pieces of advice which Sam Twitty offered to Captain Abner. In the first place, he objected {{to a good}} black horse which had been {{attached}} to the wagon, giving it as his opinion that that looked too much like a funeral, and that a cheerful-colored horse {{would be much better}} adapted to a matrimonial expedition. A gray horse, slower than the black one, was substituted, and Sam was quite satisfied. Then a great many things in the way of provisions and conveniences came into his mind which he thought would be well to take on the voyage, and he even insisted upon <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> an extension {{at the back of the}} wagon on which her trunk could be carried on the home journey.|$|E
60|$|Bedlam reigned. All the {{recruits}} below, bushmen and {{afraid of the}} sea, dashed panic-stricken on deck and got in everybody's way. At {{the same time the}} boat's crew made a rush for the rifles. They knew what going ashore on Malaita meant--one hand for the ship and the other hand to fight off the natives. What they held on with I don't know, and they needed to hold on as the Minota lifted, rolled, and pounded on the coral. The bushmen clung in the rigging, too witless to watch out for the topmast. The whale-boat was run out with a tow-line endeavouring in a puny way to prevent the Minota from being flung farther in toward the reef, while Captain Jansen and the mate, the latter pallid and weak with fever, were resurrecting a scrap- anchor from out the ballast and <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> a stock for it. Mr. Caulfeild, with his mission boys, arrived in his whale-boat to help.|$|E
60|$|Those {{who try to}} be artists use, {{time after}} time, the matter of their recollections, setting and {{resetting}} little coloured memories of men and scenes, <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> (it may be) some especial friend in the attire of a buccaneer, and decreeing armies to manoeuvre, or murder to be done, on the playground of their youth. But the memories are a fairy gift which cannot be worn out in using. After a dozen services in various tales, the little sun-bright pictures of the past still shine in the mind's eye with not a lineament defaced, not a tint impaired. Glück und unglück wird gesang, if Goethe pleases; yet only by endless avatars, the original re-embodying after each. So that a writer, in time, begins to wonder at the perdurable life of these impressions; begins, perhaps, to fancy that he wrongs them when he weaves them in with fiction; and looking back on them with ever-growing kindness, puts them at last, substantive jewels, in a setting of their own.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think about it. I have no idea what effect {{dynamite}} would have when exploded at a distance of thirty or forty feet below a bridge. Certainly it would blow the roadway up, but I have very great doubts whether it would so twist or smash the main girders as to render the bridge impassable. The distance to the first pier is not great, and unless one entirely destroyed the bridge, I should say that it could be repaired very soon--I mean, in a week or two--by a strong gang. If the girders kept their places, two or three days' work might patch it up temporarily. If it were destroyed altogether as far as the first pier, it would stop the cannon getting over till a temporary bridge is constructed; but by <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> some strong cables, they could pass cases of musket ammunition across the gap in the same way, you know, as I have seen pictures of shipwrecked people being swung along under a cable in a sort of cradle. What do you think, Peters?" ...|$|E
60|$|Our passage out was a {{very long}} one, lasting two hundred and ten days. When {{we got into the}} trades, we {{stripped}} one mast after the other, to a girt-line, overhauling everything, and actually getting new gangs of <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> over the lower-mast-heads. We were a long time about it, but lost little or nothing in distance, as the ship was going before the wind the whole time, with everything packed on the masts that were rigged. Before overhauling the rigging, we fell in with an English ship, called the General Blucher, and kept company with her for quite a fortnight. While the two ships were together, we were chased by a strange brig, that kept in sight three or four days, evidently watching us, and both vessels suspected him of being a pirate. As we had six guns, and thirty-one souls, and the Blucher was, at least, as strong, the two captains thought, by standing by each other, they might beat the fellow off, should he attack us. The brig frequently came near enough to {{get a good look at}} us, and then dropped astern. He continued this game several days, until he suddenly hauled his wind, and left us. Our ship would have been a famous prize; having, it was said, no less than two hundred and fifty thousand Spanish dollars on board.|$|E
60|$|WELL, all day him and {{the king}} was hard at it, <b>rigging</b> <b>up</b> a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn't hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, {{and said it was}} the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main {{principal}} part in it; and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and- striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.|$|E
