50|$|As of December 2012, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration {{does not}} {{typically}} require testing of personal lubricants in humans. The agency classifies them as medical devices, so testing occurs on {{animals such as}} rabbits and guinea pigs. Rectal use of lubricants is viewed by the agency as an off-label application. In 2012 {{it was reported that}} participants who consistently used personal lubricants for <b>rectal</b> <b>intercourse</b> had a higher prevalence of STIs, such as chlamydia, than inconsistent users. Some warming lubricants have been shown to have an osmolality count more than 30 times the body's own fluid. Increased herpes transmission was more than ninefold when compared with animals not administered lubricant. In 2007 it was demonstrated that certain lubricants can cause significant damage to the rectal tissue of human study participants - major shedding of cells from tissue samples biopsied 60 to 90 minutes after lubricant application was observed. Certain lubricants containing the ingredient chlorhexidine, an antibacterial agent, has been shown to kill three species of Lactobacillus and has been shown to unbalance the natural flora in the vagina, which might lead to infections such as bacterial vaginosis. Lubricants with osmolalities closer to that of the body, such as agar-based lubes, did not damage the tissue samples or boost HIV infection rates.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{clinical}} observation that {{there appeared to}} be an association between shigellosis and male homosexuality, the medical records of 113 patients at The New York Hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 38 males studied who were between the ages 19 and 61, seventeen were homosexual (44 - 7 per cent.). Only one of the matched controls was homosexual. Of the men with shigellosis who had a history of foreign travel, 10 per cent. were homosexual; however, among the patients without a travel history, 57 - 1 per cent. were homosexual (P less than 0 - 05). For male patients with shigellosis who do not have an appropriate travel history, the physician should expand his epidemiological investigation to include sexual contacts. Men and women who perform <b>rectal</b> <b>intercourse</b> should be cautioned to abstain from this activity until their stool cultures are negative for shigella. If a male patient with shigellosis is homosexual, he should be screened for other sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B, and amoebiasis...|$|E
40|$|Solitary rectal ulcer (SRU) {{is a rare}} dis-ease in children, the {{pathogenesis}} of which is not well understood(l, 2). We report a child with this condition. Case Report An 11 -year-old girl presented with his-tory of frequent passage of small amounts of bright red blood per rectum without mucus {{since the age of}} 2 years. There was no his-tory of abdominal pain, tenesmus, constipa-tion, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, joint paints, skin rash, hematemesis, <b>rectal</b> prolapse, anal <b>intercourse</b> or insertion of foreign bodies. Physical examination was normal except for findings on rectal exami-nation of ulceration and induration on the anterior rectal wall. Her hemogram, coagu-lation profile, serum chemistry and stool ex-aminations were normal. On colonoscopi...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 17 -year-old male who was {{initially}} assessed for pain with defecation, bloody rectal discharge, and diarrhea, consistent with proctitis. Though proctitis is most commonly due to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infectious etiologies must also be considered, including sexually transmitted causes of infectious proctitis. In discussion of his sexual history, he identified as homosexual and acknowledged engaging in receptive anal <b>intercourse.</b> <b>Rectal</b> biopsies obtained via colonoscopy were culture-positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV), leading to a diagnosis of HSV proctitis and treatment with an appropriate antiviral medication. HSV proctitis is more common in individuals with high-risk sexual practices, including {{men who have sex with}} men. While this may be an uncommon diagnosis for pediatricians to make in practice, a high clinical index of suspicion for sexually transmitted infectious proctitis in those with risk factors must be maintained in order to facilitate appropriate testing, treatment, and counseling of affected individuals...|$|R
