500|$|Based on {{southern}} Europe countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, Karnaca is warmer and sunnier than Dunwall. Reference photos were used {{from a variety}} of places to help design the city, including Cuba, Lyon and Malibu, California. The buildings in Karnaca frequently have flat roofs and more ornate windows. Photography from the 1920s was examined in order to help build a setting with a historical disposition, using reference websites like Shorpy.com and looking at the work of Agustín Casasola. Whereas Dishonored was largely built on the <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> 1837, Dishonored 2 draws ideas from [...] "the architectural forms, popular fashions, and far-out technologies" [...] of 1851. Arkane tried to take architectural concerns into account, and considered the effect the wind would have on the way the city developed, with energy being generated by wind turbines. Level designers and level architects collaborated throughout the entire production as locations were built. In making Karnaca, a style of Art Nouveau was applied.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters.

500|$|Writer Sangita Gopal {{analysed}} the [...] "intensification of {{the aesthetic}} effects of Hindi cinema" [...] in the narrative scheme of the film. During the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a [...] "thundering background score" [...] coupled with [...] "360° panning shots" [...] were used to build up melodrama. She added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as Mohabbatein of 2000), they gradually shifted [...] "to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family". Mazur mentioned the use of [...] "dream sequences" [...] in the film {{as a means of}} escapism. He referred to the song [...] "Suraj Hua Maddham" [...] as an extradiegetic sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate [...] "in ways that they could not in the <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> the film." [...] He added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme close-ups on their eyes.|$|E

500|$|Persona 4 blends {{traditional}} RPG gameplay with simulation elements. The player {{controls the}} game's protagonist, {{a teenage boy}} who is named by the player, who comes {{to the town of}} Inaba for a year. Gameplay is divided between the <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> Inaba, where the protagonist carries out his daily life, and the mysterious [...] "TV World", where various dungeons filled with monsters known as Shadows await. With the exception of scripted events, such as plot progression or special events, players can choose to spend their day how they like, be it participating in various real world activities, such as joining school clubs, taking part-time jobs, or reading books, or exploring the TV World's dungeons to gain experience and items. Days are broken up into various times of day, the most frequently recurring being [...] "After School/Daytime" [...] and [...] "Evening", with most activities causing time to move on. Certain activities are limited depending on the time of day, days of the week, and the weather, with most evening activities unavailable if the player visits the TV World that day. Furthermore, some activities and dialogue choices may be limited by the protagonist's five attributes; Understanding, Diligence, Courage, Knowledge, and Expression, which can be increased by performing certain activities that build them. Whilst the player is free to choose how to spend their time, if they fail to rescue someone who is trapped in the TV World by the time fog appears in town, which takes place after several days of consecutive rain, that person will get killed by the shadows and the game will end, forcing the player to return to a week prior. As the game progresses, the protagonist forms friendships with other characters known as [...] "Social Links", which are each represented by one of the Major Arcana. As these bonds strengthen, the Social Links increase in Rank, which grant bonuses when creating new Personas in the Velvet Room. Additionally, strengthening Social Links with the main party members grant them additional abilities, such as the ability to perform a follow-up attack or an additional ability for their Persona.|$|E
