5|$|In late August 1917, the <b>rotary</b> <b>engine</b> F.I {{prototype}} {{was assigned}} to Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with his cousins in Krefeld; the decorations on the kites gave him the inspiration to paint the nose cowling of his triplane with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted German Chancellor Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a <b>rotary</b> <b>engine.</b> The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
25|$|The Triplane was {{initially}} {{powered by the}} 110hp Clerget 9Z nine-cylinder <b>rotary</b> <b>engine,</b> but most production examples were fitted with the 130hp Clerget 9B rotary. At least one Triplane was tested with a 110 hp Le Rhône <b>rotary</b> <b>engine,</b> but this did not provide a significant improvement in performance.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>rotary</b> {{combustion}} <b>engine</b> {{has been}} suggested as an alternative name for these engines to distinguish them from early (generally up to the early 1920s) aircraft engines and motorcycle engines also known as <b>rotary</b> <b>engines.</b> However, both continue to be called <b>rotary</b> <b>engines</b> and only the context determines which type is meant.|$|R

25|$|Some HJ series Premier based {{vehicles}} were assembled by Mazda in Japan, which fitted with the company's <b>rotary</b> <b>engine.</b> The car, manufactured between 1975 and 1977 sold as the Mazda Roadpacer was quite heavy and the <b>rotary</b> <b>engine</b> {{of the time}} was severely underpowered.

25|$|Emile Berliner, an {{inventor}} {{famous for his}} invention of the flat gramaphone record, had experimented with intermeshing helicopters as early as 1907.

Berliner developed a 36hp five cylinder <b>rotary</b> <b>engine</b> with the Adams-Farwell Company from Dubuque, Iowa, producing the first <b>rotary</b> <b>engine</b> used for aircraft. Berliner later spun off the Gyro Motor Company from this work. A test rig was flown in 1908, followed by two other upgrades before Berliner focused on his other businesses.|$|E
