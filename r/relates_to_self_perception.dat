40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 51 - 54) In {{order to}} investigate the effects of sustained self awareness, 54 student volunteers were assigned at random to these three groups: High Self Awareness, Low Self Awareness, and a no-treatment Control. Participants in the treatment groups met individually with the Experimenter {{three times a week}} for a two week period, and were asked to maintain a personal journal during that two week period. The Low Self Awareness group recorded ways in which they coped in their lives as well as daily activities. All participants were tested before and after the two week period with five measures <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>self</b> <b>perception</b> and well being: Bradburn???s Physical Well Being Inventory, Bradburn???s Affect Balance Scale, Spilberger???s Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Janis-Field Feelings of Inadequacy Scale, and Rotter???s Internal-External (Locus of Control) Scale. Analyses of variance were performed on each of the dependent variables, both pre and post treatment, using a series of 2 x 3 analyses of variance. Results revealed that sustained self awareness had no effect on <b>self</b> <b>perception</b> or well being as measured by the instruments used in this study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how levels of {{satisfaction}} with dating relationship and levels of satisfaction with sexual experiences vary based on demographic variables including age, religiosity, and political beliefs. This study also examined how dating and sexual satisfaction <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> sexual attitudes, <b>self</b> <b>perceptions,</b> and relationship anxiety and avoidance. There were 230 participants; 115 heterosexual couples who completed self-report questionnaires and in person interviews with research assistants. The average age of participants was 21. 6 and 80 % of participants were college students. Results indicated that age was positively correlated with dating satisfaction. Religiosity was negatively correlated with sexual satisfaction and political affiliation had no relation to dating or sexual satisfaction. With regards to sexual attitudes, sexual satisfaction was positively correlated with positive attitudes towards birth control, attitudes connecting intimacy and sexual intercourse, and sexual permissive attitudes. Regarding <b>self</b> <b>perceptions,</b> dating satisfaction was positively correlated with synthesis of one’s sexual identity. Also, for women, self-ratings of physical attractiveness were positively correlated with sexual satisfaction. Dating satisfaction for both genders was negatively correlated with anxiety and avoidance in relationships. Also, for women, sexual satisfaction was negatively correlated with relationship avoidance. Lastly, results indicated that dating satisfaction was positively correlated with sexual satisfaction. These results suggest that a positive self view is important in sexual satisfaction. When females view themselves as more physically attractive and are less avoidant in their relationships, they tend to be more sexually satisfied. Politics played no role in sexual satisfaction, however, religion did, suggesting that the more religious a person is the less sexually satisfied they are. In our study, the older the participant, the more satisfied they were with their dating relationships. This could mean that as people age we find what we want and stick with it. And lastly our study shows that relationship anxiety and avoidance are not conducive for dating satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the fact that research on the integration of soft skills in the English language textbooks is still not much done, especially in senior high school level. This study is aimed to describe the values of soft skills, integration of soft skills in the reading materials of English text book, and presentation techniques of soft skills‟ integration in reading tasks of Bahasa Inggris X for grade X of senior high school. This {{research is}} descriptive-qualitative research which applies a content analysis method. The data source of this research was the textbook Bahasa Inggris X, namely Bahasa Inggris X Semester 1 and Semester 2 that are composed by Utami Widiati, Zuliati Rohmah, and Furaidah under the coordination of Kemendikbud. Data collection was done by using a careful reading and recording of the primary data source. The main form of verbal data was in units of paragraphs about the values of soft skills, integration of soft skills and presentation techniques of soft skills in reading task of Bahasa Inggris X for class X Senior High School. The data analysis was conducted using content analysis method. The validity of data was assessed through semantic validity, and the data reliability through inter-rater and intra-rater techniques. The results show that Bahasa Inggris X contains the values of soft skills, which are grouped into two categories, namely (a) Core Competency one, which is composed of soft skills <b>related</b> <b>to</b> God, and (b) Core Competency two, which consists of soft skills <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>self,</b> others, the environment, and the nation. From the two categories of soft skills, in the Core Competence two there are found as many as 366 times of soft skills, while in the Core Competency one there are 42 times. In terms of soft skills <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>self,</b> as many as 201 times are discovered, and which <b>related</b> <b>to</b> other people as much as 145 times. Frequent soft skills <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>self</b> shows that the authors emphasized on the importance of soft skills development in the aspects of an individual's life, then continued with the social and spiritual life. Soft skills are integrated into the four components of reading task, i. e. goals, input, activities, and settings. The overall integration of soft skills in reading tasks of Bahasa Inggris X is seen more on goals and input. This shows the author sees that the integration of soft skills in the goals and input are more easily and practically done and developed in the teaching- learning process. The presentation technique of soft skills in reading tasks of Bahasa Inggris X is both explicit and implicit. As a whole, 2. 45...|$|R

40|$|Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) {{are part}} of the life course of some {{individuals}} and as such there are significant implications in relation to matters of identity and the need to ensure educational and professional practices are considered from an ethical perspective as <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>self</b> and identity. However, despite the wide ranging literature in the area of autism, there is very little research that examines identity in relation to young people with ASCs. Furthermore, where identity is noted as an important consideration, the concept is often inadequately theorised and explained with reference to psychological frameworks of identity. This study draws on narrative psychology and the concept of narrative identity (McAdams, 2011) to explore what insider perspectives, gained through life story accounts of lived experience, can tell us about processes <b>related</b> <b>to</b> sense-making, <b>self</b> and identity in young people with a diagnosis of a ASC. The findings revealed that the participants were actively engaged in sense-making of their experiences and in the production of narrative identities.

The interaction between extraversion and a disrupted family was also independently <b>related</b> <b>to</b> frequent female offending.
