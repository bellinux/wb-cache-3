They considered spacetime itself {{as part of an}} explicate order that is connected to an implicate order that they called pre-space. The spacetime manifold and the properties of locality and nonlocality all arise from an order in such pre-space. A. M. Frescura and Hiley suggested that an implicate order could be carried by an algebra, with the explicate order being contained in the various representations of this algebra.

Primary afferent signals in most cases are <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>form</b> of spike trains using a combination of rate coding and population coding while there are clear evidences that temporal coding is used in various regions of cortex.

Available statistical methods are, however, complex. Method: A two-stage flexible design is <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>form</b> of a simple chance tree.

The application of the expansion series for these two functions leads to a new asymptotic formula for π. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

This is done by developing a compact formalism with the particular advantage that the stress energy tensor acting on Jordan cells of primary fields and their logarithmic partners can still be <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>form</b> of linear differential operators. Since the existence of singular vectors is subject to much stronger constraints than in regular conformal field theory, they also provide a powerful tool for the classification of logarithmic conformal field theories.

An optimal solution to the original fuzzy optimization problem can be then obtained by solving the resulting crisp mathematical programming program.
