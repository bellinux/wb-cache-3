The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off {{with the help of}} the Cloak of Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to <b>reverse</b> <b>time</b> and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E

Tim jumps and stomps on enemies to defeat them, and can collect keys to unlock doors or operate levers to trigger platforms. A defining game element is the player's unlimited ability to <b>reverse</b> <b>time</b> and [...] "rewind" [...] actions, even after dying. The game is divided into six worlds, which are experienced sequentially and can be entered from different rooms of Tim's house; the player can return to any world previously visited to attempt to solve puzzles they missed.|$|E

[...] Mitchell however hypothesizes {{that the power of}} the Ori energy beam could provide the required energy to reverse the time. This, however, will mean the loss of any memories of the last fifty years; additionally, whoever volunteers will remain at their advanced age. Teal'c, who as a Jaffa has a much longer lifespan than the other team members, volunteers to remain behind and perform the rescue, protected within a separate field. As the group prepares their plan, Vala and Daniel exchange a last embrace, assuring each other of their love. When everything is in place, they deactivate the time dilation field and, after the normal timeline is restored, Teal'c prevents Colonel Carter from activating the time dilation field.

500|$|Braid {{features}} {{licensed music}} from Magnatune artists Cheryl Ann Fulton, Shira Kammen and Jami Sieber. Part of Blow's {{decision to use}} licensed music was to reduce development costs. He also felt that those who regularly compose video game music {{did not have the}} necessary skills needed to create the mood he wanted for the game. He ultimately selected eight tracks that were sufficiently long to avoid notable looping while a player attempted to solve a difficult puzzle, and that provided a [...] "different and interesting" [...] sound when played in reverse to match the <b>reverse</b> <b>time</b> mechanic of the gameplay. Blow also selected tracks that were [...] "organic and complex" [...] as to help set the game's mood and aimed [...] "to present something that isn't necessarily clear-cut". The selection of the music influenced the creation of the background artwork for the game. Both Kammen and Sieber received favorable feedback from listeners {{as a result of their}} works' inclusion in Braid. Magnatune released a soundtrack of the game's music on April 9, 2009, which includes two additional track remixes that incorporate some of the time-shifting elements from the game. The pieces included in Braid are: ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Blow {{had envisioned}} {{the game to}} be broken into several {{different}} worlds as in the final game, each exploring facets of space, time, and causality, but with each world having very different high-level mechanics. One mechanic {{that he could not}} develop further was a world with no [...] "arrow of time" [...] that would have required the player to traverse the level in a manner that could be repeated in reverse. For example, the player would have been forbidden to jump down from a tall height while moving in forward time, as they {{would not be able to}} jump that height in <b>reverse</b> <b>time.</b> While this idea was not used, Blow discovered the rewind feature could be developed further for other aspects. Another game mechanic that Blow considered was to show the player the expected result of an action they would take; while this concept was informative, he did not find it to be an entertaining game mechanic. Blow had previously explored this in a prototype game called [...] "Oracle Billiards", the game predicting each billiards shot before it was made. He had found the billiards setting too chaotic for this idea and this led him to try out similar ideas in a simpler [...] "Mario-style" [...] setting. After selecting the game mechanics he wanted, he began adding puzzles that made philosophical points on his views on game design in general. After brainstorming more puzzles and concepts, Blow dropped the least interesting puzzles and worlds from the game. Blow wanted to include significant consequences of rewinding time, not found in games such as , , and Timeshift in which rewinding time creates few or no changes to the game's world. While these games immerse the player with these time-shifting effects using a first- or third-person perspective, he decided to use a 2D presentation. Blow noted that some of the puzzles in Braid would have been more difficult or impossible to solve in any other perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{argument}} involves energy, the time-component of the momentum. If time reversal {{were implemented}} as a unitary operator, it would reverse {{the sign of}} the energy just as space-reversal reverses {{the sign of the}} momentum. This is not possible, because, unlike momentum, energy is always positive. Since energy in quantum mechanics is defined as the phase factor exp(-iEt) that one gets when one moves forward in time, the way to <b>reverse</b> <b>time</b> while preserving the sign of the energy is to also reverse the sense of [...] "i", so that the sense of phases is reversed.|$|E
