40|$|The Holy See {{has engaged}} {{extensively}} in United Nations negotiations on issues concerning sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health <b>rights</b> {{as they have}} emerged and evolved in a dynamic global agenda {{over the past two}} decades. A meta-narrative review of the mission’s official statements was conducted to examine the positions, discourses and tensions across the broad range of agendas. The Holy See represents a fundamentally conservative and stable position on a range of sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health <b>rights</b> concerns. However, the mission has been dynamic in the ways in which it has forwarded its arguments, increasingly relying upon secularised technical claims and empirical evidence; strategically interpreting human rights norms in ways consistent with its own position; and framing sexuality and reproduction in the context of “the family”. Seen in the broader context of a “religious resurgence” in international relations, and {{in light of the fact}} that the Holy See has frequently sought to form alliances with conservative State and non-State actors, these findings make an important contribution to understanding the slow progress as well as the potential obstacles that lie ahead in the battle to realise sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health <b>rights</b> in a changing global political environment. © 2014 Reproductive Health Matters Keywords: Holy See, United Nations, sexual health, sexual <b>rights,</b> <b>reproductive</b> health, <b>reproductive</b> <b>right...</b>|$|R
5|$|Feminist {{campaigns are}} {{generally}} considered to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, <b>reproductive</b> <b>rights</b> for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's <b>reproductive</b> <b>rights</b> and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) {{began in}} 1966 to seek women's equality, {{including}} through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), {{which did not}} pass, although some states enacted their own. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>rights</b> in the U.S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.|$|E

5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved <b>reproductive</b> <b>rights,</b> gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E
5|$|Three related {{targets of}} MDG5 were {{adolescent}} birth rate, contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning (where prevalence+unmet need = total need), which were {{monitored by the}} Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Contraceptive use was part of Goal 5B (universal access to reproductive health), as Indicator 5.3. The evaluation of MDG5 in 2015 showed that amongst couples usage had increased worldwide from 55% to 64%. {{with one of the}} largest increases in Subsaharan Africa (13 to 28%). The corollary, unmet need, declined slightly worldwide (15 to 12%). In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and <b>reproductive</b> <b>rights,</b> where Indicator 5.6.1 is the proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care (p.31).|$|E
40|$|Faculty advisers: Dr. Gyula Csurgai and Dr. Alexandre LambertIn 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development {{established}} the Cairo Programme of Action to embrace women's empowerment {{as one of}} the fundamental components of development, including the recognition that sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> {{are an important part of}} the development agenda. However, twenty years after the ICPD sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> remain largely neglected in development initiatives. There are vast inconsistencies between knowledge, policy and practice in ensuring sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights,</b> which is primarily due to a lack of understanding of the social and structural contexts that inhibit sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights.</b> There are three broad examples of these contexts that can provide insight into why it is remarkably difficult to ensure sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> in developing countries: cultural and religious factors, political will, and program capacity. Realizing how these contexts impact sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> can help illuminate comprehensive strategies for the international community to consider in the effort to address sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> in the post- 2015 development agenda.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the challenges faced in mainstreaming {{the teaching of}} sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> into public health education. For this paper, we define sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> education as including not only its biomedical aspects but also an understanding of its history, values and politics, grounded in gender politics and social justice, addressing sexuality, and placed within a broader context of health systems and global health. Using a case study approach with an opportunistically selected sample of schools of public health within our regional contexts, we examine the status of sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> education {{and some of the}} drivers and obstacles to the development and delivery of sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> curricula. Despite diverse national and institutional contexts, there are many commonalities. Teaching of sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> is not fully integrated into core curricula. Existing initiatives rely on personal faculty interest or short-term courses, neither of which are truly sustainable or replicable. We call for a multidisciplinary and more comprehensive integration of sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> in public health education. The education of tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s public health leaders is critical, and a strategy is needed to ensure that they understand and are prepared to engage with the range of sexual and <b>reproductive</b> health and <b>rights</b> issues within their historical and political contexts...|$|R
