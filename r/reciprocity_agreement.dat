Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada. While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada–US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence. Gaining the advantage over Britain in the region was a key part of Pierce's expansionist goals.|$|E

Numerous states have entered into <b>reciprocity</b> <b>agreements</b> with other states that exclude non-residents’ income from the tax base.

We demonstrate that not only do <b>reciprocity</b> <b>agreements</b> dampen competition over income taxes, but the states that enact agreements also exhibit decreased levels of competition over other tax bases.

Further, the results suggest that informal sharing agreements are more likely to involve goods that are consumed along with other group benefits, such as conversation and companionship. We conclude by analyzing investments in social capital and discussing the effects of deeper social interactions constrained by norm structures on our results. club; institution; non-market; reciprocal; social capital...|$|R

In 1911, the major issue in Canada was the reciprocity treaty with the United States signed by the Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier and vigorously opposed by the Conservatives under Sir Robert Borden. On 7 September 1911, the Montreal Daily Star newspaper published a front-page appeal to all Canadians against the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>agreement</b> with the United States by Kipling who wrote: [...] "It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration, Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial, legal, financial, social, and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States." [...] At the time, the Montreal Daily Star was Canada's most read newspaper. Over the next week, Kipling's appeal was reprinted in every English newspaper in Canada and is credited with helping to turn Canadian public opinion against the Liberal government that signed the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the economic {{costs and benefits}} of Minnesota's nonresident tuition policies and tuition <b>reciprocity</b> <b>agreements</b> to the state. It also assesses the effects that modifications to these policies and agreements would have on migration patterns and the costs and benefits arising from such modifications. The methods used, such as student price response coefficients, migration rates, and estimates of lifetime tax payments, provide the basis for determining the economic value of <b>reciprocity</b> <b>agreements</b> and nonresident tuition policies to the state of Minnesota. These methods may be useful to other states in assessing migration patterns and nonresident tuition policies. Results of the analysis show that reduced tuition for nonresidents is of great benefit to the state's economy. However, policies that provide incentives for Minnesota residents to leave the state for college are costly to the state. (Contains 11 tables, 3 figures, and 20 references.) (Author...|$|R
2500|$|While the {{economic}} underperformance of the Maritime {{economy has been}} long lasting, it {{has not always been}} present. The mid-19th century, especially the 1850s and 1860s, has long been seen as a [...] "Golden Age" [...] in the Maritimes. Growth was strong, and the region had one of British North America's most extensive manufacturing sectors as well as a large international shipping industry. The question of why the Maritimes fell from being a centre of Canadian manufacturing to being an economic hinterland is thus a central one {{to the study of the}} region's pecuniary difficulties. The period in which the decline occurred had a great many potential culprits. In 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick merged with the Canadas in Confederation, with Prince Edward Island joining them six years later in 1873. Canada was formed only a year after free trade with the United States (in the form of the <b>Reciprocity</b> <b>Agreement)</b> had ended. In the 1870s John A. Macdonald's National Policy was implemented, creating a system of protective tariffs around the new nation. Throughout the period there was also significant technological change both in the production and transportation of goods.|$|E

Other associations support either coed or men-only derby; {{among them is the}} largest organization supporting the growing trend of male roller derby, MRDA. Within the United States, roller derby played by those under 18 is governed by the Junior Roller Derby Association, which uses the widely used rule set of the WFTDA, with modifications for players who are minors (such as no hitting, or accelerating into a block). Outside of the United States many roller derby leagues enjoy support from their national skate federations such as the Skate Australia, the British Roller Sports Federation, and Roller Sports Canada. In Europe, roller derby otherwise received recognition as a legitimate sport by the Federation Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS) in Paris in 2010; this organization reports directly to the International Olympic Committee. As of 2017 FIRS has been accepted as the international rule set by the International Olympic Committee. USA Roller Sports (USARS) is recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) as the National Governing Body of competitive roller sports in the United States, including speed, figure, hockey, roller derby and slalom. Under FIRS rule set, teams will be competing at The World Roller Games 2017 in Nanjing, China.
