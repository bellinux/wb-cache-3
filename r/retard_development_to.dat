40|$|SYNOPSIS. Invasive {{species that}} {{penetrate}} habitat boundaries {{are likely to}} experience strong selection and rapid evolution. This study documents evolutionary shifts in tolerance and performance following the in-vasion of fresh water by the predominantly estuarine and salt marsh copepod Eurytemora affinis. Common-garden experiments were performed on freshwater-invading (Lake Michigan) and ancestral saline (St. Lawr-ence marsh) populations to measure shifts in adult survival (at 0, 5, and 25 PSU), and survival during development and development time (both using full-sib clutches split across 0, 5, 15, and 25 PSU). Results showed clear evidence of heritable shifts in tolerance and performance associated with freshwater invasions. The freshwater population exhibited a gain in low-salinity tolerance {{and a reduction in}} high-salinity toler-ance relative to the saline population, suggesting tradeoffs. These tradeoffs were supported by negative genetic correlations between survival at fresh (0 PSU) versus higher salinities. Mortality in response to salinity occurred primarily before metamorphosis, suggesting that selection in response to salinity had acted primarily on the early life-history stages. The freshwater population exhibited curious patterns of life-history evolution across salinities, relative to the saline population, of <b>retarded</b> <b>development</b> <b>to</b> metamorphosis but accelerated <b>development</b> from metamorphosis <b>to</b> adulthood. This pattern might reflect tradeoffs between development rate and survival in fresh water at the early life-history stages, but some other selective force acting on later life-history stages. Significant effects of clutch (genotype) and clutch-by-salinity interaction (G 3 E) on survival and development time in both populations indicated ample genetic variation as substrate for natural selection. Variation for high-salinity tolerance was present in the freshwater population despite negative genetic correlations between high- and low-salinity tolerance. Results implicate the importance of natural selection and document the evolution of reaction norms during freshwater invasions...|$|R

40|$|WHILE {{numerous}} studies have been made on the relation of temperature {{to changes in the}} hatchability of eggs, knowledge concerning the effects of sealing of eggshell on hatchability are noticeably lacking. This series of experiments was undertaken with the particular object in mind of determining the effect on hatcha-bility of the sealing of eggshells and sub-merging eggs in distilled water previous to incubation. In addition, data were also se-cured on eggs held in air. Romanoff and Romanoff (1933) have presented a complete review of the work of other investigators who submerged eggs in water or sealed eggshells by the use of oil, varnish, or other substances and observed early embryo development. Retardation in development was observed as the area of the eggshell treated was increased.

The osteopetrotic conditions of Mior/Mior mice increased progressively during the first 5 weeks after birth. However, adult Mior/Mior mice 3 months or older showed improvement of the osteopetrotic condition, although the disease was not completely resolved. Ultrastructurally, osteoclasts of Mior/Mior mice had well developed ruffled borders. These {{results show that the}} Mior mutation has milder osteopetrotic changes than the original mi mutation, a surprising observation given that both mutations affect the same functional domain of the mi protein, a basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-Zipper transcription factor.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Tillage {{of forest}} soils {{compacted}} by ground-based logging systems is {{a practice that}} is becoming widely accepted in the Pacific Northwest. However, past research has failed to adequately define the conditions and specifications that particular tillage operations should meet {{in order to produce}} the maximum growth response from planted seedlings. The objective {{of this study is to}} quantify the early growth response of conifer seedlings to altered soil conditions produced by conventional ripping practices. To achieve the stated objective, a field study and a growth chamber study were implemented. A small tractor equipped with two 58 -cm long ripper teeth spaced 140 cm apart performed the tillage on compacted gravelly loam soils in the Cascade Mountains of southwestern Oregon. Conditions for both studies included undisturbed soil, compacted soil in skid trails, and ripped soil in skid trails. Fifty-nine soil cores (15 cm in diameter by 32 cm long) were extracted from each treatment as growth media for the growth chamber study. Preliminary results from the field study shoved no significant differences in height growth or diameter growth of planted 2 - 0 bare root Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Nirb.) Franco) seedlings after two years, even though soil bulk density and strength were significantly different and depth of compaction extended to 40 cm. It is possible that improper handling of seedlings either in the nursery or during planting has <b>retarded</b> <b>development</b> <b>to</b> the point that planting shock is overriding any effects. due to soil treatment. This phase of the study will be continued for another four years, so treatment effects may yet appear. The growth chamber study included observations on Douglas-fir and white fir (Abies concolor) seedlings grown from seed for 226 days. At 148 days, the Douglas-fir seedlings growing in tilled soil showed a 44 percent improvement in height growth compared to seedlings growing in compacted soil. Differences between means were statistically significant at p = 0. 051 level. Differences between means for white fir were statistically significant at p = 0. 074 level. Significant differences in root development were evident for both species at the end of 226 days. Dry root weight found in the top 20 cm of tilled soil for white fir was 61 percent greater than for trees growing in compacted soil. For Douglas-fir, a 42 percent increase was noted. These differences reflect the influence of aggregate strength rather than bulk density since the latter values for soil in the cores were not significantly different as a result of disturbance from sampling and handling. It was postulated that seedlings growing in tilled soil with their more extensive root systems would fare better under Stressed conditions than seedlings growing in compacted soil...|$|R
