25|$|Variable {{renewable}} energy (VRE) is a <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> that is non-dispatchable {{due to its}} fluctuating nature, like wind power and solar power, {{as opposed to a}} controllable <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> such as hydroelectricity, or biomass, or a relatively constant source such as geothermal power or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity.|$|E

25|$|Water is used {{in power}} generation. Hydro{{electricity}} is electricity obtained from hydropower. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.|$|E
25|$|Apart from biomass, which {{accounts}} for about 3.5% of total generation capacity, no other <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> besides hydroelectricity plays a relevant role in the energy mix. However, the potential for wind energy, which is concentrated in the Northeast, is very large. It is about 143 GW, which exceeds current installed capacity and {{is second only to}} Argentina in the LAC region. There are projects for the development of biomass, solar and wind energy.|$|E

25|$|Solar {{photovoltaics}} is {{a sustainable}} energy source. By {{the end of}} 2011, a total of 71.1 GW had been installed, sufficient to generate 85 TWh/year. And by end of 2012, the 100 GW installed capacity milestone was achieved. Solar photovoltaics is now, after hydro and wind power, the third most important <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> in terms of globally installed capacity.

China, followed by Japan and the United States, is the fastest growing market, while Germany remains the world's largest producer, with solar PV providing seven percent of annual domestic electricity consumption. With current technology (as of 2013), photovoltaics recoups the energy needed to manufacture them in 1.5 years in Southern Europe and 2.5 years in Northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{recovery}} from waste is {{the conversion of}} non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel {{through a variety of}} processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy {{recovery from}} waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.|$|E

25|$|Water {{is used in}} {{renewable}} power generation. Hydroelectric power derives {{energy from}} the force of water flowing downhill, driving a turbine connected to a generator. This hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> Significantly, hydroelectric power {{can also be used}} for load following unlike most renewable energy sources which are intermittent. Ultimately, the energy in a hydroelectric powerplant is supplied by the sun. Heat from the sun evaporates water, which condenses as rain in higher altitudes and flows downhill. Pumped-storage hydroelectric plants also exist, which use grid electricity to pump water uphill when demand is low, and use the stored water to produce electricity when demand is high.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{photovoltaics}} {{is growing}} rapidly and worldwide installed capacity reached about 300 gigawatts (GW) {{by the end}} of 2016. Since 2000, installed capacity has seen a growth factor of about 57. The total power output of the world’s PV capacity in a calendar year in 2014 is now beyond 200 TWh of electricity. This represents 1% of worldwide electricity demand. More than 100 countries use solar PV. China, followed by Japan and the United States is now the fastest growing market, while Germany remains the world's largest producer, contributing more than 7% to its national electricity demands. Photovoltaics is now, after hydro and wind power, the third most important <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> in terms of globally installed capacity.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel, today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply. Electricity produced from biomass sources was estimated at 44GW for 2005. Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100% in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. A further 220GW was used for heating (in 2004), bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264GW. The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded. World production of bioethanol increased by 8% in 2005 to reach , with most of the increase in the United States, bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil. Biodiesel increased by 85% to , making it the fastest growing <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> in 2005. Over 50% is produced in Germany.|$|E
