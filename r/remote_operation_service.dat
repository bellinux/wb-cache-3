40|$|ELROS, {{an acronym}} for Embedded Language for <b>Remote</b> <b>Operation</b> <b>Service,</b> was {{developed}} at Lawerence Livermore National Laboratory for programming distributed applications. ELROS statements can be embedded in a conventional language such as C. This {{makes it easier to}} develop distributed applications. ELROS supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations. ELROS also provides a good exception handling facility. Although ELROS provides a good programming interface, it does not provide primitives for collective operations. In this paper we present some of the collective operations that were written using ELROS. We also present programs to demonstrate how these operations can be implemented using sockets. Advantages and disadvantages of using ELROS over sockets are also discussed.

50|$|The CAMEL Application Part (CAP) is a {{signalling}} protocol {{used in the}} Intelligent Network (IN) architecture. CAP is a <b>Remote</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>Service</b> Element (ROSE) user protocol, and as such is layered {{on top of the}} Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) of the SS#7 protocol suite. CAP is based on a subset of the ETSI Core and allows for the implementation of carrier-grade, value added services such as unified messaging, prepaid, fraud control and Freephone in both the GSM voice and GPRS data networks. CAMEL is a means of adding intelligent applications to mobile (rather than fixed) networks. It builds upon established practices in the fixed line telephony business that are generally classed under the heading of (Intelligent Network Application Part) or INAP CS-2 protocol.|$|R

40|$|The key to {{introducing}} CORBA-based object-oriented {{technologies in}} the real-time telecommunications signaling environment {{is to ensure}} interoperability by maintaining the existing, standard protocols using Signaling System No. 7 (SS 7) for the external communication interface between telecommunication equipment. It is anticipated that there will initially be islands of CORBAbased implementations which will have to interwork with the more widely deployed “legacy ” systems. As signaling applications, such as Intelligent Networks (IN), are defined using the concepts and constructs of the <b>Remote</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>Service</b> (ROS), interworking requires that a gateway serve as a “translator ” of operation invocations and their returns between the ROS and CORBA domains. Previous work by the authors had defined the “specifications translations ” for such a gateway, i. e., the algorithmic mapping of various ROS concepts and constructs defined in ASN. 1 to those of CORBA using IDL. In this paper we provide the “interaction specifications ” for such a gateway, namely the dynamic aspects of ROS-to-CORBA mappings. These include extending the CORBA object services to support the ROS concepts of “association contract” and “connection package ” {{as well as the}} mapping for the respective naming schema as well as the message formats in the two domains...|$|R
