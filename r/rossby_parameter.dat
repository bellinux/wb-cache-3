40|$|We {{obtain an}} {{analytic}} representation for {{the profile of}} the surge wave in the sea, due to a tropical storm at a low latitude. The results reproduce the known experimental data adequately. In the calculations we take into account the influence of <b>Rossby's</b> second <b>parameter</b> and we analyse its contribution to the surge wave, which is proved to be sufficiently small to be neglected in higher latitudes. The obtained analytical solution allows us to study in detail the surge wave formation in the presence of such a storm. To solve the problem, Laplace method and Green functions are used. This allows us to improve previous results obtained by Evsa in 1989...|$|R
40|$|Processes {{that cause}} decadal {{variability}} in an intermediate coupled ocean–atmosphere {{model of the}} Pacific basin, both at northern midlatitudes and in the Tropics, are studied. The model’s ocean component is a variable-temperature 3 -layer system. Its atmospheric component consists of two basic parts: an empirical model, con-structed from patterns obtained by the singular value decomposition (SVD) statistical technique that determines wind stress anomalies from model sea surface temperature (SST), and a simple representation of the planetary boundary layer to calculate the surface heat flux anomalies. A third part specifies stochastic wind stress forcing from observed variability. In addition, the model is specifically designed to separate tropical and extratropical interactions, such that the Tropics can force the extratropics through the atmosphere but the extratropics can only feed back to the Tropics through the ocean. Solutions develop two types of oscillations: an ENSO-like interannual mode and a decadal mode. As in many models of ENSO, the interannual mode is driven by positive, ocean–atmosphere feedbacks near the equator, and time-delayed negative feedback is provided by off-equatorial <b>Rossby</b> waves. For <b>parameter</b> choices that amplify midlatitude coupling by 30 % (fo 5 1. 3), a self-sustained decadal oscillation develops in the North Pacific without any tropical interactions. Diagnostic analyses show that it is maintained by ocean-to-atmosphere feedbacks i...|$|R
40|$|A fluid {{dynamics}} {{video of the}} rotating, weakly stratified Boussinesq equations is presented that illustrates the spontaneous formation of columnar vortices {{in the presence of}} stochastic, white noise forcing. 1 Description of the video The rotating, stratified Boussinesq equations are a fundamental model of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. In the limit of rapid rotation (small Rossby Ro number) the classical Taylor-Proudmann theorem indicates that the fluid motion is restricted to columnar structures [1]. This video shows the formation of the vortex columns in one component of the horizontal velocity field. The data is collected from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) from the LANL/Sandia DNS code (see [1] for details regarding the simulation and code) of the rotating, stratified Boussinesq equations with the rotation <b>parameter</b> <b>Rossby</b> number Ro = 0. 05, and stratification parameter Froude number Fr = 1. As explained in [1] the momentum is forced via a stochastic white-noise forcing centered at wave-number 3, and the initial conditions are zero for all dynamic quantities. The computational grid is 2563 in order to resolve the smallest scale which for these simulations is dictated by the Rossby deformation radius (see [2] for a brief discussion). The first part of the movie shows the effects of the stochastic forcing from the zero initial condition. One can recognize large scale structures in the velocity field that are a result of the wave-number 3 dependence of the forcing. Eventually the initial cutoff for the isosurfaces of the velocity field 1 a...|$|R

It is noted that the zonal phase speed of Rossby waves is always westward (traveling east to west) relative to mean flow U, but the zonal group speed of Rossby waves can be eastward or westward depending on wavenumber.|$|E

We interpolate the globall well-posedness results for small initial data in H 1 given by the Fujita-Kato theorem, and the result from [6] which gives global well-posedness if the <b>Rossby</b> <b>parameter</b> is small enough, and for regular initial data (oscillating part in H 1 and H 1 / 2 and quasigeostrophic part in H 1) ...|$|E
40|$|IUE {{data for}} 31 solar-type stars are {{compared}} with observations of T Tauri stars {{in order to}} determine whether the pattern of main sequence chromospheric decay shown by stars older than about 100 million yr extends back to ages of 100 million yr appropriate for T Tauri stars. An analysis of the time decay of stellar ultraviolet and X-ray emission establishes a relationship between emission level and axial rotation, which is expressed in terms of the <b>Rossby</b> <b>parameter.</b> It is shown that the intensity of ultraviolet chromospheric and transition region lines of solar-type stars declines with age. The activity-age relation for main sequence stars older than about 100 million yr is fitted best by an exponential law whose rate of falloff with age depends on temperature...|$|E
