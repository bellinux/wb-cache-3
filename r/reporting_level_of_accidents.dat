40|$|This paper {{examines}} the accident reporting {{procedures in the}} maritime transportation sector. A parallel study, corresponding to this study, revealed {{a vast amount of}} underreporting by several western flag states. This is resulting in a poor situational awareness, making it difficult to implement sufficient measures and derive a wanted safety <b>level.</b> <b>Reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> is globally regulated by IMO and made mandatory by the flag states‟ regulations. The Norwegian flag state, regulating the procedures for all Norwegian flagged vessels and for all vessels in Norwegian waters has been the main focus in this paper. Reporting <b>of</b> an <b>accident</b> can be visualized as a chain of actors which information has to pass through. Underreporting occurs if the links between the actors are broken. The chain starts in one end with the ship‟s crew and master, being the first to detect any accident. The information is then passed on to the ship owner, who in turn forwards a report to the respective flag state. Alternatively, an accident can be detected by Vessel Traffic Services or by Rescue Coordination Centers. Input for this study was gained through interviewing the actors in the reporting chain and through a literature study of the legislation regulating the procedures. Further, a comparative threshold analysis was carried out to measure the differences in the threshold for reporting an incident for the aviation industry in comparison with the maritime industry. The results indicated that the links in the reporting chain is vulnerable to breaches. The Norwegian legislation seems to be somewhat ineffective with respect to actors placed under a mandatory reporting scheme. The Norwegian legislation is not efficient enough to protect the findings from investigation to be used in other contexts than what it is intended for, meaning that investigation reports are misused as evidences in court. The ship owners appear to be little motivated because they receive little relevant feedback. The seafarers also seem to be withholding reports to their ship owners due to their fear of being punished or fired. Compared to the aviation industry, the maritime transportation sector is characterized by a poor safety culture, meaning that the sector shows little interest in sharing and receiving lessons learned by experience. Much can be transferred from the aviation industry or from other flag states, like the United Kingdom. Reporting performance may be increased by improving regulations, motivation and safety culture. </p...|$|R

40|$|Research into {{anxiety and}} driving has {{indicated}} that those higher in anxiety are potentially more dangerous on the roads. However, simulator findings suggest that conclusions are mixed at best. It is possible that anxiety is becoming confused with fear, which has a focus on more clearly defined sources of threat from the environment, {{as opposed to the}} internal, thought-related process associated with anxiety. This research aimed to measure feelings of fear, as well as physiological and attentional reactions to increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> risk. Trait anxiety was also measured to see if it interacted with <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> risk or its associated reactions. Participants watched videos of driving scenarios with varying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> risk and had to rate how much fear they would feel if they were the driver of the car, whilst skin conductance, heart rate, and eye movements were recorded. Analysis of the data suggested that perceptions of fear increased with increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> risk, and skin conductance reflected this pattern. Eye movements, when considered alongside reaction times, indicated different patterns of performance according to different dangerous situations. These effects were independent of trait anxiety, which was only associated with higher rates of disliking driving and use of maladaptive coping mechanisms on questionnaires. It is concluded that these results could provide useful evidence in support for training-based programs; it may also be beneficial to study trait anxiety within a more immersive driving environment and on a larger scale...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe number <b>of</b> road <b>accidents</b> and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> {{severity}} {{have been}} extensively applied as the indicators {{for measuring the}} efficiency of service provision in road network systems of each country. This research utilized accident data on expressway networks during B. E. 2550 (2007) to B.

The chief objective of the study aims to forecast the accident severity through formulating Multiple Logistic Regression Model to analyze the probability <b>of</b> injury <b>accident</b> and fatal accident in comparison with property damage only accident. Its measurement comprehensively considers statistical relationship among variables such as average speed on road section, average traffic volume per day, period of time, weather conditions, physical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> area, and causes <b>of</b> <b>accident.</b> Together, the research question is to verify whether these variables affect the opportunity or probability <b>of</b> three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and investigate impacts <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> loss values due to the reduction in crash severity measures...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that head gesture and mental states can reflect some human {{behaviors}} related to a risk <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> when using machine-tools. The research works {{presented in this paper}} aim {{to reduce the number of}} injury and thus increase worker safety.

Information extracted from SSH is used for computing risk <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>accident</b> (a safety <b>level)</b> for preventing and reducing injury or accidents. The SSH system is an inexpensive, non-intrusive, non-invasive, and non-vision-based system, which consists of 9 DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and dry EEG electrodes. A haptic device, such as vibrotactile motor, is integrated to the helmet in order to alert the operator when computed risk level (fatigue, high stress or error) reach a threshold.

40|$|This study brings {{together}} two perspectives on managers’ <b>reported</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> red tape. The work motivation perspective explains how managers’ characteristics, such as work engagement (alienation) or commitment, affect their <b>reported</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> red tape. The external control perspective explains how managers’ feedback relations with external actors and organizations reduce miscommunications and conflicts between multiple sources of rules, regulations, and procedures. Hypotheses are derived {{about the effects}} <b>of</b> managers’ <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> work engagement, commitment to the organization, and networking activity with external actors and organizations on their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> red tape. The hypotheses are simultaneously tested on a cross-sectional data set of Dutch primary school principals with information about their <b>reported</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> externally generated general red tape (n = 792) and personnel red tape (n = 787). The results of the analyses suggest that work engagement reduces and commitment increases <b>reported</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> red tape. Networking activity with national government is associated with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> general red tape and personnel red tape. Networking activity with local government and interest organizations in the labor relations domain are associated with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> personnel red tape.
