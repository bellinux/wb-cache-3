5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte Grappa with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best <b>ride</b> <b>of</b> the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The {{cyclogenesis}} of Tropical Storm Emily was complicated, extending {{over several}} days from late July into early August. An easterly tropical wave—an equatorward trough of low pressure—exited the west African coast {{in the fourth}} week of July, at which point it became largely embedded within the monsoon trough. Located {{to the south of}} a <b>ride</b> <b>of</b> high pressure, the wave moved west-northwestward across the open Atlantic; it retained a broad circulation with little to no precipitation for a day or two. Over time, clusters of convection increased around the broad system, and it developed two distinct centers of circulation on July30. During the morning of July 31, the large low markedly gained in organization, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted it was close to becoming a tropical depression. Later that day, however, the main circulation became increasingly elongated; its westernmost component soon detached to form a separate tropical wave. This new disturbance featured widely scattered convection and rainbands, which briefly affected the Lesser Antilles. The next day, a new area of deep convection with a dominant center formed as the circulation became better defined. It passed through the Leeward Islands with some improvement in its structure, and the surface winds rose to near tropical storm force. A reconnaissance flight into the system revealed the circulation center had become well defined near the deep convection. The system was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Emily at 0000UTC on August2, when it was located to the south of Dominica. During the initial stages of its existence, the storm accelerated toward the west-northwest in response to the strong high pressure to its north.|$|E
