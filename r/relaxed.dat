5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are <b>relaxed.</b> Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are <b>relaxed,</b> blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} isolated a novel rat cDNA encoding a basic helix–loop–helix {{transcription factor}} named <b>Relax,</b> whose {{expression in the}} developing central nervous system is strictly limited to discrete domains containing precursor cells. The timing of <b>Relax</b> expression coincides with neuronal differentiation. To investigate the involvement of <b>Relax</b> in neurogenesis we tested whether <b>Relax</b> activated neural genes in the ectoderm by injecting <b>Relax</b> RNA into Xenopus embryos. We demonstrate that ectopic <b>Relax</b> expression induces a persistent enlargement of the neural plate and converts presumptive epidermal cells into neurons. This indicates that <b>Relax,</b> when overexpressed in Xenopus embryos, has a neuronal fate-determination function. Analyses both of <b>Relax</b> overexpression in the frog and {{of the distribution of}} <b>Relax</b> in the rat neural tube strongly suggest that <b>Relax</b> is a neuronal fate-determination gene...|$|R

5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously <b>relaxed</b> craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously <b>relaxed</b> crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E

40|$|The {{sedimentation}} {{pattern of}} usual preparations of the <b>relaxing</b> protein is a single, sharp peak, {{but we found}} a few preparations to have two peaks. Metal-chelators or sulfhydryl compounds made the two peaks into a single peak whose. s^w (2. 7 mg per ml, ^~ 0. 22) was {{exactly the same as}} that of the single-peak preparation (5. IS). The <b>relaxing</b> protein prepared in the presence of ethylene glycol-bis (/S-aminoethylether) -N, N'-tetraacetic acid contained 4. 9 moles of sulfhydryl groups (SH) per 105 g. When incubated with N-ethylmaleimide, the SH content of the <b>relaxing</b> protein was reduced to 1. 3 moles per 105 g, whereas the <b>relaxing</b> activity of the protein was affected very little. AZUMA and WATANABE (1) reported that the metachromatic protein (metin) of SZENT-GY 6 RGYI and KAMINER (2) has the <b>relaxing</b> activity similar to but weaker than EBASHI'S <b>relaxing</b> protein (3). In Azuma and Wata-nabe's study, metin preparations retained their <b>relaxing</b> activity even after being treated with a SH-blocking reagent, NEM, thus suggesting that SH groups are not responsible for the <b>relaxing</b> activity. However, MUELLER (4, 5) reported that the <b>relaxing</b> protein is probably SH-tropomyosin and that BAILEY'S tropomyo-sin (6 "), which is inactive as the <b>relaxing</b> protein, is (disulfide) SS-tropomyosin.

Concergence of the <b>relaxing</b> scheme is then established. The results obtained for the first-order <b>relaxing</b> scheme can be extended to MUSCL <b>relaxing</b> schemes...|$|R
