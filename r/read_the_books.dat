5|$|Make Way for Ducklings {{was adapted}} into an 11-minute {{black-and-white}} cartoon created by Weston Woods in 1955. Founded by educator Morton Schindel in 1953, Weston Woods Studios, Inc.(named after the wooded area outside {{his home in}} Weston, Connecticut) specializes in animating children's picture books on film. The program is centered toward young struggling readers who, after watching the movie, are encouraged to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> themselves.|$|E
5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E
5|$|The Christians, {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon {{them for their}} neglect of the Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619). On discovering this, some Muslims destroyed the books, but the Christians constructed subterranean refuges in which to perform their religious devotions, <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> and strengthen their faith. According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E

25|$|In 1897 Ramana {{was joined}} by Palaniswami, who became his attendant. Palaniswami studied books in Tamil on Vedanta, such as Kaivalya Navaneeta, Shankara's Vivekachudamani, and Yoga Vasistha.

25|$|Another {{alternative}} is to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> in their original order of publication, since reading the Foundation prequels prior to reading the Foundation Trilogy fundamentally alters the original narrative structure of the trilogy by spoiling what were originally presented as plot surprises. In that same Author's Note, Asimov noted that {{there is room for}} a book between Robots and Empire (5) and The Currents of Space (6), and that he could follow Foundation and Earth (15) with additional volumes.|$|E

25|$|Juliette Benzoni's {{maiden name}} was Andrée-Marguerite–Juliette Mangin. She was the {{daughter}} of Marie-Susanne Arnold (with Alsace and Swiss Switzerland origin) and Charles-Hubert Mangin. She grew up in an upper-middle-class family in Paris. At the age of nine she discovered in a book Joan of Arc, at the stake and that was the moment her passion for history was awakened. It was her father who persuaded her to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> of Alexander Dumas as she told 2002 the Magazine Littéraire for the two hundred anniversary of that famous author.|$|E
25|$|Originally, WXP {{planned for}} The Fellowship {{to be an}} RPG, but they soon came to feel this might {{alienate}} potential players, and as they wanted to attract {{as many people as}} possible to the title, including people who had never <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> they decided to develop the game as a third-person action-adventure instead. At the time, Frodo was the only controllable character, with the other members of the fellowship featuring as NPCs, although the player was to have the choice as to which character(s) to fight alongside at each point in the game. The developers were also working closely with Tolkien Enterprises to ensure any action sequences or enemies that moved beyond the immediate events of the novel kept with the general tone of the narrative and were true to the spirit of Tolkien's legendarium.|$|E

500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed in the series, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the re-introduction of Benjen Stark, or Coldhands Benjen, and working with Joseph Mawle, saying [...] "It was so fantastic. And it's interesting. If you've <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> then you know about the Coldhands character, who was cut out of the Bran, Meera and Jojen storyline on the show. It was always interesting, having <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is sort of like the Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was very cool, the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set. I loved working with Joseph Mawle, and I loved having another member of our rapidly dwindling gang." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, David Benioff had a phone {{conversation}} with George R. R.

[...] The literary agent then sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel, A Game of Thrones, shared his enthusiasm with D. B. Weiss and suggested that they adapt Martin's novels into a television series; Weiss finished the first novel in [...] "maybe 36 hours". They pitched the series to HBO after a five-hour meeting with Martin (a veteran screenwriter) in a restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard. According to Benioff, they won Martin over with their answer to his question, [...] "Who is Jon Snow's mother?" ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{compared}} and contrasted Lazarus {{with other}} genre works. The timeliness of Rucka's premise made the series stand out among dystopian fiction for IGN reviewer Melissa Grey. Garrett Martin wrote in Paste Magazine that {{the series was}} unlike other contemporary class warfare genre fiction like Hunger Games or Blackacre because it is told from the oppressors' point of view. Oliver Sava reviewed the series for The A.V. Club and said it stood out from Image's other science fiction comics [...] "because it's more grounded in current political and economic trends". In {{a review of the}} first issue for Behind the Panels, Richard Gray felt Lazarus did too little to set itself apart from similar books. Rucka specifically addressed fan-drawn parallels to Game of Thrones, saying he had not <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> and purposely avoids watching the show to avoid unintentionally borrowing ideas from it. Lark thinks the comparison to Game of Thrones works to some extent, but points out that Lazarus concentrates more on a single character.|$|E

500|$|The opinion, {{written by}} Hardwicke, {{found that a}} true {{abridgement}} of a published book may be considered an entirely separate, new work, as the abridgement showed the labour, originality, education, and judgement of the editor. This new book did not {{run the risk of}} infringing the rights of the author or bookseller who owned the publishing rights. However, Lord Hardwicke drew a distinction between works [...] "fairly made" [...] and those [...] "colourably shortened". Hardwicke refused to compare the books himself to determine whether Modern Crown Law was indeed a fair abridgement, or to force a judge and jury to sit and hear both books read, instead opting to have two legal experts and a literary master <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> and report the findings to the court. The parties were allowed to choose these examiners, in a way leaving the case to arbitration. After a week in which the parties were given a chance to make amends outside of court, the book in question was ruled a colourable shortening, created only to circumvent the law, and thus was an infringement of Gyles' printing rights.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Tandy, Nappi did not <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> before {{illustrating}} them; instead, {{his wife}} read them and {{provided him with}} a brief plot summary before Nappi began painting. Nappi's first cover was for The Clue of the Velvet Mask, where he began a trend of portraying Nancy as [...] "bobby-soxer... a contemporary sixteen-year-old. This Nancy was perky, clean-cut, and extremely animated. In {{the majority of his}} covers Nancy looks startled– which, no doubt, she was." [...] Nancy's style is considerably conservative, and remains so during the psychedelic period. Although she wears bold colors and prints, or the background colors are shades of electric yellow, shocking pink, turquoise, or apple green, her clothing is high-necked and with long hemlines. Earlier Nappi covers show Nancy in poses similar to those in the covers by Tandy and Gillies; for many updated covers he simply updated the color scheme, clothing style, and hairstyles of the characters but retains their original poses in similar settings. Later Nappi covers show only Nancy's head or part of her body, surrounded by spooky or startling elements or clues from the story. These Nappi covers would later be used for the opening credits of the television production, with photos of Pamela Sue Martin inserted on the book covers.|$|E
500|$|Dinklage has {{received}} widespread praise for his performance, with Matthew Gilbert from The Boston Globe saying that Dinklage [...] "gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware". Dan Kois of The New York Times noted that Dinklage's performance {{has made the}} character [...] "all the more popular". The Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage". Tyrion {{has been called the}} [...] "most quotable" [...] character and [...] "one of the most beloved characters" [...] of the series. For his performance, he has gone on to win a Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2011 and 2015, as well as the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. As a result of his performance and increased screen time, Dinklage was given top billing starting in the series' second season. In 2014, he said on The Late Show with David Letterman that he had once tried to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> the show is based upon, but had found them confusing. He joked, [...] "George Martin, our author, is probably going to kill my character soon because I mentioned that." [...] In 2014, Dinklage and four of his Game of Thrones co-stars became some of the highest paid actors on television, although sources differ on the actors' per-episode salaries as of 2017. In 2015, Dinklage lent his voice for the role of Tyrion in , an episodic graphic adventure video game based on the show.|$|E

500|$|Kristen Stewart {{was on the}} set of Adventureland when Hardwicke {{visited her}} for an {{informal}} screen test that [...] "captivated" [...] the director. Hardwicke had trouble finding an actor otherworldly enough to play vampire Edward Cullen. Then she got a call about a guy in London. [...] "I looked at a couple pictures and was like, ‘I’m not sure,’?" [...] Hardwicke says. [...] "He had been fired from his last job, he was unemployed, he was in debt." [...] Pattinson flew to Los Angeles on his own dime to read with Stewart. Shiloh Fernandez, Jackson Rathbone, Ben Barnes, and Robert Pattinson were the final four up for the role of Edward. Hardwicke did not initially choose Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen, but after an audition at her home with Stewart, he was selected. Hardwicke said, [...] "Kristen was like, ‘It’s got to be Rob!’ She felt connected to him from the first moment. That electricity, or love at first sight, or whatever it is." [...] Hardwicke gave him the part, but he had to make a promise. [...] "You’ve got to realize that Kristen is 17 years old," [...] Hardwicke told him, [...] "She’s underage. You’ve got to focus, dude, or you’re going to be arrested. I made him swear on a stack of Bibles." [...] Pattinson was unfamiliar with the novel series prior to his screen test but <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> later on. Meyer allowed him to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun, which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward's point of view. Fan reaction to Pattinson's casting as Edward was initially negative; Rachelle Lefèvre remarked that [...] "very woman had their own Edward [...] they had to let go of before they could open up to , which they did." [...] Meyer was [...] "excited" [...] and [...] "ecstatic" [...] in response to the casting of the two main characters. She had expressed interest in having Emily Browning and Henry Cavill cast as Bella and Edward, respectively, prior to pre-production.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} narrated by Orrec Caspro, {{the son of}} Canoc, master of the domain of Caspromant. The gift that his family {{possesses}} {{is the ability to}} [...] "unmake" [...] things, but his gift seems to manifest very late, and he is unable to control it. Later he seems to strike down his pet dog, and then destroy an entire hillside with his power. He decides the death was his fault, and horrified by the thought of his power out of control, demands that he be blindfolded. Orrec's battles with his power and its potential to destroy have been described {{as an example of a}} person's confrontation with their own shadow, a common theme in Le Guin's writing. The blindfold initially brings him some peace. Unable to see the real world, he lives within the stories that Melle has told him, Eventually he begins to retell the stories to his mother, and to add to them himself. When Melle asks to see his face without the blindfold one last time, he realizes he couldn't have hurt her, and feels the [...] "dry fury of impotent regret." [...] After his mother's death he descends into grief and rage, which he eventually emerges from with Gry's assistance. At Gry's suggestion he begins to remove his blindfold to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> his mother writes for him. Orrec comes to realizes that his father has unintentionally tricked him into believing in his wild gift, so as to protect his domain. He confronts his father [...] Orrec eventually realizes that he prefers [...] "making" [...] to unmaking. Gry and he get married, and leave the Uplands. Scholar Sandra Lindow has pointed out that Orrec's name is similar to [...] "auric", meaning [...] "related to hearing", and that it brings to mind the word [...] "oracle", describing his discovery of his power to create and perform. Orrec's emotional journey during his blindfoldment has been compared to that of the biblical character Jonah, as well as to that of Max in the Maurice Sendak children's picture book Where the Wild Things Are.|$|E
