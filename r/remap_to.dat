25|$|Phantom limbs are a {{phenomenon}} which occurs following amputation of a limb from an individual. In 90–98% of cases, amputees report feeling {{all or part}} of the limb or body part still there, taking up space. The amputee may perceive a limb under full control, or paralyzed. A common side effect of phantom limbs is phantom limb pain. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which phantom limbs occur is still under debate. A common theory posits that the afferent neurons, since deafferented due to amputation, typically <b>remap</b> <b>to</b> adjacent cortical regions within the brain. This can cause amputees to report feeling their missing limb being touched when a seemingly unrelated part of the body is stimulated (such as if the face is touched, but the amputee also feels their missing arm being stroked in a specific location). Another facet of phantom limbs is that the efferent copy (motor feedback) responsible for reporting on position to the body schema does not attenuate quickly. Thus the missing body part may be attributed by the amputee to still be in a fixed or movable position.|$|E

In March 2009, WIRE's owners filed an informal objection against WANN's request for special temporary authority, stating it had until the following month to file a petition to deny. The objection was dropped when the two stations began to work together, and late in the month WANN filed an application to modify its permit from atop the Bank of America Plaza in downtown Atlanta (where it shares an antenna with WANN analog, and co-owned WTBS-LP 26 and its permit for WTBS-LD 30) to the east tower at the [...] "Richland" [...] site near North Druid Hills. This is the same tower and channel (29) as WIRE's digital application (made December 2008), but at higher power (15 kW versus 10 kW) and much higher height (by 92m).

5000|$|Another pioneer {{within the}} field of activity-dependent {{plasticity}} is Michael Merzenich, currently a professor in neuroscience at the University of California, San Francisco. One of his contributions includes mapping out and documenting the reorganization of cortical regions after alterations due to plasticity. [...] While assessing the recorded changes in the primary somatosensory cortex of adult monkeys, he looked at several features of the data including how altered schedules of activity from the skin <b>remap</b> <b>to</b> cortical modeling and other factors that affect the representational remodeling of the brain. His findings within these studies have since been applied to youth development and children with language-based learning impairments. Through many studies involving adaptive training exercises on computer, he has successfully designed methods to improve their temporal processing skills. These adaptive measures include word-processing games and comprehension tests that involve multiple regions of the brain in order to answer. The results later translated into his development of the Fast ForWord program in 1996, which aims to enhance cognitive skills of children between kindergarten and twelfth grade by focusing on developing “phonological awareness.” [...] It has proven very successful at helping children with a variety of cognitive complications. In addition, it has led to in depth studies of specific complications such as autism and intellectual disability and the causes of them. [...] Alongside a team of scientists, Merzenich helped to provide evidence that autism probes monochannel perception where a stronger stimulus-driven representation dominates behavior and weaker stimuli are practically ignored in comparison.|$|E
5000|$|According to the CDISC SDS Team, CDISC {{standards}} evolve, as {{any standard}} does. The SDTM is the model, the implementation guides provide guidance {{in implementing the}} model for specific use cases. The initial publications of the SDTM and the SDTMIG (SDTM Implementation Guide for Human Clinical Trials) published in 2004 were not complete by any means, they could not provide guidance for every possible type of data collected in all human clinical trials. Instead they provided a general model (the SDTM) and an implementation guide (the SDTMIG) {{for the majority of}} data seen in most clinical trials, and have been evolving ever since to cover more and more use cases. The SDTM is a general class model, and hopefully can be applied to all data that we collect, but the implementation guides still as yet do not cover all use cases. Sponsors with use cases that are not covered yet must apply the principles of the SDTM in creating what we refer to as [...] "custom" [...] domains. Over time, as more and more use cases are represented in the implementation guides, these use cases become covered by what we call [...] "standard" [...] domains ("standard" [...] = published in an implementation guide, [...] "custom" [...] = not published yet). It would be remiss if CDISC did not continue to enhance the standards to cover these additional use cases, and I am sure all would agree it would have been an impossible task in 2004 (or now for that matter) to wait to publish anything until every use case is covered. So the issue of backward compatibility is more complicated than described in the preceding paragraph. True, there are certainly model changes that may not be backward compatible, but new domains are a different issue. Before a domain is published (standard), sponsors still must submit this data, so they create custom domains. Different sponsors may map the same data differently, and even call their custom domains something different. This facilitates the today for their specific use cases and submissions, but does nothing to help the tomorrow, where all sponsors should submit the data the same way. True, when a new standard domain is published, sponsors should rework their custom domains that have that type of data, but they are also free to continue to use their custom domains in the versions of the standards they were working under. But it of-course may be beneficial to the sponsor to <b>remap</b> <b>to</b> the standard domain, since this is now the [...] "standard" [...] way all sponsors would submit, and benefit from improved reviewability by regulators. So yes, sponsors should transform their custom domains to standard when standard are published, but this is an improvement for all, and should not be looked at as a limitation. ... The EC (Exposure as Collected) domain that the author above mentions is an excellent example of a domain that makes it easier, not harder to submit. The EX (Exposure) domain is, and has always been, supposed to be submitted in the Protocol Specified Unit and in the most reviewable manner possible. This means that if a specific drug administration is collected in mg, but the dosage is prescribed (and likely eventually labeled) in mg/kg, then the EX data should be represented in mg/kg, which means the collected data should be converted to the Protocol Specified Unit (mg/kg in this case). EC allows the source data collected in mg to be represented, and summarized ({{for lack of a better}} word) into an EX record in mg/kg. This maintains a clear audit-trail of collected data to the EX summarized (again, for lack of a better word) data. Additionally, what if a single drug administration is given in multiple injections, in-order to maintain a dosage blind, or perhaps because the dose is better applied for safety reasons to multiple areas of the body. The collected data would likely represent each injection, when really what a reviewer wants to see if the summarized dosage across the multiple injections. EC allows each injection to be represented, and EX is again the summarized administration, which is likely what the Protocol represents and the eventual product labeling. So, yes, EC represents a change, but a positive change for something that sponsors could not do within the model before. So in summary, while the statements the author of the previous section make are true, in this authors opinion they are incomplete and misleading. Hope this helps shed some light on why the CDISC standard must evolve, and are evolving in a mutually beneficial way, for regulators and industry.|$|E

40|$|The {{memory system}} {{is often the}} weakest link in the {{performance}} of today’s computers. Cache design has received increasing attention in recent years as increases in CPU performance continues to outpace decreases in memory la-tency. Bershad et al. proposed a hardware modification called the Cache Miss Lookaside buffer which attempts to dynamically identify data that is conflicting in the cache and <b>remap</b> <b>to</b> pages to avoid future conflicts. In a follow-up paper, Bershad et al. tried to modify this idea to work with standard hardware but had less success than with their dedicated hardware. In this thesis, we focus on a modification of these ideas, using less compli-cated hardware and focusing more on sampling policies. The hardware support is reduced to a buffer of recent cache misses and a cache miss counter. Be-cause determination of remapping candidates is moved to software, sampling policies are studied to reduce overhead which will most likely fall on the OS. Our results show that sampling can be highly effective in identifying conflicts that should be remapped. Finally, we show that the theoretical performance of such a system can compare favorably with more costly higher-associativity caches. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Genetic and {{epigenetic}} modifications {{resulting from}} different genomes adjusting {{to a common}} nuclear environment have been observed in polyploids. Sequence restructuring within genomes involving retrotransposon/ microsatellite-rich regions {{has been reported in}} triticale. The present study uses inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphisms (IRAP) and retrotransposon microsatellite amplified polymorphisms (<b>REMAP)</b> <b>to</b> assess genome rearrangements in wheat–rye addition lines obtained by the controlled backcrossing of octoploid triticale to hexaploid wheat followed by self-fertilization. The comparative analysis of IRAP and REMAP banding profiles, involving a complete set of wheat–rye addition lines, and their parental species revealed in those lines the presence of wheat-origin bands absent in triticale, and the absence of rye-origin and triticale-specific bands. The presence in triticale x wheat backcrosses (BC) of rye-origin bands that were absent in the addition lines demonstrated that genomic rearrangement events were not a direct consequence of backcrossing, but resulted from further genome structural rearrangements in the BC plant progeny. PCR experiments using primers designed from different rye-origin sequences showed that the absence of a rye-origin band in wheat–rye addition lines results from sequence elimination rather than restrict changes on primer annealing sites, as noted in triticale. The level of genome restructuring events evaluated in all seven wheat–rye addition lines, compared to triticale, indicated that the unbalanced genome merger situation observed in the addition lines induced a new round of genome rearrangement, suggesting that the lesser the amount of rye chromatin introgressed into wheat the larger the outcome of genome reshuffling...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hippocampal place fields show {{remapping}} between {{environments that}} contain sufficiently different contextual features, {{a phenomenon that}} may reflect a mechanism for episodic memory formation. Previous {{studies have shown that}} place fields <b>remap</b> <b>to</b> changes in the configuration of visual landmarks in an environment. Other experiments have demonstrated that remapping can occur with experience, even when the visual features of an environment remain stable. A special case of remapping may be trajectory coding, the tendency for hippocampal neurons to exhibit different firing rates depending upon recently visited or upcoming spatial locations. To further delineate the conditions under which different task features elicit remapping, we recorded from place cells in dorsal CA 1 of hippocampus while rats switched between tasks that differed in memory demand and task structure; continuous spatial alternation (CA), delayed spatial alternation (DA), and tactile-visual conditional discrimination (CD). Individual hippocampal neurons and populations of simultaneously recorded neurons showed coherent remapping between CA and CD. However, task remapping was rarely seen between DA and CD. Analysis of individual units revealed that even though the population retained a coherent representation of task structure across the DA and CD tasks, the majority of individual neurons consistently remapped at some point during recording sessions. In contrast with previous studies, trajectory coding on the stem of the T-maze was virtually absent during all of the tasks, suggesting that experience with multiple tasks in the same environment reduces the likelihood that hippocampal neurons will represent distinct trajectories. Trajectory coding was, however, observed during the delay period of DA. Whether place fields change in response to task or trial type or remain stable within the same environment may depend on which aspects of the context are most salient or relevant to behavior.
