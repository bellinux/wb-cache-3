40|$|In many countries, spent {{nuclear fuel}} is {{considered}} as a waste form to be disposed of in underground disposal. Under deep host rock conditions, a reducing environment prevails. In the case of water contact, long-term radionuclide release from the fuel depends on dissolution processes of the UO 2 matrix. The dissolution rate of irradiated UO 2 is controlled by oxidizing processes facilitated by dissolved species formed by alpharadiolysis of water in contact with {{spent nuclear fuel}}. To understand {{the effect of the}} radiation, the information of the dose rate at the surface of the fuel and its proximity is needed. α particles contribute strongly due to their high linear energy transfer. However, their dose rate and the energy deposition at the fuel surface are difficult to measure. Cylindrical fuel pellets as used in fuel rods show specific features, such as the <b>rim</b> <b>zone,</b> where a higher Pu concentration and a different porosity of the fuel matrix is present.

40|$|International audienceChemical zoning in xenocrysts may be inherited, {{the result}} of magmatic growth, or {{diffusive}} ion exchange with the host magma. To quantify magma residence times of xenocrysts based on diffusion zoning patterns thus requires knowledge of the contribution of diffusion to the zoning patterns and knowledge of appropriate diffusion coefficients. Using olivine xenocrysts (Fo 75 - 79) from melting experiments run for ca. 1 day, at 1000 - 1150 °C, 200 MPa, fO 2 near NNO, and 1 - 5 wt% H 2 O, we characterize length-scales of growth versus Fe-Mg diffusion zoning, and suggest that hydrous diffusion coefficients for olivine need to be constrained to reliably model xenocryst residence times in magmatic systems. In the experiments, initially angular, unzoned olivine xenocrysts develop subhedral to euhedral crystal outlines, and continuous Fe-Mg core-rim zoning with rim thicknesses of ≤ 40 μm. The euhedral crystal outlines and thick <b>rim</b> <b>zones</b> indicate that the zoning patterns partly result from growth. However, abundant healed micro-fractures, originally present in the xenocrysts, extend into the compositional <b>rim</b> <b>zones,</b> and define minimum length scales for zoning as {{the result of}} diffusion. The maximum length scale of the diffusion zoning profiles are 9. 5 and 17. 5 μm in 1000 and 1150 °C experiments, and we suggest that these profiles represent diffusion close to [001]. Estimating the diffusion coefficient D as ~l 2 /t (l = diffusion length scale; t = time) gives log(D) of ca. - 14. 8 to - 14. 2 m 2 /s- 1 at 1000 and 1150 °C, apparently independent of the amount of H 2 O present. Using the same approximation to calculate D for olivine xenocrysts in an equivalent dry system (using data from [1]), indicate that diffusion in olivine xenocrysts in lowpressure hydrous systems is over ten times faster than in equivalent anhydrous systems. To reliably quantify magma residence times of xenocrysts based on diffusion zoning patterns thus requires (i) that hydrous diffusion coefficient are rigorously constrained and applied, unless it is evident that the xenocrysts were immersed in dry magmas; and (ii) that growth contributions to xenocryst zoning patterns are constrained (e. g., using markers as above, or comparing zoning patterns for multiple elements).

The contact metamorphic assemblage of a pelitic sample in the innermost aureole of the Croton Falls pluton, a small (< 10 km 2) gabbroic body, consists of quartz–plagioclase– biotite–garnet–sillimanite–ilmenite–graphite–Zn-rich Al-spinel. Both K-feldspar and muscovite are absent, and abundant biotite, plagioclase, sillimanite, quartz and ilmenite inclusions are found within subhedral garnet crystals. Unusually low bulk-rock Na and K contents imply depletion of alkalic components and silica through anatexis and melt extraction during contact heating relative to typical metapelites outside the aureole. Thermobarometry on nearby samples lacking a contact overprint yields 620 – 640 °C and 0. 5 – 0. 6 GPa. In the aureole sample, WDS X-ray chemical maps show distinct Ca-enriched rims on both garnet and matrix plagioclase.

An anti-plane problem for a cracked unbounded two-dimensional poled piezoelectric plate has been investigated. The crack rims open on account of shear mechanical forces applied at the remote boundary and in-plane electric displacement field prescribed at the infinite boundary.

Three inclusions yielded total gas ages that agree with, or are younger than, or within error of, the Sese kimberlite eruption age (538 ± 11 Ma) but may be compromised by gas loss. One inclusion, with the highest tapped interface gas yield, gave a total gas age of 892 ± 21 Ma that is a likely minimum yimengite age.

40|$|The {{timescales}} {{over which}} magmas in large silicic systems are reactivated, assembled and stored remains a fundamental question in volcanology. To address this question, we study timescales from Fe–Mg interdiffusion in orthopyroxenes and Ti diffusion in quartz from the caldera-forming 1200 km 3 Kidnappers and 200 km 3 Rocky Hill eruptions from the Mangakino volcanic centre (Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand). The two eruptions {{came from the}} same source area, have indistinguishable 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages (∼ 1. 0 Ma) and zircon U–Pb age spectra, but their respective deposits are separated by a short period of erosion. Compositions of pumice, glass and mineral species in the collective eruption deposits define multiple melt dominant bodies but indicate that these shared a common magmatic mush zone. Diffusion timescales from both eruptions are used to build on chemical and textural crystal signatures and interpret both the crystal growth histories and the timing of magma accumulation. Fe–Mg interdiffusion profiles in orthopyroxenes imply that the three melt-dominant bodies, established through extraction of melt and crystals from the common source, were generated within 600 years and with peak accumulation rates within 100 years of each eruption. In addition, a less-evolved melt interacted with the Kidnappers magma, beginning ∼ 30 years prior to and peaking within 3 years of the eruption. This interaction did not directly trigger the eruption, but may have primed the magmatic system. Orthopyroxene crystals with the same zoning patterns from the Kidnappers and Rocky Hill pumices yield consistently different diffusion timescales, suggesting a time break between the eruptions of ∼ 20 years (from core–rim zones) to ∼ 10 years (outer <b>rim</b> <b>zones).</b> Diffusion of Ti in quartz reveals similarly short timescales and magmatic residence times of < 30 years, suggesting quartz is only recording the last period of crystallization within the final eruptible melt. Accumulation of the eruptible magma for these two, closely successive eruptions was accomplished over centuries to decades, in contrast to the gestation time of the magmatic system of ∼ 200 kyr, as indicated by zircon age patterns. The magmatic system was able to recover after the Kidnappers eruption in only ∼ 10 – 20 years to accumulate enough eruptible melt and crystals for a second ∼ 200 km 3 eruption. Our data support concepts of large silicic systems being stored as long-lived crystal mushes, with eruptible melts generated over extraordinarily short timescales prior to eruption...|$|R
40|$|The magmatic {{systems that}} {{give rise to}} voluminous crystal-poor {{rhyolite}} magma bodies can be considered to operate on two contrasting timescales: Those governed by longer-term processes by which a magma acquires its chemical and isotopic characteristics (e. g., fractional crystallisation and assimilation), and those operating at shorter timescales during the physical accumulation of the melt-dominant magma body that finally erupts. We explore the compositional and textural relationships between amphibole and orthopyroxene crystals from the 25. 4 ka, 530 km 3 (magma) Oruanui eruption products (Taupo volcano, New Zealand) to investigate how processes related to the physical assembly of the pre-eruptive magma body are represented in the crystal record. Over 90 % of orthopyroxenes from the volumetrically dominant high-SiO 2 (> 74 wt%) rhyolite pumices record textural evidence for a significant disequilibrium event (partial dissolution ± resorption of cores and interiors) prior to the growth of 40 – 500 μm thick <b>rim</b> <b>zones.</b> This dissolution/regrowth history of orthopyroxene is recorded in the chemistry of co-crystallising amphiboles as a prominent inflection in the concentrations of Mn and Zn, two elements notably enriched in orthopyroxene relative to amphibole. Textural and chemical features, linked with in situ thermobarometric estimates, indicate that a major decompression event preceded the formation of the melt-dominant body. The decompression event is inferred to represent the extraction of large volumes of melt plus crystals from the Oruanui crystal mush/source zone at pressures of 140 – 300 MPa (~ 6 – 12 km depth). Orthopyroxene underwent partial dissolution during ascent before reestablishing in the melt-dominant magma body at pressures of 90 – 140 MPa (~ 3. 5 – 6 km). We model Fe–Mg diffusion across the core-rim boundaries along the crystallographic a or b-axes to constrain the timing of this decompression event, which marked establishment of the melt-dominant magma body. Maximum modelled ages indicate that this event did not begin until ~ 1, 600 years before eruption, consistent with constraints from zircon model-age spectra. Once extraction began, it underwent runaway acceleration with a peak extraction age of ~ 230 years, followed by an apparent period of stasis of ~ 60 years prior to eruption. The rapidity of the extraction and accumulation processes implies the involvement of a dynamic driving force which, in the rifted continental arc setting of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, seems likely to be represented by magma-assisted extensional tectonic processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{reintegration}} of the urban system new settlements are emerging on the urban <b>rim,</b> transitional <b>zones</b> are reurbanised, derelict areas within the cities are being deve-loped and degraded urban areas of derelict industrial complexes are being renaturalised. In the periphery combined research and production parks are being set up, in the open land-scape integrated business, trade and recreational centres are springing up. Decentralisation and recentralisation of focal points of development accompany the contemporary processes of reurbanisation and suburbanisation – they are simultaneous and move in two-direction i. e. {{to and from the}} city. We understand them as manifestation of a dynamic balance among contradiction existing between the centre and the rim. Deindustrialisation and relocation of production and distribution from the centres of gravity to the periphery generate extensive degraded urban areas within cities and between the city and suburbs. The periphery is being urbanised with the creation of new, dispersed and nonhierachical poles of development, and the city and inner city is undergoing reurbanization. The general environmental conditions in the city and in the countryside are being equalised, the potentials of development are being sought in the comparative advantages of local conditions: be it attractive urban dis-tricts, be it suburban entities or countryside areas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTitanium alloys such as Ti 6 Al 4 V {{are often}} {{employed}} in turbine industry components {{due to their}} outstanding mechanical properties. These properties {{make it hard to}} machine with conventional processes like broaching, milling or grinding. An alternative represents WEDM. Within this paper a comparison between grinding and WEDM of Ti 6 Al 4 V concerning surface integrity aspects proved by bending fatigue life is set up. Due to visual inspections and surface roughness measurements a higher fatigue life of the ground specimen is assumed. In contrast the EDMed specimen show higher fatigue strength. Further surface integrity aspects have been conducted to analyse the fatigue result. Summarized, the better correlation between visual part quality, influenced <b>rim</b> <b>zone</b> and fatigue strength, shows a user-friendly quality check of EDMed parts. Furthermore, this paper shows that WEDM is an alternative to conventional processes for machining titanium alloys...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has been}} written in two parts: the chemical characteristics of Iowa highway concrete containing coarse dolomite aggregate, and an experimental study of deterioration of Iowa highway concrete;Two groups of Iowa highway concretes studied here can be differentiated: durable concretes with extended service lives of 3 ̆e 40 years and non-durable concretes with short service lives of 8 - 12 years. Compared to durable concretes, non-durable concretes are far more deteriorated, contain more cracks or micro-cracks, and exhibit more abundant and better developed reaction rims at dolomite aggregate - cement paste interfaces. Both petrographic and SEM studies reveal that the reactions responsible for reaction rim development are dolomite-specific. Reactive dolomite aggregates exhibit higher porosity and consist of fine-grained dolomite crystals with a diameter of 0. 005 - 0. 05 mm, whereas non-reactive dolomite aggregates show lower porosity and consist of coarse, extremely well-crystallized, and tightly intergrown dolomite crystals with a diameter of 0. 05 - 0. 45 mm;The best-developed interface pattern is: unaltered dolomite aggregate interior (zone A) → inner dark dolomite reaction <b>rim</b> (<b>zone</b> B) → outer light-colored dolomite reaction <b>rim</b> (<b>zone</b> C) → light-colored paste reaction <b>rim</b> (<b>zone</b> D) → dark, presumably unaltered, cement paste (zone E). Regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of zone C, there is an increase in Ca and a concomitant decrease in Mg near the edge of dolomite aggregate close to the aggregate-paste interface, along with the formation of calcite and brucite near the interface. Zone D is calcite-rich. The compositional variations and mineralogy strongly suggest that these reaction rims were formed as a result of dedolomitization reactions between reactive dolomite aggregates and alkaline cement paste, and that dedolomitization is the primary cause of Iowa concrete deterioration;Both durable and non-durable Iowa concretes were subject to wet/dry, freeze/thaw, and continuous soaking treatment with magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride solutions, and water. No deterioration was evident in concrete samples treated with water, and sodium chloride solution was found to be relatively benign in terms of concrete deterioration. However, magnesium and calcium chloride solutions caused severe deterioration to durable and non-durable concretes;Magnesium chloride solution typically caused severe paste decomposition, disintegration and dark brownish paste discoloration, and showed similar deleterious effects on concrete to magnesium sulphate, magnesium acetate, and magnesium nitrate. The reactions between magnesium chloride and cement paste may involve leaching out Ca(OH) 2 from cement paste, replacement of Ca 2 + in calcium silicate hydrate by Mg 2 +, and decomposition of calcium aluminate hydrate, to form non-cementitious magnesium silicate hydrate, brucite, and calcite, causing paste disintegration and discoloration. Magnesium from any source, either from magnesium road deicers or from reactive dolomite aggregate, is thought to play a major role in highway concrete deterioration;Calcium chloride attack is characterized by crack development and brownish paste discoloration. The precipitation of neo-formed materials (calcite, Freidel 2 ̆ 7 s salt, ettringite, gypsum, etc.), due to the reaction between CaCl 2 solution and cement paste, and the stress associated with crystal growth are thought to cause concrete expansion and lead to concrete cracking...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} Vickers microhardness indentation and Young's modulus {{results obtained}} from light water reactor (LWR) UO 2 fuel at burnup ≥ 60 GWd/tHM. The hardness profiles are compared with porosity distribution profiles measured by Scanning Electron Microscopy image analysis, with particular {{focus on the}} pellet rim, where the high burnup structure (HBS) is present. The formation of HBS and porosity build-up leads to a noticeable change of apparent microhardness in the <b>rim</b> <b>zone</b> of the fuel pellet, primarily related to porosity increase. The microhardness was also measured on a longitudinal section. At each radial position, no significant difference was observed between the microhardness at the mid-pellet and at end of the pellet, close to pellet-pellet interface. The relationship between the local values of the microhardness and the Young's modulus is also evaluated. The current data provides the basis for an assessment of microhardness and other mechanical properties in relation with local fuel structure and conditions and supports the development of predictive models in fuel performance codes like TRANSURANUS.

40|$|Liprin-/SYD- 2 is {{a family}} of multidomain {{proteins}} with four known isoforms. One of the reported functions of liprin- is to regulate the development of presynaptic active zones, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we report that liprin- directly inter-acts with the ERC (ELKS-Rab 6 -interacting protein-CAST) family of proteins, members of which are known to bind <b>RIMs,</b> the active <b>zone</b> proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release. In vitro results indicate that ERC 2 /CAST, an active zone-specific isoform, interacts {{with all of the}} known isoforms of liprin- and that lip-rin- 1 associates with both ERC 2 and ERC 1 b, a splice variant of ERC 1 that distributes to both cytosolic and active zone regions. ERC 2 colocalizes with liprin- 1 in cultured neurons and forms a complex with liprin- 1 i...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{diagnosis}} and follow-up of glaucoma an exact {{evaluation of the}} optic nerve disc and the nerve fiber layer is necessary. METHODS: The slit-lamp evaluation of the optic nerve disc and nerve fiber layer is presented {{as well as the}} evaluation with the Nerve Fiber Analyzer and the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph. RESULTS: Signs of a glaucomatous optic disc include a difference of more than 0. 2 in the vertical cup to disc (CD) ratio between the eyes, a vertical CD ratio exceeding more than 0. 1 the horizontal, larger CD ratios in small optic discs, notching of the neuroretinal <b>rim,</b> an enlarged <b>zone</b> beta of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy, and peripapillary hemorrhages. Atrophy of the nerve fiber layer may be localized or diffuse. Both types of atrophy may be present at the same time. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of all signs of the glaucomatous optic disc and forms of nerve fiber layer atrophy allows an earlier diagnosis of glaucoma and an earlier recognition of progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{study is}} carried for arrest of {{opening of a}} crack and fatigue crack growth rate for a {{piezoelectric}} ceramic strip weakened by a transverse, finite, hairline straight crack. A strip yield model is considered under anti-plane shear stress and in-plane electric loading conditions. The developed slide <b>zone</b> <b>rims</b> are subjected to quadratically varying yield point cohesive anti-plane shear stress to arrest the crack from further opening. Fourier integral transform method is employed, which reduces problem to the solution of Fredholm integral equation of second kind. This integral equation in turn is solved numerically. Expressions are derived {{for the length of}} slide zone, crack sliding displacement and crack growth rate. A qualitative study is presented for the parameters affecting the opening of the crack with respect to the strip width, material constants etc. {{in the form of the}} graphs. The results obtained are analyzed and conclusions are drawn. Key words: Crack growth rate, crack sliding displacement, piezoelectric ceramic strip, slide zone, stress intensity factors...|$|R
