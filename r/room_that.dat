5|$|Art Connections {{underwent}} a complete renovation in 2004. Most {{of the work}} went into installing new, high-tech activities, including a virtual canvas powered by a laser-light paintbrush and a <b>room</b> <b>that</b> turns dancers' shadows into art on the wall.|$|E
5|$|Research {{started by}} Count Gabriel de La Rochefoucauld, {{which had been}} {{interrupted}} by the war, uncovered a buried part of the castle dating to the 12th and 13th centuries, including the <b>room</b> <b>that</b> housed the drawbridge mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{these public}} functions, the {{pavilion}} is available, {{as is the}} entire park, as a venue for private events year-round. The stage's glass and steel doors enable it to provide indoor space protected from the elements when necessary. In addition, the pavilion has a Choral Rehearsal <b>Room</b> <b>that</b> can be rented.|$|E

The cellar of the jail has a chimney {{on the west}} that has several ovens, {{including}} a beehive oven, and was not partitioned except for the fieldstone foundation required to support the cells in the southeast corner.|$|E
5|$|Arnolfini {{has three}} floors of galleries, a {{specialist}} arts bookshop, a cinema {{which can also}} be used as a performance space for theatre, live art, dance and music, a reading <b>room</b> <b>that</b> provides reference material for all past exhibitions and wide range of books and catalogues, and a café bar. Entrance to the galleries is free of charge. Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley, Richard Long, Rachel Whiteread, Paul McCartney, Angus Fairhurst and Louise Bourgeois.

5|$|At the FBI safe house, {{a police}} car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the <b>room</b> <b>that</b> Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but once he is on the ground Skinner sees that his hand is curled into the shape of the gun.|$|E

I made paper <b>rooms</b> <b>that</b> you would walk into {{and they would}} kind of rustle. That was an attempt at an environment. It wasn't terribly complete [...] [...] [...] {{kind of like the}} shell. Actually, I didn't think of those as 'environments'. I didn't have that word then.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, {{received}} a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose <b>Room</b> <b>that</b> afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber were {{also a part of}} this August assembly; these individuals influenced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E
5|$|Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Gallery {{contains}} basketry made by Native American {{tribes in}} the Pacific Northwest. These pieces {{are from the}} Byrd and Polleski Collections acquired during the 1940s. The museum also contains the Carl Hall Gallery that holds a variety of work, including work by former faculty members. Other galleries at the museum include the Melvin Henderson-Rubio Gallery that exhibits traveling collections, General Collections Gallery that displays Asian and European artwork, the Study Gallery that shows small temporary collections, and the Print Study <b>Room</b> <b>that</b> exhibits prints and photographs.|$|E
5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel <b>room</b> <b>that</b> night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E

5|$|From 1793, seven small {{houses at}} {{the east side of}} the theatre {{fronting}} on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was in this <b>room</b> <b>that</b> Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95. He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts. He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000florins.|$|E
5|$|In late 1968, {{the members}} of the Jimi Hendrix Experience were living in a rented house in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. One night bassist Noel Redding was warned about a pending visit from law enforcement, so he {{immediately}} phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell, who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and asked him to come over to the house so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs. They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's <b>room</b> <b>that</b> had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house.|$|E
5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break <b>room</b> <b>that</b> included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.|$|E

Michael is bitter that Jim left Scranton for Stamford {{and tries to}} one-up Josh at every opportunity. Michael also spreads the word that he is throwing a party in his hotel <b>room</b> <b>that</b> night. Later in the evening, Michael surprises everyone {{with the news that}} he has broken Staples's exclusive hold on Hammermill products.|$|E
5|$|No {{childhood}} home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used {{during his time}} with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm <b>room</b> <b>that</b> Poe {{is believed to have}} used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.|$|E
5|$|The Library of Gray's Inn {{has existed}} {{since at least}} 1555, when the first mention of it {{was made in the}} will of Robert Chaloner, who left some money to buy law books for the Library. The Library was neither a big {{collection}} nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of Nicholas Bacon, a <b>room</b> <b>that</b> was also used for mooting and to store the deed chest. The collection grew larger over the years as individual Benchers such as Sir John Finch and Sir John Bankes left books or money to buy books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members of the Inn had been found stealing books.|$|E

5|$|The clubs {{had also}} been paired {{together}} in the fourth round of the FA Cup in February 2003. Paul Scholes and Ruud van Nistelrooy of Manchester United, and Patrick Vieira of Arsenal were all shown yellow cards within the first seven minutes of the match and referee Jeff Winter had to call Vieira and Roy Keane together to calm their teammates down. Keane himself received a yellow card {{in the first half}} and Ryan Giggs missed an open goal from 18yards. Arsenal eventually won the match 2–0 and the result infuriated Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to such an extent that he kicked a boot across the changing <b>room</b> <b>that</b> hit David Beckham above the left eye.|$|E
5|$|The main castle courtyard, {{accessed}} {{through the}} southern gateway, was 120 feet long by 72 feet wide (37 m by 22 m), and was divided from the smaller northern yard by a three-office wing, built around 1716 and renovated in 1761 in a modern, 18th-century style. The office wing held the council <b>room</b> <b>that</b> {{was used for}} interrogating prisoners, the Bastille's library, and servants' quarters. The upper stories included rooms for the senior Bastille staff, and chambers for distinguished prisoners. An elevated building {{on one side of}} the courtyard held the Bastille's archives. A clock was installed by Antoine de Sartine, the lieutenant general of police between 1759 and 1774, on the side of the office wing, depicting two chained prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control <b>room</b> <b>that</b> would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E
