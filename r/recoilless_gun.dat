25|$|A {{recoilless}} rifle (RCLR) or <b>recoilless</b> <b>gun</b> is a lightweight weapon that fires a heavier projectile {{that would be}} impractical to fire from a recoiling weapon of comparable size. Technically, only devices that use a rifled barrel are {{recoilless rifle}}s. Smoothbore variants are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles. The key difference from rocket launchers (whether man-portable or not) is that the projectile of the recoilless rifle has no propulsion of its own - once out of the rifle, it does not accelerate further, like a missile or rocket would. Normally used for anti-tank roles, the first effective system of this kind was developed during World War II by William Kroeger and Clarence Musser.|$|E
25|$|The seaplane, {{manufacturers}} {{serial number}} S.81, was built at Eastchurch and allocated the military serial number 126. S.81 {{was delivered to}} Calshot on 25 May 1914 and accepted by the Navy on 2 June 1914. It had three-bay wings with overhanging upper wings, and was powered by a 160hp (119kW) Gnome rotary engine. It was first fitted with a 1½ pounder (37mm) semi-automatic Vickers quick-firing gun in July 1914. Tests with this gun showed that recoil was severe, with claims that firing the gun would induce a stall. It was fitted {{with a number of}} different guns for trials, testing a six-pounder (57mm) Davis gun (an early <b>recoilless</b> <b>gun)</b> in 1915. In 1915 it had a dynamo and searchlight fitted. No longer needed for trials, it was deleted from the inventory in October 1915.|$|E

At the end of 1933 M. Tukhachevsky suggested equipping some T-26 mod. 1931 tanks with the 76.2mm BPK <b>recoilless</b> <b>gun</b> designed by L.V. Kurchevsky in a right turret to increase firepower. One prototype tank was built in 1934. BPK had a muzzle velocity of [...] and a range of [...] The tank was able to carry 62 4-kg rounds. The test performed on 9 March 1934 demonstrated a significant increase in firepower, but the <b>recoilless</b> <b>gun</b> proved difficult to reload on the move, and the powerful blast projected behind the weapon when fired was dangerous to infantrymen behind the tank. Shortcomings were also observed {{in the design of the}} gun itself, and so the planned rearmament of twin-turreted T-26 tanks with recoilless guns did not take place.|$|E

Further east at Tarat Umm Basis near the Israeli border was the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, which was to give warning of any Israeli attack.|$|R
500|$|However, {{deficiencies}} of the PAVN's armored and heavy artillery forces, essential for attacks on heavily fortified ARVN regimental and divisional base camps, weighed {{heavily on the}} minds of the General Staff planners who drew up the plan presented to the Politburo in October 1974. Much attention was focused on the role ARVN's ammunition shortages played in the collapse of South Vietnam, but it is not known if the PAVN suffered similar shortages. Soviet and Chinese military aid, especially in the category of [...] "offensive weapon" [...] (armor and artillery), declined significantly since the Paris cease-fire. Also, much of PAVN's armor and artillery was in poor condition, and spare parts were in short supply. Most PAVN artillery units, especially in the South, were still equipped only with light mortar, <b>recoilless</b> <b>gun,</b> or single-tube rocket launchers. In the COSVN (Central Office for South Vietnam) area of operations, consisting of the southern half of the country, seven infantry divisions (the 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th) and one corps headquarters (4th Corps) were supported by only five battalions of field artillery, two of which were equipped with captured US-made weapons for which there was little ammunition, and three understrength armored battalions. The PAVN's 2d Corps, with three artillery regiments belonging to its three infantry divisions, a corps artillery brigade, a tank brigade, and a separate armored battalion, could field a grand total of only 89 tanks and armored personnel carrier and 87 towed artillery pieces when it set off to attack Saigon in April 1975.|$|E
2500|$|The Port Victoria Depot's second design, {{designated}} Port Victoria P.V.2 was a floatplane fighter {{intended to}} intercept German Zeppelins. The P.V.2 {{was a small}} single engined biplane, powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four blage propellor. [...] It was of wood and fabric construction, and of sesquiplane configuration, i.e. with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing (both of which used the high-lift wing sections pioneered by the P.V.1). Unusually, the aircraft's wing bracing struts also carried the aircraft's floats, forming a [...] "W" [...] shape when viewed from the front. [...] The upper wing was attached directly {{to the top of}} the fuselage, giving a good field of fire for the intended armament of a single 2-lb Davis gun <b>recoilless</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Though Muslims are {{under-represented}} in the Indian Armed Forces, {{as compared}} to Hindus and Sikhs, several Indian military Muslim personnel have earned gallantry awards and high ranks for exceptional service to the nation. Air Chief Marshal I. H. Latif was Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (India) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and later served as Chief of the Air staff of the Indian Air Force from 1973 to 1976. Air Marshal Jaffar Zaheer (1923-2008) commanded IAF Agra and was decorated for his service during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War, eventually rising {{to the rank of}} air marshal and ending his career as Director-General of Civil Aviation from 1979-1980. Indian Army's Abdul Hamid was posthumously awarded India's highest military decoration, the Param Vir Chakra, for knocking-out seven Pakistani tanks with a <b>recoilless</b> <b>gun</b> during the Battle of Asal Uttar in 1965. Two other Muslims – Brigadier Mohammed Usman and Mohammed Ismail – were awarded Maha Vir Chakra for their actions during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. High ranking Muslims in the Indian Armed Forces include: Lieutenant General Jameel Mahmood (former GOC-in-C Eastern Command of the Indian Army), Lieutenant General Sami Khan (former GoC-in-C, Central Army Command), Lieutenant General Syed Ata Hasnain, Lieutenant General Pattiarimmal Mohamed Hariz (GOC-in-C, Southern Command), [...] Major General Afsir Karim, Major General SM Hasnain, and Major General Mohammed Amin Naik.|$|E
