500|$|The Amador Valley science {{department}} initiated Project Creek Watch in 1994. The project provides {{students with}} resources {{for the long term}} study of Arroyo Valle; these resources include information about the chemistry in the creek, images of the creek, a guide to flora and fauna, and student projects on aquatic species. [...] "The goal is to let kids <b>realize</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a number of different physical and biological components that allow these organisms (in the creek) to coexist," [...] said Eric Thiel, an Amador Valley Biology teacher and a co-founder of the project.

[...] In 1999, the project received a Golden Bell Award for excellence in education from the California School Boards Association. Research projects about the creek and other topics have won first place awards at the Tri-Valley Science and Engineering Fair. In 2001, Thiel and the school received a National Semiconductor [...] "Internet Innovator Award" [...] for the Project Creek Watch website.|$|E

5000|$|A {{reported}} {{concern has}} been the emergence of YouTube videos showing alleged salvia users laughing uncontrollably, apparently unable to perform simple tasks or to communicate.

5000|$|Astfgl is a Demon Lord, {{appearing}} in Eric. At {{the start of}} the book he has been made King of Hell, and his modern, go-ahead attitude is driving the other demons to distraction. In particular, Astfgl believes demons should operate Hell and extend themselves to the Discworld by creating such instances of extreme and inescapable boredom that the human brain turns to mush and the condemned souls <b>realize</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> worse things than eternal pain (particularly since they don't even have bodies any more and hence can't actually feel pain unless they want to). By the end, thanks to the machinations of his more old-fashioned rival Vassenego, he is [...] "promoted" [...] to Life President of Hell, a job that consists of writing [...] "policy statements" [...] while Vassenego rules in his stead.|$|E

While the state has legalized gay marriage, Champion pointed out churches in the state are not required to recognize or perform them. “I do <b>realize</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some faith leaders that may not agree with performing same-sex unions, however they are not obliged to do so.” [...] In 2011 his parish of Montrose, New York began to offer weddings to same-sex couples.|$|E
5000|$|Irons had a much-publicized, and, {{according}} to him, over-hyped, rivalry with fellow professional surfer Kelly Slater.

Best competitive, best free surfer, you name it, and to have my name put next to his everywhere really is flattering. He's the Michael Jordan of our sport. Kelly knows how I feel about him. Despite all the media hype {{that comes out of}} a rivalry there's a lot of respect given both ways. People don't <b>realize</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> times when we hang out.

50|$|Tsukasa is {{the protagonist}} {{character}} {{of the story and}} plays a Wavemaster. At the start of the series he is seen waking up to find himself trapped in The World, unable to log out. He is initially depicted as a cynical introvert who tends to avoid others as much as possible, but his character development shows him growing to <b>realize</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> people who care about him. One of these people is Subaru, a female Heavy Axeman introduced {{as the leader of the}} Crimson Knights, a player organization designed to fight injustice (such as player killing) in The World. Most of the time Subaru is the only character preventing the Crimson Knights from running wild; she knows that they must be restrained from abusing their power. She eventually joins in the search of a way to help Tsukasa, and builds a close relationship with him.|$|E
50|$|Despite Marvel's sacrifice, {{most of the}} metahumans are obliterated in the explosion. Superman is unharmed, {{but does}} not <b>realize</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> any other survivors. Enraged at the {{tremendous}} loss of life, Superman flies to the U.N. Building and threatens to bring it down atop the delegates as punishment for the massacre. The surviving metahumans arrive, but Norman McCay {{is the one who}} talks him down, pointing out how his appearance and behavior are exactly the sort of reasons that normal humans fear the superpowered. Superman immediately ceases his rampage. He is handed Captain Marvel's cape, and tells the U.N. that he will use his wisdom to guide, rather than lead, humankind. Superman ties Captain Marvel's cape to a flagpole and raises it among the flags of the member nations of the U.N., suggesting that this role of guidance will be more political and global in nature than the classic crime-busting vigilantism of the past.|$|E
