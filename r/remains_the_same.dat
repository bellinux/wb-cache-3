5|$|Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, {{the band}} {{completed}} the concert film The Song <b>Remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>Same</b> {{and the accompanying}} soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.|$|E
5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> colour. Thus, he observed that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are first}} {{brought to the}} options screen, where the {{starting}} level, game speed, and music can be chosen. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three-game speed options change how fast the capsules fall within the bottle. The player's score is {{based solely on the}} elimination of viruses and the chosen game speed, with bonus points for clearing more than 1 in a single line. After level 20 you can still accumulate points but the number of viruses to clear <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> or increases.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in Summer Days, {{the story}} in Cross Days is not rewritten as a {{spin-off}} of the original story, but occurs during the events of it, making the game a parallel series to School Days. As such, the undisclosed location of the story <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> with focus being around the school. All signature characters and their established relationships appear in the game, with six new cast members.|$|E
5|$|Artemis Fowl: The Graphic Novel is {{a graphic}} novel {{based on the}} book. Written by Colfer and adapted by Andrew Donkin, the graphic novel was {{released}} on 2 October 2007. The plot <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the book's except some minor details. Some characters' appearances differed from their description in the book; Holly Short's hair is longer than described {{in the book and}} a darker brown, as opposed to the reddish brown described in the book. Haven City's roof is stalactites and rock as opposed to the computer-generated sky described by the book. The graphic novel does not contain many word balloons, showing each character's story in first-person. Graphic novels for subsequent books in the series were released in 2009, 2013, and 2014.|$|E

5|$|Houses of the Holy topped charts worldwide, and the band's {{subsequent}} concert tour of North America in 1973 broke {{records for}} attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record {{set by the}} Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (The Song <b>Remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>Same)</b> was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts {{was stolen from a}} safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Now in the Erie County town of Wales, NY78 changes monikers from Main Street to Strykersville Road, {{paralleling}} Buffalo Creek northwest {{through the}} rural section of Wales. A short distance northwest, NY78 intersects with CR175 (Center Line Road), which {{connects to the}} Wyoming County line a short distance east. For a short distance after the intersection, the two routes parallel, with NY78 bypassing the hamlet of Wales Hollow and intersecting with the northern terminus of CR387 (East Creek Road). Still known as Strykersville Road, NY78 parallels Buffalo Creek into the southern terminus of CR385 (Schang Road). The two-lane rural roadway <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for several miles to the northwest, crossing an intersection with CR382 (Hunters Creek Road).|$|E
5|$|The theatre {{became part}} of the West End theatre scene and still stages popular musical {{productions}}. Later long runs at the theatre include productions of A Chorus Line (1976–1979), 42nd Street (1984–1989), Miss Saigon (1989–1999, the theatre's longest-running show), The Producers (2004–2007), an original musical, The Lord of the Rings (2007–2008), Oliver! (2009–2011) and Shrek the Musical (2011–2013). Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Musical played from 2013 through January 2017. The Drury Lane is owned and managed by Really Useful Theatres, owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The seating plan for the theatre <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and the auditorium {{is still one of the}} largest in London's West End. The building was Grade I listed in February 1958. It is one of the 40 theatres featured in the 2012 DVD documentary series Great West End Theatres, presented by Donald Sinden.|$|E

5|$|Led Zeppelin's {{untitled}} fourth album, {{often called}} Led Zeppelin IV and released on 8 November 1971, is their most commercially successful album. It received a 23 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA, the third-highest of all albums. The band's fifth album, Houses of the Holy, {{was released in}} 1973. Again a transatlantic chart-topper, it has received an 11 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA. In 1974, the band {{set up their own}} vanity label, Swan Song Records, which would release the rest of Led Zeppelin's studio albums. The first was the 1975 double album Physical Graffiti, which has received a 16 times platinum certification from RIAA. However, Zeppelin's seventh album, Presence (1976), did not perform as well as their previous releases, receiving a triple Platinum certification from RIAA. On 20 October 1976 Led Zeppelin released their first concert film The Song <b>Remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>Same.</b> The recording of the film took place during three nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City, during the band's 1973 concert tour of the United States. The band's eighth album, In Through the Out Door, received a sextuple platinum certification. This was the last album released by the band before Bonham died of alcohol intoxication in 1980; Led Zeppelin disbanded immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{the game}} <b>remains</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> from its predecessor: {{complete}} increasingly difficult challenges {{to move on to}} the next race. The difficulty level is changed by increasing the top speed of the craft, through four different classes (Vector, Venom, Rapier and Phantom). The number of laps needed to complete a race also increased with each new class. Victory in the challenge modes is the game's ultimate accomplishment. These modes are similar to a championship where players have to race every track to become champion; however, rather than tallying up points, Challenge mode takes a very single player-centric approach by only allowing progress to the next track by coming in first on the current track. Players can lose the mode by losing all three lives, which are lost by finishing a race in worse than third position. By winning all the races, the player is crowned champion and given access to faster modes, new tracks and ultimately the Piranha craft.|$|E
