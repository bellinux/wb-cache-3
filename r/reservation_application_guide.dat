40|$|Abstract—New e-Science and Grid {{applications}} {{require the}} coordination of geographically distributed scientific instruments along with data and computing resources. Due {{to the quality of}} service (QoS) requirements of these applications, these distributed resources can be connected by a wavelength-routed optical network allowing each application to get dedicated bandwidth. These networks are referred to as LambdaGrids. One important service provided in these networks is advance <b>reservation.</b> <b>Applications</b> need to coordinate the use of both grid resources and the network. Advance <b>reservation</b> allows these <b>applications</b> to reserve bandwidth in-advance to guarantee availability. In this article, we discuss different networks and frameworks that support advance reservation of bandwidth. We will discuss the general architecture of each network and the type of advance reservation services supported. Index Terms—advance reservation, scheduled demands, WDM, wavelength-routed, RWA, testbed, and frameworks...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to provide a}} Joint Deployable Intelligence Support System (JDISS) Communication and Imagery <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> for New Users. These two applications, together, are the core of the JDISS program. Both applications were examined to identify functions and processes that are difficult to understand as well as functions and processes that lack sufficient instructions for new users. The supporting JDISS Desktop and Utilities applications were added to provide the knowledge base required for the new user to use the <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> as a stand-alone document. Other JDISS applications, such as Office Tools, E-mail, Intelink, etc., are not included due, in part, to a common thread with other programs that the new user should already be familiar with, but mostly due to the adequate help instructions readily available within the JDISS main desktop help function. The JDISS program was developed to ensure that each of the U. S. Services and Agencies had an integrated intelligence system, and one that would provide a common data standard permitting interoperability both intra-service and inter- service. The Joint Staff, Director of Intelligence (J 2), has highlighted JDISS in joint doctrine as the principal intelligence component for interoperability (JBOC, 1996). Therefore, this detailed, step-by-step JDISS Communication and Imagery <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> for New Users was developed and designed to help future JDISS users worldwide.
