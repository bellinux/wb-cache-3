30|$|During {{the last}} two decades the area of {{socially}} responsible investments (SRI) has grown substantially. Between 1995 and 2012 SRI assets in the US rose more than 480  % to $ 3.74 trillion in 2012 (Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (2013)). The German market grew about 9  % with respect to 2012 values. In 2013 it is estimated to have a value of € 79.9 billion (FNG (2014)). One possibility for private investors to participate in the SRI market is to invest in socially responsible (SR) funds. According to the FNG (2014), € 12.7 billion are invested in roughly 300 SR retail funds that are available in Germany. Currently, this corresponds to 1.8  % of the total volume of the German mutual <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> market. Therefore, it has great potential to grow strongly in the following years, especially when Germany is compared to The Netherlands, the European frontrunner, where SR retail funds amount almost to a total of 15.4  % of the volume of the Dutch mutual <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> market (see Vigeo Rating (2013)). SR funds in Germany mostly practice negative screening and/or follow a best in class investment approach (see FNG (2014)). When the performance of SR and conventional retail funds domiciled in Germany are compared, no significant underperformance of SR funds can be found (Cortez et al. 2009, 2012; Renneboog et al. 2008; Kreander et al. 2005; Bauer et al. 2005; Schröder 2004; Kreander et al. 2002)). Globally, there are more than 100 studies concerning the performance of SR funds (e.g., Chegut et al. 2011; Rathner 2013; von Wallis and Klein 2014). Capelle-Blancard and Monjon (2012) point out that “maybe too much {{attention has been paid to}} this issue”. Therefore, we want to add to the “few studies [which] examine the aspirations of SRI investors”.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of Australian retail and {{wholesale}} superannuation funds to proxy for choice and limited choice alternatives, respectively, we investigate {{the costs and benefits}} of providing choice to investors. We find that investors who have choice don 2 ̆ 7 t respond to fees. Also, loads - typical of the choice environment - are likely to be a dead-weight loss borne by investors. Employees who involuntarily contribute to (employer) funds, tend to pay the lowest fees. Given these results, the advantages of choice become questionable.

The analysis of flows provides insight into why choice funds do not perform better than limited choice funds. Investors are not responding to historical performance as predicted...|$|E
40|$|Within {{this study}} we propose {{different}} measures to prove the influence of prior <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> performance on fund flows.

Moreover, it seems likely that investors react faster to market signals by withdrawing their shares in crisis situations than in previous decades that might be due to lower cost of information. Our findings can serve as a warning signal for policy-makers, regulatory authorities and the fund industry to establish a strong regulatory framework to prevent liquidity shortages of retail funds...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the often-overlooked managed fund fee that is incurred when investors enter and exit managed fund products. The present paper documents that transaction costs for investors, {{measured by the}} application-redemption spread, are above stock market brokerage rates although they have declined since 1995. The study analyses the relationship between this transaction fee and several variables. In summary, <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> transaction costs are positively related to retail funds' assets under management, whilst this relationship is negative for larger wholesale funds, consistent with economies of scale. Direct entry and exit fees and initial commissions are positively related to transaction costs which {{raises the possibility that}} the commissions are used to levy soft-dollar payments. The paper also documents a relationship between transaction costs and fund flows which differs between retail and wholesale funds. Overall, the findings are consistent with the proposition that the various fees are used by managers as interchangeable and the different fee regimes reflect different products and markets.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays in corporate finance and capital markets. The first chapter estimates the effect of competition from low-cost index funds on fees in the money management industry. A difference-in-differences analysis exploiting the staggered entry of index funds finds that while actively managed funds sold directly to retail investors reduce fees by six percent, those sold through brokers increase fees by four percent. Additionally, actively managed funds, especially closet indexers, shift away from holding the index portfolio. The paper proposes a price-discrimination model to illustrate {{that the effect of}} low-cost passive fund competition depends on market segmentation. Beyond the price competition effect, the entry creates a selection effect that isolates the least-price-sensitive investors in the broker channel and results in a price increase for this group. Repeating the study using the entry of exchange-traded funds reveals similar but stronger finding. Overall, the results shed light on why aggregate mutual fund fees decline slowly despite increased competition from lower-cost passive alternatives. The second chapter, joint with Jean-Noel Barrot, examines the effects of imperfect investor risk adjustment on the behavior of mutual fund managers. We exploit a natural experiment when a major fund rating company changed its rating methodology. While in the old system, all equity funds were compared with one another in one pool, in the new algorithm, funds become compared within narrow peer groups. This algorithm revision increases the ability of retail investor to compare funds based on risk-adjusted returns, and it has an important impact on the fund mangers' compensation. The sensitivity of <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> flows to systematic returns is eliminated. Using institutional funds as a control for retail funds in a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that this revision reduces fund managers risk taking behavior, in particular for funds in the categories that had biased low ratings ex-ante. The third chapter, joint with Carola Frydman and Eric Hilt, documents the dividend policy of firms in the United States during the first three decades of the twentieth century. This period features severe information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders, while other factors that could affect the payout policy were relatively muted. In the years surrounding World War I, industrial firms increased their payout ratios and dividends became less sticky. The new industrial firms listed on the NYSE in the 1920 s had the best fit with the Lintner (1956) model and these firms refrained from committing to sticky dividend policy. Consistent with the asymmetric information theory, the market reacted positively to dividend increase announcements, especially to those made by the new industrials, and reacted negatively to dividend cuts.

40|$|Some {{investment}} advisors offer multiple {{versions of}} a fund with the same manager and highly correlated returns.

We demonstrate that institutional twin investors are more sensitive to high fees and poor risk-adjusted performance than retail investors. Using a matched sample of retail and institutional twin funds, we analyze whether the difference in sensitivities can help explain the better performance by focusing on changes to fees and portfolio composition of <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> after {{the creation of an}} institutional twin. We find that after the institutional twin is created, expenses decrease and measures of managerial effort increase, consistent with the reduction of agency problems from greater monitoring.
