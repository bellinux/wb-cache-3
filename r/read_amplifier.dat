The object of the invention is to enable extensive influencing of the brightness and of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the organic light-emitting diodes. With the circuit arrangement according to the invention, each organic light-emitting diode (5) can be driven by means of a storage circuit (10), a <b>read</b> <b>amplifier</b> (20) and a driver circuit (30). The driver circuit is formed by at least three series-connected transistors (1 - 3) and a further output transistor (4), the drain of which is connected to the anode of the respective organic light-emitting diode. In this case, a constant electrical operating voltage LVDD is applied to the source of the transistor (1) acting as driver, and a further likewise constant electrical operating voltage VDrive is applied to the gate of said transistor.

40|$|We have numerically {{studied the}} static and dynamic {{behavior}} of a three terminal vortex-flow transistor based on a parallel array of Josephson junctions. We explicitly show advantages and disadvantages for different device geometric configurations, systematically changing the symmetry of the bias-current distribution. Using parameters typical of high-temperature superconducting junctions at 77 K, we have analysed for each configuration the dependence of the critical current on the control current, and the voltage-current curves. We have calculated gain and transresistance for different bias conditions, and explained the numerical results {{in terms of the}} vortex dynamics in the array.

30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the concept of}} a dust monitor using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics with a large detection area. Its potential as a dust detector is experimentally demonstrated. The dust monitor has a small volume compared to an impact ionization detector with the same detection area, due to the PZT sensor. The PZT sensor, as a traditional device for the in-situ observation of hypervelocity dust particles, has been used for momentum measurement. The hypervelocity impact signals of PZT sensors are typically <b>read</b> by charge-sensitive <b>amplifiers.</b> Instead, we suggest a new method that a current-to-voltage converting amplifier is useful for interpreting the impact signal of a PZT sensor arising from dust particles down to 0.5 μm in radius. We propose that datasets of dust impacts can be obtained with a higher statistical accuracy, if the new method is applied to instruments on forthcoming interplanetary-space-cruising spacecrafts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{international}} standard IEEE 1451. 4 [1] {{is the basis}} for transducer electronic data sheets (TEDS), where information related to the transducer like serial number or nominal sensitivity is stored into a chip inside the transducer. For bridge type sensors, with a novel circuit (patent pending [2]) it is possible to read the TEDS information for 6 -wire bridge sensors without additional wires by using the sense lines. The paper shows the investigations of the influence of TEDS on measurement results. Voltage ratio calibrations with TEDS between measuring amplifier and calibration unit had been carried out at different carrier frequencies. Verification measurements with the TEDS chip built into a force transducer checked for the technical specifications e. g. temperature behavior of the nominal sensitivity. Additional investigations focus on different linearization methods checked with force and voltage ratio calibrations. With force calibration according to ISO 376 a 3 rd degree polynomial equation is calculated from the calibration results. With a new kind of amplifier it is possible to store the coefficients of this polynomial equation and make an online calculation. The results of the measurements when using TEDS to store the coefficients and <b>read</b> into the <b>amplifier</b> are presented...|$|R
50|$|Voltage {{and current}} errors: SEV-c {{circuitry}} does not actually measure the voltage {{of the cell}} being clamped (as does a two-electrode clamp). The patch-clamp amplifier is like a two-electrode clamp, except the voltage measuring and current passing circuits are connected (in the two-electrode clamp, they are connected through the cell). The electrode {{is attached to a}} wire that contacts the current/voltage loop inside the amplifier. Thus, the electrode has only an indirect influence on the feedback circuit. The <b>amplifier</b> <b>reads</b> only the voltage {{at the top of the}} electrode, and feeds back current to compensate. But, if the electrode is an imperfect conductor, the clamp circuity has only a distorted view of the membrane potential. Likewise, when the circuit passes back current to compensate for that (distorted) voltage, the current will be distorted by the electrode before it reaches the cell. To compensate for this, the electrophysiologist uses the lowest resistance electrode possible, makes sure that the electrode characteristics do not change during an experiment (so the errors will be constant), and avoids recording currents with kinetics likely to be too fast for the clamp to follow accurately. The accuracy of SEV-c goes up the slower and smaller are the voltage changes it is trying to clamp.|$|R
40|$|How to Read this Document: This {{document}} combines {{two senior}} project reports. The first senior project documents designing a class AB RF amplifier. The second, discusses {{the design and}} implementation of a software Costas loop for audio frequencies. The first report begins on the next page, while the Costas loop report starts on page 24. The two reports are orthogonal from one another. It is not a prerequisite to <b>read</b> the RF <b>amplifier</b> report before <b>reading</b> the Costas loop report. This document is merely two reports combined into one document. The second report, about the Costas loop, was written as a replacement to the first. However, it was decided, to include the first senior project, {{in order to make}} available information and insights that were encountered during the RF amplifier design and construction process, that someone else might find helpful. RF Amplifier Abstract: In this senior project, a 4 W 2. 4 GHz power amplifier (PA) is designed as an entry for IEEE s high frequency amplifier design contest. The design uses Cree s CGH 40010 F Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistor, because it is capable of outputting 10 W up to 6 GHz. Cree also provides simulation models for the Agilent Design System (ADS) the RF design software used to design this PA. In order to maximize both efficiency and linearity, the PA is class AB biased. Matching networks are implemented on FR 4 substrate. Tuning the gate voltage on the final design minimizes intermodulation distortion (IMD) and improves linearity. The final design exhibits 40 % power added efficiency (PAE) and greater than 20 dBc IMD within a 5 MHz bandwidth. Software Costas Loop Abstract: A Costas loop is implemented in software with Python. A small-signal linear model is derived in order to determine loop stability. An interactive program was developed to tune loop parameters in order to obtain critically damped step response. The effect of lowpass filter phase delay on stability is discussed...|$|R
30|$|Piezoelectric {{crystals}} (PZCs) {{have been}} widely used as supersonic transducers and impact sensors for the in-situ observation of cosmic dust. The response of a PZC sensor is related to the momentum of a dust particle at low speed (v < 1 km/s) and includes the term v 2 due to the recoil from impact ejecta. In practice, the contribution from the recoil is negligible in comparison with the measurement precision (Auer, 2001). The advantages of PZC sensors are mechanical simplicity and stiffness, unnecessity of a required bias voltage, and high temperature and radiation tolerance. Thus, PZC sensors have been used for in-situ dust observations. Thick PZC and thin (typically 0.1 mm) piezoelectric diaphragms were employed on spacecraft in the early 1970 s (Auer, 2001). As part of the Dust Impact Detection System (DIDSY), several PZCs were attached to the dust shields of the Giotto spacecraft launched to study the comet Hal-ley (McDonnel et al., 1986). The Mercury dust monitor (MDM) will be onboard the BepiColombo/Mercury mag-netosphere orbiter (MMO) to be launched in 2014 (Nogami et al., 2010). MDM was proposed to investigate the dust environment around Mercury. Hence, PZC sensors constructed of PZT have been adopted because of their high temperature and radiation tolerance, in addition to a high piezoelectric constant. Four square plates of PZT, each 40 mm× 40 mm × 2 mm, will be installed on a side panel of the MMO. The PZT sensors can easily detect vibrations from origins other than impacts on the detection area. Concerning true-false discrimination, therefore, it is necessary to examine the waveforms of the signals <b>read</b> by an <b>amplifier.</b> For the BepiColombo/MDM, the signal waveform from the sensors will be digitalized by a flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC), with a sampling rate of 20 MHz, in onboard electronics. Because true dust impact events, and fake events that are likely to be generated by dust impact in ambient instruments or by thermal strain, are not distinguished onboard, the waveform will be downlinked to the ground. In general, severe limitations exist in available resources such as power consumption and communication rate in space mission; therefore, power consumption and telemetry for recording and downloading the waveform should be conserved. This is especially critical if a number of signal channels need to be read as a result of numerous PZT sensors used to enlarge sensitive areas for cosmic dust observation. In previous studies of piezoelectric dust sensors, responses of the sensor have been measured in charge or voltage by charge-sensitive or voltage amplifiers for observing momentum transfer during the impact. Here, we suggest that the signals from the PZT sensor should be read in a current mode by the amplifier, which would enhance the function of the PZT sensor. In fact, the determination of momentum, size, and speed for hypervelocity micropar-ticles, and true-false discrimination, may be facilitated.|$|R
40|$|Ultra Low Energy SRAM Design for Computation Intensive Wireless Sensor NodesThe {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} used for medical diagnosis is transforming the health care. In order to further extend their capabilities, sensor nodes {{have to be very}} energy efficient, firstly because of the limited battery and energy scavenged capacity. Secondly because of the heat dissipation limit (medical standards). The computation intensive wireless sensor nodes ensure energy efficiency by reducing the amount of raw data transmission. The computation intensive sensor nodes with the increased memory sizes significantly reduce the requirement of data transmission. This trade off between raw data transmission and on senor computation places a higher burden on energy efficient computation. The on-chip SRAM cache consumes a major proportion of the total dynamic energy per operation for computation intensive sensor nodes. This work presents innovative, ultra low energy SRAMs which prioritize energy efficiency over area overhead for a given target performance. The variability induced challenges in deep sub micron technologies are also addressed in this work. The circuit design techniques proposed improve the operating margins of SRAM without increasing the energy consumption. This work has been validated with two silicon prototypes of embedded SRAM module. The first prototype (IM_ 90) of 128 kbit 6 T SRAM in 90 nm LP CMOS consumes 4. 4 pJ/access while operating at 80 MHz. The variability resilient and low power techniques featured in IM_ 90 include innovation in the local architecture with the use of local read/write assist circuitry. The energy efficient hierarchical bit-lines structure includes low swing global bit-lines and VDD/ 2 pre-charged short local bit-lines. The innovative Multi-Sized SA redundancy (MS-SA-R) calibration technique for the global <b>read</b> sense <b>amplifiers</b> of the SRAM not only adds to the variability resilience but also yields maximum energy reduction compared with existing calibration techniques. The second prototype (IM_ 65) further validates the effectiveness of the circuit design techniques in reducing the energy consumption of SRAM memories. The main design target is to reduce the energy consumption and to mitigate the impact of increasing variability for the advance sub nanometric technology nodes. A 64 kbit embedded SRAM in 65 nm LP CMOS (IM_ 65) sets a record low energy consumption of 2. 65 pJ/access at 90 MHz. The design innovations featured are. Reduced swing dual Vt 8 T SRAM cell mitigates leakage by 7 x. Write-ability is improved by the Mimicked Negative Bit-line technique, which reduces write failures by 1000 x. Theenergy consumption is further reduced by using a novel Charge Limited Sequential sense amplifier, which achieves a &# 963;Voffset of 14 mV with energy consumption of only 11 fJ/decision, without requiring post-silicon tuning.
