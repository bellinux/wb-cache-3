50|$|The {{next three}} weeks are spent {{enduring}} a relentless storm. Morale drops {{after a series of}} misfortunes, but the crew is cheered temporarily by a chance encounter with Thomsen's boat. Shortly after the storm ends, the boat encounters a British convoy and quickly launches four torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below the submarine's <b>rated</b> <b>limit.</b> During the ensuing depth-charge attack, the chief mechanic, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage, but is eventually able to safely surface in darkness. An enemy tanker remains afloat and on fire, so they torpedo the ship, only to realize that there are still sailors aboard; they watch in horror as the sailors leap overboard and swim towards them. Unable to accommodate prisoners, the captain orders the boat away.|$|E
40|$|Growing {{need for}} {{application}} of electronics at temperatures beyond their <b>rated</b> <b>limit,</b> (usually > 150 °C) and the non availability of high temperature compatible electronics necessitates thermal management solutions {{that should be}} compact, scalable, reliable {{and be able to}} work in environments characterized by high temperature (150 - 250 °C), mechanical shock and vibrations. In this backdrop the proposed research aims at realization of an adsorption cooling system for evaporator temperatures in the range of 140 °C- 150 °C, and condenser temperature in the range of 160 °C- 200 °C. Adsorption cooling systems have few moving parts (hence less maintenance issues), and the use of Thermo-Electric (TE) devices to regenerate heat of adsorption in between adsorbent beds enhances the compactness and efficiency of the overall 'ThermoElectric-Adsorption' (TEA) system. The work presented identifies the challenges involved and respective solutions for high temperature application. An experimental set up was fabricated to demonstrate system operation and mathematical models developed to benchmark experimental results. Also, {{it should be noted that}} TEA system comprises TE and adsorption chillers. A TE device can be a compact cooler in its own right. Hence a comparison of the performance of TEA and TE cooling systems has also been presented. Ph. D.

40|$|AbstractThe authors {{present a}} case {{report of a}} patient with an {{implanted}} VDD pacemaker whose postoperative ECG revealed sinus bradycardia, showing the heart rate remarkably lower than the programmed lower <b>rate</b> <b>limit.</b> Upon assessing some pacemaker manufacturers' mechanisms to set the lower <b>rate</b> <b>limit</b> in VDD mode, {{it was found that}} they can be classified into four types. The mechanisms are based on keeping atrioventricular (AV) synchronous pacing in VDD mode or maintaining the lower <b>rate</b> <b>limit</b> in VVI mode. AV synchronous pacing results in producing an actual heart rate which is lower than the programmed lower <b>rate</b> <b>limit.</b> The classification also depends on whether the pacemakers are operating on either atrial-based or ventricular-based lower rate timing. Therefore, the actual heart rate can be lower than the programmed lower <b>rate</b> <b>limit,</b> depending on the VDD pacemaker model...|$|R

Several proposals of <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> techniques {{have appeared in}} the literature, each with a different take on the impetus behind <b>rate</b> <b>limiting.</b> This paper presents an empirical analysis on different <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> schemes using real traffic and attack traces from a sizable network. In the analysis we isolate and investigate the impact of the critical parameters for each scheme and seek to understand how these parameters might be set in realistic network settings. Analysis shows that using DNS-based <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> has substantially lower error rates than schemes based on other traffic statistics. The analysis additionally brings to light a number of issues with respect to <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> at large.

At first, a general survey about the problem is given. The state-of-the-art regarding the methods for prediction and alleviation of potential problems are presented. The established frequency domain criteria based on linear aircraft models are investigated.

40|$|County {{governments in}} Pennsylvania face {{non-binding}} limits {{on their property}} tax rates. These are considered non-binding {{because they do not}} place a limit on tax levies or expenditures. Assuming local public officials have monopoly power, tax <b>rate</b> <b>limits</b> can be circumvented by reassessing the property tax base. A two-stage process was hypothesized in which the probability of reaching tax <b>rate</b> <b>limits</b> first was determined and the probability of reassessment then was determined. The effect of budget maximizing government officials at each stage was tested for 66 Pennsylvania counties over the 1970 - 1995 period. The empirical results showed that variables associated with budget maximizing behaviour influenced the choice in each stage. Public expenditure growth increased the probability of reaching the tax <b>rate</b> <b>limit</b> in the first stage while reaching the tax <b>rate</b> <b>limit</b> increased the probability of reassessment in the second stage.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM—There {{has been}} no {{consistent}} pattern reported on how mortality for uveal melanoma varies with age. This information can be useful to model {{the complexity of the}} disease. The authors have examined ocular cancer trends, as an indirect measure for uveal melanoma mortality, to see how rates vary with age and to compare the results with their other studies on predicting metastatic disease.  METHODS—Age specific mortality was examined for England and Wales, the USA, and Canada. A log-log model was fitted to the data. The slopes of the log-log plots were used as measure of disease complexity and compared with the results of previous work on predicting metastatic disease.  RESULTS—The log-log model provided a good fit for the US and Canadian data, but the observed rates deviated for England and Wales among people over the age of 65  years. The log-log model for mortality data suggests that the underlying process depends upon four <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> steps, while a similar model for the incidence data suggests between three and four <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> steps. Further analysis of previous data on predicting metastatic disease on the basis of tumour size and blood vessel density would indicate a single <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> step between developing the primary tumour and developing metastatic disease.  CONCLUSIONS—There is significant underreporting or underdiagnosis of ocular melanoma for England and Wales in those over the age of 65  years. In those under the age of 65, a model is presented for ocular melanoma oncogenesis requiring three <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> steps to develop the primary tumour and a fourth <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> step to develop metastatic disease. The three steps in the generation of the primary tumour involve two key processes—namely, growth and angiogenesis within the primary tumour. The step from development of the primary to development of metastatic disease is likely to involve a single <b>rate</b> <b>limiting</b> process. ...|$|R
