Ecosystem populations of aerobic organisms increase until oxygen transfer limitations of the secondary treatment bioreactor are reached. Secondary treatment ecosystem populations may shift toward species with lower oxygen requirements, but failure of those species to use some food sources may produce higher effluent BOD concentrations. More extreme increases in BOD concentrations may drop oxygen concentrations before the secondary treatment ecosystem population can adjust, and cause an abrupt population decrease among important species.

Besides, in absence of adequate water resources, desalination of brackish and saline waters have been used to supply potable water. Freezing process is one of the methods which can be used to desalinate saline waters. The aim {{of this study was to}} survey freezing process to produce potable water from saline water of Persian Gulf shores. "nMaterials and Methods: This study was conducted in lab-scale by using indirect contact freezing. Three samples of 50 liter were provided from Bushehr shores. The implemented process steps were freezing (crystallization), separation of crystals, surface washing, and thawing. Freezing of the samples (each in 0. 5 liter containers) were performed by a refrigerator at - 20 °C and 0. 1 KW/h energy consumption. Results: The <b>removal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of TDS in the first, second, and third samples by first freezing process were 56, 56, and 51 percent, respectively. Moreover, the <b>removal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> by EC were 42, 44, and 40 percent, respectively.
