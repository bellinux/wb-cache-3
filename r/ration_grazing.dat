40|$|The milking robot is {{more than}} a tool to relieve the farmer of the {{substantial}} daily work associated with the milking process. Current technologies offer the possibility of increasing production efficiency by combining individual milking and feeding strategies. Although the milking robot can be integrated into any type of dairy its use differs from one dairy to another. To benefit from the milking robot not just as a replacement for a milking parlour but as a management appliance the farmer should first outline his strategic planning according to his needs and available facilities. On the planning horizon, the strategic planning considerations comprise concentrates <b>rationing,</b> <b>grazing</b> (if it exists and with or without indoor forage rationing), herd size and milking frequency, facilities and labour. The strategic planning is implemented and controlled at both operational and performance levels. Continuous evaluation of the cows' performance is incorporated into a group or individual management regime. The on-line control ensures that the planned regime is implemented. The implementation of the planned regime and its control in the milking robot dairy is possible using three management functions: milking frequency, individual concentrates allocation and cow-traffic. The farmer selects his goals according to his operational methods. The degree of system management automation and individuality will determine these methods. The dairy can operate from the basic level of replacing the milkers only, up to a fully-automatic controlled daily milking, feeding and cow traffic routine with minimal involvement of the farmer...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{aimed to}} individuate the dietary factors affecting the milk urea nitrogen (MUN) concentration in goats grazing herbaceous pasture and, particularly, {{to verify the}} relationship linking the diet crude protein (CP) content to MUN. A total of 205 individual observations regarding dietary and milk variables of 37 Girgentana goats involved in two experiments were used. Goats, averaging 154 ± 14 days in milk and 38. 1 ± 5. 4 kg of live weight, grazed on swards and received 500 g/d of barley meal. Sward biomass, herbage selected by goats and individual milk yield were measured and sampled weekly. The herbage intake and diet digestibility were estimated by the n-alkane method. Milk urea content was determined by an enzymatic method and transformed in MUN (MUN=urea* 0. 4665). The MUN concentration (9. 7 - 35. 4 mg/dl) {{was positively correlated with}} diet CP content (13. 7 - 26. 0 % of dry matter (DM); r= 0. 76; P< 0. 001), pasture allowance (39 - 151 kg DM/goat; r= 0. 42; P< 0. 001), diet net energy for lactation concentration (NEL) (1. 5 - 1. 9 Mcal/kg DM; r= 0. 37; P< 0. 001) and milk yield (320 - 2250 g/d; r= 0. 25; P< 0. 001), and negatively related with NDF (18. 7 - 37. 4 % DM; r=- 0. 69; P< 0. 001) and diet digestibility (72. 6 - 92. 5 %; r=- 0. 33; P< 0. 001). The stepwise selection from dietary variables and milk yield showed dietary CP percentage to be the single variable explaining the most variation in MUN (R 2 = 0. 56; P< 0. 0001). The other variables entering into the model were diet NDF, 3. 5 % fat-corrected milk (FCM), DM intake and NDF intake (total R 2 = 0. 66). Including the CP/NEL and CP/NDF ratios of diet in the stepwise regression model, the CP/NDF ratio alone explained 60. 1 % of MUN variability, followed by barley proportion in the diet, FCM and diet CP concentration, absorbing an extra 4. 6 % of MUN variability. A linear regression, fitting mean feeding treatment per time data of MUN and dietary CP concentration (n= 28) [CP(% of DM) = 6. 91 ± 1. 42 + 0. 61 ± 0. 06 *MUN (mg/dl); R&sup 2;= 0. 79; P< 0. 0001], suggests that MUN could be used for predicting the CP content of the diet, as a tool for developing feeding strategies aimed at balancing the <b>rations</b> of <b>grazing</b> goats through adequate supplementation. Further data from experiments on grazing goats in different environmental conditions are required in order to define a more robust relationship by which to predict the dietary CP content by MUN...|$|R

Supplements included protein meals of varying rumen-degradability (cottonseed meal (CSM) or fishmeal), {{as well as}} ‘energy sources’ comprising grains {{of high and low}} ruminal starch degradability (barley and sorghum) and a highly fermentable sugar source (molasses), with all diets adjusted for rumen-degradable nitrogen and mineral content. Unsupplemented steers gained 0. 08 and 0. 15 kg/day, in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Growth of steers increased linearly with intake of ‘energy source’ supplements in increasing order of molasses, sorghum and barley (all differences P < 0. 05). Steer growth rate also increased linearly with fishmeal, albeit over a narrow intake range (0 – 4. 1 g/kg W. day), whereas the response with CSM was asymptotic, showing a steep response at low intake before levelling at ~ 1. 2 kg/day. All supplement types were associated with a linear reduction in hay intake by the steers (energy substitution) where the reduction was greater (P < 0. 05) for barley and molasses (not different) than for sorghum (P < 0. 05), and for fishmeal compared with CSM (P < 0. 05). In concurrent metabolism studies with the same rations, organic matter digestibility of the total ration (561 – 578 g/kg DM, unsupplemented) was increased linearly by barley and molasses (both P < 0. 05) but was unaffected by CSM and sorghum supplements. The efficiency of microbial protein synthesis in steers increased linearly, from 91 g microbial crude protein/kg digestible organic matter (unsupplemented), in both molasses and CSM-supplemented steers, with the trend for a higher response to molasses (P = 0. 05), and appeared most closely related to digestible organic matter intake.

However, the contribution of sheep to CH 4 emissions in Syria is still unknown. This study was designed to quantify CH 4 emissions and identify possible mitigation strategies for their reduction. Methodology developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was used to estimate CH 4 emissions. A survey was conducted on 64 farms from different locations in Syria in 2009. Data were collected concerning sheep-keeping systems (SKSs), body mass, milk and wool yield, farm locations, feed <b>rations,</b> periods of <b>grazing</b> on the Steppe, the duration of pasturing on agricultural residuals and time periods when sheep were kept in stables. Using a linear statistical model, the influence of SKS, geographical region and sheep body mass on emitted CH 4 were analysed. The results showed that the geographical region, SKS and sheep body mass had significant effects (P< 0. 05) on CH 4 emissions. According to the model, the mean values of estimated CH 4 emissions from extensive, semi-intensive and intensive SKSs were 26 ± 0. 9, 22. 5 ± 1. 3 and 13. 5 ± 1. 7 kg/sheepyear, respectively. In comparing differences between the least square means of CH 4 emissions, the extensive and semi-intensive SKSs produced 92 % and 66 % higher CH 4 emissions compared to intensive SKS. The differences in CH 4 emissions within the distinct SKSs were attributed to dietary composition. Extensive SKS used a less concentrated feeding regime (98 ± 17 day/year) than semi-intensive SKS (114 ± 47 day/year), and intensive SKS employed concentrated feeding year round. Furthermore, it was observed that sheep with the same body mass produced higher CH 4 emissions in extensive SKS than in semi-intensive and intensive SKSs. Moreover, the semi-intensive SKS occupied more natural pastures than extensive SKS, which caused an overuse of the Steppe. Therefore, an effective mitigation strategy involves the use of more digestible feed, which would be accomplished by increasing the quantity of concentrated feed.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the change from a concentrate and silage-based ration (total mixed ration, TMR) to a pasture-based ration, a 10 -wk trial (wk 1 - 10) was performed, including 10 rumen- and duodenum-fistulated German Holstein dairy cows (182 ± 24 d in milk, 23. 5 ± 3. 5 kg of milk/d; mean ± standard deviation). The cows were divided in either a pasture group (PG, n = 5) or a confinement group (CG, n = 5). The CG stayed on a TMR-based ration (35 % corn silage, 35 % grass silage, 30 % concentrate; dry matter basis), whereas the PG was gradually transitioned from a TMR to a pasture-based ration (wk 1 : TMR only; wk 2 : 3 h/d on pasture wk 3 and 4 : 12 h/d on pasture wk 5 - 10 : pasture only). Ruminal pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), NH 3 -N, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were measured in rumen fluid samples collected medially and ventrally on a weekly basis. Ruminal pH was continuously recorded during 1 to 4 consecutive days each week using ruminal pH measuring devices. In wk 1, 5, and 10, rumen contents were evacuated and weighed, papillae were collected from 3 locations in the rumen, and subsequently a VFA absorption test was performed. In the PG, mean rumen pH and molar acetate proportions decreased, and molar butyrate proportions increased continuously {{over the course of the}} trial, which can most likely be ascribed to an increased intake of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates. During the first weeks on a full <b>grazing</b> <b>ration</b> (wk 5 - 7), variation of rumen pH decreased, and in wk 5 a lower rumen content, papillae surface area, and potential for VFA absorption were observed. In wk 8 to 10, variation of rumen pH and total VFA concentrations increased again, and acetate/propionate ratio decreased. In wk- 10 rumen content, papillae area and VFA absorption characteristics similar to initial levels were observed. Although continuous rumen pH assessments and LPS concentrations did not reveal an increased risk for subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) during the adaption period, histopathology of rumen papillae and potential for VFA absorption indicated a possible risk for rumen health. An increased risk for SARA was observed in wk 9 and 10 in the PG, but rumen LPS concentrations and histopathology were not adversely affected. Results of the present study suggest that after behavioral and metabolic adaptation to the transition from a TMR to a pasture-based ration, no adverse effects on rumen morphology and absorption capacity occurred, although rumen pH after adaptation to pasture indicated increased risk of SARA. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the derivation of a mathematical model that adequately describes the intercalving body condition score (BCS) profile in dairy cows and is robust and applicable to different animal cohorts. The data used to generate the function were 75, 352 daily BCS records across 3, 209 lactations in 1, 172 cows from a research herd in New Zealand. Mean daily BCS (scale 1 to 10) across all data were plotted and 4 distinct phases were observed. The functional form used to describe the pattern and quantify its features comprised the sum of the 4 phase functions created from intercepts, rates of change, approximate timing of phase transition points, and the sharpness of these transition points in the BCS profile. The generality and applicability of the described model were tested across substrata of BCS at calving and parity. A second data set consisting of a multiyear study comparing cows fed a total mixed <b>ration</b> (TMR) or <b>grazing</b> fresh pasture was compiled from a different research farm. This data set consisted of 4, 112 BCS records from 211 lactations on 95 cows. The third data set was a collation of data from another multiyear experiment comparing animal performance under different stocking rates. The data set consisted of 12, 414 BCS test-day records on 564 lactations from 287 cows. The presented model is robust and applicable to different animal cohorts, explaining between 29 and 79 % of variation depending on the cohort studied. A notable second period of negative energy balance was evident in all grazing cows during midlactation, irrespective of calving BCS, parity, or stocking rate, but did not appear in cows fed TMR. The amount of BCS lost postcalving and nadir BCS were positively correlated with calving BCS, with fatter cows at calving losing more BCS postcalving but remaining at a greater BCS at nadir. Primiparous cows calved at a greater BCS than multiparous cows, as dictated by management protocols, but they failed to regain BCS postnadir as effectively as their multiparous counterparts. Results may highlight the need for preferential feeding of younger cows during late lactation, at least in grazing systems, to ensure that they achieve the required calving BCS at second calving. Cows receiving TMR lost BCS at a slower rate than cows on pasture but for a longer period; the amount of BCS lost between calving and nadir did not differ between the different feeding treatments. Calving BCS declined with increasing stocking rate, and the rates of both loss and gain were negatively affected by stocking rate. The presented model accurately identified biological attributes of the intercalving BCS profile of different groups of cows...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on pregnant, non-lactating dairy cows to investigate the metabolisable energy (ME) requirements for maintenance and the efficiency with which ME is used for body weight (BW) gain. In the first experiment, 53 non-lactating, pregnant Holstein-Friesian × Jersey cross dairy cows were fed one of three allowances [low: 7. 5 kg,medium: 10. 1 kg, or high: 12. 4 kg of dry matter (DM) /day] of freshly cut autumn pasture for 38 ± 2 days (mean ± SD) in individual stalls to allow the measurement of estimated DM and ME intake daily. Animals were blocked by age (6 ± 2 years), day of gestation (208 ± 17 days), and BW (526 ± 55 kg). Cows on the low, medium, and high allowance treatments consumed 7. 5, 9. 4, and 10. 6 kg of DM/day, and BW gain, including the conceptus, was 0. 2, 0. 6, and 0. 9 kg/day. The ME content of pasture was estimated by wet chemistry from in vitro true digestibility and by near infrared spectroscopy. Total ME requirements for maintenance, pregnancy, and limited activity were 1. 07 MJ ME/kg of measured metabolic BW/day. This is more than 45 % higher than current recommendations. Differences {{may be due to}} an underestimation of ME requirements for maintenance or pregnancy, an overestimation of diet metabolisability, or a combination of these. Further research is necessary to determine the reasons for the greater ME requirements measured in the present study, but the results are important for on-farm decisions regarding feed allocation for nonlactating, pregnant dairy cows. In experiment 2, the amount of ME required for BW gain from pasture and commonly used supplementary feeds was investigated to estimate the efficiency with which ME is used for BW gain (kg). Control cows were offered autumn pasture to estimated maintenance requirements (- 0. 55 MJ ME/kg BW 0. 75), with an additional 20 MJ ME/d allocated for pregnancy and activity. All other cows received the same allowance of autumn pasture (Past) and an additional allowance (2. 5 or 5. 0 kg DM/day) of Past, spring pasture silage (Psil), maize silage (Msil), maize grain (Mgr), or palm kernel expeller (PKE). Regression analyses on BW allowed the determination of ME intake on BW gain for each feed; the kg was estimated from this, assuming each kg of BW contained 25 MJ of net energy. The kg of Past and Msil were 0. 34 and 0. 47, consistent with published literature and the kg of Psil (0. 50) was in line with published values for spring pasture. The greatest kg (0. 61) was for PKE, possibly due to its high fibre and fat content, and the fact that acetate and medium to long chained fatty acids are not substantially used for conceptus metabolism. The kg for Mgr was low (0. 38), possibly because the end products of digestion of starch (i. e. propionate and the hepatic-derived glucose) are used preferentially for conceptus metabolism and less for BW gain, or because the composition of BW gain differed relative to the other treatments. Results confirm differences between feeds in kg when pasture is the base diet, and provide important information for feed budgeting and <b>ration</b> formulation in <b>grazing</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 61 - 66). vii, 66 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmFeed costs {{comprise the}} majority of the total production costs born by livestock producers, particularly cattle. Because the relative costs of feed are so great, a dramatic economic impact can be realized by utilizing the cheapest feeds available in the most efficient manner possible. In order to make efficient use of a feed, however, it is necessary for the producer to be able to predict how an animal or group of animals will respond to a given feed or mixed ration. A common method fur predicting this response is the use of computer models. Computer models meant to predict animal performance have been around fur some time, particularly fur cattle. Currently, these models are an integral component of most operations, in both temperate and tropical regions. However, these models have not been validated fur beef production in many tropical regions. Poor production by cattle in tropical regions, even in developed countries, bas been well-documented (Minson and Mcleod, 1970; Stobbs, 1971). Tropical regions differ from temperate regions in that the forages present are often lower in protein and higher in fiber, due to the higher solar intensity and faster growth rate. Also, nutrients in tropical grasses may not be as available to the animal as the same nutrients in temperate grasses, as the higher fiber concentration may bind more of the nutrients. The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) is a mechanistic, deterministic, and static model based on the principles of rumen function, microbial growth, feed digestion and passage and animal physiology that was developed to predict requirements, feed utilization and nutrient excretion fur dairy and beef cattle. The system was first presented in a series of fuur papers (Fox et al, 1992; Russell et al, 1992; Sniffen et al, 1992; O'Connor et al, 1993) and has since been continually refined (Ainslie et al, 1993; Tylutki et al, 1994; Fox et al, 1995, 1999; Pitt et al, 1996; Tedeschi et al, 2000 a, 2000 b, 2001, 2002 a, 2002 b, 2002 c, 2003). There have been several evaluations of the CNCPS model with animal performance data. Kolver et al (1998) used a total mixed <b>ration</b> (TMR) and <b>grazing</b> dairy cows to evaluate the performance of the CNCPS and found the CNCPS underpredicted energy allowable milk production by 2. 5 % in the animals fed TMR and by 6. 8 % in the animals fed pasture. Dairy replacement heifers have also been used to evaluate the predictions of the CNCPS. Van Amburgh and coworkers (1998) used both the CNCPS and the 1989 Dairy NRC with 273 Holstein replacement heifers. The CNCPS ME allowable ADO accounted for 86 % of the actual ADO. The CNCPS has also been evaluated for tropical cattle production. Lanna et al (1996) measured energy and protein content of empty body weight gain of growing animals and milk production of dual purpose lactating cows. Using actual DMI of feeds that were characterized for carbohydrate content and protein fractions, as well as digestion rates, the CNCPS accounted for 72 % of the variation in live weight gain and 71 % of the variation in milk production. Juarez Lagwtes et al (1999) found that, when feeds are properly characterized, an increase in NDF or a decrease in the rate of digestion of NDF, will affect the prediction of milk production of dual-purpose cows by the CNCPS accordingly. In most tropical areas of the world, particularly in undeveloped countries, the primary source of nutrition fur cattle and other ruminants is forage, which is harvested by the animal as live material, as opposed to feed which is harvested by the farmer and provided to the animal, In these areas it is simply not economically practical to provide any large degree of supplementation to the animals. A similar situation can be found in Hawaii. Although the cattle industry in Hawaii is considered by most to be well developed, because of its geographical isolation the importation and delivery of supplements to the animals is often considered impractical and/or too costly. This is in contrast to more well-developed, temperate regions of the world where supplements can be produced locally or imported at lower cost. This inability to supplement is {{compounded by the fact that}} tropical grasses are primarily < 4 (take in C~ at night), rather than C 3 (take in C~ during the day) plants and, consequently, are often lower in soluble carbohydrates and higher in cell wall and lignin components (Van Soest, 1994). Because of this increase in lignin and cell wall, tropical grasses are generally about 15 % less digestible than temperate forages (Van Soest, 1994). This decrease in digestibility, along with a decrease in intake (INRA [Institut National de 1 a Recherche Agronomique], 1989), can lead to a decrease in nutrients available fur the animal It has been well-documented that animals on tropical grasses typically underperform animals on temperate grasses (Minson and McLeod, 1970; Stobbs, 1971; Kaiser and O'Neill, 1975). In other warm-climate areas, mineral deficiencies have been blamed fur poor production of beef cattle (McDowell and Conrad, 1985). There are extensive records in the literature documenting deficiencies, as well as toxicities, of minerals in both soils and plants (McDowell and Conrad, 1985; McDowell, 1997). Therefore, it is important to be aware of the mineral status of the animals_ Often, only soil and/or plant levels of minerals are assessed in making a decision to supplement, and the level of a mineral in the soil or plant does not necessarily reflect what is available to the animal Additionally, mineral supplements are often expensive and could lead to excess excretion or poor utilization by the animal Therefore, unnecessary supplementation can have a dramatic impact on both economic returns and environmental sustainability, in addition to leading to toxicities. To both ensure adequate nutrition and eliminate unnecessary supplementation, it is necessary to know the levels of minerals present in the forages being grazed and their bioavailabi 1 ity to the animal. Previous in situ tria 1 s show that there are differences in rate and extent of mineral release in the rumen between forages (Emanuele and Staples, 1990; Emanuele et al., 1991). Therefore, it is dangerous to draw general conclusions from limited studies and it becomes necessary to determine the rate and extent to which minerals are released from each of the forages in question. It is also of interest how the rate of overa 11 dry matter disappearance tracks with the rate of macromineral release in the rumen. It may be the case that dry matter disappearance is much more rapid and complete than mineral release. This may provide clues as to where certain minerals are sequestered in the plant. Also, if there is a close relationship, the procedure fur determining dry matter release is easier, takes less time, and is less expensive. The objectives of the research presented here were to: 1. evaluate the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System for use in Hawaii beef production, 2. evaluate how changing body size, body condition, level of intake, and forage composition affects the predictions of the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System, and 3. determine the levels and rates of macrominerals released from tropical forages in the rumen, and their relationship to DM disappearance...|$|R
