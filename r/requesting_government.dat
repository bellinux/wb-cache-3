[...] If the court finds the fugitive to be extraditable, it enters an order of extraditability and certifies the record to the Secretary of State, who decides whether to surrender the fugitive to the <b>requesting</b> <b>government.</b> OIA notifies the foreign government and arranges for the transfer of the fugitive to the agents appointed by the requesting country to receive him or her. Although the order following the extradition hearing is not appealable (by either the fugitive or the government), the fugitive may petition for a writ of habeas corpus as soon as the order is issued.

[...] Staff and consultants of the hospital {{and the chairman of the}} hospice board raised concerns about how a sale to a private firm might affect the charity work of the hospice, which is subsidised by hospital revenues, and the ability of the hospital to operate within moral directives of the Catholic Church. In June 2013 they appealed to Vatican officials to prevent the sale, and Paul Burstow, the member of parliament for Sutton and Cheam, said he would seek to have the Foreign Office direct an embassy official to bring the issue to the Vatican's attention. In November 2013, Burstow presented a petition to Parliament, signed by over 7,000 people, <b>requesting</b> <b>government</b> help in blocking the sale.

5000|$|As the {{conflict}} reached a boiling point, Judge Hastings made the executive decision to fire Hall and move {{all of the}} remaining natives to the Mendocino Reservation, more to save his property than {{for the protection of}} the natives. In June 1859 the “Citizens of Nome Cult Valley”, a group of 39 settlers from Round Valley, petitioned the governor of California, Governor John B. Weller, for help in protecting the settlers from native attacks. This petition, promoted and pushed for by Henley and Judge Hastings, was one of more than a dozen letters and petitions that the white settlers of Round Valley sent to the governor <b>requesting</b> <b>government</b> funding for volunteers who sought to protect white property. Within these petitions, the settlers stated their intentions to remove the natives from Mendocino through a “war of extermination”. Weller turned to the Army for advice on the petition, seeking to know whether or not the allegations of the settlers were true, since the petitions alleged that over $40,000 in property damages had occurred and over 70 whites had been slain by natives. The petitions also requested that Walter S. Jarboe, a Mendocino County resident, be assigned captain of this group. In 1858, Jarboe had been a leader on a raid in the Mendocino Reservation that killed over 60 natives. Countering the petitioners' claims, Major Johnson and Lieutenant Dillon issued reports telling a different story, claiming that only 2 whites and about 600 native had been killed in the past year.|$|E

[...] According to Jiang Fucong's memoires 蒋复璁 珍帚斋文集, [...] "Joint telegrams from Shanghai scholars to the Education Ministry and the British Boxer Indemnity Fund directors requested prompt help to acquire and save these books and manuscripts.

The Society's acquisitions took place from April 1940 to June 1941, south in Suzhou-Hangzhou to north in Beijing. In this time, Zheng Zheduo wrote 9 reports to Jiang Fucong. Zhen was no doubt the leader of all this underground activity. Others contributed according to their expertise. For example, Zhang Fengju liaised with the Jiayetang 嘉业堂 and Siyuan 适园 libraries as well as part of the authentication efforts.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} bank recapitalization policies in Japan. Based on a careful reading of the "business revitalization plan" submitted by banks <b>requesting</b> <b>government</b> funds, we identify four primary goals of the capital injection plan in Japan: 1) to increase the bank capital ratios 2) to increase lending, in particular to small and medium enterprises, and avoid a "credit crunch" 3) to increase write-offs of non-performing loans and 4) to encourage restructuring. Using a panel of individual bank data, we empirically estimate {{the effectiveness of the}} Japanese government policy of public fund injection in achieving the first three of these stated goals. Our empirical analysis of international and domestic banks reveals that the capital injections going to the larger international banks were more effective than those used toward regional banks in Japan. The first capital injection in 1997 was effective primarily in helping international banks to clear the 8 % capital adequacy ratio (BIS ratio) required under the Basel Accord. The second round capital injections seem to have been even more effective, boosting capital adequacy ratios for the regional as well as international banks, and encouraging other policy objectives such as increased lending to small and medium enterprises. ...|$|E
