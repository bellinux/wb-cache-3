ISBN 978 - 0 - 7623 - 0079 - 2 This chapter {{describes}} topoisomerases. Much {{progress has}} been made in structural and functional studies on DNA topoisomerases. New enzymes of the topoisomerase family are still being discovered, and the biological implications of these enzymes stands under open discussion. The potential of DNA topoisomerases as drug targets has expanded this research field into the realm of pharmacology and clinical medicine. Some topics like the viral and mithocondrial topoisomerases remain largely unexplored. The chapter presents the current understanding on the structure and mechanism of these enzymes, and the biological roles of DNA topoisomerases in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. All known DNA topoisomerases share two characteristics. One is their ability to cleave and reseal the phosphodiester backbone of DNA in two successive transesterification reactions. The second characteristic is that once a topoisomerase-cleaved DNA intermediate is formed, the enzyme allows the severed DNA ends to come apart, opening a gate for the passage of another single- or double-stranded DNA segmentPeer Reviewe...|$|E

Western {{analysis}} of the medium proteins with β 1, 3 -glucan- and β 1, 6 -glucan-specific antibodies showed further {{that at least some}} of the released β 1, 3 -glucan was linked to protein as part of a β 1, 3 -glucan–β 1, 6 -glucan–protein complex. These data indicate that Gas 1 p might play a role in the retention of β 1, 3 -glucan and/or β-glucosylated proteins. Interestingly, the defective incorporation of β 1, 3 -glucan in the cell wall was accompanied by an increase in chitin and mannan content in the cell wall, an enhanced expression of cell wall protein 1 (Cwp 1 p), and an increase in β 1, 3 -glucan synthase activity, probably caused by the induced expression of Fks 2 p. It is proposed that the cell wall weakening caused by the loss of Gas 1 p induces a set of compensatory reactions to ensure cell integrity...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of a}} short term (2 weeks) supplementary feeding on sexual behavior traits of Ile-de-France rams during late spring. Ten adult rams were fed a basal diet composed of 0. 5 kg of straw, 0. 8 kg of hay, 0. 27 kg of barley, 0. 05 kg of molasses and 0. 01 kg of a mineral and vitamins supplement per day providing approximately the neat energy for maintenance according to INRA tables. During two weeks prior to joining, control rams (C) were offered the basal diet, while Supplemented (<b>S)</b> <b>rams</b> received the basal diet and were given 1 kg of lupins per ram per day. The rams were selected based on their sexual motivation and allocated to treatment groups balanced for live weight and testicular volume. Sexual activity of the rams was tested {{at the end of the}} supplementary period and following joining with a flock of Ile-de-France ewes. Rams were tested 3 times over a 2 -day period. Supplementation did not affect changes in live weight or the testicular volume being 214 ± 57. 2 and 215 ± 30 g for C and <b>S</b> <b>rams</b> for the latter trait. Latency to first activity, sniffing investigations, flehmen reaction and lateral approaches were not different between rams of the two groups. Nevertheless, total activity time tended to be longer for supplemented than control rams being 6. 8 ± 1. 09 and 6. 2 ± 0. 83 min respectively. Following joining, there was an overall tendency for supplementation to affect negatively sexual behavior traits. Sniffing investigations during the first 30 min of the test were 29. 8 and 22 for C and <b>S</b> <b>rams</b> (P< 0. 05).
