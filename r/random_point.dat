25|$|A very {{different}} kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a <b>random</b> <b>point</b> on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{pool for}} in vitro {{evolution}} {{can be derived}} from a narrowed subset of sequence space, such as a certain round of an in vitro selection experiment, which is sometimes also called in vitro reselection. The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through in vitro evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the mRNA transcript of bovine serum albumin was evolved through <b>random</b> <b>point</b> mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through deep sequencing analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.|$|E

40|$|Description: This {{extension}} {{enables you}} to generate a set of <b>random</b> <b>points</b> within a specified distance {{of a set of}} input features (points, lines or polygons). You can also generate a set of <b>random</b> <b>points</b> within the extent of any particular theme, the extent of all themes, or the extent of the display. This is a useful tool when trying to determine random sampling locations to compare to some feature or set of features. All or Only Selected Features: You can generate <b>random</b> <b>points</b> based on every feature in the Input theme or only a selected subset of those features. If any features in the theme are selected, then only those selected features in that theme will be used in the analysis. If no features in that theme are selected, then <b>random</b> <b>points</b> will be generated with respect to all features in that theme. Alternatively, you can generate a specified number of <b>random</b> <b>points</b> within the rectangular extent of any of the themes, within the extent of all the themes combined, or within the Display extent. Variable Numbers of Random Points: If you choose to generate <b>random</b> <b>points</b> based on features in an input theme, then you have the option to generate a constant number of <b>random</b> <b>points</b> for each feature or a variable number based on values in the attribute table. Set Minimum Distance Between Points: You have the option to set a minimum separation distance between your <b>random</b> <b>points.</b> If you generate <b>random</b> <b>points</b> along a line, you have the option to set...|$|R

25|$|The {{starting}} gene can be mutagenised by <b>random</b> <b>point</b> mutations (by chemical mutagens or {{error prone}} PCR) and insertions and deletions (by transposons). Gene recombination can be mimicked by DNA shuffling of several sequences (usually {{of more than}} 70% homology) to jump into regions of sequence space between the shuffled parent genes. Finally, specific regions of a gene can be systematically randomised for a more focused approach based on structure and function knowledge. Depending on the method, the library generated will vary {{in the proportion of}} functional variants it contains. Even if an organism is used to express the gene of interest, by mutagenising only that gene, the rest of the organism’s genome remains the same and can be ignored for the evolution experiment (to the extent of providing a constant genetic environment).|$|E

Sometimes the term point process is not preferred, as historically the word process denoted an evolution of some system in [...] time, so a point {{process is a}}lso called a <b>random</b> <b>point</b> field. There are different interpretations of a point process, such a random counting measure or a random set.

500|$|Protein {{engineering}} with {{homologous recombination}} develops chimeric proteins by swapping fragments between two parental proteins. [...] These techniques exploit {{the fact that}} recombination can introduce {{a high degree of}} sequence diversity while preserving a protein's ability to fold into its tertiary structure, or three-dimensional shape. [...] This stands in contrast to other protein engineering techniques, like <b>random</b> <b>point</b> mutagenesis, in which the probability of maintaining protein function declines exponentially with increasing amino acid substitutions. [...] The chimeras produced by recombination techniques are able to maintain their ability to fold because their swapped parental fragments are structurally and evolutionarily conserved. [...] These recombinable [...] "building blocks" [...] preserve structurally important interactions like points of physical contact between different amino acids in the protein's structure. [...] Computational methods like SCHEMA and statistical coupling analysis can be used to identify structural subunits suitable for recombination.|$|E
500|$|The {{synaptic}} {{network that}} finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though. In {{many parts of}} the brain, axons initially [...] "overgrow", and then are [...] "pruned" [...] by mechanisms that depend on neural activity. In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping, connecting each point {{on the surface of the}} retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer. In the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a <b>random</b> <b>point</b> and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer. These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time; that is, they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons. This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell. The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult form.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{reason for}} varying {{notation}} {{is due to}} the theory of point processes, which has a couple of mathematical interpretations. For example, a simple Poisson point process may be considered as a random set, which suggests the notation , implying that [...] is a <b>random</b> <b>point</b> belonging to or being an element of the Poisson point process [...] Another, more general, interpretation is to consider a Poisson or any other point process as a random counting measure, [...] so one can write the number of points of a Poisson point process [...] being found or located in some (Borel measurable) region [...] as , which is a random variable. These different interpretations results in notation being used from mathematical fields such as measure theory and set theory.|$|E
2500|$|For a given point process, each <b>random</b> <b>point</b> {{of a point}} {{process can}} have a random {{mathematical}} object, known as a mark, randomly assigned to it. These marks can be as diverse as integers, real numbers, lines, geometrical objects or other point processes. The pair consisting of a point of the point process and its corresponding mark is called a marked point, and all the marked points form a marked point process. [...] It is often assumed that the random marks are independent {{of each other and}} identically distributed, yet the mark of a point can still depend on the location of its corresponding point in the underlying (state) space. If the underlying point process is a Poisson point process, then the resulting point process is a marked Poisson point process.|$|E

In MANET models, the transmitters form a <b>random</b> <b>point</b> process and each transmitter has its receiver located at some random distance and orientation. The channels form a collection of transmitter-receiver pairs or [...] "bipoles"; the signal of a channel is that transmitted over the associated bipole, whereas the interference is that created by all other transmitters than that of the bipole. The approach of considering the transmitters-receive bipoles led to the development and analysis of one of the Poisson bipolar network model. The choice of the medium access probability, which maximizes the mean number of successful transmissions per unit space, was in particular derived in.|$|E
