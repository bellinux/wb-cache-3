50|$|Bollea was {{separated}} from the general jail population {{because he was a}} minor. His attorneys asked for <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> his <b>sentence,</b> seeking temporary house arrest until he was 18 years old. On June 3, 2008, the motion was denied. Soon after, Bollea was moved to join three other juvenile inmates. On July 27 (his 18th birthday), he was moved to Pinellas County Jail general population.|$|R
5000|$|On September 2, 2015, al-Obeidi {{was sentenced}} in Boulder District Court to 6 {{years in prison}} for the February 2014 assault. In denying a request by al-Obeidi's {{attorney}} Eric Zale for <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sentence</b> after 120 days and possible probation, Judge Andrew Macdonald said, [...] "It's terrible, I don't know how else to describe it... It is really clear to me that Ms. Ali has a pretty serious mental health issue, most likely related to the trauma in Libya. But it's also concerning that she is refusing to get treatment." [...] Concluding the hearing, Judge Macdonald told al-Obeidi, [...] "I have grave concerns that when you get out, you'll be right back in this situation." ...|$|R
50|$|Prosecutors {{challenged}} the judge's reduction <b>of</b> Watson's <b>sentence,</b> and an appellate court {{agreed that the}} reduction was inaccurate and probably too lenient. Nearly four years later, Watson went back to court before District Court Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan for <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> his <b>sentence</b> on February 12, 2008, which was an uncommon situation for the federal court after a defendant had served his time and had been released. Although he believed Watson deserved another three years in prison, Judge Hogan declined to give Watson more prison time. Noting {{that it was only}} the second occasion he had departed from federal sentencing guidelines since Blakely was decided, Hogan stated that there would be little benefit to the public in returning him to prison, particularly since Watson was employed and taking care of his mentally ill sister.|$|R
50|$|After {{months of}} debate, the court {{concluded}} that in 51 of the cases, excluding those of César Roberto Fierro Reyna, Roberto Moreno Ramos, and Osvaldo Torres Aguilera, the United States had breached their obligation {{as set forth}} under Article 36 paragraph 1 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by not informing the appropriate Mexican consular post without delay. By not doing so, the US had also deprived Mexico {{of the right to}} provide assistance to its nationals. In regards to César Roberto Fierro Reyna, Roberto Moreno Ramos, and Osvaldo Torres Aguilera, by not allowing a review and <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> their convictions and sentences, the United States also violated Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Convention. As reparation in this case, the United States of America was ordered to provide review and <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> convictions and <b>sentences</b> <b>of</b> the Mexican nationals and implement specific measures to ensure non-repetition.|$|R
6000|$|A {{petition}} {{was addressed}} to the Home Secretary, advancing the circumstances which appeared to justify {{a request for a}} <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sentence.</b> It was not [...] "numerously signed" [...] by the inhabitants of Casterbridge, as is usual in such cases, for Boldwood had never made many friends over the counter. The shops thought it very natural that a man who, by importing direct from the producer, had daringly set aside the first great principle of provincial existence, namely that God made country villages to supply customers to county towns, should have confused ideas about the Decalogue. The prompters were a few merciful men who had perhaps too feelingly considered the facts latterly unearthed, and the result was that evidence was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime in a moral point of view, out of the category of wilful murder, and lead it to be regarded as a sheer outcome of madness.|$|R
