40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of the inplane boundary conditions on the vibration frequencies and the buckling load of plates reinforced with a system of parallel beams is presented. The adopted model for the dynamic analysis of the <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> takes into account the resulting inplane forces and deformations of the plate as well as the axial forces and deformations of the beam, due to combined response of the system. The analysis consists in isolating the beams from the plate by sections parallel to the lower outer surface of the plate. The analysis of the vibration problem of a <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> subjected to inplane forces is based on the capability to establish a flexibility matrix with respect to a set of nodal mass points using the Analog Equation Method (AEM) for the static <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> problem. Moreover, a lumped mass matrix is constructed from the tributary mass areas to the nodal mass points. The buckling load is established using the dynamic criterion.

To {{avoid the}} open {{problems}} of the leading wheel and get a more rational structure, the paper uses PRO / E and the finite element software to analyze the leading wheel of JKM- 3. 25 / 4 multi-rope friction hoist.

To solve the problem of open weld of <b>rib</b> <b>plates,</b> can consider the <b>rib</b> <b>plates</b> to be removed. When the radial angle between support wheel and drum is bigger than 6 °, the overall force of the leading wheel is affected seriously.

The first scheme utilized RFPs {{to connect the}} beam flanges to the column, without any direct connection of the beam flange to the column. Plastic hinges were forced to form in the RFPs instead of the steel beam due to strong beam-weak RFPs, so the weakened moment connection eliminated buckling of the beam and reduced cost of repairing after earthquakes. The second scheme was to strengthen a connection, which was removed from an existing 33 -story steel building, by welding <b>rib</b> <b>plates</b> between the column face and inner side of the beam flanges. Test results of the weakened connections showed that (1) the connections developed beam plastic moment and reach more than an interstory drift of 4 % without strength degradation, (2) the RFP was effective in dissipating energy before buckling, and (3) no buckling of the beam was observed. Test results of the strengthened connection showed that the <b>rib</b> <b>plates</b> significantly reduced the beam flange strain by 75 % compared to a non-retrofitted steel moment connection.

40|$|A {{simple and}} closed form {{solution}} for the vibration response of finite ribbed plates to point force/moment excitations is presented in this paper. This solution shows that input mobilities of finite ribbed plates are bounded by the input mobilities of the uncoupled plate and beam that form the <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate.</b> It is found that point force input mobilities of a finite <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> are controlled by the plate bending stiffness when the excitation force {{is more than a}} quarter wavelength away from the beam. The input mobilities are mainly dominated by the beam flexural stiffness when the force acts on or very close to the beam, and when the beam flexural stiffness is far greater than the plate bending stiffness. Similar result is found in the moment excitation case when the moment axis is perpendicular to the beam neutral axis (bending moment excitation). In contrast, the input mobilities of the <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> do not vary much from that of the corresponding uncoupled plate when the moment axis parallels to the beam’s neutral axis (torsional moment excitation) where the input mobilities are mainly dominated by the plate bending stiffness.

The fibre orientation results for the <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate,</b> measured using large area image analysis system developed at Leeds University, showed that after an initial settling down period, the central core region, where the fibres are aligned perpendicular to the flow direction, decreased in size monotonically, with an associated monotonic increase in the outer shell regions, where the fibres are aligned preferentially along the injection direction. Interestingly, the level of orientation in the two regions remained almost constant: only the proportions of the two regions were found to change with flow length. Across the plate, close to the gate, the central core region was found to have a lens-like shape, while {{at the other end of}} the plate the core was thinner and also consistent in thickness across the sample width.

In the <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> system, the reinforcing beam affects both {{the propagation of}} the flexural waves in the plate, {{as well as the}} sound radiation from the structure. A subsonic incident flexural wave in the plate impinging on the beam discontinuity generates transmitted and reflected propagating waves, and transmitted and reflected near-field waves in the plate. The scattering of the structural wave field gives rise to supersonic wave number components of the plate vibration, which subsequently leads to sound radiation into the surrounding fluid field. Two structural coincidence conditions have been identified in this paper.

40|$|Prediction of {{bending wave}} {{transmission}} across systems of coupled plates which incorporate periodic ribbed plates is considered using Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) in the low- and mid-frequency ranges and Advanced SEA (ASEA) in the high-frequency range. This paper investigates the crossover from prediction with SEA to ASEA through comparison with Finite Element Methods. Results from L-junctions confirm that this crossover occurs near the frequency band containing the fundamental bending mode {{of the individual}} bays on the <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> when ribs are parallel to the junction line. Below this frequency band, SEA models treating each periodic <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> as a single subsystem were shown to be appropriate. Above this frequency band, large reductions occur in the vibration level when propagation takes place across successive bays on ribbed plates when the ribs are parallel to the junction. This is due to spatial filtering; hence {{it is necessary to}} use ASEA which can incorporate indirect coupling associated with this transmission mechanism. A system of three coupled plates was also modelled which introduced flanking transmission. The results show that a wide frequency range can be covered by using both SEA and ASEA for systems of coupled plates where {{some or all of the}} plates are periodic ribbed plates...|$|E

The prediction of this time-dependent behaviour is important as it may cause serious serviceability problems in concrete structures. The shape and size of {{a concrete}} cross-section and environmental conditions have an important effect on the moisture flow and moisture distribution of a concrete cross-section and affect the drying shrinkage and drying creep behaviour and thus the long-term behaviour of the concrete member. The impact of the shape and size of the cross-section on the net macroscopic temporal strain and curvature due to shrinkage is investigated in this contribution using numerical simulations. A time-dependent analysis is commonly based on equations given by design codes. The effect of moisture diffusion in these equations is included in an empirical manner and is commonly, among others, defined based on the notional size of the element.

Exact tractable methods for calculating the deflections of radially ribbed plates are not available. Outlines of formal mathematical treatment which use several approximations are presented to highlight the theoretical difficulties. The technique of Fizeau interferometry was employed to study the deflections of a series of laterally loaded ribbed plates of varying proportions.

Details of modal characteristics in pass bands of the periodic <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> were elucidated and the control mechanism was discussed.

Higher order orthotropic plate modes were also identified, which could not be grouped into any pass bands defined by the classical periodic theory.

40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of sound and}} vibration transmission in built-up structures is important for human comfort, health and safety. For structural reasons, engineering structures often incorporate periodic ribbed plates to increase stiffness and stability whilst reducing the weight. However, vibration propagation on periodic ribbed plates is complex due {{to the existence of}} stop/pass bands. This thesis is concerned with predicting vibration transmission between isotropic, homogeneous plates and periodic ribbed plates. The objectives are to investigate the use of Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) and develop and validate advanced SEA (ASEA) using ray tracing to incorporate tunnelling mechanisms. Two approaches were considered for modelling the periodic ribbed plate: either representing it as a single subsystem or representing each bay as a single subsystem in the high-frequency range (above the fundamental local mode of the bay). In the low-frequency range (below the fundamental local mode of the bay) Finite Element Methods (FEM) and laboratory experiments show that the periodic <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate</b> can be adequately modelled in SEA using wave approaches from periodic structure and orthotropic plate theories. In the high-frequency range a significant decrease in energy along successive bays was identified using FEM leading to the conclusion that it is not appropriate to model a periodic plate as a single subsystem. SEA models were therefore investigated that treated each bay as an individual subsystem using wave theory. For different L-junctions formed from an isotropic, homogeneous plate and a periodic <b>ribbed</b> <b>plate,</b> SEA significantly underestimated the response in the bays. Experimental SEA (ESEA) was used to investigate these discrepancies which confirmed the existence of tunnelling mechanisms between physically unconnected subsystems. In contrast to SEA which gave errors up to 60 dB for the furthest bay from the junction, ASEA gave errors less than 6 dB when the mode count for the bay was greater than five. A range of two- and three- plate structures with different periodic ribbed plates or periodic folded plate have been modelled with ASEA. The results all lead to the conclusion that ASEA can successfully incorporate tunnelling mechanisms and provide a significantly more accurate approach to predicting high-frequency vibration transmission across periodic ribbed plates than SEA...|$|E

Furthermore, an extension to comprehension of the mechanisms that generate the mode localization phenomenon on disordered structures has been realized;A secondary effort examines natural modes of vibration and acoustic radiation for finite stiffened multiple-span beams with the efficient transfer matrix method.
