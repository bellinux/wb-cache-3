25|$|In King's Landing, Ned finds Robert's eldest brother Stannis Baratheon {{left the}} city after Jon Arryn's death for his island of Dragonstone. Ned begins to {{investigate}} into Jon Arryn's affairs, which leads him to visiting locations where Jon Arryn visited with Stannis - including places where Robert's bastard children are found. On {{the way back from}} one such place, Ned and his soldiers are waylaid by Jaime Lannister, who demands Tyrion's return, and when he does not get what he wants he orders Ned's men be killed - in the ensuing skirmish, Ned is crippled in one leg when his horse collapses on top of him. Even afterwards, Ned continues to investigate and eventually discovers that Robert's legal heirs, including Joffrey, are in fact Cersei's children by Jaime and that Jon Arryn was killed to conceal his discovery of their incest. Ned offers Cersei a chance to flee before he informs Robert, but she uses this chance to arrange Robert's death in a hunting accident. Ned, made lord-regent by Robert's will, enlists Littlefinger's help to secure the loyalty and assistance of the city guards to challenge Joffrey's claim on the throne and place Stannis on the throne; but Littlefinger betrays him, resulting in Ned's arrest, and the death of his men. Whilst Joffrey is crowned King of the Seven Kingdoms, Ned eventually agrees to falsely confess to high treason and join the Night's Watch in exchange for Sansa and Arya's safety, but Joffrey has him beheaded anyway. Whilst Sansa is retained into custody, Arya escapes {{with the help of her}} fencing instructor, Syrio Forel, and Yoren, a <b>recruiting</b> <b>agent</b> for the Night's Watch.|$|E
500|$|When Shirley and Johnson met in July 1755 {{before their}} {{respective}} expeditions set off, {{tension between the}} two men continued, and Johnson delayed decisions on assigning Indian auxiliaries to Shirley's campaign, observing that much of the expedition was traveling through friendly Iroquois territory, where they would not yet be needed. [...] Shirley took offense at this as an act of insubordination. [...] Believing he outranked Johnson, Shirley next sought to bypass the Indian agent and negotiate directly with the tribes for recruits, but Johnson and his subordinates actively opposed the move. [...] The Iroquois also objected to the presence of Shirley's <b>recruiting</b> <b>agent,</b> Colonel John Lydius, with whom they had outstanding issues over past land transactions.

On his return from Monterey in February 1847, he entered the service of the Swiss John Augustus Sutter (1803–1880).
