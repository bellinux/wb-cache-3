30|$|Turning {{specifically}} to results in Table  2, we obtain from column (1) of this table that the coefficient {{associated with the}} variable INTERNET is not statistically significant at the 10 % level, whereas in column (2) which includes the variable “DUMRES”, we obtain a negative and significant effect (at the 1 % level) of the Internet usage intensity on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> <b>in</b> total public <b>revenue.</b> This clearly suggests that the Internet facilitates the shift from reliance on resource revenue to an increasing dependence on non-resource <b>revenue</b> <b>in</b> the overall public <b>revenue.</b> <b>In</b> particular, we note that a 1 -percentage point increase in the Internet usage intensity {{is associated with a}} 0.056 -percentage point decline in the share of resource <b>revenue</b> <b>in</b> total public <b>revenue</b> for countries contained in the sub-sample of “ResCountries”. In the light of these findings, our baseline model would henceforth be the one that contains the dummy variable “DUMRES” along with its interaction with the “INTERNET” variable. Moving on to results related to control variables in column (2) of Table  2, we observe that trade policy liberalization and the population size exert no significant effect on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> <b>in</b> total public <b>revenue.</b> Higher oil prices, lower inflation rate and lower institutional and governance quality induce a rise in the share of resource <b>revenue</b> <b>in</b> total public <b>revenue.</b> As expected, countries with higher real per capita income (higher development level) tend to mobilize higher share of resource <b>revenue</b> <b>in</b> total public <b>revenue</b> compared to less developed countries: this is exemplified by the positive and statistically significant coefficient of the variable capturing the real per capita income. The coefficient associated with the “Trend” variable is negative and statistically significant, therefore suggesting a decline in the share of resource <b>revenue</b> <b>in</b> total public <b>revenue</b> over time.|$|R

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income.

A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E
