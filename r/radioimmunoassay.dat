5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of pituitary disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} <b>radioimmunoassay</b> by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the pituitary, which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously been hard to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|What is the {{relationship}} of gluten and anti-gliadin antibodies?. In gluten-sensitive individuals AGA testing is a routinely used blood test for possible presence of coeliac disease, allergies or idiopathic phenomena. The measurement of AGA is done with ELISA or <b>radioimmunoassay.</b> Such tests measure the level of AGA relative to a standard, such as a level of 10 = point which 85% of normal population falls below. Greater than 10 equals disease and a value of 3 is expected (mean).|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of benzodiazepine overdose may be difficult, but is usually made {{based on the}} clinical presentation of the patient along {{with a history of}} overdose. Obtaining a laboratory test for benzodiazepine blood concentrations can be useful in patients presenting with CNS depression or coma of unknown origin. Techniques available to measure blood concentrations include thin layer chromatography, gas liquid chromatography with or without a mass spectrometer, and <b>radioimmunoassay.</b> Blood benzodiazepine concentrations, however, {{do not appear to be}} related to any toxicological effect or predictive of clinical outcome. Blood concentrations are, therefore, used mainly to confirm the diagnosis rather than being useful for the clinical management of the patient.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundations}} for which ligand binding assay {{have been built}} {{are a result of}} Karl Landsteiner, in 1945, and his work on immunization of animals through the production of antibodies for certain proteins. Landsteiner’s work demonstrated that immunoassay technology allowed researchers to analyze at the molecular level. The first successful ligand binding assay was reported in 1960 by Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Solomon Berson. They investigated the binding interaction for insulin and an insulin-specific antibody, in addition to developing the first <b>radioimmunoassay</b> (RIA) for insulin. These discoveries provided precious information regarding both the sensitivity and specificity of protein hormones found within blood-based fluids. Yalow and Berson received the Nobel Prize in Medicine {{as a result of their}} advancements. Through the development of RIA technology, researchers have been able to move beyond the use of radioactivity, and instead, use liquid- and solid-phase, competitive, and immunoradiometric assays. As a direct result of these monumental findings, researchers have continued the advancement of ligand binding assays in many facets in the fields of biology, chemistry, and the like.|$|E

40|$|Procedures were {{examined}} for labeling immune globulins with radioactive iodine using chloramine-T as the oxidizing agent. The chloramine-T method was critically evaluated {{to establish the}} optimal conditions for preparing iodinated globulins with high specific radioactivities without impairing their immunospecificities for use in in vitro <b>radioimmunoassays.</b> The {{results showed that the}} use of 100 μg of chloramine-T per ml, 500 to 1, 000 μCi of Na 125 I per mg of protein, and a 10 -min oxidation reaction time produced globulins of both high specific radioactivities and immunospecificities. Criteria were established for evaluating and determining optimal concentrations of iodine-labeled globulin for use in <b>radioimmunoassays.</b> The results of this investigation indicated that the amount of labeled indicator globulin used in <b>radioimmunoassays</b> should be based upon protein concentration rather than radioactivity...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{estrogen}} measurement {{with use}} of <b>radioimmunoassays</b> {{has been instrumental in}} the development of aromatase inhibitors for endocrine therapy of postmenopausal breast cancer. However, due to low plasma estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, direct <b>radioimmunoassays</b> lack the sensitivity required. While certain laboratories have developed highly sensitive assays for research purposes revealing plasma estrogen suppression consistent with results from tracer studies, such assays are time and labor-consuming due to need for pre-analytical chromatographic purification, sample concentration and sometimes conversion of precursors to products. While novel chromatographic methods involving mass spectrometry analysis are likely to replace such <b>radioimmunoassays</b> in the future, so far a limited number of laboratories have developed suitable assays with a detection limit (around 1 pM) that is required for analyzing plasma estrogen levels in patients during treatment with potent aromatase inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|Although {{lysosomal}} enzyme {{activities are}} known to vary in response to numerous physiological and pharmacological stimuli, the relationship between lysosomal enzyme activity and enzyme concentration has not been systematically studied. Therefore we developed <b>radioimmunoassays</b> for two lysosomal glycosidases {{in order to determine}} lysosomal enzyme concentration. beta-Galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase were purified from rat liver 2780 -fold and 1280 -fold respectively, by using differential centrifugation, affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography and molecular-sieve chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies to these enzymes were raised in rabbits, and two <b>radioimmunoassays</b> were established. Antibody specificity was shown by: (i) selective immunoprecipitation of enzyme activity; (ii) identical bands of purified enzyme on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis; (iii) single immunoreactive peaks in molecular-sieve chromatography experiments. Sensitivities of the assays were such that 15 ng of beta-galactosidase and 45 ng of beta-glucuronidase decreased the ratio of bound to free radiolabel by 50 %; minimal detectable amounts of immunoreactive enzymes were 2 ng and 10 ng respectively. The assays were initially used to assess the effects of physiological perturbations (i. e. fasting and age) on enzyme concentrations in rat liver; these experiments showed that changes in enzyme concentrations do not always correlate with changes in enzyme activities. This represents the first report of <b>radioimmunoassays</b> for lysosomal glycosidases. The results suggest that these <b>radioimmunoassays</b> provide useful technology for the study of regulatory control mechanisms of the concentrations of lysosomal glycosidases in mammalian tissues...|$|R

40|$|Rapid, {{sensitive}} <b>radioimmunoassays</b> {{have been}} developed for the conjugated primary bile salts, cholate and chenodeoxycholate, using immunogens prepared by the mixed anhydride procedure. Antibodies produced showed equal specificity for glycine and taurine conjugates. Cross-reactivities were comparable with those from other published <b>radioimmunoassays.</b> The assays were routinely performed on unextracted sera and the concentrations correlated well with concentrations determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Accuracy, determined by the addition of bile salt to charcoal-extracted serum, and percision, determined by replicate analysis of a normal sample, were both less than +/- 10 %. These figures are comparable with those obtained by both gas-liquid chromatography and other <b>radioimmunoassays</b> for bile salts. Normal sera were found to contain 0. 49 - 1. 32 mumol/l of cholate and 0. 55 - 2. 02 mumol/l of chenodeoxycholate. Serum concentrations in patients with liver disease were higher than this normal range.
