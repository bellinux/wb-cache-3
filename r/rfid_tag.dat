The main club shop, named 'The Armoury', and ticket offices are located near the West Stand, with other an {{additional}} store {{at the base of}} the North Bank Bridge, named 'All Arsenal' and the 'Arsenal Store' next to Finsbury Park station. Arsenal operates an electronic ticketing system where members of 'The Arsenal' (the club's fan membership scheme) use their membership cards to enter the stadium, thus removing the need for turnstile operators. Non-members are issued with one-off paper tickets embedded with an <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> allowing them to enter the stadium.|$|E

Although it offers many advantages over other identification systems, there are also associated security risks that are not easy to be addressed. When designing a real lightweight authentication protocol for low cost <b>RFID</b> <b>tags,</b> a number of challenges arise due to the extremely limited computational, storage and communication abilities of Low-cost <b>RFID</b> <b>tags.</b> This paper proposes a real mutual authentication protocol for low cost <b>RFID</b> <b>tags.</b> The proposed protocol prevents passive attacks as active attacks are discounted when designing a protocol to meet the requirements of low cost <b>RFID</b> <b>tags.</b> However the implementation of the protocol meets the limited abilities of low cost <b>RFID</b> <b>tags.</b> Comment: 11 Pages, IJNS...|$|R
25|$|RFID tags contain {{at least}} three parts: an {{integrated}} circuit for storing and processing information that modulates and demodulates a radio-frequency (RF) signals; a means of collecting DC power from the incident reader signal; and an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal.

40|$|I am {{here today}} {{to talk about some}} of the {{security}} implications of Radio Frequency Identification. <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> are remotely-powered data carriers that resemble the theft control tags that you might find in a sweater when buying clothing from a store. Like theft-control <b>tags,</b> <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> are powered and accessed from a distance using radio waves, but <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> differ from theft-control tags in that they tend to have more storage space and processing power. <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> have security issues that have been exposed in the past few years. The heart of the problem is that <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> don’t usually support cryptography, plus RFID application scenarios are usually not conducive to commonly performed security operations like key management; in fact, many security and privacy issues that generally exist in ubiquitous computing reappear in RFID applications specifically...|$|R
5000|$|For <b>RFID</b> <b>tags,</b> bulk {{reading is}} the {{extension}} of single reading {{to a set of}} tags. A group of objects, all of them <b>RFID</b> <b>tagged,</b> are read completely from one single reader position at one time.|$|R
25|$|A {{physical}} <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> may {{be incorporated}} with browser-based software {{to increase its}} efficacy. This software allows for different groups or specific hospital staff, nurses, and patients to see real-time data relevant to each piece of tracked equipment or personnel.

This combination of RFID real-time locating system hardware and software provides a powerful data collection tool for facilities seeking to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.|$|E
25|$|An RFID reader transmits an encoded {{radio signal}} to {{interrogate}} the tag. The <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> receives {{the message and}} then responds with its identification and other information. This may be only a unique tag serial number, or may be product-related information such as a stock number, lot or batch number, production date, or other specific information. Since tags have individual serial numbers, the RFID system design can discriminate among several tags that might be {{within the range of}} the RFID reader and read them simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The {{concerns}} {{raised by}} the above may be addressed in part by use of the Clipped Tag. The Clipped Tag is an <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> designed to increase consumer privacy. The Clipped Tag has been suggested by IBM researchers Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off {{a portion of the}} tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range– less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.|$|E

25|$|The unique {{identity}} is a mandatory requirement for RFID tags, despite special {{choice of the}} numbering scheme. <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current bar codes are limited to a single type code for a particular product. The uniqueness of RFID tags means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location, finally ending up in the consumer's hands. This may help to combat theft {{and other forms of}} product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that gets well supported with RFID tags containing a unique identity of the tag and also the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope with quality deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of consumers after the sale.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The recent {{emergence}} of <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> capable of performing public key operations has enabled {{a number of}} new applications in commerce (e. g., RFIDenabled credit cards) and security (e. g., ePassports and access-control badges). While the use of public key cryptography in <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> mitigates many difficult security issues, certain important usability-related issues remain, particularly when <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> are used for financial transactions or for bearer identification. In this paper, we focus exclusively on techniques with user involvement for secure user-to-tag authentication, transaction verification, reader expiration and revocation checking, as well as association of <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> with other personal devices. Our approach is based on two factors: (1) recent advances in hardware and manufacturing have made it possible to mass-produce inexpensive passive displayequipped <b>RFID</b> <b>tags,</b> and (2) high-end <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> used in financial transactions or identification are usually attended by a human user (namely the owner). Our techniques rely on user involvement coupled with on-tag displays to achieve better security and privacy. Since user acceptance is a crucial factor in this context, we thoroughly evaluate the usability of all considered methods through comprehensive user studies and report on our findings. ...|$|R
