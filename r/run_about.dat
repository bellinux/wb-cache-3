5|$|A {{group that}} opposed the hippie {{movement}} {{managed to keep}} Guldy off the mayoral ballot in 1975. He became a write-in candidate for village trustee, with his friend, poet George Montgomery, running for mayor. Montgomery lost the election to Raivo Puusemp, a sculptor from SoHo. After his election, Puusemp chided Guldy for being a poor role model for the village youth. Puusemp was not a native of Rosendale and had not lived there long. By early July 1975, Puusemp had appointed a village dog warden after a dog bit a child and was allowed to <b>run</b> <b>about</b> the streets unrestrained.|$|E

25|$|A myotonic goat, {{otherwise}} known as the fainting goat, is a domestic goat that freezes for roughly 3 seconds when it feels panic. Though painless, this generally results in the animal collapsing on its side. The characteristic {{is caused by a}} hereditary genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or lean against something when startled, and often they continue to <b>run</b> <b>about</b> in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} sources of error exist due to {{relativistic}} effects that would render the system useless if uncorrected. Three relativistic effects are the time dilation, gravitational frequency shift, and eccentricity effects. Examples include the relativistic time slowing due to {{the speed of the}} satellite of about 1 part in 1010, the gravitational time dilation that makes a satellite <b>run</b> <b>about</b> 5 parts in 1010 faster than an Earth-based clock, and the Sagnac effect due to rotation relative to receivers on Earth. These topics are examined below, one at a time.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of sources of uncertainty, such as {{insufficient}} knowledge of fault geometry (especially at depth) and slip rates, and there is considerable challenge in how to balance the various elements of the model to achieve the best fit with the available observations. For example, there is difficulty fitting paleoseismic data and slip rates on the southern San Andreas Fault, resulting in estimates of seismicity that <b>run</b> <b>about</b> 25% less than seen in the paleoseismic data. The data does fit if a certain constraint (the regional Magnitude-Frequency Distribution) is relaxed, but this brings back the problem over-predicting moderate events.|$|E
25|$|Several {{rapid transit}} and {{commuter}} rail services {{run on the}} Barcelona–Vallès Line, all of them either starting or terminating at Plaça de Catalunya station in central Barcelona (excepting the L12 shuttle services).

Currently, there are no overnight services, though the last trains run just after 2:00 the following morning on Friday and Saturday nights as well as on public holidays. Continuous overnight rapid transit services had previously been offered on Saturdays, though they were suspended to reduce operational costs in January 2012.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the story, Saya finds Kohta cringing in the hallway as students <b>run</b> <b>about</b> in a panic. They hide in a classroom where Hirano is able to put together a nail gun rifle powered by gas cartridges. Kohta has an unrequited crush on Saya. Kohta provides long-range cover when Takashi rescues Alice Maresato from approaching zombies after Alice's father is killed. At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses saying this is the one thing he was good at and that he wants to protect Saya. The rest of the group, including Saya, support him.|$|E
25|$|A team {{consists}} of minimum seven (maximum 21) players, of which six {{are always on}} the pitch, those being the three chasers, one keeper, and two beaters. Besides the seeker who is off-pitch, the six players are required {{to abide by the}} gender rule, which states that a team may have a maximum of four players who identify as the same gender, excluding the seeker, making quidditch one of the few sports that not only offers a co-ed environment but an open community to those who do not identify with the gender binary. Matches or games often <b>run</b> <b>about</b> 30 to 40 minutes but tend to be subject to varying lengths of time due to the unpredictable nature of the snitch catch. If the score {{at the end of the}} match including the 30 point snitch catch is tied (such that the team that caught the snitch was 30 points behind the other), the game moves to overtime where the snitch is constrained to the pitch's dimensions and the game ends after five minutes or when the snitch is legally caught.|$|E
