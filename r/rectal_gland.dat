The members of Silphidae have many different modifications {{that allow them to}} thrive in different ecological niches including colour warnings (from aposematism to Batesian mimicry), chemical defenses and parental care. Silphid beetles are usually dark in color consisting of gold, black and brown. This dark coloring allows them to blend into their environment. One species of Silphidae uses a physical mean of defense. Oiceoptoma inaequalis holds its elytra over its back when it flies. The back of the elytra are bright blue and when they are exposed it makes the beetle look much larger. After landing, the beetle folds its wings and the blue color vanishes. Many Silphidae have bright orange coloring on their elytra, which may serve as a warning to other predators. Some Silphidae beetles secrete a chemical from a <b>rectal</b> <b>gland</b> that consists of aliphatic acids and terpene alcohols.

40|$|The <b>rectal</b> <b>gland</b> of Squalus acanthias: A {{model for}} the {{transport}} of chloride. The <b>rectal</b> <b>gland</b> of the spiny dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias, secretes chloride by a furosemide sensitive process that has been termed “secondary active”. Chloride enters the cell across the basolateral cell membrane via the sodium:potassium: 2 chloride cotransporter. The energy for this electroneutral uptake step {{is provided by the}} electrochemical gradient for sodium directed into the cell. This is maintained by Na-K-ATPase present in the basolateral cell membrane. Present as well in the basolateral cell membrane is a potassium conductance that permits potassium to exit passively. Chloride leaves the cell across the luminal membrane via a chloride conductance closely similar to CFTR. The <b>rectal</b> <b>gland</b> is thus a {{model for the}} mechanism of secondary active chloride transport utilized by various epithelial organs throughout the vertebrate kingdom. This report reviews the humoral agents that regulate the secretion of chloride by the <b>rectal</b> <b>gland</b> and the intracellular mechanisms that mediate it.
