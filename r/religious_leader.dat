40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 In sub-Saharan Africa, <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> {{are highly}} revered. They {{are in a}} {{position}} to play an important role in response to the HIV epidemic. This study explored the attitudes of <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> towards HIV testing in Pentecostal churches in Mombasa, Kenya. Individual in-depth interviews with seven Pentecostal <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> and four focus group discussions (FGDs) with congregation members were conducted. The in-depth interviews highlighted the range of views of the <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> towards HIV testing, while the FGDs illustrated the religious community norms that shape the congregations attitudes towards testing. <b>Religious</b> <b>leaders</b> were important in influencing the congregants' decisions about whether or not to seek HIV testing. Some <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> address HIV in their interactions with congregants and actively promote testing. However, many <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> do not talk about testing because of the stigma associated with HIV as a sexually transmitted disease. <b>Religious</b> <b>leaders</b> cited numerous barriers to advocacy for HIV testing in the church. These included conformity to religious norms on faith and righteousness, belief in faith healing of HIV, and a perception of the disease as God's punishment. A notable exception to the religious leaders' resistance to discussing HIV was the widespread acceptance of HIV testing prior to marriage. Focus group discussions highlighted the role of <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in motivating congregants' decisions to seek HIV testing. Many FGD participants expressed desire for their <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> to advocate for HIV testing. These results highlight the importance of <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in influencing HIV testing decisions among religious adherents. If barriers to discussion of HIV testing in Pentecostal communities could be addressed, <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> could play a key role in motivating church members to seek HIV testing...|$|R
40|$|Nigeria {{has high}} rates of sickle cell disease (SCD), which is {{attributed}} {{to the lack of}} awareness of the disease among the reproductive age in the country. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to explore the role of <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in contributing to awareness and prevention of SCD in Nigeria. <b>Religious</b> <b>leaders</b> 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, attitude, and prevention and awareness practices of SCD, and how they translated to the prevention of SCD through improved counseling of premarital couples, were explored. A stratified random sampling was employed in selecting a sample of 150 <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> from different <b>religious</b> affiliations. Data were collected through a survey of sampled <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in Nigeria by use of semi-structured questionnaires. Correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship among the variables under study. According to study findings, the level of knowledge towards SCD among the <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> was high. Additionally, there was no significant relationship between the <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of SCD and their efforts in increasing testing and genetic counseling among their congregation members. The level of awareness among the <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> did not contribute to the prevention of SCD in the country. The implications for positive social change from this research include <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> 2 ̆ 7 commitment to emphasizing genotype testing during regular premarital counseling sessions and including <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in health promotion activities, especially SCD prevention...|$|R

40|$|The central {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the dynamic {{relationship}} between Javanese strongmen and <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in search of power. Two groups of strongmen -jago in Central and East Java and jawara in Banten- and <b>religious</b> <b>leaders,</b> such as kyai, tarekat teachers and guru ngaji are the subjects of this discussion. I present two groups of strongmen and <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> and sketch how both groups, through their socio-political as well as religious roles, preserve the values of the Javanese and Bantenese. <b>Religious</b> <b>leaders</b> and strongmen have been the source of informal traditional leadership, particularly in villages. <b>Religious</b> <b>leaders</b> have represented leadership in knowledge, while strongmen have represented leadership with regard to braveness and physical magical power. The most visible roles of the strongmen are as power brokers. In the meantime, <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> have to be aware of the risk of being alienated and isolated from their horizontal networks within religious circles, but also more importantly, that their high position in society will gradually fade away if they place themselves too close to strongmen and the authorities.

5|$|Joseph Smith Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was an American <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> {{and founder}} of Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement.

By {{the time of his}} death fourteen years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religious culture that continues to the present.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2002 {{deterioration}} of his health, al-Jamri's {{position as a}} political and <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> of Bahrain's Shia opposition {{was taken over by}} his lifelong friend, Ayatollah Isa Qassim. Qassim was less revolutionary than al-Jamri, having opposed the 1992 and 1994 petitions, but his views were kept private, in part as a sign of respect for al-Jamri. Al-Jamri's role as leader of the opposition remained empty, as the opposition became fragmented.|$|E
5|$|In the congregation's early years, {{tensions}} {{existed between}} traditionalists and reformers, and in 1861, 41 {{of the latter}} left Baith Israel to form the Congregation Beth Elohim, a Reform synagogue. That year Baith Israel hired the Reverend Joel Alexander as its <b>religious</b> <b>leader.</b> Alexander, the synagogue's first full-time rabbi, {{was a graduate of}} the Jews Seminary in Münster, and had been ordained both in Posen and by Hermann Adler, the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|Research {{is needed}} to {{understand}} {{the role of religion}} in family planning dynamics, particularly in societies where the views of <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> can be an important influence on the reproductive decisions of individuals. This paper attempts to describe the factors associated with approval of contraception among <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> in Pakistan. The data are taken from the 1999 – 2000 Survey of Perception of <b>Religious</b> <b>Leaders</b> about Population Welfare. Regression modelling shows that whether or not <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> approve of family planning is associated with their views on the ideal family size, their level of religious education, the specific religious sect to which they belong, their own knowledge and use of family planning, their exposure to television and the region of the country in which they live...|$|R

5|$|John Sigismund {{appointed}} a Calvinist bishop {{as the only}} <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> of the Romanians in his realm in November 1566. The Diet also ordered that all Romanian priests who refused to convert to Calvinism were to be expelled, but this decision was not carried out. Influenced by Dávid and Biandrata, John Sigismund became receptive to Anti-Trinitarian ideas from early 1567. With John Sigismund's support, Dávid published five books to promote his views, reproving for idolatry those who accepted the dogma of the Trinity.|$|E

Shortly after meeting a mysterious girl named Reala while trying to save Rutee's orphanage from bankruptcy, Kyle is drawn into conflict with Barbatos, a cruel warrior responsible for killing Stahn, and the machinations of Elraine, a <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> seeking to bring peace to mankind. The gameplay uses two-dimensional character sprites and backgrounds, and the battle system is a revamped version of the series' trademark Linear Motion Battle System.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Smith and rising {{opposition}} in the west, the Mormons decided to relocate their center from Nauvoo, Illinois to the California region outside of the United States border. The plans for the large exodus began and Mormon leadership moved westward leaving Brannan the highest ranking <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> in New York. As such, he was faced with the large responsibility of evacuating the eastern Mormons to California. Brannan chartered the ship Brooklyn and persuaded the Mormons of New York to join the expedition to California. The Brooklyn set sail for upper California via Cape Horn in January 1846. Brannan {{was in charge of}} the expedition and the highest presiding <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> on the ship. He brought along an antiquated printing press and a complete flour mill to make colonization easier. While the living conditions aboard the Brooklyn were strenuous for many, Brannan lived lavishly in the ship's officers' quarters. The ship stopped on June 20, 1846 in Honolulu, Hawaii to resupply and be inspected by Commodore Stockton. Brannan expected the inspection to go badly but instead Commodore Stockton spoke to Brannan about the United States planned assault of the Mexicans at Monterey. This information along with Commodore Stockton's quiet encouragement lead Samuel Brannan to the idea of taking the port town of Yerba Buena. Brannan's dreams of colonization and success were underway and after leaving Hawaii, the Brookyln changed routes, landing on July 31, 1846, at the Mexican port town of Yerba Buena. Upon arrival they were met by Commander John B. Montgomery and the Portsmouth who had taken Yerba Buena only a few days before much to Brannan's dismay. The Mormons began colonizing the area (present-day San Francisco) and tripled the population of the pueblo.|$|E

5|$|Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial {{writers have}} {{reported}} in their chronicles {{the use of}} tunjos for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the New Kingdom of Granada have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies. Caciques of Tuta, Toca, Duitama, Iguaque, Ramiriquí, Chitagoto, Onzaga, Tunja and Cucunubá participated in these rituals. The <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> of Sogamoso was still the most important in these days.|$|E
5|$|Brigitte Boisselier (born 1956), {{also known}} as Brigitte Roehr, is a French chemist and Raëlian <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> {{best known for her}} claim to have overseen the {{creation}} of the first human clone. A native of Champagne-Ardenne, she studied chemistry in France and the United States, earning two PhDs. From 1984 to 1997, she lived near Paris and worked as a research chemist and a sales manager for Air Liquide. She embraced Raëlism in 1992; the group was unpopular in France and her conversion led to tensions with those around her. Five years later, she joined Clonaid, a Raëlian organization that sought to clone a human. After her service as their scientific director was publicized, she lost her position with Air Liquide and focused on cloning full-time.|$|E
5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not follow him as a <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> and were not members of the Ansar movement. By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and the attendees {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E

5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a <b>religious</b> <b>leader,</b> rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdist Rebellion {{broke out}} in 1881 when a <b>religious</b> <b>leader,</b> the self-proclaimed Mahdi, {{declared}} a jihad against the Egyptian government, which had been subject to British domination since {{the construction of the}} Suez Canal around a decade earlier. Leveraging widespread resentment towards European influence in Egypt and preaching renewal of the Islamic faith, the Mahdi began to accumulate followers and soon presented a serious threat to the government. Early Egyptian-led efforts to suppress the movement failed spectacularly, and their humiliating defeat {{at the hands of the}} outnumbered, outgunned, and undersupplied Mahdist force only increased their leader's fame and reputation.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} numerous subplots which largely {{serve as}} {{means for the}} player to earn money. For example, the player can choose to locate and retrieve a stolen icon {{on behalf of a}} <b>religious</b> <b>leader</b> in exchange for a reward. Other methods to earn money include stripping the corpses of slain opponents for marketable items, killing wanted criminals to earn a reward, and attacking other vessels in space to pirate their cargo. Gameplay {{in the early stages of}} the game primarily involves activities of this nature so that the player can accumulate enough money to outfit the party with better weapons and armor and purchase a jump drive capable of propelling the party's spacecraft to other worlds crucial to obtaining the means to stop Kiefer.|$|E
