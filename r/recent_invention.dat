At the same time, Lawrence's <b>recent</b> <b>invention,</b> the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.|$|E

25|$|Books {{constantly}} occur, {{most frequently}} {{in the arms of}} colleges and universities, though the Gospel and Bible are sometimes distinguished. Books if open may be inscribed with words. Words and phrases are otherwise rare, except in Spanish and Portuguese armory. Letters of the various alphabets are also relatively rare. Arms of merchants in Poland and eastern Germany are often based on house marks, abstract symbols resembling runes, though they are almost never blazoned as runes, but as combinations of other heraldic charges. Musical instruments commonly seen are the harp (as in the coat of arms of Ireland), bell and trumpet. The drum, almost without exception, is of the field drum type. Since musical notation is a comparatively <b>recent</b> <b>invention,</b> it is not found in early heraldry, though it does appear in 20th century heraldry.|$|E

2500|$|Third, printed secular {{music had}} become widely {{available}} in Italy due to the <b>recent</b> <b>invention</b> of moveable type and the printing press. [...] The music being written and sung, principally the frottola but also the ballata, canzonetta, and mascherata, was light, and typically used verses of relatively low literary quality. [...] These popular music styles used repetition and soprano-dominated chordal textures, styles considerably more simple than those used {{by most of the}} resident composers of the Franco-Flemish school. [...] Literary tastes were changing, and the more serious verse of Bembo and his school needed a means of musical expression more flexible and open than was available in the frottola and its related forms.|$|E

[...] The ailerons were of the differential kind, a <b>recent</b> <b>invention,</b> with less downward movement than upward. Both wing sets were built up around two spruce spars; the only novelty was that the rear spar was not straight but came in two joined sections, the outer part swept forward to meet the forward spar at the wingtip. [...] The wings were hinged to the lower longerons and braced {{by a pair of}} streamlined steel tubes from spars to upper longerons.|$|E
2500|$|Within suits, {{there are}} {{regional}} or national variations called [...] "standard patterns" [...] {{because they are}} in the public domain, allowing multiple card manufacturers to copy them. Pattern differences are most easily found in the face cards but the number of cards per deck, the use of numeric indices, or even minor shape and arrangement differences of the pips can be used to distinguish them. Some patterns have been around for hundreds of years. Jokers are not part of any pattern as they are a relatively <b>recent</b> <b>invention</b> and lack any standardized appearance so each publisher usually puts their own trademarked illustration into their decks. The wide variation of jokers has turned them into collectible items. Any card that bore the stamp duty like the ace of spades in England or the ace of clubs in France are also collectible as that is where the manufacturer's logo is usually placed.|$|E

2500|$|The Bohemian Method is a <b>recent</b> <b>invention</b> that {{involves}} fire, {{and was not}} performed during absinthe's peak of popularity in the Belle Époque. Like the French method, a sugar cube is placed on a slotted spoon over a glass containing one shot of absinthe. The sugar is pre-soaked in alcohol (usually more absinthe), then set ablaze. The flaming sugar cube is then dropped into the glass, thus igniting the absinthe. Finally, a shot glass of water is added to douse the flames. This method tends to produce a stronger drink than the French method. A variant of the Bohemian Method involves allowing the fire to extinguish on its own. This variant is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Cooking the Absinthe" [...] or [...] "The Flaming Green Fairy." [...] The origin of this burning ritual may borrow from a coffee and brandy drink that was served at Café Brûlot, in which a sugar cube soaked in brandy was set aflame. Most experienced absintheurs do not recommend the Bohemian Method and consider it a modern gimmick, as it can destroy the absinthe flavour and present a fire hazard due to the unusually high alcohol content present in absinthe.|$|E

60|$|The {{philosophy}} called Positive {{is not a}} <b>recent</b> <b>invention</b> of M. Comte, but {{a simple}} adherence to the traditions of all the great scientific minds whose discoveries have made the human race what it is. M. Comte has never presented it in any other light. But he has made the doctrine his own by his manner of treating it. To know rightly what a thing is, we require to know, with equal distinctness, what it is not. To enter into the real character of any mode of thought, we must understand what other modes of thought compete with it. M. Comte has taken care that we should do so. The modes of philosophizing which, according to him, dispute ascendancy with the Positive, are two in number, both of them anterior to it in date; the Theological, and the Metaphysical.|$|E

These delicate adjustments of the balance, by which we strive to weigh to a grain the relative quantities of devotion which we may render in the service of Mammon and of God, are wholly of <b>recent</b> <b>invention</b> and application; nor have they the slightest bearing, either on the spiritual purport of the final commandment of the Decalogue, or on the distinctness of the subsequent prohibition of practical usury.|$|E

Hence the necessity of our meeting; for I need not remind you what enormous issues depend upon the nice adjustment of the engine. I set our little petard for half an hour, the scene of action being hard by; and, the better to avert miscarriage, employed a device, a <b>recent</b> <b>invention</b> of my own, by which the opening of the Gladstone bag in which the bomb was carried should instantly determine the explosion. M'Guire was somewhat dashed by this arrangement, which was new to him: and pointed out, with excellent, clear good sense, that should he be arrested, it would probably involve him in the fall of our opponents. But I was not to be moved, made a strong appeal to his patriotism, gave him a good glass of whisky, and despatched him on his glorious errand.|$|E
40|$|The {{geography}} of duplicated inventions: evidence from patent citations. Regional Studies. Innovators often claim inventions that {{turn out to}} duplicate, at least in part, existing ones. This paper advances the claim that for <b>recent</b> and upcoming <b>inventions,</b> competitive incentives are high, and localized knowledge flows increase the probability of duplication. Therefore, over {{a brief period of}} time the probability of duplication is higher at short geographical distance. Conversely, the duplication of less <b>recent</b> <b>inventions</b> is more likely at long distance as a consequence of a lower awareness of the existence of a technology. This claim is supported by coherent descriptive and multivariate evidence using data on patent citation categories from the European Patent Office (EPO) ...|$|R

In metal spinning, a wood or metal spinning mandrel is used, the form of which corresponds with the internal contour of the part to be produced.

Since the material is clamped internally, there is no interference to the operator from the lathe/mandrel assembly during production.|$|R
