Rotor bearing stability characteristics were evaluated at different loads to assure and verify a stable rotor bearing configuration. Predicted rotor response was also compared with those obtained during the test.

In addition, the control of the <b>radial</b> <b>thrust</b> of the legs can be a simple, effective method for stabilizing the body pitch in a running gait. This paper presents the mechanical systems, models and control strategies employed to generate and control leg thrust in the KOLT quadruped running robot. An analytical model of the electro-pneumatic leg thrusting system is presented and analyzed to evaluate its performance and to facilitate the design of control strategies. Several experiments have been conducted to estimate the energy losses and determine their origins as well as to compute the energetic efficiency of the actuation system. Two thrust control methods are also proposed and tested experimentally. The closed loop method regulates thrust through the control of the hip liftoff speed, a conceptually simple control strategy that stabilizes the body pitch in pronk and trot gaits without the need for central feedback, even on irregular terrain. The open-loop control method regulates the energy added in each hop based on the model of the actuator system. The efficacy of these models and techniques is tested in several planar trot and pronk experiments, and the results are analyzed focusing on the body stabilization, the power consumption and the energetic efficiency. © SAGE Publications 2008 Los Angeles.

40|$|Four popular tectonic {{models are}} {{discussed}} {{that attempt to}} explain the formation of arc-backarc systems. These systems develop in a convergent setting with shortening in the forearc region, extension in the backarc region, and progressive out-bowing of the arc. The models include the gravitational collapse model, the rollback model, the extrusion tectonics model, and the orogen-parallel compression model. The rollback model can explain the progressive development of most arcs, such as {{those found in the}} Western Pacific and the Mediterranean, in combination with backarc extension. Slab rollback ultimately is a consequence of the negative buoyancy of the slab. Collapse models can explain <b>radial</b> <b>thrusting</b> in the foreland and exten-sional deformation in high-standing mountain belts, since these regions involve large potential energy contrasts between mountain range and foreland. However, these models cannot explain the development of Western Pacific and Mediterranean style arc-backarc systems. In such settings, the extending region has a small potential energy, which cannot drive arc formation, fore-arc shortening, and backarc extension. The extrusion tectonics model can explain strike-slip structures such as those observed in the Eastern Alps, Anatolia, and East Asia, but fails to explain backarc extension. The extrusion of a wedge cannot produce shortening at its leading edge contemporaneously with extension {{in the middle of the}} wedge. The orogen-parallel compression model cannot explain arc formation and backarc extension, since an orogen does not behave elastically in the plane of the lithosphere at a length scale of ∼≥ 1000 km...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDespite the {{importance}} of the Pamir range in controlling Asian paleoenvironments and land-sea paleogeography, its tectonic evolution remains poorly constrained in time and space, hindering its potential for understanding deep to surface processes. We provide here new constraints on vertical-axis tectonic rotations from the southwest Tarim Basin along the eastern flank of the Pamir arcuate range based on paleomagnetic results. Two well-dated Eocene to Oligocene sections, previously analyzed using biostratigraphy andmagnetostratigraphy, yield consistently clockwise rotations of 21. 6 ± 4. 2 ° in 41 to 36 Ma strata then 17. 1 ± 6. 5 ° in 33 to 28 Ma strata at the Aertashi section and 14. 2 ± 11. 5 ° in 41 to 40 Ma strata at the Kezi section. Combined with a regional review of existing paleomagnetic studies, these results indicate that most of the clockwise rotations along the eastern Pamir occurred during Oligocene times and did not extend systematically and regionally into the TarimBasin. In contrast, on the western flank of the Pamir tectonic rotations in Cretaceous to Neogene strata are regionally extensive and systematically counterclockwise throughout the Afghan-Tajik Basin. This timing and pattern of rotations is consistent with paleogeographic reconstructions of the regional sea retreat out of Central Asia and supports a two-stage kinematic model: (1) symmetric rotations of either flanks of the Pamir arcuate range until Oligocene times followed by (2) continued rotations on its western flank associated with <b>radial</b> <b>thrusting</b> and, along the eastern flank, no further rotations due to decoupled transfer slip starting in the Early Miocene...|$|R
