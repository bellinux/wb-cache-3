For estimating rain attenuation two important parameters, viz., the point rainfall rates and the vertical and horizontal structures of rain have been considered.

Taking the frequencies 11 to 14 GHz separately and 00 C isotherm height as 5. 0 km, the effective rain height values are determined. The attenuation of radio waves due to rain are calculated for different rain rates assigning different γ-values. The attenuation is found to vary significantly with the γ-values. Also the attenuation curves are closer when the γ-values are of low order. An increase in attenuation with the γ-values is found to be more prominent for higher rain rates...|$|R

In fact only a {{little is known about}} differences in <b>rain</b> <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities between land and sea {{due to a lack of}} suitable data over the sea. To fill in this gap measurements were performed during the recent 10 years at different locations in Germany and on board of research vessels over the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean. Measurements were done by using an optical disdrometer (ODM 470, Großklaus et al., 1998), which is designed especially to perform precipitation measurements on moving ships and under high wind speeds. Temporal resolution of measurements is generally 1 minute, total number of time series is about 220000. To investigate differences in <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities over land and over sea measurements have been divided into four classes on the basis of prevailing continental or maritime influence: land measurements, coastal measurements, measurements in areas of semi-enclosed seas, and open sea measurements.

A Kolmogoroff Smirnoff test does not give any significant difference between <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> densities over land, coastal areas, semi-enclosed, and open seas at an error rate of 5 %.

Gamma model {{parameters}} N 0, µ and Λ are determined through measured data for ten different averaged rain rates. The estimates from the method of moments are obtained by equating {{a sufficient number of}} measured moments to the corresponding theoretical moments. The estimated parameters show that the gamma model parameter µ varies very slowly compared to the other two parameters. This slow varying parameter varies between 3. 03 and 9. 30 for rain rates from 1. 50 mm/hr to 147. 70 mm/hr for the tropical region of Singapore. In this paper, an attempt is made to simplify the modified gamma model with moment estimator by keeping this slow varying parameter µ as a constant. This study is performed using various constant µ values of 3, 4. 58 and 5 to model <b>rain</b> <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> distribution along with the calculated µ values based on the measured DSD for all the considered rain rates. Fixed µ models deviate more from measured DSD for the lower three rain rates, except µ= 4. 58 which models well only at 4. 99 mm/hr. Root mean square errors (RMSE) are calculated to compare modeled DSD with the measured data. RMSE calculations along with <b>rain</b> <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> distributions show that modified gamma model can be used to model Singapore’s DSD with fixed µ= 4. 58 and µ= 5 for all the rain rates from 99. 55 mm/hr to 147. 70 mm/hr and µ= 3 for all the rain rates from 23. 29 mm/hr to 76. 15 mm/hr.

Typically, models utilize an average <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> distribution, such as those developed by Laws and Parsons, or Marshall and Palmer. However, individual rain events may possess <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> distributions which could be significantly different from the average and will impact, for example, fade mitigation techniques which utilize channel performance estimates from a signal at a different frequency. Therefore, a good understanding of the characteristics and variability of the raindrop size distribution is extremely important in predicting rain attenuation and instantaneous frequency scaling parameters on an event-toevent basis.

Filter paper staining techniques were used to measure <b>rain</b> <b>drop</b> <b>size</b> distributions and calculate rainfall intensity and total kinetic energy for rainstorms under open sky and closed canopy conditions in an area of lowland dipterocarp forest. The results show a positive correlation between median <b>drop</b> <b>size,</b> rainfall intensity and kinetic energy for open sky situations, consistent with studies from elsewhere.

For closed canopy situations there is no such relationship in rainfall parameters, all drops being around 5. 5 mm in diameter regardless of rainfall in tensity. With interception losses of 29 % in the study area, the modification to total kinetic energy following forest disturbance can be assessed. The results show that above rainfall intensities of 20 mm h⁻¹, open sky rainfall is more erosive than that falling through the canopy. Since most rainstorms are above 20 mm h⁻¹ canopy disturbance is likely to increase erosion rates, and needs to be included when modelling soil erosion.

The vertical looking radiometers will give vertical path attenuation due to rain as well as dust and line of sight link will give horizontal path attenuation whereas the satellite link gives slant path attenuation. In this present paper the methodology of collecting data and methodology for obtaining slant path attenuation using data obtained from vertically looking radiometers and horizontal line of sight links will be given. Validation methodology for the slant path attenuation using beacon receiver will be given...|$|R
