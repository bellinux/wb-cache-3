5|$|Article Two, {{initially}} <b>ratified</b> <b>by</b> {{seven states}} through 1792 (including Kentucky), was not <b>ratified</b> <b>by</b> another state for eighty years. The Ohio General Assembly ratified it on May 6, 1873 {{in protest of}} an unpopular Congressional pay raise. A century later, on March 6, 1978, the Wyoming Legislature also ratified the article. Gregory Watson, a University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student, started a new push for the article's ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures. As a result, by May 1992, enough states had approved Article Two (38 of the 50 states in the Union) for it to become the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment's adoption was certified by Archivist of the United States Don W. Wilson and subsequently affirmed {{by a vote of}} Congress on May 20, 1992.|$|E
