Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago.

5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, {{the only}} {{members of the}} genus Rhinoceros, first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago. Molecular estimates, however, suggest the two species diverged from each other much earlier, around 11.7 million years ago. Although {{belonging}} to the type genus, the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized {{that they may be}} closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino. Other studies have suggested the Sumatran rhinoceros is more closely related to the two African species. The Sumatran rhino may have diverged from the other Asian rhinos 15 million years ago, or as far back as 25.9 million years ago based on mitochondrial data.|$|E
5|$|The {{superfamily}} Rhinocerotoidea, {{which includes}} modern rhinoceroses, {{can be traced}} back to the early Eoceneabout 50 million years agowith early precursors such as Hyrachyus. Rhinocerotoidea contains three families; Amynodontidae, <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> ("true rhinoceroses"), and Hyracodontidae. The diversity within the rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times; they ranged from dog-sized to the size of Paraceratherium. There were long-legged, cursorial forms adapted for running and squat, semi aquatic forms. Most species did not have horns. Rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth, which is the part of the animals most likely to be preserved. The upper molars of most rhinoceroses have a pi-shaped (π) pattern on the crown, and each lower molar has paired L-shapes. Various skull features are also used for identification of fossil rhinoceroses.|$|E
25|$|The Ceratomorpha are {{so-called}} {{because their}} families, {{such as the}} <b>Rhinocerotidae,</b> of which Elasmotherium is indisputably one, are characterised {{by the presence of}} hooves, or horns and hooves, made of keratin, the same substance of which hair is made. These keratin structures appear to have formed in the Mesozoic, a remnant in humans being the nails. A keratin horn is to be distinguished from a bone horn and a tusk. Bone forms the base of most horns, but in some cases the horn is entirely of bone. A tusk is a modified canine or incisor tooth. <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> have had tusks, but not Elasmotherium. Two open questions are whether they were horned or hornless, hairy or hairless. Most <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> have and have had horns, but there are some instances of hornlessness, and most are or were hairy, such as the woolly rhinoceros, but no instances of hair or horn have yet been found for Elasmotherium. Only circumstantial evidence of them exists.|$|E
25|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} first diverged {{from other}} perissodactyls in the Early Eocene.

The extant family, the <b>Rhinocerotidae,</b> {{first appeared in the}} Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> follows {{a very similar}} pattern to the {{evolution of}} the Equidae, both being facets of the evolution of mammalian herbivores during the Cenozoic. The overall pattern is based on the evolutionary development of grass and grassland, and further the changing distribution of C3 and C4 types of plant metabolism, so-called because they generate a molecule containing three or four Carbon atoms by different metabolic pathways (sequences of chemical reactions).|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, C4 {{metabolism}} was well established on the plains. In {{place of the}} prehistoric C3 grasslands (which are no longer extant) was the savanna, today's subtropical mixture of grasses and sedges. The deciding factors in this turn of evolution were a documented increase in temperature and aridity over the period. Faced with scant nutrition from browsing, the smaller <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> and Equidae declined in diversity, the gate in that direction, so to speak, now being closed.|$|E

500|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} (Rhinoceros sondaicus), {{also known}} as the Sunda rhinoceros or lesser one-horned rhinoceros, is a very rare member of the family <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> and one of five extant rhinoceroses.

500|$|The Sumatran {{rhinoceros}}, {{also known}} as the hairy rhinoceros or Asian two-horned rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), is a rare member of the family <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> and one of five extant rhinoceroses. It is the only extant species of the genus Dicerorhinus. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands [...] high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of [...] and a tail of [...] The weight is reported to range from , averaging , although there is a single record of a [...] specimen. Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically , while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>Rhinocerotidae</b> and Equidae in the Miocene grasslands proceeded along parallel lines from similar causes. Diminutive, cursorial, browsing, brachydont species expanded their ranges from the Oligocene forests into the nutritious C3 Miocene grasslands and there over {{the millions of}} years of the Miocene evolved diverse and flourishing populations on the ample food supply, gradually increasing in size. Some of these species exploited the grazing niche. Hispanotherium, Chilotherium and Teleoceras [...] "show a clear tendency to hypsodonty, and a grazing feeding adaptation has usually been attributed to them".|$|E
2500|$|The known {{specimens}} of E. sibiricum reach up to [...] in body length with shoulder heights over [...] while E. caucasicum reaches at least [...] in body length {{with an estimated}} mass of , based on isolated molars that significantly exceed those known from the Siberian species. Both species were among {{the largest in the}} family <b>Rhinocerotidae,</b> comparable in size to the woolly mammoth and larger than the contemporary woolly rhinoceros. The feet were unguligrade, the front larger than the rear, with 4 digits at the front and 3 at the rear.|$|E
2500|$|A third type of {{evidence}} that Elasmotherium was a grazer is that of tooth wear and morphology. Like all <b>Rhinocerotidae,</b> E. had cheek teeth evolved for herbivory: two premolars and three molars (originally taken for five molars), no incisors, no canines. Where some of the browsers kept the incisors {{in the form of}} tusks, E, had instead a spoon-like symphysis, or tip, of the lower mandible and a rostrum, or beak, of the upper, which served as a bony basis for a soft-tissue labial grasping and tearing mechanism. Grass, a very tough, fibrous material, contains phytoliths, microscopic granules mainly of silica, which act as sandpaper on the molars of grazers. Their response in geologic time is to evolve cheek teeth with large crowns (hypsodonty). There appears to be a correlation between grazing and hypsodonty: ...|$|E
2500|$|Hieronymus found annular rugosities in {{all living}} and some fossil <b>Rhinocerotidae.</b> The rings had {{previously}} been noted on additional fossils. To date Elasmotherium has not been examined for rings under lighting designed to show them up; however, based on the observations of other palaeontologists, the author says [...] "squamosal rugosity" [...] is the [...] "most pronounced cranial rugosity in the elasmotherine lineage". This fact suggests an especially firm attachment was required, which, combined with the extraordinarily large hump of muscle for managing the head, could suggest a large and heavy horn. In the early 19th century {{the state of the}} fossils had not yet revealed the presence of a horn. From around 1910 and ever since then, palaeontologists have not ventured a mathematical estimate but rather have preferred occasionally to refer to the horn as immense, enormous, great or huge (these words turn up more often in popularising works than in scientific articles). As {{the size and shape of}} the horn would depend on the concentration of melanin and calcium, and no known indicator of those remains, any further estimate of horn morphology is purely speculative.|$|E
60|$|Let us now {{endeavour}} to {{find some}} cases of true linear types, or forms which are intermediate between others because they stand in a direct genetic relation to them. It is no easy matter to find clear and unmistakable evidence of filiation among fossil animals; for, in order that such evidence should be quite satisfactory, {{it is necessary that}} we should be acquainted with all the most important features of the organization of the animals which are supposed to be thus related, and not merely with the fragments upon which the genera and species of the palaeontologist are so often based. M. Gaudry has arranged the species of Hyaenidae, Proboscidea, <b>Rhinocerotidae,</b> and Equidae in their order of filiation from their earliest appearance in the Miocene epoch to the present time, and Professor Rütimeyer has drawn up similar schemes for the Oxen and other Ungulata--with what, I am disposed to think, is a fair and probable approximation to the order of nature. But, as no one is better aware than these two learned, acute, and philosophical biologists, all such arrangements must be regarded as provisional, except in those cases in which, by a fortunate accident, large series of remains are obtainable from a thick and wide-spread series of deposits. It is easy to accumulate probabilities--hard to make out some particular case {{in such a way that}} it will stand rigorous criticism.|$|E
