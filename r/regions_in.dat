5|$|Croatia can be {{subdivided}} {{between a}} number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently {{one of the richest}} in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} via infected blood products and through organ donation.

Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue emerging in new <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> recent decades.|$|E
