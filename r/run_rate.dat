50|$|Therefore, tournament NRR can {{alternatively}} {{be thought}} of as the weighted average of the <b>run</b> <b>rates</b> scored in each match (weighted by the lengths of the innings batted compared to the other innings batted), minus the weighted average of the <b>run</b> <b>rates</b> conceded in each match (weighted by the lengths of the innings bowled compared to the other innings bowled). Each time another match is played, the weights of the previous innings reduce, and so the contributions of the previous innings to overall NRR reduce.|$|R

25|$|A fine left-handed middle-order batsman and {{deliverer}} of right-arm slow-medium deliveries, Harris rescued the New Zealand team's batting {{on numerous}} occasions and his deceptive looping bowling often restricted the <b>run</b> <b>rates</b> of opposition batting line-ups.|$|R
5|$|The rest day was {{followed}} by the fourth day, which was abandoned due to persistent rain. Yardley declared {{at the start of the}} fifth day, leaving Australia a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire first session was lost. Young removed Johnson for six to leave Australia 10/1, but the tourists thereafter batted safely in a defensive manner to ensure a draw. They ended at 92/1 in 61 overs, a <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> of 1.50, which was the slowest innings <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> to date in the series. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series. The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test.|$|E
5|$|After taking match {{figures of}} 6/117 and 5/140 for India A against Sri Lanka A, Kartik {{made his first}} {{overseas}} appearance for India, replacing the injured Harbhajan midway through the 2003–04 tour of Australia. He had little success in his first tour match, taking 1/64 and 1/53 against Australian A. He played in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground when India fielded two spinners for {{the only time in}} the series. He was punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of1/211 from 45 overs, a <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> of 4.68, in a high-scoring draw.|$|E
5|$|As {{they were}} playing a four-man bowling attack, and had spent longer in the field than they had wanted, England opted not to enforce the follow-on. Batting again, England pressed to score quickly, but were pegged back by regular dismissals: no batsman scored more than 40 runs, and the <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> was {{much the same as}} their first innings. Shakib Al Hasan claimed four wickets, and England batting 50 minutes into the fourth morning before declaring on 209 for 7, leaving Bangladesh {{requiring}} 513 runs in their second innings to win.|$|E

50|$|The NRR in {{a single}} game is the average runs per over that a team scores, minus the average runs per over that is scored against them. The NRR in a tournament is the average runs per over that a team scores across the whole tournament, minus the average runs per over that is scored against them across the whole tournament. This {{is the same as}} the {{weighted}} average of the <b>run</b> <b>rates</b> scored in each match (weighted by the lengths of the innings batted compared to the other innings batted), minus the weighted average of the <b>run</b> <b>rates</b> conceded in each match (weighted by the lengths of the innings bowled compared to the other innings bowled).

5|$|Play {{finally began}} after the tea, and the pitch played very slowly {{because of the}} excess moisture. As Australia had no {{intention}} of chasing the runs, England captain Norman Yardley often installed seven men in close catching positions. In the first half-hour, the tourists showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Johnson then fell for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Bradman came to the crease and played 11 balls without scoring while Morris scored two streaky fours from Bedser. Yardley used his spinners for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike by taking singles. The Australian skipper faced only eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled when his partner wanted a single that he sent him back. Thereafter, the tourists batted steadily and defensively to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 from 61 overs, a <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> of 1.50, with 35 maidens; this was the slowest innings <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> for the series to date. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century during the Test series. The match finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions.|$|E

She was used as a specialist batsman in the top-order, as Leonie Coleman, a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against South Australia and was unsuccessful to begin with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five innings. After one month at senior level, she broke through with a match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After Queensland had made 170, Healy came in with the score at 5/99 after 32 overs, with 18 overs remaining. She raised the <b>run</b> <b>rate,</b> scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight fours, shepherding the tail-enders and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 balls to spare.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Healy stumped leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj {{from the}} bowling of Sthalekar and was not {{required}} to bat as Australia reached their target of 120 with seven wickets and seven balls to spare. Australia elected to bat first in the final against New Zealand, but was top-order struggled and Healy came to the crease to join Elliott at 5/51 in the 13th over {{after the fall of}} two wickets in quick succession. The pair lifted the <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> by adding 21 runs in 18 balls. Healy scored 10 from as many balls, but was then run out attempting a second run after being dropped by Sara McGlashan in the outfield. This left the score at 6/72 in the 16th over, and Australia eventually ended on 8/106.|$|E

5|$|England and New Zealand met {{each other}} in the first match of the Super Sixes. England batted first, and despite being 96 for four at one stage, 57 runs from captain Charlotte Edwards, and a rapid 22 runs from Gunn, helped their side recover to post a total of 201 for five. In response, New Zealand began positively, and were boosted by a half-century from their captain, Tiffen, but the spin bowling of Edwards, Marsh and Colvin {{controlled}} the <b>run</b> <b>rate,</b> and New Zealand were eventually bowled out for 170, Edwards taking four wickets. England's following match was against the West Indies, and they once again surpassed 200 runs after batting first. Sarah Taylor, Claire Taylor and Atkins all scored half-centuries to propel England to their total of 236 for eight. The English bowlers then dismissed the West Indies for 90 runs, with Marsh collecting three wickets. The win secured England a place in the final, irrespective of the result in their final match against Australia.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the fourth day, England set about extending their lead. Early in the innings, the capacity crowd encroached substantially onto the ground and the umpires spent eight minutes trying to force them back {{to the edge of the}} official playing area, but they again spilled over. Initially, Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously to see off the new ball before trying to lift the <b>run</b> <b>rate.</b> Lindwall's first two overs were maidens, but Hutton and Washbrook scored 21 runs from his next five overs, while taking only five from Miller's six overs. The English batsmen attacked the bowling and reinforced their aggressive strokeplay with quick running. England reached lunch at 72/0 with Hutton on 40 and Washbrook on 28. Washbrook was particularly confident and Bradman decided to not risk Johnson in the morning session.|$|E
5|$|In response, Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal for a duck in {{the first}} over, giving debutant Ajmal Shahzad his first ODI wicket from his third ball of the match. Bresnan removed the other Bangladeshi opener in the 10th over, {{the first of his}} four wickets in the match. This wicket brought {{together}} Mushfiqur Rahim and Aftab Ahmed, who both played aggressively, putting on 56 together in the next ten overs, but when Aftab Ahmed was run out looking for a non-existent run, Bangladesh started to struggle. Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan both fell after making good starts and the required <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> started to rise, making a Bangladeshi victory look improbable. Slow scoring between Naeem Islam and Mahmudullah took victory further away, and Bangladesh eventually finished 45 runs short of their target, granting England a series whitewash.|$|E

5|$|Laker to {{this point}} had taken 3/22 from 12.4 overs. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would {{throughout}} the day. Yardley set a defensive field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman. Yardley took Laker out of the attack and took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes but the <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> remained low. Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brown leg before wicket in his first over. Hassett came in at 185/4 and Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets.|$|E
5|$|Miller had a quiet match. He did not bowl in {{the first}} innings as England batted first and posted 363. The closest {{he came to a}} catch was when Yardley edged to him in slips on the half-volley. When Australia batted, he came to the crease and joined Morris with the score at 3/82 and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps on the second day. He was on 23 and Morris had made 48. The <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> picked up in the last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time. The next day, Australia {{struggled}} against the new ball {{in the first}} hour. Miller was beaten three times in one Bedser over before Dick Pollard trapped him for 31, prompting a middle-order collapse of 3/37, before the tourists recovered to end at 221, avoiding the follow on by eight runs.|$|E

5|$|The Australians then toured South Africa {{the next}} month and {{it was during the}} First Test in Johannesburg that Gilchrist broke the record for the fastest double century in Tests on 23 February, {{requiring}} 212 balls for the feat. This was eight balls quicker than Ian Botham's innings against India at The Oval in 1982. He ended unbeaten on 204, having featured in a partnership of 317 with Damien Martyn at a <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> of 5.5. South Africa were demoralised and lost by an innings after being forced to follow on.

5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high <b>run</b> <b>rate</b> during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E
5|$|Australia bowled England out for 215 at the {{beginning}} of the third day to take a 135-run first innings lead. This had increased to 431 when Miller came to the crease with the score at 3/296 during the afternoon. English captain Yardley was on a hat-trick, having removed Hassett first ball after the fall of Barnes. Miller survived a loud lbw appeal on the hat-trick ball before hitting a six into the grandstand and reaching stumps on 22, with Australia at 4/329. He resumed on the fourth morning and reached lunch on 63 with the tourists at 4/409. Miller was reprieved when Tom Dollery dropped a catch from a ball he skied into the air. When the new ball was taken, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, to lift the <b>run</b> <b>rate.</b> Miller repeatedly hooked Coxon and drove Bedser for many runs. After lunch, he hit out at every opportunity before the declaration. He was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from the bowling of Laker. Australia declared at 7/460 to set England a target of 596.|$|E

We find that growth in Kenya, until the 1990 s was mainly due to factor accumulation. Since then, TFP has made a small contribution to growth. Our findings imply that while variables like overseas development aid, foreign direct investment and progress of financial sector improves TFP, trade openness is the key determinant.
