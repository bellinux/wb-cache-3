60|$|Arnus Beaton's studio {{looked at}} first glance like many other painters' studios. A gray wall quadrangularly vaulted to a large north light; casts of feet, hands, faces hung to nails about; prints, {{sketches}} in oil and water-color stuck here and there lower down; a rickety table, with paint and palettes and bottles of varnish and siccative tossed comfortlessly on it; an easel, with a strip of some faded mediaeval silk trailing from it; a lay figure simpering in incomplete nakedness, with its head on one side, and a stocking on one leg, and a Japanese dress dropped before it; dusty rugs and skins kicking over the varnished floor; canvases faced to the mop-board; an open trunk overflowing with costumes: these features one might notice anywhere. But, besides, there was a bookcase with an unusual number of books in it, {{and there was an}} open colonial writing-desk, claw-footed, brass-handled, and scutcheoned, with foreign periodicals--French and English--littering its leaf, and some pages of manuscript scattered among them. Above all, there was a sculptor's <b>revolving</b> <b>stand,</b> supporting a bust which Beaton was modelling, with an eye fixed as simultaneously as possible on the clay and on the head of the old man who sat on the platform beside it.|$|E

60|$|The Manxman {{took the}} reel, and holding it high up, by the {{projecting}} handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line <b>revolved,</b> so <b>stood</b> with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes slaves <b>stood</b> on <b>revolving</b> <b>stands,</b> {{and around}} each slave for sale hung {{a type of}} plaque {{describing}} his or her origin, health, character, intelligence, education, and other information pertinent to purchasers. Prices varied with age and quality, with the most valuable slaves fetching prices equivalent to thousands of today's dollars. Because the Romans wanted {{to know exactly what}} they were buying, slaves were presented naked. The dealer was required to take a slave back within six months if the slave had defects that were not manifest at the sale, or make good the buyer's loss. Slaves to be sold with no guarantee were made to wear a cap at the auction.|$|R

60|$|Uriel. Gabriel, if now {{the watch}} be set, prepare, With strictest guard, to shew thy utmost care. This morning came a spirit, fair he seemed, Whom, by his face, I some young cherub deemed; Of man he much inquired, and where his place, With shews of zeal to praise his Maker's grace; But I, with watchful eyes, {{observed}} his flight, And {{saw him on}} yon steepy mount alight; There, as he thought, unseen, he laid aside His borrowed mask, and re-assumed his pride: I marked his looks, averse to heaven and good; Dusky he grew, and long <b>revolving</b> <b>stood</b> On some deep, dark design; thence shot with haste, And o'er the mounds of Paradise he past: By his proud port, he seemed the Prince of Hell; And here he lurks in shades 'till night: Search well Each grove and thicket, pry in every shape, Lest, hid in some, the arch hypocrite escape.|$|R

50|$|The Furama Kempinski Hotel, {{famous for}} its <b>revolving</b> restaurant, {{formerly}} <b>stood</b> on the same lot that the former AIG Tower rises from, but in December 2001, the 33-story hotel was demolished {{in order to make}} way for the AIG Tower.

(Still unable to stand without support, he makes his way past Cuthbertson to the <b>revolving</b> bookcase and <b>stands</b> there with his back to them, leaning on it with his head on his hand.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Next day at noon, in the Library of the Ibsen club. A spacious room, {{with glass}} doors right and left. At the back, in the middle, is the fireplace, surmounted by a {{handsome}} mantelpiece, with {{a bust of}} Ibsen, and decorated inscriptions of the titles of his plays. There are circular recesses at each side of fireplace, with divan seats running round them, and windows at the top, {{the space between the}} divan and the window sills being lined with books. A long settee is placed before the fire. Along the back of the settee, and touching it, is a green table, littered with journals. A <b>revolving</b> bookcase <b>stands</b> in the foreground, a little to the left, with an easy chair close to it. On the right, between the door and the recess, is a light library stepladder. Placards inscribed [...] "silence" [...] are conspicuously exhibited here and there.|$|R

Thus it {{was easy}} to bring the inducteous ball always to the same {{distance}} from the inductric bull, and to uninsulate and insulate it again in its place; and then, after measuring the force in the electrometer (1181.), to return it to its place opposite to the inductric ball for a second observation. Or {{it was easy}} by <b>revolving</b> the <b>stand</b> which supported the cube to bring four of its faces in succession towards the inductric ball, and so observe the force when the lines of inductive action (1304.) coincided with, or were transverse to, the direction of the optical axis of the crystal. Generally from twenty to twenty-eight observations were made in succession upon the four vertical faces of a cube, and then an average expression of the inductive force was obtained, and compared with similar averages obtained at other times, every precaution being taken to secure accurate results.|$|R
60|$|As the Captain, with a dejected face, <b>stood</b> <b>revolving</b> these thoughts, and {{polishing}} the Midshipman, partly in the tenderness of old acquaintance, and partly {{in the absence}} of his mind, a knocking at the shop-door communicated a frightful start to the frame of Rob the Grinder, seated on the counter, whose large eyes had been intently fixed on the Captain's face, and who had been debating within himself, for the five hundredth time, whether the Captain could have done a murder, that he had such an evil conscience, and was always running away.|$|R
5000|$|Li'l Missy Beaded Doll Kits {{were made}} in the early 1970s. The 6" [...] tall doll had a dylite form body that {{required}} no sewing.Each kits included pins, sequins, beads, colorful fabric, ribbons and trim. Other embellishments included flowers and fruit. There was a large variety of kits representing countries of the world, careers, holidays, birthdays, etc. These kits were a big hit with girls from ages 8 to 75. Additional accessories available were <b>revolving</b> plastic musical <b>stands,</b> plastic display domes and cardboard doll houses, some sold in a three doll package.|$|R
60|$|This screed, {{remarkable}} as it was, had {{no mystery}} for Goodwin. He {{was the most}} successful of the small advance-guard of speculative Americans that had invaded Anchuria, and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction. He had taken up political intrigue {{as a matter of}} business. He was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers, and he was prosperous {{enough to be able to}} purchase the respect of the petty office-holders. There was always a revolutionary party; and to it he had always allied himself; for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labours. There was now a Liberal party seeking to overturn President Miraflores. If the wheel successfully <b>revolved,</b> Goodwin <b>stood</b> to win a concession to 30,000 manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior. Certain incidents in the recent career of President Miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in Goodwin's mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution, and now Englehart's telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom.|$|R
60|$|Books {{open with}} torn pages bestrewed the floor; other books lay about grimy and black, {{looking as if}} they had never been opened. Account books. In those books he had {{intended}} to keep day by day a record of his rising fortunes. Long time ago. A very long time. For many years there has been no record to keep on the blue and red ruled pages! In {{the middle of the room}} the big office desk, with one of its legs broken, careened over like the hull of a stranded ship; most of the drawers had fallen out, disclosing heaps of paper yellow with age and dirt. The <b>revolving</b> office chair <b>stood</b> in its place, but he found the pivot set fast when he tried to turn it. No matter. He desisted, and his eyes wandered slowly from object to object. All those things had cost a lot of money at the time. The desk, the paper, the torn books, and the broken shelves, all under a thick coat of dust. The very dust and bones of a dead and gone business. He looked at all these things, all that was left after so many years of work, of strife, of weariness, of discouragement, conquered so many times. And all for what? He stood thinking mournfully of his past life till he heard distinctly the clear voice of a child speaking amongst all this wreck, ruin, and waste. He started with a great fear in his heart, and feverishly began to rake in the papers scattered on the floor, broke the chair into bits, splintered the drawers by banging them against the desk, and made a big heap of all that rubbish in one corner of the room.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is perhaps}} in a pious {{recognition}} of our mortality that Dublin is built around the Irish grave-yard. Most of its windows look out upon the sepulchral monuments and the pretty constant arrival of the funeral trains with their long lines of carriages bringing to {{the celebration of the}} sad ultimate rites those gay companies of Irish mourners. I suppose that the spectacle of such obsequies is not at all depressing to the inhabitants of Dublin; but that, on the contrary, it must beget in them a feeling which, if not resignation to death, is, at least, a sort of sub-acute cheerfulness in his presence. None but a Dubliner, however, would have been greatly animated by a scene which I witnessed during a stroll through this cemetery one afternoon of early spring. The fact that a marble slab or shaft more or less sculptured, and inscribed with words more or less helpless, is the utmost that we can give to one whom once we could caress with every tenderness of speech and touch, and that, after all, the memorial we raise is rather to our own grief, and is a decency, a mere conventionality,--this is a dreadful fact on which the heart breaks itself with such a pang, that it always seems a desolation never recognized, an anguish never felt before. Whilst I <b>stood</b> <b>revolving</b> this thought in my mind, and reading the Irish names upon the stones and the black head- boards,--the latter adorned with pictures of angels, once gilt, but now weather-worn down to the yellow paint,--a wail of intolerable pathos filled the air: [...] "O my darling, O my darling! O--O--O!" [...] with sobs and groans and sighs; and, looking about, I saw two women, one standing upright beside another that had cast herself upon a grave, and lay clasping it with her comfortless arms, uttering these cries. The grave was a year old at least, but the grief seemed of yesterday or of that morning. At times the friend that stood beside the prostrate woman stooped and spoke a soothing word to her, while she wailed out her woe; and in the midst some little ribald Irish boys came scuffling and quarreling up the pathway, singing snatches of an obscene song; and when both the wailing and the singing had died away, an old woman, decently clad, and with her many-wrinkled face softened by the old-fashioned frill running round the inside of her cap, dropped down upon her knees beside a very old grave, and clasped her hands in a silent prayer above it.|$|R
