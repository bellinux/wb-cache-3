40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Best scan {{available}} for {{black and white}} figures. Two examples of Pacific <b>rim</b> <b>plate</b> boundary deformation are presented. In {{the first part of}} the thesis crustal models are derived for the northwestern part of the Vizcaino block in California using marine seismic and gravity data collected by the Mendocino Triple Junction Seismic Experiment. A northwest-southeast trending kink in the Moho is imaged and interpreted to have formed under compression by reactivation of preexisting thrust faults in the paleoaccretionary prism at the seaward margin of the Vizcaino block. The study suggests that the deformation resulted from mainly north-south compression between the Pacific-Juan de Fuca plates across the Mendocino transform fault and predates late Pliocene Pacific-North America plate convergence. In the second part, 195 earthquakes recorded during the duration of the Southern Alps Passive Seismic Experiment (SAPSE) are analysed. Precise earthquake locations and focal mechanisms provide unprecedented detail of the seismotectonics in the central South Island. The short term (6 month) SAPSE seismicity is compared with long term (8 years) seismicity recorded by the New Zealand National Seismic network and the Lake Pukaki network. The seismicity rate of the Alpine fault is low, but comparable to locked sections of the San Andreas fault, with large earthquakes expected. Changes of the depth of the seismogenic zone, generally uniform at about 10 - 12 km, occur only localised over distances smaller than 30 km, suggesting that thermal perturbations must be of similar scale. This implies that the thermal effects of the uplift of the Southern Alps do not change the seismogenic depth significantly and are not in accordance with most of the present thermal models. Both the Hope and Porters Pass fault zones are seismically active and deformation is accommodated near the fault zones and in the adjacent crust. North of Mt Cook, a triangular shaped region along the Alpine fault is characterised by absence of earthquakes. We interpret this as the result of the plate boundary shift from the Alpine fault to the Hope and Porters Pass fault zones. The study region shows distributed deformation in a 60 - 100 km wide zone on NNE-SSW trending thrust faults and strike-slip mechanisms on transfer faults...|$|E

40|$|In December 1996, the Boiling Water Reactor Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP) issued BWRVIP- 25 [1], which {{provides}} a generic inspection strategy for boiling water reactor (BWR) core plates, and defines flaw evaluation methodologies. That report provides inspection/repair strategies for the core <b>plate</b> <b>rim</b> hold-down bolts that include installation of wedges, or periodic ultrasonic (UT) and/or visual (VT) examination. Carolina Power & Light Company (CP&L) has developed a plant specific inspection plan for the core <b>plate</b> <b>rim</b> holddown bolts.

40|$|Objective: Anatomic volar <b>rim</b> locking <b>plates</b> are {{designed}} {{with the aim of}} treating intraarticular distal radius fractures. When used to treat comminuted distal radius fractures, these plates can damage the flexor tendons. In this study, we sought to determine the radiological and functional results and rate of complications of these plates. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 36 patients (28 males, 8 females; mean age: 46. 4 years) with AO/OTA Type C 2 -C 3 distal radius fractures treated with anatomic volar <b>rim</b> distal radius <b>plates</b> between January 2011 and December 2014. Radial length, radial inclination and palmar tilt were compared with the intact wrist. Results were evaluated with the Mayo wrist and Lidstrom scores. Complications were documented throughout the follow-up period of 23. 8 (range: 12 to 48) months. Results: Postoperative measurements of the radial length, inclination and palmar tilt did not differ significantly. Mayo wrist and Lidstrom scores were good and excellent in 27 and 32 patients, respectively. Flexor tenosynovitis was symptomatic in 15 patients and asymptomatic (localized swelling only) in 21. Plates were removed from 15 patients due to symptomatic tenosynovitis and from six patients due to partial rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon. The flexor digitorum profundus tendon of the second finger was also partially ruptured in three patients. Conclusion: Anatomic volar <b>rim</b> locking <b>plates</b> provide satisfying radiological and functional results in treating AO/OTA Type C 2 -C 3 comminuted distal radius fractures. However, if these plates interfere with the union of the fracture, they should be removed to avoid potential tendon problems caused by their placement in the rim region.

40|$|AIMS: To {{identify}} the rates and reasons for plate removal (PR) among patients treated for facial fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of files of 238 patients. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (20. 2 %) had plates removed. The {{reason for removal}} was objective in 33. 3 % and subjective in 29. 2 %. The most common subjective reason was cold sensitivity, and the most common objective reason was wound dehiscence/infection. Women had PR for subjective reasons more often than men (p= 0. 018). Removal was performed more often for subjective reasons after zygomatico-orbital fractures than after mandibular fractures (p= 0. 002). Plates inserted in the mandible from an intraoral approach were removed more frequently than extraorally inserted mandibular plates, intraorally inserted maxillary plates, and extraorally inserted plates in other locations (p< 0. 001). Orbital <b>rim</b> <b>plates</b> had {{a higher risk of}} being removed than maxillary or frontal bone plates (p= 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Subjective discomfort is a notable reason for PR among Finnish patients, suggesting that the cold climate has an influence on the need for removal. Patients receiving mandibular osteosynthesis with miniplates from an intraoral approach are at risk of hardware removal because of wound dehiscence/infection and loose/broken hardware, reminding us that more rigid fixation devices should not be forgotten despite the widespread use of miniplates...|$|R

40|$|The {{pinch-off}} of {{drops from}} {{the downstream end}} of plates is an important re-entrainment mechanism of condensate in compact condensers. The present experimental study complements a previous one [1], in which ethanol and water drops were created for various mass densities and gas velocities at the downstream end of a plate that was fully wetted. In the present study, the effects of plate thickness and surface tension are studied with ethane drops detaching in ethane vapor flow at near-critical conditions. If {{the thickness of the}} plate, D, is introduced as a governing length scale, the Bond number ∆ρ g D 2 / σ is found to indicate whether or not the plate thickness affects drop detachment. A theoretical prediction for the drop size after pinch-off in otherwise quiescent vapor is compared with experiments, which results in a correlation valid for high Bond numbers that are based on the drop diameter. The predictive method presented in the previous study took account of the effect of flow on detaching drop size. It has now been extended and generalized. The combined effect of plate thickness and high vapor velocity is found to lead to a bifurcation in the main drop size after detachment. This phenomenon is due to the facts that the position of the drop foot underneath the plate is unstable, and that detachment near the <b>rim</b> of a <b>plate</b> is essentially different from that {{from the center of the}} plate...|$|R

Accordingly, a technical justification for deviation from the BWRVIP guidance was developed.

Therefore, postulated flaws would not grow to a size that significantly reduces the bolt preload {{over the life of the}} plant. Even if significant cracking did occur in the bolting, redundant structural components will prevent adverse displacement of the core plate. Furthermore, even with the extremely conservative assumptions of failures of both the bolting and the redundant hardware, the Standby Liquid Control (SLC) system could be used to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown.
