50|$|This effect {{appears to}} be far more {{prevalent}} in older <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> than in younger <b>married</b> <b>couples.</b> As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows.

These loans were to be used as “vouchers for furniture and other household goods, provided, of course, that the women gave up work on marriage and devoted herself to motherhood”.

40|$|Ninety-five {{studies that}} {{addressed}} {{the possibility of}} gender differences in forgiveness literature are reviewed. Gender differences were examined with respect to predictor variables and outcome variables. Participants were 314 couples from the community who had been married less than one year.

In addition, females were more religious and reported more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility. Four structural equation models were tested {{in order to test}} for gender differences. Structural models including the latent variables of martial satisfaction, marital commitment, marital forgiveness, and mental health fit the data better for males than for females. Results support the conclusion that there are gender differences in forgiveness in <b>recently</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples...</b>|$|R

40|$|Not {{the final}} {{published}} versionIn sub-Saharan Africa, {{the prevalence of}} HIV infection among young women {{is much higher than}} that among young men. Many women enter marriage HIV-infected, suggesting that men may be predominantly infected by their wives. Using data from cross-sectional surveys in Kisumu, Kenya, and Ndola, Zambia, in 1997, the prevalence of HIV infection at marriage was estimated from age at marriage and age- and sex-specific prevalence of HIV infection among unmarried individuals. Using a deterministic model, this prevalence was compared with measured concordance of HIV infection among <b>recently</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> to estimate transmission probabilities within marriage and extramarital incidence of HIV infection. Over a wide range of assumptions, we estimated that at least one quarter of cases of HIV infection in <b>recently</b> <b>married</b> men were acquired from extramarital partnerships, and for both men and women, less than one half of cases of HIV infection were acquired from their spouse. In these sites, many infections in married men, even in those with HIV-infected wives, may be acquired from outside the marriage...|$|R

The current research addressed this question through one cross-sectional and one longitudinal study in which <b>recently</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> reported their levels of shyness, relationship self-efficacy, marital problem severity, and marital satisfaction. Multilevel modeling revealed that (a) shyness was negatively associated with concurrent marital satisfaction in Study 1 and with declines in marital satisfaction in Study 2, (b) the association between shyness and satisfaction was mediated by low levels of relationship self-efficacy in Study 1 and Study 2, and (c) the association between relationship self-efficacy and concurrent marital satisfaction was mediated by concurrent marital problems in Study 1, and the association between relationship self-efficacy and declines in marital satisfaction was mediated by worsening marital problems in Study 2.

50|$|Fernando {{married his}} second wife, Stephanie (Estefanía), {{daughter}} of Count Ermengol V of Urgell, probably in early 1119, {{while she was}} still quite young. On 12 November 1119 Fernando had a grant of bridewealth (carta de arras) drawn up for his second wife. He bestowed on her his half of properties at Castrojeriz and Cerrato, which he had acquired with his first wife and which had been divided between him and his children by Tegridia at her death. He also granted Stephanie the half he claimed of some properties at Cevico and Uceda, which he and Stephanie had previously acquired together. Earlier that year, in April or May, Queen Urraca had granted those lands at Uceda and some others at Hita to the betrothed or <b>recently</b> <b>married</b> <b>couple.</b> On 30 June she granted the lands at Cevico to Stephanie to be held independently of her husband or his existing children. Fernando disregarded this royal charter, placing greater stock in aristocratic custom based on Visigothic law, by which he acquired one half of all his wife's acquisitions during their marriage.|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the importance that similar identity style {{plays in the}} relationships within <b>recently</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples.</b> To assess the congruency of similar and dissimilar identity style, three postulates were analyzed.

(c) Is there an interaction effect between gender and similarity of identity style in relation to reports of marital intimacy? A sample consisting of 84 couples completed a survey containing questions relevant to identity and marital intimacy. Demographic information was also requested in the survey. Analyses indicate that (a) males generally report greater marital intimacy than females, (b) couples with similar identity style tend to report greater marital intimacy than their dissimilar counterparts, and (c) females 2 ̆ 7 reports of marital intimacy are more influenced (than males) by similarity of identity style...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the attitudes and {{intentions}} of individuals planning a pregnancy with regard to preconceptional cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening and to determine factors associated with a positive and negative/neutral intention to have the test. A survey, based on a questionnaire, was conducted among a stratified random sample of 303 <b>recently</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> (606 individuals). Of the eligible individuals, 70 % (n = 380) participated. Of the respondents, 73 % had a positive attitude toward a routine offer of preconceptional CF carrier screening, and 56 % had the intention to participate in a screening program. A positive intention to have the test was associated with high perceived anticipation of regret, intended preconceptional behavior, high perceived pressure from experts, high perceived consequences of the test results, low perceived barriers, and low perceived negative consequences for family members. These results suggest that the offer of routine preconceptional CF carrier screening would lead to substantial acceptance among couples planning a pregnancy.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the housework distribution between spouses in Mainland China {{and from a}} dyadic perspective. The findings from 211 Chinese couples indicated a pattern consistent with Western findings: housework distribution is lopsided in favor of husbands. On average, wives accounted for two third of the total time that the couples spent on housework. As predicted by relative income theory, the workload was more skewed among couples with a larger discrepancy of personal income. The results also lent partial support to the time-availability theory in that couples with both spouses working fewer hours were more egalitarian in sharing. However, when {{both of them were}} heavily involved in paid work, it remained the wives who shouldered the majority of housework, as was the case among couples with full-time housewives. The results showed that more <b>recently</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> allocated housework more equally, indicating a possible cohort effect, probably a phenomenon more characteristic of the developing world.
