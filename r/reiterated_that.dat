5|$|Henry's 2006–07 {{season was}} marred by injuries. Although he scored 10 goals in 17 {{domestic}} appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match, but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing {{the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Filipino Associated Broadcasting Company leased its airtime to the Malaysian {{broadcaster}} Media Prima (through {{the local}} subsidiary MPB Primedia) similar to an LMA – with MPB Primedia providing entertainment programming, and ABC handling news programming and operations. Soon afterward, ABC and Media Prima were sued by rival media company GMA {{for attempting to}} use the partnership to skirt laws requiring domestic ownership of broadcasters. In response, ABC's media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> the subsidiary was a Filipino company which was self-registered and Filipino-run. The concerns became moot in 2010, when Media Prima announced it would divest its ownership in the network to PLDT's broadcasting subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a difficult}} and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up to the job in the future.|$|E

5|$|Individually, Iginla reached 900 career {{points in}} a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Oilers on January 30, 2010. Six nights later, he played his 1,000th career game against the Florida Panthers. Iginla {{struggled}} offensively to begin the 2010–11 season, and with the Flames falling {{to the bottom of}} the standings, there was renewed speculation over his future in Calgary. Team management repeatedly <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> they were not interested in moving him to another team. Improving his game as the season wore on, Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced several days later that he had declined to play in the All-Star Game as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Later in the day, Đôn privately {{met with}} CIA agent Lucien Conein and <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> the Americans were mistaken in {{believing that the}} ARVN was responsible. Đôn insisted that Diem {{remained}} in control although Nhu had to approve all of the generals' meetings with Diệm. Đôn insisted Nhu had orchestrated the raids, fearing that the generals had too much power. He asserted that Nhu used the cover of martial law to discredit the generals by dressing the Special Forces in ARVN uniforms. Đôn insisted that {{he was unaware of}} the plans and was at Joint General Staff headquarters with Khiêm when he received a radio message informing him of the assaults. Police Commissioner Trần Văn Tu, supported by Tung's men, were in charge of the operation at ground level, and by the time Don arrived, the mission had been completed.|$|E
5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E

5|$|The {{negotiations}} were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the Kremlin with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> the Anglo-American inspection plan {{would amount to}} espionage, effectively dismissing {{the possibility of a}} comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore the possibility of a non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a test ban could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to West Berlin. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a non-proliferation agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that such an agreement should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a test ban would have the same effect on limiting proliferation.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Clinton {{took office}} as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press {{secretary}} <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> {{she would be}} using that form of her name.

She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing. She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones. After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.|$|E
5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that the decision of the state court of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and that the Supreme Court could claim no jurisdiction. The decision of the state court of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E

5|$|In January 1978, a WMATA {{regional}} {{task force}} approved a Green Line route in Anacostia that followed Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue and then Wheeler Road down to the Beltway (with a new station added near St. Elizabeths Hospital). Nonetheless, the Prince George's County government demanded in May 1978 that WMATA chose the Suitland-Parkway-to-Rosecroft route instead, and WMATA agreed to the change. In August 1978, WMATA's Board of Directors recommended {{to the federal government}} and its partner state and local governments that the entire -long (160.9 kilometres) Metrorail system be fully built—a proposal that included immediate construction of the Archives, Waterfront, Navy Yard – Ballpark, and Anacostia stations. WMATA announced in November 1978 that it had secured funding to build the Green Line from Gallery Place to Waterfront and that construction was nearly complete on this portion of the line, but that funding did not exist to push the line from Waterfront to Anacostia. Nonetheless, Metro <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> it intended to complete the extension to Anacostia Station by late 1983.|$|E
5|$|Kasche had not {{received}} a reply to his telegram of 17 March, so he sent a further telegram to von Ribbentrop on 26 March. In it he advised that two Partisan representatives had arrived in Zagreb for negotiations, and named them using their aliases. He {{pointed out that the}} Partisan interest in an armistice had increased, and emphasised that he considered this a significant development. By this time, Đilas and Velebit had returned to Zagreb, where they <b>reiterated</b> <b>that</b> the Partisans wanted recognition as a regular belligerent, and emphasised the futility of continued fighting. They effectively asked to be left alone to fight the Chetniks. According to Pavlowitch, it is not clear which side posed the question of what the Partisans would do if the British were to land in Yugoslavia without Partisan authorisation, but Đilas and Velebit said they would fight them as well as the Germans. They stated that their propaganda had been slanted towards the Soviet Union because {{they did not want to}} communicate with London. Their determination to fight the British if they landed was because they believed that the British would try to thwart their objective of seizing power in Yugoslavia. They further stated that the Chetniks would not fight the British because such a landing was exactly what they were waiting for.|$|E
