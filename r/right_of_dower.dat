60|$|DEAR BROTHER:--Your {{letter of}} the 22d is just received. Your {{proposal}} about selling the east forty acres of land is all that I want or could claim for myself; but I am not satisfied with it on Mother's account--I want her to have her living, and I {{feel that it is}} my duty, to some extent, to see that she is not wronged. She had a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> (that is, the use of one-third for life) in the other two forties; but, it seems, she has already let you take that, hook and line. She now has the use of the whole of the east forty, as long as she lives; and if it be sold, of course she is entitled to the interest on all the money it brings, as long as she lives; but you propose to sell it for three hundred dollars, take one hundred away with you, and leave her two hundred at 8 per cent., making her the enormous sum of 16 dollars a year. Now, if you are satisfied with treating her in that way, I am not. It is true that you are to have that forty for two hundred dollars, at Mother's death, but you are not to have it before. I am confident that land can be made to produce for Mother at least $30 a year, and I can not, to oblige any living person, consent that she shall be put on an allowance of sixteen dollars a year.|$|E

40|$|Dower was {{a rather}} {{peculiar}} institution of the old French customary law that, according to some, still subsists in modern Quebec law. At first blush, dower {{seems to be in}} complete opposition to the main thrust of old French law, whose primary- concern for the protection of lineage allowed hardly any right to be created in favour <b>of</b> spouses. Indeed, <b>dower</b> granted to the wife important rights, bearing on the husband's biens propres, i. e. property coming from his lineage or not included in the community and therefore normally entitled to the strictest protection. The wife's rights consisted in a usufruct on one-half of the husband's bien propres. Considering both the basis and the extent <b>of</b> those <b>rights,</b> therefore, <b>dower</b> appears as a most unusual provision in favour of the wife. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> were, however, more apparent than real. This comes out clearly when one examines the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children under the dower, as well as {{the manner in which the}} institution was transformed. Dower then appears as a mere reduction <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> full ownership previously vested in the wife. Such reduction favoured the children, who emerged as the main beneficiaries <b>of</b> <b>dower.</b> They were the owners of the property upon which bore the wife's usufruct. And their rights were safeguarded as against every other party, including their mother and father, as well as the latter's creditors. The history <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> therefore illustrates the manner in which legal institutions may be transformed to suit changing ideas and mores...|$|R

50|$|When Robert's brother, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford, died in {{the latter}} half of 1214, Robert succeeded to his title and estates and the {{hereditary}} office of Master Chamberlain <b>of</b> England. The <b>dower</b> <b>of</b> Earl Aubrey's second wife, Alice (possibly his cousin, a daughter of Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk), had not been formalized. In 1215 Oxford settled his sister-in-law's dower by lot, the earl drawing two knights' fees for every one drawn by Alice.

5000|$|During the pre-Reformation period, a man {{who became}} a monk and made his {{religious}} profession in England was deemed civilly dead, [...] "dead in law" [...] consequently his heirs inherited his land forthwith {{as though he had}} died a natural death. Assignment <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> in his hand would nevertheless be postponed until the natural death of such a man, for only by his wife's consent could a married man be legally professed in religion, and she was not allowed by her consent to exchange her husband for dower. After the Reformation and the enactment of the English statute of 11 and 12 William III, prohibiting [...] "papists" [...] from inheriting or purchasing lands, a Roman Catholic widow was not held to be debarred <b>of</b> <b>dower,</b> for dower accruing by operation of law was deemed to be not within the prohibitions of the statute. By a curious disability of old English law a Jewish widow born in England would be debarred <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> in land which her husband, he having been an Englishman of the same faith and becoming converted after marriage, should purchase, if she herself remained unconverted.|$|R

50|$|<b>Of</b> <b>dower</b> (douaire) as {{it existed}} in the old French law no trace {{is to be found}} in the {{existing}} law of France. But brought to Canada from the mother country in pre-Revolutionary times, customary dower accruing by operation of law is yet recognized in the law of the former French province of Quebec. The civil death which by English law seems to have applied to men only, might be by the French law incurred by women taking perpetual religious vows. Therefore, a widow entering into religion would lose her dower, although in some regions she was allowed to retain a moderate income. And now by the law of Quebec a widow joining certain religious orders of the province is deemed civilly dead and undoubtedly would suffer loss <b>of</b> <b>dower.</b>|$|R
