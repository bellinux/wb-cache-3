5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oil</b> into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
40|$|H- 1 nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was utilized to distinguish the brands of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oils.</b> As {{there are more than}} four hundreds of NMR variables which can cause the discrimination model redundancy, it is necessary to do effective variable selection. Successive projections algorithm (SPA) executed on the full spectrum only improved a few correct answer rate (CAR) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (K) compared to full spectrum-least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) model. The better results of uninformative variable elimination (UVE) -based SPA calculation show {{that it is necessary to}} do UVE before SPA. Because the cutoff threshold selection in UVE algorithm using an artificial random noise cannot obtain the optimal results, we applied simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to estimate the optimal cutoff threshold. The discrimination results show that UVE-SA did better works than conventional UVE. Only 13 variables were obtained by UVE-SA-SPA while the conventional UVE-based SPA selected 77 variables. The best 97. 5 % CAR and K of 0. 967 result of UVE-SPA-LS-SVM model show that it is feasible to distinguish different brands of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oils</b> using H- 1 NMR spectra. It shows that a combination of SA, UVE, and SPA is effective method for the classification of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oils.</b> Final result shows that all acyl chains, linolenyl and linoleyl chains, and triglycerides were most important for the classification.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding}} of the chemistry of mustard and <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oils</b> in the field of authenticity, formation of antioxidants during roasting and their effects on the oil oxidative stability. At first, a chemometric methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation was developed to evaluate the authenticity of mustard and <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oils.</b> In the second part, the isolation of a potent radical scavenger, canolol, from the roasted mustard seed oil was carried out and its identity was confirmed via spectrometric data (NMR, UV, MS) and chemical synthesis. Canolol was found to be formed during seed roasting by decarboxylation of sinapic acid. In the third part, the oxidative stability of roasted and unroasted mustard seed oils collected from the Nepalese market was evaluated. Furthermore, the effects of seed roasting on the oxidative stability of mustard and <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oils</b> was investigated. These studies showed that canolol could play an important role in the oxidative stability of roasted rapeseed oil; in contrast, it could only play a limited role in the much higher oxidative stability of roasted mustard seed oil. In fact, the oxidative stability of roasted mustard seed oil was mainly correlated with the phospholipid content and the Maillard type browning reaction products formed during roasting. At last, the Maillard type reactions involving phospholipids and their antioxidant potential were evaluated in a model system containing phosphatidylethanolamine and glucose. The reaction products not only increased the oil oxidative stability but also increased the stability of tocopherol and plastochromanol- 8 during oil storage. The occurrence of such reactions in an apolar medium was demonstrated by identifying some of the reaction products by liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS). Such antioxidants could find a wide application in different food products...|$|R

40|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biopolymers, {{which can}} replace {{petrochemical}} plastics in many applications. However, these bioplastics are currently far {{more expensive than}} petrochemical plastics. Many researchers are investigating the use of inexpensive substrates derived from waste streams. Waste frying oil is abundant {{and can be used}} in PHA production without filtration. Cupriavidus necator (formerly known as Ralstonia eutropha) is a versatile organism for the production of PHAs. Small-scale batch fermentation studies have been set up, using different concentrations of pure vegetable oil, heated vegetable oil and waste frying oil. These <b>oils</b> are all <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oils.</b> It has been shown that Cupriavidus necator produced the homopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from the <b>rapeseed</b> <b>oils.</b> The achieved PHB concentration from waste frying oil was 1. 2 g/l, which is similar to a concentration that can be obtained from glucose. The PHB harvest from pure oil and heated oil was 0. 62 g/l and 0. 9 g/l respectively. A feed of waste frying oil could thus achieve more biopolymer than pure vegetable oil. While the use of a waste product is beneficial from a life-cycle perspective, PHB is not the only product that can be made from waste oil. The collection of waste frying oil is becoming more widespread, making waste oil a good alternative to purified oil or glucose for PHB production...|$|R
