40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} combining radar information and gauge measurements. Gauge measurements are the best available source of absolute rainfall intensity albeit their spatial availability is limited. Precipitation information obtained by radar mimics well the spatial patterns but is biased for their absolute values. In this study copula models are {{used to describe the}} dependence structure between gauge observations and rainfall derived from radar reflectivity at the corresponding grid cells. After appropriate time series transformation to generate "iid" variates, only the positive pairs (radar > 0, gauge > 0) of the residuals are considered. As not each grid cell can be assigned to one gauge, the integration of point information, i. e. gauge rainfall intensities, is achieved by considering the structure and the strength of dependence between the radar pixels and all the gauges within the radar image. Two different approaches, namely Maximum Theta and Multiple Theta, are presented. They finally allow for generating precipitation fields that mimic the spatial patterns of the <b>radar</b> <b>fields</b> and correct them for biases in their absolute rainfall intensities. The performance of the approach, which {{can be seen as a}} bias-correction for <b>radar</b> <b>fields,</b> is demonstrated for the Bavarian Alps. The bias-corrected rainfall fields are compared to a field of interpolated gauge values (ordinary kriging) and are validated with available gauge measurements. The simulated precipitation fields are compared to an operationally corrected <b>radar</b> precipitation <b>field</b> (RADOLAN). The copula-based approach performs similarly well as indicated by different validation measures and successfully corrects for errors in the radar precipitation...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{a defense}} sphere uses {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs have several advantages over manned aircrafts such as small size, reduced combat losses of personnel, etc. In addition, in threat environment, {{it is necessary}} to arrange both bringing together distant from each other UAVs in a group and their undetected in <b>radar</b> <b>fields</b> compact flying in terms of the joint flight security. However, the task to control a UAVs group is much more difficult than to control a single UAV, since it is necessary not only to control the aircraft, but also take into account the relative position of objects in the group. To solve this problem two ways are possible: using a network exchange between members of the group on the "everyone with everyone" principle and organizing the leader-headed flight. The aim of the article is to develop and study a possible option of the UAVs group control with arranging a leader-headed flight to provide the undetected in <b>radar</b> <b>fields</b> compact flying in terms of the joint flight security. The article develops a universal algorithm to control leader-headed group, based on a new modification of the statistical theory of optimal control. It studies effectiveness of the algorithm. While solving this task, a flight of seven UAVs was simulated in the horizontal plane in a rectangular coordinate system. Control time, linear errors of desired alignment of UAV, and control errors with respect to angular coordinates are used as measures of merit.

2500|$|The {{functioning}} of the radar is completely automatic, controlled by four computers. [...] The software divides the beam time between [...] "surveillance" [...] and [...] "tracking" [...] functions, switching the beam back and forth rapidly between different tasks.

In the tracking mode, which normally consumes the other 7% of the 18% duty cycle, the radar beam follows already-detected objects to determine their trajectory, calculating their launch and target points.|$|R

50|$|However, {{there are}} a number of {{limitations}} to the use of radar speed guns. For example, user training and certification are required so that a radar operator can use the equipment effectively, with trainees being required to consistently visually estimate vehicle speed within +/-2 mph of actual target speed, for example if the targets actual speed is 30 mph than the operator must be able to consistently visually estimate the target speed as falling between 28 and 32 mph. Stationary traffic enforcement radar must occupy a location above or to the side of the road, so the user must understand trigonometry to accurately estimate vehicle speed as the direction changes while a single vehicle moves within the field of view. Actual vehicle speed and radar measurement thus are rarely the same, however, for all practical purposes this difference in actual speed and measured speed is inconsequential, generally being less than 1 mph difference, as police are trained to position the radar to minimize this inaccuracy and when present the error is always in the favor of the driver reporting a lower than actual speed. Radar speed guns do not differentiate between targets in traffic, and proper operator training is essential for accurate speed enforcement. This inability to differentiate among targets in the <b>radars</b> <b>field</b> of view is the primary reason for the operator being required to consistently and accurately visually estimate target speeds to within +/-2 mph, so that, for example if there are seven targets in the <b>radars</b> <b>field</b> of view and the operator is able to visually estimate the speed of six of those targets as approximately 40 mph and visually estimate the speed of one of those targets as approximately 55 mph and the radar unit is displaying a reading of 56 mph it becomes clear which targets speed the unit is measuring.|$|R

Delay lines are also used in electronic objects for making decision point, in sound reinforcements. In a delay network, for a given bandwidth, the amount of delay increases as the order increases. Therefore we propose an idea of optimizing the poles of the filter in order to get more delay over a given order and bandwidth...|$|R
50|$|A {{more common}} {{application}} of a Navy Iron Hand mission involved an A-4 Skyhawk or A-6 Intruder, armed with Shrikes, which would fly low-level ("above deck"), detectable by SAM search radar while still having ready access to much lower, radar-free altitudes ("hard deck"). The pilot's avionics would detect a SAM radar's acquisition ("lock") onto his aircraft; the pilot would then dive for the hard deck, choose another approach track, suddenly pitch 15 degrees up without re-entering the SAM <b>radar</b> <b>field</b> ("cone") and launch the Shrike into the cone. The Shrike would then acquire the SAM radar's location, fly to it and destroy it, thus disabling SAM missiles associated with the particular radar, allowing American aircraft to conduct their missions unharassed.|$|E
50|$|One of Chrysler's most {{significant}} contributions {{to the war effort}} was not in the field of vehicles but in the <b>radar</b> <b>field.</b> For the final production design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism, the Army's Signal Corps Laboratories turned to Chrysler's Central Engineering Office. There, the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel, allowing production forming using standard automotive presses. To keep weight down, 6,000 equally spaced holes were drilled in the face (this had no effect on the radiation pattern). The drive mechanism was completely redesigned, using technology derived from Chrysler's research in automotive gears and differentials. The changes resulted in improved performance, reduced weight, and easier maintenance. A large portion of the Dodge plant was used in building 1,500 of the SCR-584 antennas as well as the vans used in the systems.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{it was a}} great {{improvement}} over the older SRD-5M, the new intercepting capabilities were still limited, mostly due to an inherent design flaw of the MiG-21; the nose inlet limited the size of the small radar cone, so the <b>radar</b> <b>field</b> was limited to 20° vertically and 60° horizontally. Even in the latest Chinese F-7MG copies of the MiG-21 (equipped with more advanced Israeli and Italian radars [...] ) this is still said to be a significant limiting factor for radar use. Also, because of the vacuum tube electronics, the radar system (like most other early generation radars) had a low mean time between failures (MTBF). The radar lacked look-down/shoot-down capabilities (though this was not at all a common feature of radar systems at the time), meaning that it couldnt intercept targets that were flying under the MiG-21, because the radar system was unable to filter out [...] "ground clutter" [...] return. Another disadvantage of the new radar (and other avionics) was the weight increase in the MiG-21 PF, which reduced the baseline MiG-21s otherwise impressive flight characteristics.|$|E

40|$|Results from a WERA {{radar system}} in very high {{frequency}} (VHF) mode in a small coastal area (range of 7 km. resolution of 250 m) are compared with surface drifter data. The measurements are performed in the Gulf of La Spezia, a highly populated area characterized by a complex use of the territory, where monitoring of surface currents {{can play an important}} role in correct management. The drifters have been launched in clusters of 3 - 6 units, aimed at investigating the significant time and space variability of the flow. In particular, two clusters launched at the same location 2 days apart show strikingly different patterns of evolution. The first cluster is swiftly advected with little particle spreading, while the second cluster divides into two branches with significant drifter spreading. Radial velocities from radar and drifter data are compared. The difference is characterized by a RMS similar to 5 cm/s, on the lowest side of the RMS values reported in the literature. In-situ drifter trajectories are then compared with synthetic trajectories computed from VHF <b>radar</b> <b>fields,</b> and a separation rate of similar to 1 km/ 12 h between individual trajectories is found. Finally, the spreading patterns of the in-situ clusters are qualitatively compared with the synthetic clusters and in all cases the synthetic trajectories are found to correctly reproduce the patterns, including the drastic difference between the two launches from the same location. The in-situ trajectories appear to fall in the envelope of the synthetic ones. The positive results are likely to be due to a combination of factors and primarily to the high frequency and space resolution of the <b>radar</b> <b>fields,</b> as well as to the flow regime characteristic of protected areas. The results confirm that radar data are well suited for the study of coastal flows in limited areas with complex patterns of velocity and transport. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
