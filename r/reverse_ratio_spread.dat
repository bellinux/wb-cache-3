50|$|The call {{backspread}} (<b>reverse</b> call <b>ratio</b> <b>spread)</b> is a bullish {{strategy in}} options trading whereby the options trader writes {{a number of}} call options and buys more call options of the same underlying stock and expiration date but at a higher strike price.

50|$|A <b>Ratio</b> <b>spread</b> is a complex, multileg options {{position}} {{that is a}} variation of a vertical spread. Like a vertical, the <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> involves buying and selling options on the same underlying security with different strike prices and the same expiration date. Unlike a vertical spread, a number of option contracts sold is not equal {{to a number of}} contracts bought. An unequal number of options contracts gives this spread certain unique properties compared to a regular vertical <b>spread.</b> A typical <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> would be where twice as much option contracts are sold, thus forming a 1:2 ratio.|$|R

40|$|Three {{government}} bond futures contracts {{and their respective}} 3 -month interest rate futures contracts traded on LIFFE are examined.

Borrowing from the calculation of minimum variance hedge ratios, half-hourly minimum variance <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> (the ratio of one contract to another, which provides the minimum variance) are estimated for the above contracts. The hypothesis under examination is whether there is any value-added in estimating minimum <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> based on intraday data. Three <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> are defined: two ratios calculated from daily data and a third one based on intraday data.

40|$|The maximum {{spreading}} of drops impacting on {{smooth and}} rough surfaces is measured from low to high impact velocity for liquids with different surface tensions and viscosities. We demonstrate that dynamic wetting {{plays an important}} role in the spreading at low velocity, characterized by the dynamic contact angle at maximum spreading. In the energy balance, we account for the dynamic wettability by introducing the capillary energy at zero impact velocity, which relates to the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero impact velocity. Correcting the measured <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> by the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero velocity, we find a correct scaling behaviour for low and high impact velocity and, by interpolation between the two, we find a universal scaling curve. The influence of the liquid as well as the nature and roughness of the surface are taken into account properly by rescaling with the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero velocity, which, as demonstrated, is equivalent to accounting for the dynamic contact angle...|$|R

INTRODUCTION There is an increasing emphasis on the provision of meaningful warranty conditions and reliability predictions for software 1. This has been parallelled by greater emphasis on statistical control of the software process 2. The availability of a sound and complete model for error insertion and removal would assist in achieving both of these goals. There have been a number of proposals for error or defect models of software development. Many of these have been based on defining the re [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} inject ions from an {{external}} ion source, the field between the electrodes is first reduced. As ion packets are injected tangentially into the field, the electric field is increased by ramping the voltage {{on the inner}} electrode. Ions get squeezed towards the inner electrode until they reach the desired orbit inside the trap. At that moment ramping is stopped, the field becomes static, and detection can start. Each packet contains a multitude of ions of different velocities spread over a certain volume. These ions move with different rotational frequencies but with the same axial frequency. This means that ions of a specific mass-to-charge <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> into rings which oscillate along the inner spindle.|$|R

Indeed, taking into account of the FSI effects, the theoretical prediction on R is well consistent with the data. Comment: 9 pages, 1 figures, 3 tables. Accepted by PR...|$|R
