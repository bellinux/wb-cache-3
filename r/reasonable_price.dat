5|$|The {{film was}} a {{financial}} failure; according to Wild Bunch in February 2011, the film had returned 1.25% of the investment. In France, it was launched on 30 prints and sold 51,126 tickets in total. Producer Brahim Chioua {{said that the}} film had been difficult to sell abroad for a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> due to the late-2000s financial crisis. The Numbers reported that the worldwide theatrical revenues corresponded to US$1,467,278.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne {{was again}} {{waterlogged}} and Silver City Airways operated out of Southend and Blackbushe. The company {{stated that they}} were willing to purchase Lympne, but the decision of Folkestone Town Council was still awaited for. By May, Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the Frontier Nerds of NYU's ITP program {{published}} a thorough tutorial titled How To Hack Toy EEGs.

25|$|It {{was from}} around 1770 that Arnold {{developed}} the portable precision timekeeper, {{almost from the}} point where John Harrison ended his work in this field. But, compared to Harrison's complicated and expensive watch, Arnold's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable. Importantly, the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Next {{came the}} 1984 Fiero. This {{was a major}} {{departure}} from anything Pontiac had produced in the past. A two-seat, mid-engined coupe, the Fiero was targeted straight at the same market that Semon Knudsen had been aiming for in the late 1950s: the young, affluent buyer who wanted sporting performance at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> The Fiero was also an instant success and was partially responsible for Pontiac seeing its first increase in sales in four years.|$|E
25|$|The Macintosh {{initially}} sold well, but follow-up {{sales were}} not strong {{due to its}} high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed {{with the introduction of}} the LaserWriter, the first PostScript laser printer to be sold at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> and PageMaker, an early desktop publishing package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market. The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} envisaged acquiring BAC's {{capital and}} merging it with Hawker Siddeley. The ownership of BAC would thus give the government a minority {{stake in the}} new company. Although BAC's parent companies were prepared to sell their shares for a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> the government proposal, in their view, undervalued the group. By August 1967, {{the success of the}} BAC 1–11 and defence sales to Saudi Arabia made the prospect of the parent companies selling their shares less likely. In December 1967, Anthony Wedgwood Benn, the Minister of Technology, while reiterating his desire to see a merged BAC and HSA, admitted it would not be possible.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, many navies began to need {{replacements}} for WWII-era submarines, aging United States GUPPY conversions, and British units transferred postwar. During this time, few western submarine designs {{were available for}} export as most were large, expensive, sophisticated and difficult to operate and designed for the Cold War. Several designs originally built for specific nations were available including the French Daphne Class, British Oberon Class, and the Soviet Foxtrot Class submarines. The design, designated by the German Ministry of Defense as the “Type 209” provided a solution providing the combination of size, performance, relative ease of operation for small or inexperienced navies, <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> and economy of operation.|$|E
25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of {{connections to the}} driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a choke coil, filtering the power supply of the amplifier that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated {{by the action of}} passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|E

25|$|The first {{production}} Short 360 had its {{maiden flight}} on 19 August 1982 and entered service with Suburban Airlines (later merged with Allegheny Airlines/US Airways) in November 1982. Building on {{the strengths and}} reputation of its 330 antecedent, the 360s found a niche in regional airline use worldwide, being able to operate comfortably from 4,500ft (1,400 m) runways – opening up hundreds of airfields {{that would otherwise be}} inaccessible to airliners. With a cruise speed about 215mph (370km/h), at an altitude of 10,000ft (3,048 m), the unpressurized 360 was not the fastest turboprop in its market but it offered acceptable performance at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price</b> combined with ease of service and maintainability. The PT6A turboprops are fully ICAO Stage 3 noise-compliant, making the 360 one of the quietest turboprop aircraft operating today. Production of the 360 ceased in 1991 after 165 deliveries. In 1998, approximately 110 360s were in service. In 2009 a retired Emerald Airlines 360 was bought by Kingsland Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, for use as a mobile classroom.|$|E
25|$|Urban tourism {{activities}} includes shopping, sightseeing in big cities, or enjoying modern amusement parks, resorts, spas, nightlife and entertainment. To {{some extent}} urban tourism might also involving municipal culture and heritage tourism, such as visits to city museums {{or parts of}} colonial old town. Ancol Dreamland with Dunia Fantasi theme park and Atlantis Water Adventure is Jakarta's answer to Disneyland-style amusement park and water park. Several similar theme parks also developed in other cities, such as Trans Studio Makassar and Trans Studio Bandung. The nation's capital, Jakarta, offers many places for shopping. Mal Kelapa Gading, the biggest one with , Plaza Senayan, Senayan City, Grand Indonesia, EX, and Plaza Indonesia {{are some of the}} shopping malls in the city. Next to high-end shopping centres with branded products, Indonesia is also a popular destination for handicraft shopping in the region. Certain Indonesian traditional crafts such as batik, songket, ikat weaving, embroidery, wooden statue and fashion products are popular souvenirs for visitors. Indonesian textile and fashion products are known for its good value; good quality with relatively cheap and <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> Bandung is a popular shopping destination for fashion products among Malaysians and Singaporeans.|$|E
25|$|From the mid-1920s {{and until}} the German {{invasion}} of Norway, {{it was possible for}} civilians to buy surplus Jarmann rifles for about a quarter of what a brand-new Krag–Jørgensen would cost. Despite the <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> it appears that very few were actually sold. Attempts were also made to sell the rifles and ammunition abroad. In 1929, about 5000 rifles were sold to a German firm, but the fate of these Jarmanns is unknown. In 1936 King Ibn Saud from Saudi Arabia initiated talks to buy 20,000 Jarmanns with ammunition for his police force, but the request was turned down by the Norwegian parliament, who claimed that the sale of such outdated weapons would reflect badly upon Norway. In 1938 a private investor— Trygve G. Hygen, a former captain in the Norwegian Army— caused a minor international incident when he offered to sell Jarmann rifles to Ceylon. The British Consulate General complained to the Norwegian government, pointing out that Ceylon was British and they wanted full control of all weapons sold there. The Norwegian government reprimanded Hygen, and the offer was withdrawn. Attempts were also made by Hygen to sell Jarmanns to Lithuania, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bulgaria, Italy and the Netherlands, but without any takers.|$|E

25|$|A start {{was made}} in April on {{building}} the new depot at Carter Gate (Parliament Street), with accommodation for buses, trams and trolleybuses. Trams were given eight roads, all with pits, the capacity being 80 cars. A most complicated layout of track leading to the depot was put in at same time, the intention being to build a single line for one-way traffic inward to the Market Place along Lower Parliament Street and Hockley, via Victoria Street and South Parade, the outward route, also single line and one-way traffic via Long Row and Pelham Street to Hockley. Hockley was a narrow thoroughfare that had been widened towards its junction with Lower Parliament Street, but, owing to the Corporation being unable to obtain a property higher up the street at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price,</b> the whole scheme was later abandoned, although not before much track and pointwork had been laid. The double turnout {{at the bottom of}} Hockley had been in position for approximately six months when it was removed together with the short length of track leading to it, no car ever having run over it. Lines built in connection with the depot were along Southwell Road, with a three-way junction at Manvers Street, another three-way junction at Lower Parliament Street, and then along Lower Parliament Street to within 30 yards of Pennyfoot Street. There were trailing points from both lines into Stanhope Street, where the depot entrances were. A single line ran along Stanhope Street, with trailing junctions both ways into Manvers Street.|$|E
500|$|The Black Thunder bar was {{conceived}} as an easily marketable candy bar with three popular components and a <b>reasonable</b> <b>price.</b> [...] The name was partially {{inspired by the}} Japanese god of thunder.
