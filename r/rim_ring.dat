From {{the center to}} the edge of the crater there are {{innermost}} <b>rim,</b> inner <b>ring,</b> outer <b>rim,</b> and outermost <b>ring.</b> Recently, we have found some self-organized textures or chaos phenomena in shock-metamorphic rocks from the Duolun impact crater, such as turbulence in matrices of impact glass, oscillatory zoning, or chemical chaos of spherulites in spherulitic splashed breccia, fractal wavy textures or self-similar wavy textures with varied scaling in impact glass, and crystallite beams shaped like Lorentz strange attractors. The rare phenomena indicate that the shock-metamorphic rocks from Duolun crater are formed far from equilibrium. If impact cratering generates momentarily under high-pressure and superhigh-temperature, occurrence of those chaos phenomena in shock-metamorphic rock is not surprising...|$|R

The images are dominated by radar-bright features associated with fresh impact craters. As was found from earlier Goldstone-VLA and pre-upgrade Arecibo imaging, {{three of the most}} prominent crater features are located in the Mariner-unimaged hemisphere. These are: “A, ” an 85 -km-diameter crater (348 ◦ W, 34 ◦ S) whose radar ray system may be the most spectacular in the Solar System; “B, ” a 95 -km-diameter crater (343 ◦ W, 58 ◦ N) with a very bright halo but less distinct ray system; and “C,” an irregular feature with bright ejecta and rays distributed asymmetrically about a 125 -km source crater (246 ◦ W, 11 ◦ N). Due south of “C ” lies a “ghost ” feature (242 ◦ W, 27 ◦ S) that resembles “A ” but is much fainter. An even fainter such feature is associated with Bartok Crater. These may be two of the best mercurian examples of large ejecta/ray systems observed in an intermediate state of degradation.

30|$|The {{development}} {{history of}} the G 393 fault-block condensate gas reservoir showed that they developed the fault-block oil <b>rim</b> and <b>ring</b> contact parts at the same time, but since there was insufficient control at the oil–gas interface, gas channelling occurred, {{as well as a}} significant decline in the production capacity of the oil and gas wells. During its development, to add to the underlying energy output, water-injection development policy was used in the oil rim zone. The relationship between the oil and water distributions is complex: if the gas storage were to be rebuilt, it must impact the injection volume and gas recovery therefrom and was not conducive to the smooth and efficient operation of the underground gas storage. Therefore, to enact those control measures needed to reduce the effect of these disadvantages, an understanding of the behaviour of the oil rim, as it affects gas storage, was sought.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} {{in patients}} with developmental dysplasia of the hip can be a complex procedure due to acetabular and proximal femoral deformities. Presentation of case: A 59 -year-old male patient underwent a total hip arthroplasty {{for the treatment of}} end-stage dysplastic osteoarthritis. A roof reinforcement ring, a cemented polyethylene cup, and a cementless stem were used. A portion of the superior <b>rim</b> of the <b>ring</b> was uncovered by the host bone. Morsellized autogenous femoral-head graft was impacted to fill the space between the superior <b>rim</b> of the <b>ring</b> and the superior part of the dysplastic acetabulum. At the follow-up after 5 -years, the patient had no complaints and was very satisfied with the operation result. The hip radiograph revealed no signs of instability of the acetabular component, and no bone graft resorption. Discussion: Favorable results were described using metal rings and conical femoral stems for the treatment of the developmental dysplasia of the hip. The superior rim of the metal ring should be against host bone for 60 % of its support. Despite the suboptimal implantation of the ring compromising, apparently, mechanical stability of the arthroplasty, the outcome was favorable. Conclusion: This result can be supported by the good fixation of the metal ring to the pelvis with screws, the adequate orientation of both components of the total hip arthroplasty, and the bone graft incorporation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn ciliates, basal {{bodies and}} {{associated}} appendages {{are bound to}} a submembrane cytoskeleton. In Paramecium, this cytoskeleton {{takes the form of}} a thin dense layer, the epiplasm, segmented into regular territories, the units where basal bodies are inserted. Epiplasmins, the main component of the epiplasm, constitute a large family of 51 proteins distributed in 5 phylogenetic groups, each characterized by a specific molecular design. By GFP-tagging, we analyzed their differential localisation and role in epiplasm building and demonstrated that: 1) The epiplasmins display a low turnover, in agreement with the maintenance of an epiplasm layer throughout the cell cycle; 2) Regionalisation of proteins from different groups allows us to define <b>rim,</b> core, <b>ring</b> and basal body epiplasmins in the interphase cell; 3) Their dynamics allows definition of early and late epiplasmins, detected early versus late in the duplication process of the units. Epiplasmins from each group exhibit a specific combination of properties. Core and rim epiplasmins are required to build a unit; ring and basal body epiplasmins seem more dispensable, suggesting that they are not required for basal body docking. We propose a model of epiplasm unit assembly highlighting its implication in structural heredity in agreement with the evolutionary history of epiplasmins...|$|R

30|$|Small craters on {{the melt}} pools of impact craters such as Giordano Bruno, Tycho, and King have {{different}} morphology with both primaries and typical secondaries (Plescia 2015), {{as they are}} much shallower, with irregularly shaped rims and small central mounds, and absence of well-developed ejecta (e.g., Fig.  4 b). On the contrary, craters that are formed on the normal ejecta deposits do not have such morphological characteristics (e.g., Fig.  3 b). The irregularly shaped craters formed on Tycho’s melt pools have much smaller depth–diameter ratios (~[*] 0.06) than those formed on the normal ejecta deposits (~[*] 0.12), and their interior wall slopes are also much shallower (~[*] 9 ° versus 21 ° on average; Plescia 2015). Plescia and Spudis (2014) interpreted these craters as self-secondaries (termed as palimpsests) that were formed after the emplacement, but before the solidification of the impact melt. This interpretation is supported by laboratory impact experiments into viscos targets (e.g., Bingham fluids such as cone mush), as the simulated craters have shallow depths, low <b>rims,</b> concentric <b>rings,</b> lobate margins, and central highs (Fink et al. 1981; Greely et al. 1980).

Therefore, it is likely that self-secondaries have been continuously accumulating on the continuous ejecta deposits, even after the melt pools have been ponded.|$|R

Several small differentiated magma bodies may have been fed by and interspersed among a plexus of dikes and sills.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The ring canals in the ovary of {{the fruit}} fly Drosophila provide a {{versatile}} system in which to study the assembly and regulation of membrane-associated actin structures. Derived from arrested cleavage furrows, ring canals allow direct communication between cells. The robust inner rim of filamentous actin that attaches to the ring-canal plasma membrane contains cytoskeletal proteins encoded by the hu-li-tao shao (hts) and kelch genes, and is regulated by the Src 64 and Tec 29 tyrosine kinases. Female sterile cheerio mutants fail to recruit actin to ring canals, disrupting the flow of cytoplasm to oocytes. Results: We have cloned cheerio {{and found that it}} encodes a member of the Filamin/ABP- 280 family of actin-binding proteins, known to bind transmembrane proteins and crosslink actin filaments into parallel or orthogonal arrays. Antibodies to Drosophila Filamin revealed that Filamin is an abundant ring-canal protein and the first known component of both the outer and inner <b>rims</b> of the <b>ring</b> canal. The cheerio gene also encodes a new Filamin isoform that lacks the actin-binding domain. Conclusions: Localization of Filamin to nascent ring canals is necessary for the recruitment of actin filaments. We propose that Filamin links filamentous actin to the plasma membrane of the ring canal. Although loss of Filamin in human cells supports a role for Filamin in organizing orthogonal actin arrays at the cell cortex, the cheerio mutant provides the first evidence that Filamin is required in membrane-associated parallel actin bundles, such as those found in ring canals, contractile rings and stress fibers...|$|R

[...] Some notable examples of Dark Faced Burnished Ware were found at Tell Judaidah (and nearby Tell Dhahab) in Amuq by Robert Braidwood {{as well as at}} Ras Shamra and Tell Boueid. Other finds have been made at Yumuktepe in Mersin, Turkey where comparative studies were made defining different categories of ware that have been generally grouped as DFBW.

Vessels are often coarse, tempered with grit or sand, burnished to a shiny finish and made with a variety of clays in different areas. The grit or sand is thought to have made the vessels easier to fire and the burnishing made them less permeable and suitable for heated liquid substances.

40|$|Lipins {{constitute}} a novel family of Mg 2 +-dependent phosphatidate phosphatases that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to yield diacylglycerol, an important intermediate in lipid metabolism and cell signaling. Whereas a single lipin is detected in less complex organisms, in mammals there are distinct lipin isoforms and paralogs that are differentially expressed among tissues. Compatible with organism tissue complexity, {{we show that}} the single Drosophila Lpin 1 ortholog (CG 8709, here named DmLpin) expresses at least three isoforms (DmLpinA, DmLpinK and DmLpinJ) in a temporal and spatially regulated manner. The highest levels of lipin in the fat body, where DmLpinA and DmLpinK are expressed, correlate with {{the highest levels of}} triacylglycerol (TAG) measured in this tissue. DmLpinK is the most abundant isoform in the central nervous system, where TAG levels are significantly lower than in the fat body. In the testis, where TAG levels are even lower, DmLpinJ is the predominant isoform. Together, these data suggest that DmLpinA might be the isoform that is mainly involved in TAG production, and that DmLpinK and DmLpinJ could perform other cellular functions. In addition, we demonstrate by immunofluorescence that lipins are most strongly labeled in the perinuclear region of the fat body and ventral ganglion cells. In visceral muscles of the larval midgut and adult testis, lipins present a sarcomeric distribution. In the ovary chamber, the lipin signal is concentrated in the internal <b>rim</b> of the <b>ring</b> canal. These specific subcellular localizations of the Drosophila lipins provide the basis for future investigations on putative novel cellular functions of this protein family.

40|$|Color and {{luminance}} perception both rely on {{the different}} combinations of the three cone types, termed L, M, and S cones. Each of the color opponent mechanisms can be defined by their cone weights with (L-M) for Red-Green, (S- 0. 5 (L+M)) for Blue-Yellow, and (2 L+M) for the luminance mechanism. My project investigates two aspects of peripheral color vision. One looks at the spatial summation of the three mechanisms across eccentricity {{and the other one}} looks at the selective loss of red-green cone contrast sensitivity in the periphery. In the spatial summation experiment, we have used two kinds of horizontal gratings for the investigation: a gabor patch and a sine wave ring stimulus. A gabor patch is a conventional visual research stimulus. A radially modulated sine wave ring stimulus is one we designed to test peripheral vision with the advantage of confining its spatial position in eccentric location. In other words, from changing the radius of the ring, we can place the <b>rim</b> of the <b>ring</b> either nearer or further in eccentricity from the central point. Our results show three things: the spatial summation of both chromatic mechanisms and luminance mechanism are similar, spatial summation for all three mechanisms varies across eccentricity, and lastly we find that spatial summation is constant in spatial extent as opposed to the number of spatial cycles. This last finding is in contradiction to previous results, which have found that the spatial summation of the luminance mechanism is determined by the number of stimulus cycles rather than its spatial extent. We used the sine wave ring stimulus, as described in the spatial summation experiment, for our second investigation. Our results show that red-green mechanism unlike the other two mechanisms has a steep post-receptoral signal loss in the periphery, using the sine wave ring confirming previous studies. In addition, we have found the outer bound limit of red-green peripheral perception occurs at around 25 to 30 degree. We have optimally increased the stimulus in size and in contrast, but the red-green detection limit cannot be eccentrically set further...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of this study, {{a broad range of}} permodified ?- and -cyclodextrins with appended carboxylic functions was prepared. Several alternative synthetic procedures were demonstrated. Oxidation of primary hydroxylic groups of per- 2, 3 -protected cyclodextrins with TEMPO gave good to high yields of the corresponding per-carboxylic (uronic) acids. Direct oxidation of native CDs was found to proceed with insufficient selectivity. Dipolar cycloaddition of per(6 -azido- 6 -deoxy) -cyclodextrins on dimethyl acetylene-dicarboxylate was used to attach twelve or fourteen cyrboxylic functions onto the primary <b>rim</b> through triazolyl <b>rings.</b> Carboxymethylation was found to be the most versatile route to cyclodextrins regioselectively persubstituted with carboxylic groups on either of the rims. Two alternative procedures were developed. Primary hydroxyls of per(2, 3 -di-O-methyl) -cyclodextrins were simply carboxymethylated using ethyl diazoacetate under catalysis of anhydrous HBF 4. More polar peralkyl-CD derivatives and native -CD were carboxymethylated by (i) allylation of the desired positions, (ii) alkylation of the remaining positions, (iii) dihydroxylation of the double bond (OsO 4) followed by cleavage of the diol (NaIO 4) and reduction of the peraldehyde (NaBH 4) performed as "one pot" reaction, and (iv) oxidation (TEMPO) ot the hydroxyethyl groups to carboxymethyl functions. This procedure permits preparation of per- 2, 3, 6 -, per- 2, 6 - and per- 2, 3 -carboxymethylated -CDs in good overall yields. Self-assembling properties of a few-selected per-acids and their complexes with isosteric peramines were investigated. Vapour pressure osmometry was found to be the most useful method for the determination of the average molecular weight of discrete aggregates. The amphiphilic per(6 -O-carboxymethyl- 2, 3 -di-O-methyl) -cyclodextrins and per(5 -carboxy- 5 -dehydroxymethyl- 2, 3 -di-O-methyl) -cyclodextrins were found to form stable dimers in 1, 2 -dichloroethane or chloroform solutions {{in a wide range of}} concentrations. Structure of the complexes of these percarboxylic acids with complementary peramines depended markedly on the nature of the solvent. Their molecular weight was generally higher than that corresponding to the expected dimeric structureAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
