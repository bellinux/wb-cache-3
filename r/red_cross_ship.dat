50|$|Despite {{being told}} of this decision, Jaeger {{continued}} to protest it. He presented multiple arguments. First, {{there was no}} possible way to transport the Jews off of the island.

Third, {{he noted that the}} Greeks on the island supported the Jews. Fourth, a <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> <b>ship</b> was in the harbor delivering aid. This ship could potentially witness deportations and fuel ‘atrocities propaganda’, fueling the Allies' propaganda campaign.|$|E
