5|$|Mulder goes to {{investigate}} the facility Sheriff Frass mentioned. Before breaking in, he and Scully discuss the odd behavior of the <b>roaches,</b> with Scully hypothesizing that the <b>roaches</b> could be an invasive species. Inside the facility, which resembles a typical house, Mulder sees the walls rippling and is quickly surrounded by <b>roaches.</b> He is then confronted by Dr. Bambi Berenbaum (Bobbie Phillips), a researcher from the Department of Agriculture who is studying cockroaches to develop more effective methods of pest control. Berenbaum has great interest in insects and, incidentally, believes that some UFOs are actually insect swarms flying through electrically charged airspaces. Yet another death occurs in Mulder's hotel, with the individual being found covered in <b>roaches</b> that quickly flee. At this point, Mulder believes that the individual simply died of fright, though Scully begins to wonder {{what is going on}} and decides to head up there herself.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{appear to}} use just {{two pieces of}} {{information}} to decide where to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the <b>roaches</b> as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the <b>roaches</b> accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{brings a}} {{cockroach}} {{from the hotel}} room to Berenbaum, who thinks it may be mechanical. Mulder then visits the nearby Dr. Ivanov, a wheelchair-bound scientist who works on insect-like robots. The two discuss the possibility that extraterrestrial intelligences could send robotic probes to study other planets. After inspecting the Mulder's specimen, Ivanov is rendered speechless; he informs Mulder that the specimen is, technology-wise, vastly superior to anything he's ever seen. Scully arrives in the town at a convenience store, finding the residents succumbing to panic over the <b>roaches.</b> She attempts to calm the people down, however the store-goers frantically flee after two scuffling patrons knock over a display of chocolate candies, believing {{them to be more}} <b>roaches.</b> Meanwhile, Mulder, while departing Ivanov's lab, catches another roach to bring to Berenbaum, but this time, she concludes that it is a seemingly normal cockroach. Scully finds out that Eckerle was researching dung-derived methane as an alternative fuel source, and had been importing animal dung that may have introduced the <b>roaches</b> to the area. Upon hearing this, Mulder speculates that the <b>roaches</b> are actually extraterrestrial robotic probes that are capable of consuming dung—an abundant resource already exploited by some species of roaches—to generate methane as a source of fuel.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Roach</b> River is a {{river in}} Piscataquis County, Maine. From the outlet of Third <b>Roach</b> Pond (...) in Shawtown (Maine Township A, Range 12, WELS), the river runs 19.1 mi west, through {{a chain of}} ponds. The Flow {{sequence}} through the ponds is from the Fourth <b>Roach</b> Pond through the Third <b>Roach</b> Pond, Second <b>Roach</b> Pond, and First <b>Roach</b> Pond to empty into Moosehead Lake, {{the source of the}} Kennebec River, in Spencer Bay (T1, R14, WELS). The Seventh <b>Roach</b> Pond drains through the Sixth <b>Roach</b> Pond in a separate tributary to the Third <b>Roach</b> Pond. No fifth <b>Roach</b> Pond is shown on modern maps.|$|R

25|$|The company, {{originally}} named John <b>Roach</b> & Son, {{was established}} in 1864 as the operating and marketing firm for <b>Roach's</b> Etna Iron Works in New York, and gave <b>Roach's</b> eldest son, William Henry <b>Roach,</b> {{a stake in the}} business. <b>Roach's</b> other sons later joined the partnership.|$|R
5|$|The {{black stork}} mainly eats fish, {{including}} small cyprinids, pikes, <b>roaches,</b> eels, budds, perches, burbots, sicklebacks and muddy loaches (Misgurnus and Cobitis). It may feed on amphibians, small reptiles, crabs, mammals and birds, and invertebrates such as snails, molluscs, earthworms, and insects like water beetles and their larvae.|$|E
5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by <b>roaches,</b> or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern fringes of the Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The <b>Roaches,</b> and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal measures on the eastern fringes of the Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the Coal measures on the western fringes form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E
25|$|Two children, son Daryl Keith <b>Roach</b> and {{daughter}} Maxine <b>Roach,</b> were born from <b>Roach's</b> first marriage with Mildred <b>Roach</b> in 1949. He {{continued to play}} as a freelance while studying composition at the Manhattan School of Music. He graduated in 1952. In 1958 he met singer Barbara Jai (Johnson) and fathered another son, Raoul Jordu. During the period 1961–1970, <b>Roach</b> was married to the singer Abbey Lincoln, who had performed on several of <b>Roach's</b> albums. In 1971, twin daughters, Ayodele Nieyela and Dara Rashida, were born to <b>Roach</b> and his third wife, Janus Adams <b>Roach.</b> He had four grandchildren: Kyle Maxwell <b>Roach,</b> Kadar Elijah <b>Roach,</b> Maxe Samiko Hinds, and Skye Sophia Sheffield. Long involved in jazz education, in 1972 he was recruited to {{the faculty of the}} University of Massachusetts Amherst by Chancellor Randolph Bromery. In the early 2000s, <b>Roach</b> became less active from the onset of hydrocephalus-related complications.|$|R
50|$|<b>Roach</b> {{married a}} second time on September 1, 1942, to Lucille Prin (January 20, 1913 - April 4, 1981), a Los Angeles secretary. They were married at the on-base home of Colonel Franklin C. Wolfe and his wife at Wright-Patterson Airfield in Dayton, Ohio, where <b>Roach</b> was {{stationed}} at the time while serving as a major in the United States Army Air Corps. <b>Roach</b> and Lucille had four children, Elizabeth Carson <b>Roach</b> (December 26, 1945 - September 5, 1946), Maria May <b>Roach</b> (April 14, 1947), Jeanne Alice <b>Roach</b> (October 7, 1949), and Kathleen Bridget <b>Roach</b> (January 29, 1951).|$|R
2500|$|Following a {{protracted}} dispute over a U.S. Navy {{contract for the}} [...] in the early 1880s, the company's founder John <b>Roach</b> placed John <b>Roach</b> & Sons into receivership in 1885. After settlement of the parent company's debts, the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works was reopened by <b>Roach's</b> sons and continued in operation until shortly {{after the death of}} <b>Roach's</b> eldest son John Baker <b>Roach</b> in 1908, at which point the <b>Roach</b> family retired from the shipbuilding business.|$|R
5|$|Sheldon then tells Rico {{to hurry}} to his hideout, where Rico learns that {{intelligence}} asset Jade Tan has been captured in Panay's military base {{and will be}} tortured and—possibly-summarily executed. Although Rico rescues her and destroys the base, Jade is bundled into a truck and a fleet of gunmen try to escape along a frozen lake. A nuclear submarine emerges from the ice, but Rico hijacks the truck and they are airlifted to safety by Kane (Sheldon and Rico's mission handler). Jade later explains that the <b>Roaches,</b> Reapers, and Ular Boys are secretly backed by Russia, China, and Japan, respectively, to bring down Baby Panay, but Rico and Sheldon wonder what the small island has which is so attractive to superpowers. They track down and assassinate the foreign intelligence officers liaising with the factions.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and <b>roaches</b> that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that <b>roaches</b> were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
40|$|Myxobolus pseudodispar (Gorbunova) is {{a common}} {{parasite}} of the muscle of <b>roach,</b> Rutilus rutilus L., whereas its actinosporean development occurs in two oligochaete alternate hosts. This paper reports the complete developmental cycle of this parasite in the oligochaete alternate host Tubifex tubifex and the <b>roach.</b> In laboratory experiments, parasite-free T. tubifex specimens were infected by myxospores of M. pseudodispar collected from <b>roach</b> in Lake Balaton. Parasite-free <b>roach</b> fingerlings were infected with floating triactinospores (TAMs) released from oligochaetes on day 69 after challenge. Young plasmodia and spores in <b>roach</b> were first recorded on day 80 post-exposure (p. e.).

50|$|Following <b>Roach's</b> {{death and}} the {{settlement}} of all the company's debts, <b>Roach's</b> heirs found themselves still in possession of both the Chester shipyard and the Morgan Iron Works. <b>Roach's</b> eldest son John Baker <b>Roach</b> assumed head of the business, which would continue for another 20 years, although the yard would never again regain the pre-eminent position in American shipbuilding that it had enjoyed under <b>Roach</b> Sr.|$|R

25|$|Cockroaches {{are mainly}} nocturnal and will run away {{when exposed to}} light. A study tested the {{hypothesis}} that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the Free University of Brussels and other European institutions created a set of tiny robots that appear to the <b>roaches</b> as other <b>roaches</b> and can thus alter the roaches' perception of critical mass. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real <b>roaches.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Kentucky {{a similar}} study was done, {{examining}} the fecal pellets and stomach contents of the bats {{in and around the}} caves. The processed food showed that in this particular area the Virginia Big-Eared Bat had a diet of mainly Lepidoptera (moths) and Coleoptera (beetles), along with spiders, crickets, <b>roaches,</b> flies, ants, wasps and bees.|$|E
25|$|Techniques for {{eliminating}} centipedes from homes include {{drying up}} {{the areas where}} they thrive, eliminating large indoor insect populations, sealing cracks in the walls, pouring bleach down shower and sink drains, and seeking the assistance of an exterminator. An alternative is to let them live, allowing them to control pests, e.g., <b>roaches,</b> flies, moths, bed bugs, silverfish, earwigs, etc.|$|E

25|$|Like all Cyclura species the Anegada {{ground iguana}} is {{primarily}} herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers and fruits from different plant species. However, due to direct competition with grazing livestock in its native habitat such as sheep, goats, burros, and cattle {{they have been}} reduced to eating vegetation rejected by these domestic and feral animals. This has also caused them to become opportunistic carnivores preying upon centipedes, millipedes, <b>roaches,</b> insects, and other invertebrates as opposed to being strict herbivores.|$|E

25|$|Cockroaches {{are most}} common in {{tropical}} and subtropical climates. Some species are in close association with human dwellings and widely found around garbage or in the kitchen. Cockroaches are generally omnivorous {{with the exception of}} the wood-eating species such as Cryptocercus; these <b>roaches</b> are incapable of digesting cellulose themselves, but have symbiotic relationships with various protozoans and bacteria that digest the cellulose, allowing them to extract the nutrients. The similarity of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus to those in termites are such that it has been suggested that they are more closely related to termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis of relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensis, an Australian cave dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, and which recent genetic studies indicates are very primitive cockroaches.|$|E
25|$|There {{were major}} changes {{following}} World War II. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harlem {{was the scene}} of a series of rent strikes by neighborhood tenants, led by local activist Jesse Gray, together with the Congress of Racial Equality, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU), and other groups. These groups wanted the city to force landlords {{to improve the quality of}} housing by bringing them up to code, to take action against rats and <b>roaches,</b> to provide heat during the winter, and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations. The largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem. Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of new projects. From the mid-20th century, the low quality of education in Harlem has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under grade level in math. In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school boycotts to call attention to the problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students stayed home. In the post-World War II era, Harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the city's blacks, but it remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly black America.|$|E
