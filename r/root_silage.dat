40|$|The {{experiment}} {{aimed at}} determining the nutritional value of integral cassava root silages with yogurt as inoculant or wastewater (manipueira) by liquid addition ensiling process. Eighteen crossbred piglets (Large White × Landrace), castrated males {{with an initial}} average weight of 50  kg were allocated in metabolism cages throughout 11 -day trial duration (6 days for animal's adaptation to the cages and to the experimental diets, and 5 days of urine and faeces collection). The experimental design was a randomized block arrangement with 3 treatments and 6 replicates: basal diet (100 %); mixture composed of 75 % basal diet and 25 % integral cassava <b>root</b> <b>silage</b> with yogurt as inoculant; a mixture composed of 75 % of basal diet and 25 % integral cassava <b>root</b> <b>silage</b> with wastewater. The silages with wastewater and yogurt presented the following values of apparent digestibility of dry matter 89. 96 % and 90. 01 %, apparent digestibility of crude protein of 60. 67 % and 66. 43 %, apparent digestibility of gross energy of 90. 43 % and 91. 48 %, gross energy metabolizability coefficients of 87. 88 % and 88. 93 %, digestible energy values of 3, 705 and 3, 783  kcal/kg on a dry matter (DM) basis, and metabolizable energy values of 3, 600 and 3, 676  kcal/kg DM, respectively. The results have demonstrated that integral cassava root silages with wastewater or yogurt have a high nutritional value {{and can be used}} as an alternative energy source in growing pig's diets...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at the Southwestern State University of Bahia (UESB), Bahia, Brazil, in order to verify the kinetic of dry matter ruminal degradation of cassava byproducts. Two cows, fistulated in the rumen, were used to incubate samples in nylon bags for 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, in a completely randomized block design, resulting in four incubation periods for each sample. Tested feedstuffs were cassava root (T 1), cassava <b>root</b> <b>silage</b> treated with 3 % of urea (T 2), cassava aereal part hay (CLH) harvested at 5 (T 3) or 14 months of age (T 4) and the stems of cassava plants, harvested at 14 months, planted in continuous rows (T 5) or 0, 6 meters between plants (T 6) along the planting line. Percentual results of feed rumen degradabilities (P), were adjusted to the mathematical model "P = a + b (1 - e-ct) ". Average percent results found in the treatments were compared using Student-Newman-Keuls test, {{at the level of}} 5 % of probability. Results for treatments 1 to 6, were respectively: soluble fraction (74, 8 b; 80, 9 ª; 26, 3 c; 23, 6 d; 22, 4 d; 22, 3 d), effective degradability (90, 7 b; 92, 0 ª; 65, 4 c; 62, 4 d; 41, 8 e; 40, 9 e), potential degradability (99, 1 ª; 99, 4 ª; 74, 4 b; 73, 4 b; 49, 2 c; 46, 8 d) and lag time in hours (0, 4 cb; 0, 1 c; 1, 5 ba; 1, 5 ba; 1, 6 ba; 1, 8 ª). These results indicate a high level of ruminal solubility of cassava <b>root</b> <b>silage</b> treated with urea and a higher degradation rate of CH harvested at 5 months compared to CH harvested at 14 months of age...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this experiment {{was to compare}} the drying and ensiling methods to reduce cyanides contents in cassava, as well as related nutrient components. This experiment used roots and stems of cas-sava, fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (FJLB) and molasses. A completely randomized design {{was used in this}} experiment for 8 treatments. The treatments were 30 o C incubator, 50 o C incubator, 70 o C oven drying, freeze drying, 2 d incubator 30 o C ensiling, 2 d incubator 50 o C ensiling, 2 w incubator 30 o C ensiling and 2 w incubator 50 o C ensiling. The contents of HCN, acetone cyanohydrin, linamarin, proximate components and in vitro dry matter digestibility were determined in each treatment. The result of this experi-ment showed that the contents of HCN and linamarin in ensiled cassava roots were lower (p< 0. 01) than in dried cassava roots. There were no significantly different on residual HCN among treatments in cassava stems. The content of linamarin was higher in freeze drying than that in heat drying methods (p< 0. 05). There was an opposite pattern of acetone cyanohydrins and linamarin content of roots and stems. The content of dry matter (DM) in 30 o C ensiling was lower than in 50 o C ensiling (p< 0. 05). The content of ash increased in cassava <b>roots</b> <b>silage</b> (p< 0. 01), meanwhile the decreasing of ether extract content was occured in cassava stem silage (p< 0. 01). Ensiling method was more effective to reduce cyanide than the drying method, and cassava silage showed a proper qualification as feed. Keywords: Drying, Ensiling, Cyanides, Cassav...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} world {{experience}} of using zeolites in manufacturing food packaging materials {{with a view}} to extend food storage. Antimicrobial properties of zeolites are confirmed by the results of the re-search of antifungal mixture for prolongation of food products shelf life. They correlate with the experience of using the mixture in agriculture as a fungicide and preservative for corn, <b>root</b> crops, sunflower, <b>silage.</b> The ability of zeolites to inactivate pathogens and accelerate excretion of metabolic products from the human body as well as products of disturbed metabolism and toxic compounds derived from the environment was considered. In medicine almost all zeolites are used as highly effective sorbents, and it is confirmed by the positive results of their use in the treatment of poisoning and other intoxications, and for their prevention. Thus, they can be used as raw materials in the development of food with detoxicative properties for people who face food, environmental or occupational poisoning.

40|$|Nitrate {{leaching}} from agricultural lands can pollute groundwater, and {{the degree}} of pollution caused significantly depends on agricultural practices implemented on farms. Field studies required to evaluate the effects of various agricultural management strategies on nitrate leaching are expensive and time consuming. As a result, it is suggested to use crop models to simulate the effects of management practices on nitrate leaching. Plant growth models such as DSSAT software package can simulate daily plant growth and development, and also are capable of simulating daily nitrate leaching and nitrogen uptake by plants. However, it is required to evaluate the performance of any model before using it for any specific region. In this study, the performance of nitrogen balance model of DSSAT software package was evaluated to simulate nitrate leaching from the <b>root</b> zone of <b>silage</b> maize at different levels of applied water and nitrogen fertilizer. The experiment consisted of three levels of nitrogen fertilizers, including zero, 150 and 200 kg N ha- 1 and four levels of applied water 0. 7 SMD (soil moisture depletion), 0. 85 SMD, 1. 0 SMD and 1. 13 SMD. Nitrate-nitrogen leaching from 36 plots at the 60 cm depth during the growing period was measured by soil moisture suction equipment (ceramic suction cups, CSC). After calibrating the model by using field data, its performance was evaluated to simulate nitrate leaching. Maximum amount of N leaching 8. 4 kg N ha- 1 was obtained from over irrigation treatment with the application of 150 kg nitrogen per hectare. The model simulated nitrate leaching for this treatment as 7. 8 kg N ha- 1. The model consistently underestimated the nitrate leaching; however, it followed the behavior of nitrate leaching during the growing season. In deficit irrigation treatments, the nitrate leaching was very low and close to zero and the model simulated the same result accordingly. The results showed that the model, in addition to phenological stages and performance indicators, can simulate nitrate leaching from the root zone and could be used to evaluate the effects of various irrigation and fertilizer management strategies on nitrate leaching...|$|R
