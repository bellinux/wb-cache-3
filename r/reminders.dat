40|$|A single-subject ABA {{reversal}} {{design was}} applied {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a limited 8 -s safety belt <b>reminder</b> system and two modified <b>reminder</b> systems (a delayed and second <b>reminder)</b> to increase the safety belt use of 13 drivers. The research was conducted with a specially equipped research vehicle that permitted the manipulation of different safety belt <b>reminder</b> stimuli and the unobtrusive recording of a driver's belt use. For 2 subjects, the limited 8 -s <b>reminder</b> increased safety belt use. For another 2 subjects, the second <b>reminder</b> markedly increased belt use. Some subjects were uninfluenced by the <b>reminder</b> systems presented; others always buckled up during both baseline and intervention conditions. The approach and results are discussed with regard to the application of behavior analysis methodologies (e. g., cumulative records) and principles (e. g., schedules of reinforcement) to advance the utility and investigation of safety belt <b>reminder</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of three computerized <b>reminder</b> systems {{in the delivery of}} five preventive procedures in family practice. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Ottawa Civic Hospital Family Medicine Centre. PARTICIPANTS: Of 8502 patients 15 years of age or more who were not in a hospital or institution 5883 were randomly assigned, by family, to a control group, a physician <b>reminder</b> group (passive) or a telephone or letter <b>reminder</b> group (active). The remaining 2619 patients {{were not included in the}} randomized portion of the study but were monitored. INTERVENTION: During 1 year the patients in the active <b>reminder</b> groups received a telephone call or letter reminding them of any overdue preventive procedures; for those in the passive <b>reminder</b> group the physician was reminded at an office visit to provide any overdue service. OUTCOME MEASURE: Rates of completion of the preventive procedures required. MAIN RESULTS: All three <b>reminder</b> systems significantly improved the delivery of preventive services (p less than 0. 001). The procedure completion rates were 42. 0 % in the letter <b>reminder</b> group, 42. 0 % in the telephone <b>reminder</b> group, 33. 7 % in the physician <b>reminder</b> group and 14. 1 % in the randomized control group. The use of a letter was more cost-effective than the telephone system, but the physician <b>reminder</b> system was the most cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Computerized <b>reminder</b> systems do improve the delivery of preventive services in family practice...|$|R

We then present our vision on how <b>reminder</b> objects can enrich the user’s experience by combining different objects. We then use the three following sections to showcase corresponding examples of our work in the previously described field. Next, three scenarios—people with dementia living an independent life at home, checking the weather, and navigating the city—will illustrate our understanding of <b>reminder</b> objects.

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2007. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 45). This is not always possible {{for a person to}} remember all things or events by himself or herself, he or she needs to be reminded. To remind or not to forget to do things at right time on the right place is called <b>Reminder</b> Service. It could be reminded by one’s own self, someone else or have sort of technological intervention or gadgets to remind. Manually people remind by calendar or it could be reminded by <b>reminder</b> card, to do list, cheat sheet etc. But now-a-days <b>reminder</b> could be done by technologically by computer, e-mail from websites or by PDA and most of all by cell-phone. Cell-phone has great potential for <b>reminder</b> purpose because of wide availability. But the cell phone’s built in <b>reminder</b> system requires user to be smart enough to activate and deactivate the service when never appropriate. An easy alternative solution could be SMS based <b>reminder.</b> To remind someone’s birthday, anniversary, holiday, parties, deadlines etc are the most common purposes for <b>Reminder</b> Service. The objective of my thesis is to explore the perception of potential users about such SMS based <b>reminder</b> service and evaluation of effectiveness of demo based <b>reminder</b> service. Md.

40|$|Purpose: Non-adherence is a {{critical}} factor associated with failure of topical therapy in glaucoma. Electronic <b>reminder</b> systems for eye drop medications may allow improving adherence to intraocular-pressure lowering agents. This pilot study aimed to assess the functionality of a new visual and audible <b>reminder</b> system for latanoprost eye drops {{and its impact on}} adherence rates in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Methods: Commercially available eye drops containing 0. 005 % latanoprost (Xalatan®, Pfizer Pharma GmbH, Germany) were placed in modified dosing aids (Xal-Ease™, Pfizer Pharma GmbH) equipped with electronic adherence monitoring and <b>reminder</b> devices. After written informed consent and with approval of the ethics committee 9 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension applied latanoprost eye drops once-daily for 2 months. Patients received new medication on monthly return appointments. During the first month the devices were programmed to record adherence without emission of any <b>reminder</b> signal. During the second month the therapy was enforced by audible and visual signals emitted from the electronic devices in case of non-adherence at designated hours (9 pm). Electronic dosing information was analyzed for mean rates of adherence, coverage and dosing time intervals. End of coverage was defined as dosing intervals exceeding 27 hours. The effect of the <b>reminder</b> signals was assed by comparisons of means for the first month (without <b>reminder</b> signal) the second month (with <b>reminder</b> signal) and used non parametric tests: Mann-Whitney-U test or Wilcoxon signed rank test where applicable. Results: One patient quit the study due to handling difficulties with the Xal-Ease™ device. The mean dose adherence rate of the remaining 8 patients with activated audible and visual <b>reminder</b> signals was 99. 8 ± 1. 1 % and thus significantly higher than without <b>reminder</b> signals (mean 91. 1 ± 25. 8 %, p= 0. 03). Accordingly, the mean dosing intervals were also reduced from 31. 3 ± 20. 2 to 23. 7 ± 0. 6 hours (p= 0. 04) with active <b>reminder</b> signals. Without <b>reminder</b> signals 3 out of 8 patients had a drug coverage rate below 90 % (mean 85. 7 ± 25. 9 %), whereas with activated <b>reminder</b> signal all patients had a coverage rate above 95 % (mean 98. 7 ± 1. 9 %, p= 0. 09). Conclusions: Audible and visual <b>reminder</b> signals improved significantly adherence to topical latanoprost for glaucoma in this pilot study. Our data show that electronic <b>reminder</b> devices can be useful in glaucoma therapy even for medications with a once-daily dosing schedule. Still, the long-term effect of this <b>reminder</b> system on adherence remains to be studied in large cohorts...|$|R

5|$|Touching {{the names}} of the dead on {{memorials}} was common gesture of grieving in the inter-war period; sometimes mourners would also kiss the names. Visitors to the memorials on the Western front would often photograph or trace on paper the relevant names on the memorials, taking these <b>reminders</b> back with them to their homes. By contrast, the naming of the dead played a less significant role in Italy, where formal lists of the war dead were not established until the mid-1920s; local communities compiled their own lists, used to produce local memorial plaques, but the national lists remained inaccurate for many years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after the war the natural ice {{industry}} collapsed into insignificance. Industry turned entirely to plant ice and mechanical cooling systems and the introduction of cheap electric motors resulted in domestic, modern refrigerators becoming common in U.S. homes by the 1930s and more widely across Europe in the 1950s, allowing ice {{to be made in the}} home. The natural ice harvests shrunk dramatically and ice warehouses were abandoned or converted for other uses. The use of natural ice on a small scale lingered on in more remote areas for some years, and ice continued to be occasionally harvested for carving at artistic competitions and festivals, but by the end of the 20th century there were very few physical <b>reminders</b> of the trade.|$|E
5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} dead of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as <b>reminders</b> of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the black majority.

40|$|Memory traces, once established, are {{no longer}} {{sensitive}} to disruption by metabolic inhibitors. However, memories reactivated by <b>reminder</b> are once again vulnerable, in a time-dependent manner, to amnestic treatment. To determine whether the metabolic events following a <b>reminder</b> recapitulate those following initial training we examined the temporal dynamics of amnesia induced by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and the glycosylation inhibitor 2 -deoxygalactose. The effects of both were transient and dependent on time of <b>reminder</b> post-training and time of injection relative to <b>reminder,</b> and differed from those following initial training. 2 -[C- 14]-deoxyglucose uptake increased in two brain regions, the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) and lobus parolfactorius (LPO) following <b>reminder</b> as it did following training, but the increase was bilateral rather than confined to the left hemisphere and was more marked in LPO than IMHV. C-fos expression after <b>reminder</b> was increased only in the LPO, the chick brain region associated with a late phase of memory processing and recall. Thus although, like initial consolidation, memory processing after <b>reminder</b> is sensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis and glycosylation, the temporal and pharmacological dynamics indicate differences between these two processes...|$|R
40|$|Background: The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in England offers {{biennial}} guaiac faecal {{occult blood}} testing (gFOBt). There is a socioeconomic gradient in participation and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups have worse colorectal cancer survival than more advantaged groups. We compared the effectiveness {{and cost of}} an enhanced <b>reminder</b> letter with the usual <b>reminder</b> letter on overall uptake of gFOBt and the socioeconomic gradient in uptake. Methods: We enhanced the usual <b>reminder</b> by including a heading ‘A <b>reminder</b> to you’ and a short paragraph restating the offer of screening in simple language. We undertook a cluster-randomised trial of all 168 480 individuals who were due to receive a <b>reminder</b> over 20 days in 2013. Randomisation {{was based on the}} day of invitation. Blinding of individuals was not possible, but the possibility of bias was minimal owing to the lack of direct contact with participants. The enhanced <b>reminder</b> was sent to 78 067 individuals and 90 413 received the usual <b>reminder.</b> The primary outcome was the proportion of people adequately screened and its variation by quintile of Index of Multiple Deprivation. Data were analysed by logistic regression with conservative variance estimates to take account of cluster randomisation. Results: There was a small but statistically significant (P ¼ 0. 001) increase in participation with the enhanced <b>reminder</b> (25. 8 % vs 25. 1 %). There was significant (P ¼ 0. 005) heterogeneity of the effect by socioeconomic status with an 11 % increase in the odds of participation in the most deprived quintile (from 13. 3 to 14. 1 %) and no increase in the least deprived. We estimated that implementing the enhanced <b>reminder</b> nationally could result in up to 80 more people with high or intermediate risk colorectal adenomas and up to 30 more cancers detected each year if it were implemented nationally. The intervention incurred a small one- off cost of d 78 000 to modify the <b>reminder</b> letter. Conclusions: The enhanced <b>reminder</b> increases overall uptake and reduces the socioeconomic gradient in bowel cancer screening participation at little additional cost...|$|R
