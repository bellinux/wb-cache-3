30|$|Considering the {{hydrological}} {{boundary conditions}} the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> capacity {{was set to}} approx. 9  m 3 /s. This value includes safety margins and refers to the plant’s design storage level of 15  m which was defined in accordance to local geological characteristics (see “Determination of the hydraulic head”). As it later became apparent (rainy season 2011 / 2012), however, peak discharge values distinctly above 10  m 3 /s occurred as well as ongoing high discharge values exceeding the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> capacity for days. In total this lead to extreme storage levels, which are especially critical in terms of seepage in spatial proximity to the barrage (see “Initial operational phase”). Fortunately they did not cause any damage to the plant or the surrounding geology. Although fragmentary discharge data of the past decades do not allow a statistical classification of this event, investigations of KIT showed the necessity of extending the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> discharge capacity. Even though {{it is assumed that}} the observed event will only occur sporadically in the future, the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> discharge capacity was extended to approx. 11.5  m 3 /s (also referring to the plant’s design storage level of 15 m).|$|R

50|$|Formed in 1977, the Design Institute for Emergency <b>Relief</b> <b>Systems</b> was a {{consortium}} of 29 companies {{under the auspices of}} the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) that developed methods for the design of emergency <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> to handle runaway reactions. Its purpose was to develop the technology and methods needed for sizing pressure <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> for chemical reactors, particularly those in which exothermic reactions are carried out. Such reactions include many classes of industrially important processes including polymerizations, nitrations, diazotizations, sulphonations, epoxidations, aminations, esterifications, neutralizations and many others. Pressure <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> can be difficult to design, not least because what is expelled can be gas/vapour, liquid, or a mixture of the two - just as with a can of carbonated drink when it is suddenly opened. For chemical reactions, it requires extensive knowledge of both chemical reaction hazards and fluid flow.|$|E

40|$|In a {{disaster}} <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> transshipment {{plays an important}} role to improve the management of inventory. For a humanitarian supply chain with transshipment and without transshipment the system dynamics simulation was used to compare inventory control and costs. The simulation study on a system consisting of two warehouses where transshipment is allowed compared to the alternative where transshipment is not allowed, gives the framework. The literature studies indicate that transshipment may reduce costs and improve service levels.

50|$|Hydraulic surges {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient. Fluctuations in the fluid’s velocity are generated by restrictions like a pump starting/stopping, a valve opening/closing, or a reduction in line size. Hydraulic surges can be generated {{within a matter of}} seconds anywhere that the fluid velocity changes and can travel through a pipeline at very high rate of speed, damaging equipment or causing piping failures from overpressurizing. Surge <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system. Methods for controlling hydraulic surges include utilizing a gas-loaded surge relief valve, spring-loaded pressure safety valves, pilot-operated valves, surge suppressors, and rupture disks.|$|E

5000|$|At {{this point}} the Shuttle and {{external}} tank were on a slightly suborbital trajectory, coasting up towards apogee. Once at apogee, {{about half an hour}} after MECO, the Shuttle's Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines were fired to raise its perigee and achieve orbit, while the external tank fell back into the atmosphere and burned up over the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean depending on launch profile. [...] The sealing action of the tank plumbing and lack of pressure <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> on the external tank helped it break up in the lower atmosphere.

40|$|During {{the early}} modern period the poor <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> of the Dutch Republic were the most {{elaborate}} and generous forms of poor relief found anywhere in the world. Poor relief in the Dutch Republic was provided by a myriad of different organizations including churches, civic governments, guilds, private institutions of poor relief, and semi-public administrative boards. Although civic governments {{played an important role}} in the provision of poor relief, it remained a limited role and civic governments preferred to delegate responsibility over poor relief to existing institutions. Provincial governments, aside from Friesland, and the national government of the Dutch Republic played even less of a role in the provision of poor relief. The Dutch Republic resisted most attempts at centralized control over poor relief, even as other cities and eventually countries in Europe reformed their own poor <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> to come under state control. According to the influential theorist, Abram de Swaan, this lack of centralization should have resulted in a complete collapse of Dutch poor <b>relief</b> <b>systems.</b> However, as later scholars have argued, Dutch poor <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> thrived and survived without coming under direct state control until the 20 th century. In light of the failure of De Swaan’s model, alternative models of poor relief in the Dutch Republic have been proposed, but a universally accepted theory has not yet emerged, partially as a result of several insufficiently studied themes in poor relief in the Dutch Republic. One of these themes is the experience of poor relief in rural areas. In an attempt to contribute to the field, this thesis will conduct a case study on poor relief in the village of Berkel en Rodenrijs during the crisis period at the end of the 18 th century that eventually resulted in the collapse of the Dutch Republic. Despite extreme pressure, and contrary to De Swaan’s predictions, the poor relief system of Berkel en Rodenrijs seems to have survived the chaos...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the practice and}} application of relief policy in Saskatoon {{during the years of}} the Great Depression. The research focuses particularly on the effect of relief policy on the lives of women, and the effect, in turn, of women's activities on relief. The thesis argues that the Canadian <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> was based primarily on specific principles derived from the British <b>system</b> of <b>relief,</b> principles based mainly on moral judgements and economic concerns. These principles, largely considered failures in Britain by World War I, continued to influence relief policy in Canada until the experiences of the Depression proved their inadequacy. In Britain they failed because they did not meet their objectives of reducing the escalating costs of relief and controlling the labour of men. The economic depression of the thirties revealed similar failures in Canada. Using Saskatoon as a case study, the activities of those on relief in particular, the women who found themselves on relief and the women in various organizations who attempted to supplement and subsidize the inadequacies of relief - are examined. Their activities are considered to be fundamental to the emergence of a community consensus which rejected the moral and economic principles of relief. The consensus was that the <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> should be replaced by a national and centralized system of unemployment insurance and other welfare programs. The establishment of this understanding was an outcome of the direct and widespread experience with an outmoded <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> inherited from Britain...|$|R
