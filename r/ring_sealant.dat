For this application, the membrane materials require mixed ionic and electronic conductivities {{in a large}} range of pO 2 resulting in an excellent oxygen semi-permeation of the membrane to improve methane conversion. In this paper, particular attention {{is given to the}} influence of sealant materials on oxygen semi-permeation performances of membrane materials. For instance, oxygen semi-permeation measurements have been performed with La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 Fe 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 O 3 −ı membranes under an oxygen partial pressure gradient at temperatures from 700 ◦C to 1000 ◦C with different sealing materials (glass or gold <b>ring</b> <b>sealant)</b> between the membrane and the support. The result leads {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of sealing on oxygen transport through the La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 Fe 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 O 3 −ı membrane. Indeed, a gold sealing material is required for accurate measurements of oxygen semi-permeation flux...|$|E

Solder sleeves also commonly contain a <b>ring</b> of heat-activated <b>sealant</b> {{on the inside of}} each end of the tubing, allowing the connection to also be made waterproof.|$|R
