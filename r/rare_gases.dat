500|$|Noble gas is {{translated}} from the German noun , first used in 1898 by Hugo Erdmann to indicate their extremely low level of reactivity. The name makes an analogy to the term [...] "noble metals", which also have low reactivity. The noble gases have also {{been referred to as}} inert gases, but this label is deprecated as many noble gas compounds are now known. <b>Rare</b> <b>gases</b> is another term that was used, but this is also inaccurate because argon forms a fairly considerable part (0.94% by volume, 1.3% by mass) of the Earth's atmosphere due to decay of radioactive potassium-40.|$|E
500|$|Neon is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is a noble gas. Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds {{the density of}} air. It was discovered (along with krypton and xenon) in 1898 {{as one of the}} three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air, after nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide were removed. Neon was the second of these three <b>rare</b> <b>gases</b> to be discovered, and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red emission spectrum. The name neon is derived from the Greek word, , neuter singular form of [...] (neos), meaning new. Neon is chemically inert and no uncharged neon compounds are known.

The measurement of kinetic energy distributions indicated that the desorbing energy of clusters depend on the <b>rare</b> <b>gas</b> species of the substrates and the cluster size.

40|$|Reactive {{quenching}} of {{the first}} two excited states of <b>rare</b> <b>gas</b> atoms, Rg(np 5 n+ 1 s, 3 P 2 and 3 P 1), by halogens yields <b>rare</b> <b>gas</b> halide molecules in the B and C states and with high vibrational distributions. Interpretation of the bound-free emission spectra permits assignment of the initial distributions. Subsequent collisions of the <b>rare</b> <b>gas</b> halide molecules with He, Ne and Ar bath gas atoms result in transfer between the B and C states and vibrational relaxation. For high v levels the transfer rate is faster than vibrational relaxation, but the reverse holds for lower v levels. This can lead to a 300 K Boltzmann vibrational distribution but a nonequilibrium electronic state distribution of <b>rare</b> <b>gas</b> halide molecules in the B and C states. Modeling of the variation of the <b>rare</b> <b>gas</b> halide electronic and vibrational distributions with pressure gives a state-to-state view of relaxation processes. Photolytic dissociation of XeF 2 yields XeF(B) in low v levels. Observation of the steady-state emission intensity from XeF(B), and XeF(C) from photodissociation in the presence of added reagents permits assignment of rate constants for B-C transfer and for quenching of XeF(B) and XeF(C) with 300 K Boltzmann vibrational distributions. Both the reactive quenching and photodissociation experiments indicate that the (C, Ω = 3 / 2) state is lower in energy than the (B, Ω = 1 / 2) state for XeF, XeCl and KrF.
