50|$|For common flows (the ones {{which can}} usually be {{considered}} as incompressible or isothermal), the kinematic viscosity is everywhere uniform over all the flow field and constant in time, {{so there is no}} choice on the viscosity parameter, which becomes naturally the kinematic viscosity of the fluid being considered at the temperature being considered. On the other hand, the <b>reference</b> <b>length</b> is always an arbitrary parameter, so particular attention should be put when comparing flows around different obstacles or in channels of different shapes: the global Reynolds numbers should be referred to the same <b>reference</b> <b>length.</b> This is actually the reason for which most precise sources for airfoil and channel flow data specify the <b>reference</b> <b>length</b> at a pedix to the Reynolds number. The <b>reference</b> <b>length</b> can vary depending on the analysis to be performed: for body with circle sections such as circular cylinders or spheres, one usually chooses the diameter; for an airfoil, a generic non-circular cylinder or a bluff body or a revolution body like a fuselage or a submarine, it is usually the profile chord or the profile thickness, or some other given widths that are in fact stable design inputs; for flow channels usually the hydraulic diameter) about which the fluid is flowing.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, for an {{aerodynamic}} profile the <b>reference</b> <b>length</b> {{depends on}} the analysis. In fact, the profile chord is usually chosen as the <b>reference</b> <b>length</b> also for aerodynamic coefficient for wing sections and thin profiles in which the primary target is to maximize the lift coefficient or the lift/drag ratio (i.e. as usual in thin airfoil theory, one would employ the chord Reynolds as the flow speed parameter for comparing different profiles). On the other hand, for fairings and struts the given parameter is usually the dimension of internal structure to be streamlined (let us think for simplicity it is a beam with circular section), and the main target is to minimize the drag coefficient or the drag/lift ratio. The main design parameter which becomes naturally also a <b>reference</b> <b>length</b> is therefore the profile thickness (the profile dimension or area perpendicular to the flow direction), rather than the profile chord.|$|E

50|$|A general {{parameter}} {{that indicates}} the formability and ductility of a material is the fracture strain which {{is determined by}} a uniaxial tensile test (see also fracture toughness). The strain identified by this test is defined by elongation {{with respect to a}} <b>reference</b> <b>length.</b> For example, a length of abbr=on 80 mm is used for the standardized uniaxial test of flat specimens, pursuant to EN 10002. It {{is important to note that}} deformation is homogeneous up to uniform elongation. Strain subsequently localizes until fracture occurs. Fracture strain is not an engineering strain since distribution of the deformation is inhomogeneous within the <b>reference</b> <b>length.</b> Fracture strain is nevertheless a rough indicator of the formability of a material. Typical values of the fracture strain are: 7% for ultra-high-strength material, and over 50% for mild-strength steel.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to provide an {{enhanced}} adaptive approach to classic queue-based Bandwidth-on-Demand (BoD) procedures in broadband satellite networks. In queue-based schemes, the controller's objective is to drive the buffer queue length to an appropriate <b>reference</b> queue <b>length,</b> and {{the efficiency of the}} control strictly depends on the choice of its reference value. In latest approaches, solutions to adaptively modify the target <b>reference</b> queue <b>length</b> based on a set of network information have been proposed; nevertheless, in such approaches, the satellite terminals should base their control strategies on information which are not available to them, according to the communication standards of state-of-the-art technologies, such as DVB-RCS.

The percent of rent subsidized by government and sex of household head had little effect on applicant acceptance.
