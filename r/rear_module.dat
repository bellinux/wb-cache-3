The {{study was conducted in}} the zootechnical district of the Apulian Murgia, featuring a high productive specialization. The farm module was defined by analyzing and identifying both quantitative and qualitative parameters. The optimum number of heads per farm (quantitative parameter) was determined on the basis of technical and regulatory references of agronomic and environmental type as well as through direct surveys. The qualitative assessment, performed in order to define the <b>rearing</b> <b>module</b> from a building standpoint, was carried out by comparing the <b>rearing</b> <b>module</b> previously determined in consideration of the regulations on the subjects of hygiene (Community Directives 92 / 46 and 92 / 47), animal wellbeing (Community Directives 98 / 58 and 92 / 2) and the natural environment (Community Directives 79 / 409 and 92 / 43). The study we conducted enabled us to establish the optimum number of heads in terms of profitability and made it possible for us {{to define a}} building model suitable to satisfy the needs of farms with regard to production as well as environmental and landscaping requirements.

50|$|CLEVER employs an {{electronically}} {{controlled and}} hydraulically actuated Direct Tilt Control {{system with a}} maximum tilt angle of ±45° 6. A pair of single acting hydraulic actuators generate a tilting moment about the tilt bearing (which joins the cabin and <b>rear</b> <b>module).</b> The tilt controller uses driver’s steer input and the vehicle’s speed to estimate the lateral acceleration and hence the appropriate tilt angle. The DTC system provides excellent stability at low speeds but during vigorous manoeuvres at higher speeds the system’s torque output exceeds that which can be reacted by the non-tilting rear module; {{as a result the}} inside rear wheel lifts, this can lead to the vehicle rolling over.|$|E

The <b>rear</b> <b>module</b> does not tilt and accounts for approximately 40% of the laden vehicle mass meaning only 60% can be tilted {{to balance the}} vehicle whilst cornering.

40|$|Electric and hybrid {{vehicles}} with narrow track are very suited to sustainable urban mobility. A particular tilting three wheeled vehicle {{has been developed}} at Padova University. It is composed of a tilting front module (one wheel) and a non-tilting <b>rear</b> <b>module</b> (two wheels). The {{lower part of the}} front module is connected to {{the upper part of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>module</b> by means of four revolute joints and two rockers. Therefore, the two modules of the vehicle and the two rockers make a four-bar linkage. A specific code for kinematic, dynamic and electric analysis of this vehicle has been developed, with the aim of showing the effects of linkage set-up and mass distribution on the handling and stability characteristics. Some numerical results are presented. This particular three-wheeled vehicle is well suited both to advanced electric and hybrid propulsion systems. A section of this paper shows the characteristics of an electric version for fast urban mobility, that is named E-Snake. The performances of E-Snake were assessed by means of many road tests and were confirmed when it participated in Formula Electric and Hybrid Italy: in 2008 E-Snake was the winner of its category. The last section of the paper deals with Hy-Snake, a new version of the three wheeled vehicle for sustainable urban and sub-urban mobility. The principal feature of Hy-Snake is the series hybrid propulsion system. Some numerical results show the effectiveness of the integration between mechanical and electrical design.

40|$|AbstractBifacial {{solar modules}} are {{becoming}} increasingly more attractive stimulated {{by the development of}} new solar cell structures enabling to capture solar insolation on both front and rear surfaces. The possibilities to be installed in the conventional south facing orientation or even vertically are further advantages. Although the potential of bifacial modules have been already shown in specific time intervals and for various ground albedos there is a lack in simulation studies up to now. In this study, we simulated the annual energy yield (AEY) of south facing bifacial modules using a rigorous calculation method of the ground reflected radiation reaching the <b>rear</b> <b>module</b> surface. The necessary tilt angle optimization is done incorporating the influence of module elevation and considering the inherent albedo coefficient. These simulations are able to reproduce measurement observations and show that at optimum tilt angles produced annual energy can be increased by 30 % compared to a standard module simply by positioning modules two meters above ground instead of a close to ground installation. Furthermore, a linear relationship between albedo coefficient and AEY is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture (MTCA) {{standard}} {{is a modern}} platform, that is gaining popularity {{in the area of}} High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. The standard provides extensive management, monitoring and diagnostics functionality. The hardware management is based on Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI), that was initially developed for management and monitoring of complex computers operation. The original IPMI specification was extended and new functions required for MTCA hardware management, were added. The Module Management Controller (MMC) is required on each Advanced Mezzanine Card installed in MTCA chassis. The <b>Rear</b> Transition <b>Modules</b> (RTMs) require RMC management controller (<b>Rear</b> transition <b>module</b> Management Controller) that is specified in MTCA. 4 extension specification. The commercially available implementations of MMC and RMC are expensive and do not provide the whole functionality that is required by specific HEP applications. Therefore, many research centers and commercial companies work on their own implementation of AMC or RTM controllers. The available implementations suffer because of lack of a standard and interoperability problems. The Authors developed a unified solution of management controller fully compliant to MTCA and MTCA. 4 standards. The MMC v 1. 00 solution is dedicated for management of AMC and RTM modules. The MMC v 1. 00 is based on Atmel ATxmega MCU and can be fully customized by user or used as a drop-in-module without any modifications. The paper discusses the functionality of the MMC v 1. 00 solution. The implementation was verified with developed evaluation kits for AMC and RTM cards...|$|R
