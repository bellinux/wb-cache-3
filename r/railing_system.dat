40|$|The {{combination}} of microfabrication and microfluidics has enabled {{a variety of}} opportunities in making new tools for biological and diagnostic applications. For example, microdroplets-based systems have attracted lots of attentions in recent years due to potential advantages in controlled environments with fast reaction time, high-throughput and low noises. This work presents a number of advanced microfluidic systems in process, control and manipulation of microdroplets, including finger-powered pumps to generate microdroplets, continuous-flow rupture reactors for the rupture and content retrieval of microdroplets, and magnetic microcapsules for drug delivery applications. Prototype `finger-powered' pumping systems have been designed and constructed and integrated with passive fluidic diodes to pump microfluidics, including the formation of microdroplets. No electrical power is needed for pumping by using a human finger as the actuation force to generate pressure heads. Both multilayer soft lithography and injection molding processes have been successfully utilized to make the pumping systems. Experimental results revealed that the pressure head generated from a human finger could be tuned based on the geometric characteristics of the system, with a maximum observed pressure of 7. 6 ± 0. 1 kPa. In addition to the delivery of multiple, distinct fluids into microfluidic channels, the finger-powered pumping system is also employed to achieve rapid formation of both water-in-oil droplets (106. 9 ± 4. 3 μm in diameter) and oil-in-water droplets (75. 3 ± 12. 6 μm in diameter), {{as well as the}} encapsulation of endothelial cells in microdroplets without using any external or electrical controllers. To advance the technology of microdroplets in microfluidic systems, the technique to rupture microdroplets via the continuous-flow micropost array <b>railing</b> <b>systems</b> has been developed. The key step is to transport water-in-oil microdroplets with surfactant into the pure oil microchannel to wash away the surfactant and allow the washed microdroplets to transport to the next water microchannel and rupture at the oil-water interface boundary. Microdroplets-based nanoparticle synthesis systems have been fabricated to demonstrate synthesis and retrieval of iron oxide nanoparticles without the need of an external centrifuge machine. In a second demonstration, a rapid solution alteration system for the bead-in-droplet microreactors has been demonstrated via the continuous flow micropost array railing technique. The prototype system has accomplished: (i) the retrieval of microbeads in water-in-oil droplets by the 'rupture' of the droplets, (ii) transfer of the released microbeads into a second solution, and (iii) the formation of new water-in-oil droplets containing the original microbeads and a different, second droplet solution. In these experiments, a total of four different microdroplets generation systems have been fabricated and different designs and operation conditions result in different sizes of microdroplets, including 41. 1 μm for the basic microdroplets rupture demonstration, 67. 5 μm for nanoparticle synthesis experiments, 61. 1 μm in the original solution, and 38. 6 μm for the new solution in the bead-in- droplets alternation experiments. In the last example, a new class of magnetic microcapsules with aqueous core and polymer shell containing magnetic nanoparticles has been demonstrated for possible drug delivery applications. The {{combination of}} multi-layer flow-focusing methodology and an optofluidic polymerization process is employed to form double emulsions of water-in-photocurable polymer microdroplets. A subsequently polymerization process cure the magnetic polymer shells and encapsulates drug materials in the core. Experimentally, remote manipulations of the magnetic microcapsules by applying an external magnetic field have been achieved. As such, the proposed microcapsules have the potential to overcome a number of hurdles associated with current state-of-art technologies: (1) magnetic shells can be guided by DC magnetic field for location control; (2) magnetic particles can be heated by AC magnetic field to break or change the porosity of the shells for active drug release control; and (3) encapsulated microdroplets can prevent the possible degradation and contamination of the drug materials during the transportation processes...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} {{methods and}} microfabrication techniques offer powerful means for meeting biological challenges. In particular, microfabrication processes enable researchers to develop technologies at scales that are biologically relevant and advantageous. In this work, microfabricated posts {{were employed to}} advance cell handling capabilities in both static and dynamic (i. e., microfluidic) systems. Static, substrate-based biophysical properties influence diverse cellular processes. Methods for engineering micropost arrays enable microscale control over the biophysical characteristics of discrete topographic features. Here, unidirectional micropost array gradients of variable micropost stiffness and variable interpost spacing were constructed to regulate cell motility using two distinct biophysical cues: (i) gradients in substrate rigidity (i. e., via durotaxis - a subset of mechanotaxis), and (ii) variable spacing of substrate binding sites - via a phenomenon herein referred to as spatiotaxis. Micropost array stiffness gradients were designed with post-to-post differences in stiffness of 0. 5 nN/µm, 2 nN/µm, 3 nN/µm, and 7. 5 nN/µm. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) seeded on micropost array gradients with variable micropost stiffness exhibited preferential cell migration {{in the direction of}} increasing micropost stiffness. Gradients of elliptical microposts further enhanced unidirectional guidance by limiting cellular movement perpendicular to the direction of increasing micropost stiffness. Micropost array spacing gradients were designed with average post-to-post differences in spacing of 10 nm, 20 nm, and 40 nm. Micropost array gradients with variable interpost spacing were found to promote BAEC migration in the direction of decreasing interpost spacing, which represents the first demonstration of unidirectional spatiotaxis. Higher gradient strengths were observed to enhance the aforementioned migratory behaviors for both biophysical cues. For substrates with simultaneous, anti-parallel stiffness and spatial stimuli, the spatial cues were found to dominate the migratory response. The micropost array gradient methodology offers a powerful technique for investigating the biophysical cellular response, while also providing the basis for new classes of passive substrates capable of directing cell motility in biological fields, such as biomaterials, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. In order to create high-speed lab-on-a-chip devices for quantitative cell biology, drug discovery, and molecular diagnostics, precision hydrodynamic controls of microparticles (e. g., cells and microbeads) are in critical demand. The ability to achieve multi-stage fluidic reaction processes for microparticles is integral to diverse chemical and biological applications; however, microfluidic particulate-based systems remain limited due to particle handling issues. In contrast to suspended cells, which are experimentally complex, microbeads offer a simplified example for initial demonstrations of microfluidic particulate handling. Thus, the ability to manipulate microbeads in microfluidic systems represents a fundamental first step toward advancing microfluidic cell handling. In this dissertation, microposts (15 × 15 µm 2) were arrayed within microfluidic architectures (18 µm in height) to enhance microparticle handling and enable multi-stage fluidic reactions and analyses for suspended particles. The presented microfluidic systems were first characterized using suspended microbeads (15 µm in diameter); thereafter, the potential of employing the platforms for cell handling applications was also investigated using suspended BAECs. A resettable, hydrodynamic microparticle trapping system - termed micropost array trapping (µPAT) - was designed and demonstrated to accomplish controlled particulate arraying and microarray resettability by trapping-and-releasing both microbeads and cells. The µPAT technique was integrated into: (i) a dynamic microarray to detect multiple bio-molecules in parallel via molecular beacon probes conjugated to microbead substrates, and (ii) a "Microfluidic Ping Pong" (MPP) system to achieve multi-stage fluidic reactions under discontinuous flow conditions. As a demonstrative example, the MPP technique was employed to detect an inflammatory cytokine at 100 pM concentrations via an 11 -stage aptamer beacon-based sandwich assay performed using microbeads. Additionally, a microfluidic micropost array <b>railing</b> (µPAR) <b>system</b> was developed to rapidly transport both microbeads and cells into adjacent flow streams under continuous flow conditions. To demonstrate the µPAR technique, a multiplexed layer-by-layer (LbL) molecular synthesis process (i. e., consisting of up to 18 fluidic stages) was accomplished on microbead substrates. This work represents the first demonstration of a microfluidic platform capable of railing either microbeads or cells into adjacent flow streams. Through improved microparticle handling in microfluidic systems, the presented methodologies could further extend the efficacy of dynamic cell-based and bead-based microarrays for applications in diverse chemical and biological fields...|$|R
