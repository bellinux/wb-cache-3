40|$|The EU {{consumer}} acquis {{has undergone}} significant overhaul {{in the past}} decades mainly following {{the publication of the}} Green Paper. The reform culminated with the enactment of a fully harmonized consumer rights directive which brings along a range of consumer-protective measures. Of these changes, the directive embraces auctions within the ambit of the directive in response to the hitherto vague exclusion under the distance selling directive. While the consumer rights directive definitively puts auctions within its bounds, it contains rather vague and ambiguous rules in regulating the scope <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> vis-à-vis auction. It generally denies the right for consumer contracts concluded at public auction while making absurd distinction between public auction and what it calls auctions via online platforms.

40|$|The {{provisions}} of the CFR dealing with mistake, non-disclosure and pre-contract information fulfil {{the functions of the}} CFR as a legislator's guide or toolbox stated in the European Commission's Action Plan documents: to provide definitions and model rules which the European legislator could employ were it minded to deal with these topics - for example, to give consumers who have been the victims of breaches of information duties stronger remedies than the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> currently required by, e. g., the Doorstep and Distance Selling Directives. The paper suggests that the CFR has a further function as a toolbox: to provide the legislator with essential background information about the different laws of the Member States. This information is necessary in order to decide whether European legislation is needed at all and, if so, how it can best be made to "fit" existing national laws. The {{provisions of}} the DCFR dealing with mistakes caused by one party giving incorrect information to the other represent what is "common core" to most of the national laws; but the provisions dealing with fraudulent non-disclosure and with mistakes that are known or should have been known to the other party do not represent common core, since on these points the laws differ widely. Rather the DCFR provisions represent a workable compromise position. This must be clearly flagged up in the Comments and Notes, or the CFR would be highly misleading. The study shows {{that it would not be}} feasible for the European legislator to provide fuller remedies by simply stating that the consumer shall have whatever remedies for mistake or non-disclosure are available under national law: many national systems provide only very limited remedies. It would be possible to provide that the consumer should have "remedies for mistake and non-disclosure", meaning that phrase to have an autonomous meaning, and to leave the CFR to provide a definition of those remedies. However, given the complexity of the topic and the enormous variations in the national laws, this approach would be risky: national legislators and courts might well not understand what is required. A detailed legislative scheme would be better. The DCFR offers a workable set of model rules, both on these issues under the general law of contract and for consumer contracts under the specific provisions dealing with information requirements in B 2 C contracts. The DCFR provisions would also fit well into a Optional Instrument that is aiming to meet the needs of SMEs seeking to enter transnational contracts...|$|R

In the second section discusses the concept of the right to desist in their different meanings. In the third, it is an exercise approach and conceptual comparison. In the fourth, the justification cited social, economic and legal right to exist as the analyte and finally in the fourth, its legal nature.

For this, 41 Wistar rats were used, and in 25 of them a constrictive sciatic neuropathy was induced (Bennet & Xie model). For testing pain symptoms, spontaneous (scratching) and evoked behaviors to noxious (46 o C) and non-noxious (40 o C) thermal stimuli were quantified. Moreover, a comparative pharmacological study of vigabatrin with other analgesic anticonvulsant drugs was also performed. The results showed a possible dose-dependent analgesic effect of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl-GABA) on experimental neuropathic pain, as shown by the significant (p< 0. 05) decreasing effect of vigabatrin on scratching and by its significant (p< 0. 05) increasing effect on the latency <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> hindpaw <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the animals to noxious thermal stimulus.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding the consumer's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from contracts concluded by electronic means (e-contracts). The objectives pursued by the author are:- establishing the juridical nature of consumer's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from e-contracts;- identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation,- issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. Governmental Ordinance no. 130 / 2000 introduces a new exception to the principle of irrevocability of contracts in Romanian law: the consumer's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from distance contracts. The same Ordinance sets the scope and conditions for the applicability of this right. Consumer's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from e-contracts, as a type of distance contracts, can be exercised without the need to give any specific reason and without penalties, within 10 working days from the date of receiving the goods or from the another moment depending on the specifics set out in GO no. 130 / 2000. If consumer cancels the distance contract on the basis that he does not like the goods, the withdrawal from the contract is valid, even if the withdrawal solely depended on the will of the consumer, this sets out a legal exception from the provisions of art. 1010 of Civil Code which stipulate the nullity of the obligations undertook by the liable person under the condition “if I want”.

40|$|The {{development}} of e-commerce has undeniably been {{beneficial to the}} global economy and society; it brought new opportunities and simplified the process of shopping and trading. Nonetheless, the unique particularities attached to e-commerce also created new challenges and gave rise to various consumer-related issues. In order to address the risks accompanying e-commerce, different consumer-protective instruments may be applied. In the area of contract law, these notably include information duties and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> is commonly meant to protect a party who, in a particular context or {{a particular type of}} contract, is deemed to require protection. It is typically used in consumer contracts to protect the consumer from making rash decisions, by giving her the possibility during a relatively short ‘cooling-off period’, to go back on her decision to conclude a contract. Such an intervention in the binding force of the contract aims at compensating the unequal positions of co-contracting parties. In Europe, consumers enjoy a statutory right to change their mind on purchases made online within 14 days. Swiss law does not provide e-consumers with a similar mandatory right although many attempts to change the law on this point have been undertaken over the past years. In 2015, the Swiss Parliament once again turned down a project aiming at introducing such a statutory right in e-commerce. This raises the questions of why the Swiss authorities keep on refusing to amend the legislation on this topic to bring it in line with European law, and more fundamentally whether a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> is appropriate in the context of e-commerce. This thesis will attempt to explain, in light of the European and Swiss legislations, what is the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> in which context and circumstances this instrument is used and why {{it may or may not}} be relevant to made it mandatory in e-commerce. In analyzing the related differences in these two aforementioned legislations, we will not neglect to also provide the reader with an insight of the main differences between European and Swiss laws as regards general e-consumer protection...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{published}} in the liber amicorum for Jules Stuyck (Leuven). This liber amicorum consists of case notes to landmark cases of the CJEU. The Travel Vac case, which is relatively unknown, stands {{at the crossroads of}} unfair commercial practices and consumer contract law, just as the work of Jules Stuyck does. In the Travel Vac case the Court took a number of important decisions. First, where the scope of two directives overlap, both directives are applicable, unless one claims priority. Second, the Travel Vac case makes clear that the application of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> under the Doorstep Selling Directive and the Timeshare Directive may originally be provided to consumers to compensatie consumers from possibly being unduly influenced or manipulated by the trader during the conclusion of the contract, but the consumer need not in fact be mislead or surprised {{in order to be able}} to withdraw from the contract. The Travel Vac case thus provides for a clear distinction between rights of withdrawal and defects of consent, such as mistake, fraud and threat. The absence of a need to state reasons for the withdrawal is now codified in the 2011 Consumer Rights Directive. Similarly, the absence of a form requirement - despite the fact that the wording of the Doorstep Selling Directive suggested otherwise - is now codified in the 2011 Directive. Finally, the CJEU could have gone either way with regard to the question whether the trader would have to be compensated by the consumer who wishes to make use of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Its decision that the consumer need not pay such compensation seems evident now, but was far from that in 1999. With its decision, the CJEU ensured that consumers would not be discouraged from exercising the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> As such it may have contributed to a large extent to the success of this instruments - in particular in other areas, such as distance selling...|$|E
