ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The Method of Moments (MoM) is {{routinely}} {{used for the}} numerical solution of electromagnetic surface integral equations. Solution errors are inherent to any numerical computational method, and error estimators can be effectively employed to reduce and control these errors. In this thesis, gradient recovery techniques of the Finite Element Method (FEM) are formulated within the MoM context, in order to recover a higher-order charge of a Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) MoM solution. Furthermore, a new recovery procedure, based specifically on {{the properties of the}} RWG basis functions, is introduced by the author. These <b>recovered</b> <b>charge</b> distributions are used for a posteriori error estimation of the charge. It was found that the newly proposed charge recovery method has the highest accuracy of the considered recovery methods, and is the most suited for applications within recovery based error estimation. In addition to charge recovery, the possibility of recovery procedures for the MoM solution current are also investigated. A technique is explored whereby a <b>recovered</b> <b>charge</b> is used to find a higher-order divergent current representation. Two newly developed methods for the subsequent recovery of the solenoidal current component, as contained in the RWG solution current, are also introduced by the author. A posteriori error estimation of the MoM current is accomplished through the use of the recovered current distributions. A mixed second-order recovered current, based on a vector recovery procedure, was found to produce the most accurate results. The error estimation techniques developed in this thesis could be incorporated into an adaptive solver scheme to optimise the solution accuracy relative to the computational cost. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die Moment Metode (MoM) vind algemene toepassing in die numeriese oplossing van elektromagnetiese oppervlak integraalvergelykings. Numeriese foute is inherent tot die prosedure: foutberamingstegnieke is dus nodig om die betrokke foute te analiseer en te reduseer. Gradiënt verhalingstegnieke van die Eindige Element Metode word in hierdie tesis in die MoM konteks geformuleer. Hierdie tegnieke word ingespan om die oppervlaklading van 'n Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) MoM oplossing na 'n verbeterde hoër-orde voorstelling te neem. Verder is 'n nuwe lading verhalingstegniek deur die outeur voorgestel wat spesifiek op die eienskappe van die RWG basis funksies gebaseer is. Die verhaalde ladingsverspreidings is geïmplementeer in a posteriori fout beraming van die lading. Die nuut voorgestelde tegniek het die akkuraatste resultate gelewer, uit die groep verhalingstegnieke wat ondersoek is. Addisioneel tot ladingsverhaling, is die moontlikheid van MoM-stroom verhalingstegnieke ook ondersoek. 'n Metode vir die verhaling van 'n hoër-orde divergente stroom komponent, gebaseer op die verhaalde lading, is geïmplementeer. Verder is twee nuwe metodes vir die verhaling van die solenodiale komponent van die RWG stroom deur die outeur voorgestel. A posteriori foutberaming van die MoM-stroom is met behulp van die verhaalde stroom verspreidings gerealiseer, en daar is gevind dat 'n gemengde tweede-orde verhaalde stroom, gebaseer op 'n vektor metode, die beste resultate lewer. Die foutberamingstegnieke wat in hierdie tesis ondersoek is, kan in 'n aanpasbare skema opgeneem word om die akkuraatheid van 'n numeriese oplossing, relatief tot die berekeningskoste, te optimeer...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the molecular {{basis of the}} voltage sensor that triggers excitation–contraction (EC) coupling, the four-domain pore subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) was cut in the cytoplasmic linker between domains II and III. cDNAs for the I-II domain (α 1 S 1 – 670) and the III-IV domain (α 1 S 701 - 1873) were expressed in dysgenic α 1 S-null myotubes. Coexpression of the two fragments resulted in complete recovery of DHPR intramembrane charge movement and voltage-evoked Ca 2 + transients. When fragments were expressed separately, EC coupling was not recovered. However, charge movement was detected in the I-II domain expressed alone. Compared with I-II and III-IV together, the charge movement in the I-II domain accounted for {{about half of the}} total charge (Qmax = 3 ± 0. 23 vs. 5. 4 ± 0. 76 fC/pF, respectively), and the half-activation potential for charge movement was significantly more negative (V 1 / 2 = 0. 2 ± 3. 5 vs. 22 ± 3. 4 mV, respectively). Thus, interactions between the four internal domains of the pore subunit in the assembled DHPR profoundly affect the voltage dependence of intramembrane charge movement. We also tested a two-domain I-II construct of the neuronal α 1 A Ca 2 + channel. The neuronal I-II domain <b>recovered</b> <b>charge</b> movements like those of the skeletal I-II domain but could not assist the skeletal III-IV domain in the recovery of EC coupling. The results demonstrate that a functional voltage sensor capable of triggering EC coupling in skeletal myotubes can be recovered by the expression of complementary fragments of the DHPR pore subunit. Furthermore, the intrinsic voltage-sensing properties of the α 1 A I-II domain suggest that this hemi-Ca 2 + channel could be relevant to neuronal function...|$|E

Deletion mutants were expressed in dysgenic α 1 S-null myotubes and analyzed by voltage-clamp and confocal fluo- 4 fluorescence. Immunostaining of the mutant subunits using an N-terminus tag revealed abundant protein expression in all cases. Furthermore, the maximum <b>recovered</b> <b>charge</b> movement density was > 80 % of that recovered by full-length α 1 S in all cases. Δ 671 – 690 {{had no effect on}} the magnitude of voltage-evoked Ca 2 + transients or the L-type Ca 2 + current density. In contrast, Δ 720 – 765 or Δ 724 – 743 abolished Ca 2 + transients entirely, and L-type Ca 2 + current was reduced or absent. Surprisingly, Ca 2 + transients and Ca 2 + currents of a moderate magnitude were recovered by the double deletion mutant Δ 671 – 690 /Δ 720 – 765. A simple explanation for this result is that Δ 720 – 765 induces a conformation change that disrupts EC coupling, and this conformational change is partially reverted by Δ 671 – 690. To test for Ca 2 +-entry independent EC coupling, a pore mutation (E 1014 K) known to entirely abolish the inward Ca 2 + current was introduced. α 1 S Δ 671 – 690 /Δ 720 – 765 /E 1014 K expressed Ca 2 + transients with Boltzmann parameters identical to those of the Ca 2 +-conducting double deletion construct. The data strongly suggest that skeletal-type EC coupling is not uniquely controlled by α 1 S 720 – 765.

In addition, all constructs except beta 2 a mutants <b>recovered</b> <b>charge</b> movements with a density similar to full-length beta 1 a. Thus, all beta constructs became integrated into a skeletal-type DHPR and, except for beta 2 a mutants, all restored functional DHPRs to the cell surface at a high density. The maximum amplitude of the Ca(2 +) transient was not affected by separate deletions of the N-terminus of beta 1 a or the central linker region of beta 1 a connecting two highly conserved domains. Also, replacement of the N-terminus half of beta 1 a with that of beta 2 a had no effect. However, deletion of 35 residues of beta 1 a at the C-terminus produced a fivefold reduction in the maximum amplitude of the Ca(2 +) transients. A similar observation was made by deletion of the C-terminus of a chimera in which the C-terminus half was from beta 1 a. The identified domain at the C-terminus of beta 1 a may be responsible for colocalization of DHPRs and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), or may be required for the signal that opens the RyRs during excitation-contraction coupling.

40|$|Amorphous {{selenium}} (a-Se) and its alloys {{are important}} photoconductor {{materials used in}} direct conversion flat panel digital x-ray detectors. The performance of these detectors is determined, in part, by the electronic transport properties of the a-Se photoconductor layer – namely, the charge carrier mobility m and the deep trapping lifetime t. The product of the mobility and the lifetime mt, {{referred to as the}} charge carrier range, determines the average distance that photo-generated charge will travel before being removed from the transport band by deep localized states in the mobility gap of the semiconductor. The loss of carriers to these deep states reduces the amount of charge collected per unit of x-ray exposure, and, hence, limits the x-ray sensitivity of the detector. Two experimental techniques that may be used to measure the transport properties of holes and electrons in high resistivity semiconductors are described in this thesis. The Time-of-Flight (TOF) transient photoconductivity technique is used to evaluate the charge carrier mobility by measuring the time required for the charge carriers to transit a fixed distance under the influence of an applied electric field. The Interrupted-Field Time-of-Flight (IFTOF) technique is used to determine the charge carrier deep trapping time; the drift of the injected carriers is temporarily interrupted at a position in the sample by removing the applied field. When the field is reapplied the number of charge carriers has decreased due to trapping events. The carrier lifetime is determined from the dependence of the fraction of <b>recovered</b> <b>charge</b> carriers before and after the interruption with the interruption time. TOF and IFTOF measurements were carried out on a number of samples of vacuum deposited selenium alloy x-ray photoconductors. Device quality photoconductor films are fabricated by evaporating a-Se source material that has been alloyed with a small quantitiy of As (~ 0. 3 at. %) and doped with a halogen (typically Cl) in the p. p. m. range. The dependence of the carrier range on the composition of the photoreceptor film was accurately measured using both TOF and IFTOF measurements. It was found that the transport properties of the film could be controlled by suitably adjusting the composition of the alloy. Combined IFTOF and TOF measurements were also performed on several samples {{to examine the effects of}} trapped electrons on the hole transport properties in a-Se films. It was found that drifting holes recombine with the trapped electrons, and that this process could be described by a Langevin recombination process. This finding is important for the correct modeling of amorphous selenium digital x-ray detector designs. Finally, the effects of x-ray exposure on a-Se films were examined. A temporary reduction in the effective hole lifetime was observed due to an increase in the number of hole capture centers following an x-ray exposure. The capture coefficient between free holes and the x-ray induced hole capture centers was measured using combined TOF and IFTOF measurements. It was shown that this capture process was governed by the Langevin recombination mechanism. From these observations it was concluded that trapped electrons from a previous x-ray exposure act as recombination centers for subsequently generated holes, thereby reducing the effective hole lifetime in the sample...|$|E

The paper reviews a fluid selection methodology based on thermodynamic/thermo-physical and environmental/safety properties.
