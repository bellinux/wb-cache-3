In this paper, we construct global classical {{solutions to the}} interaction of four orthogonal planar <b>rarefaction</b> <b>waves</b> with two axes of symmetry for the Euler equations in two space dimensions, in the case where the initial <b>rarefaction</b> <b>waves</b> are large. The bi-symmet-ric initial data is a basic type of four-wave two-dimensional Riemann problems. The solutions in this case are continuous, bounded and self-similar, and we characterize how large the <b>rarefaction</b> <b>waves</b> must be. We use the methods of hodograph transformation, characteristic decomposition, and phase space analysis. We resolve binary interactions of simple waves in the process...|$|R

The global {{stability}} of <b>rarefaction</b> <b>waves</b> {{in a broad}} class of entropy solutions in L ∞ containing vacuum states is proved for the compressible Euler equations for both one-dimensional isentropic and non-isentropic fluids. <b>Rarefaction</b> <b>waves</b> are the unique case that produces the vacuum states late time in the Riemann solutions when the Riemann initial data are away from the vacuum.

50|$|During this phase, too, {{there is}} a {{difference}} in action between the very different masses in the intake and tailpipe. The intake air mass is again fairly low, but it now almost totally consists of outside air; therefore, fresh air is available almost immediately to begin re-filling the combustion zone from the front. The tailpipe air mass is also pulled, eventually reversing direction as well. The tailpipe will never be completely purged of hot combustion gases, but at reversal it will be easily able to pull in fresh air from all sides around the tailpipe opening, so its contained mass will be gradually increasing until the next deflagration event. As air flows rapidly into the combustion zone, the <b>rarefaction</b> <b>wave</b> is reflected rearward by the front of the engine body, and as it moves rearward the air density in the combustion zone naturally rises until the pressure of the air/fuel mixture reaches a value where deflagration can again commence.|$|E
