40|$|Abstract. Construction {{of kitchen}} cabinet in Malaysia {{has grown in}} {{correspond}} to {{the increasing number of}} housing development. However, kitchen cabinet supplier is facing with major problem regarding to the increasing number of failure that occurred at the screw jointing during kitchen cabinet installation. Thus, the objective of the study is to observed the failure or damages during screw fixing on kitchen cabinet. It was observed that the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> and driving features effect the number of damages and the failure mode type. Screw with pan-head type has the lowest number of damages compared with <b>countersunk</b> <b>head</b> <b>screw.</b> Selecting screw insertion technique is also important in order to reduce number of damages. Insertion technique with pilot-hole pre-drilling managed to reduce number of damages and type of failure modes occurred. With this paper, the kitchen cabinet manufacturer will be able to select the best screw with their preferable insertion technique {{in order to reduce the}} number of damages used for kitchen cabinet jointing...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} our study {{demonstrate}} that PETS is a minimally invasive and safe technique for treating LLD by creating a growth inhibition of the longer limb. The screws can {{be placed in a}} parallel or crossed pattern and it may be beneficial to <b>countersink</b> the <b>screw</b> <b>heads,</b> particularly if they are placed in a parallel fashion to decrease the risk of pain from a prominent <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> irritating the soft tissues. Clinicians may use the growth predictor method of choice with the understanding {{that there may be a}} large variability in the result, but usually the variability is not clinically significant. We found that the Green−Anderson and Moseley methods tended to underpredict and the Paley method tended to overpredict the final LLD. Several studies have reported that PETS creates delayed growth inhibition and recommend performing PETS between 6 and 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis [5, 8, 18]. We believe that PETS is reversible by removing the screws and are now performing the PETS 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis. We believe that PETS creates growth inhibition by locking the epiphysis to the metaphysis with screw threads on both sides of the growth plate. Although we have not used fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated screws, we believe that fully threaded screws would be equally successful and would decrease the problems associated with screw removal.|$|R
30|$|The six {{patients}} who complained of pain over their screws at maturity had screws {{placed in a}} parallel fashion. We are now <b>countersinking</b> the <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> partially into the cortical bone at the meta-diaphyseal junction to address this concern. Although crossed screws are more technically demanding to achieve precise placement, crossed screws may have less <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> prominence and decrease the risk of irritating the adjacent soft tissues. Song et al. [17] treated 59 patients with PETS using crossed screws and reported no screw-related pain, infection, neurologic injury or hematoma. Three screws broke during attempted removal and the removal was abandoned in 2 others. Five patients (8  %) developed an axial deviation that was attributed to inadequate purchase of the epiphysis on one side {{in three of the}} five cases. In our study, no patient developed asymmetric growth that created an axial, coronal or sagittal deformity and we had no problems removing screws. Parallel screws are shorter than crossed screws and can be placed within 10 degrees of perpendicular to the physis in both the anteroposterior and lateral views making them theoretically more mechanically effective to inhibit growth than crossed screws. Since crossed screws are longer than parallel screws, 7.3 -mm cannulated screws with a 32 -mm thread are placed in a crossed fashion in case they are difficult to remove even though they have reverse-cutting threads. We believe that the ideal screw to address all these shortcomings would be a fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated stainless steel screw.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the <b>head</b> of the <b>screw.</b> The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{progression}} of damage in carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) countersunk composite bolted joints (CBJs) with neat-fit clearance, subjected to quasi-static loading. Damage mechanisms, comprising of fibre buckling and breakage, matrix damage, shear damage and inter-laminar delamination within the CFRP composite parts of the joints have been studied. Load-displacement curves, X-ray and optical microscopic images in single- and three-bolt CBJs were used to investigate damage and deformation characteristics. The observations were then employed to further investigate the type of failure {{and the extent of}} damage. The evolution of damage within the composite parts was correlated to the failure characteristics of the joints: It was found that the type and extension of damage is strongly correlated with the ultimate failure load point of the joint in single-bolt CBJs. A combined inter/intra-laminar damage consisting of fibre cluster breakage, extensive fibre buckling, debonding and delamination was observed at the ultimate failure load. This study was then extended to three-bolt CBJ where damage surrounding each bolt and its corresponding failure load was strongly correlated: The final study showed that the ultimate failure point in single-bolt CBJ and the first-bolt-failure point in three-bolt CBJ correspond to the composite plies undergoing intra-laminar damage with the size reaching {{to the edge of the}} <b>countersunk</b> <b>head.</b> This damage developed extensively through the thickness of the composite parts underneath the countersink, and in the direction opposite to the loading direction. Outside the <b>countersunk</b> <b>head,</b> debonding and delamination were found to be the dominant damage driving mechanisms. Finally, a new design rule has been proposed to predict the response of multi-bolt joints (damage area and failure load) by using the response in single-bolt CBJ as an initial baseline...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{are limited}} {{information}} and inconclusive results for dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nails for trochanteric fractures. Therefore, {{we performed a}} prospective study to evaluate the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients operated with this implant. 				 					Methods: We prospectively studied 79 patients (61 women and 18 men; mean age: 84. 7  years; range: 65 – 96  years) with a low-energy trochanteric fracture, treated with a dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail from 2013 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 2. 1  years (range: 1 – 3  years); seven patients were lost to follow up. This left 72 patients for further analysis. We evaluated the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients. 				 					Results: Fracture healing was evident in 70 patients (97. 2 %) at 2 – 3 months postoperatively. One patient experienced cut-out and z-effect phenomenon of the <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Another patient experienced a periprosthetic femoral diaphysis fracture at the distal tip of the nail. A third patient experienced an acute postoperative superficial skin infection that was treated successfully with wound dressing changes and a course of antibiotics. Sixteen patients (22. 2 %) deceased within 12  months postoperatively. In the remaining patients, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 12  months postoperatively was excellent in 16 (28. 6 %), good in 23 (41. 1 %), fair in 10 (17. 8 %), and poor in 7 patients (12. 5 %). The function declined after the patients’ fracture. Fair and poor results were related to age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types. 				 					Conclusion: The dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail is associated with high healing and low complication rates for intertrochanteric fractures. The function of the patients is good or excellent in most cases; however, it declines, especially for those patients with age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Z-effect {{and reverse}} Z-effect are {{complications}} {{that arise from}} the surgical treatment of pertrochanteric fractures of the femur with proximal femoral nails (PFN) comprising two interlocking <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Such complications are induced by the migration of screws in opposite directions, which may lead to failure of the osteosynthesis. Findings The paper describes three cases of pertrochanteric fractures that were treated with PFN with two interlocking screws that evolved to either Z-effect or reverse Z-effect. Literature-based explanations for this phenomenon are provided together with recommendations of how to avoid such complications. Conclusions Although intramedullary fixation is an established method of treatment of femoral intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures, {{the evolution of the}} procedure may include complications associated with the migration of the interlocking <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> The occurrence of Z-effect and reverse Z-effect has not been completely elucidated, but the main causes of such complications are probably fracture fixation in varus position, severe medial comminution, inappropriate entry point of the nail and poor bone quality. </p...|$|R

50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square socket <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R
