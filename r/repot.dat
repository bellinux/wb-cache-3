"Perhaps because I was {{the only}} Bostonian who, for almost ten years, had {{steadily}} pursued the study of bonsai in the United States and in Japan, in 1969, {{through the efforts of}} Mr. Alfred Fordham, Dr. Donald Wyman asked me to <b>repot</b> the Anderson collection of bonsai. I did and began a program to renew the vigor and beauty of these venerable trees. Dr. Richard A. Howard, director, pleased with the initial effort, had me appointed Honorary Curator of the Bonsai Collection." ...|$|E
5000|$|Coelogyne pandurata {{found in}} Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo and the Philippines {{as a large}} sized, hot growing {{epiphyte}} found on large trees near rivers or terrestrial with well-spaced, strongly compressed, oblong or suborbicular, sulcate pseudobulb carrying 2, apical, plicate, elliptic-lanceolate, leaves with a stout petiole that blooms in late spring-summer out {{of the center of}} new leads with up to 15 flowers on a terminal, arched to pendant, 6 to 12" [...] to 30 cm long, racemose inflorescence. The simultaneously opening flowers are highly fragrant of honey but are short lived. This orchid needs wire basket culture as it spreads out quite rapidly and sphagnum with wood chips as media works best and the best time to <b>repot</b> is when the new lead emerges.|$|E

2500|$|Bonsai are <b>repotted</b> and root-pruned at {{intervals}} {{dictated by the}} vigor and age of each tree. In the case of deciduous trees, this is done as the tree is leaving its dormant period, generally around springtime. Bonsai are often <b>repotted</b> while in development, and less often as they become more mature. [...] This prevents them from becoming pot-bound and encourages the growth of new feeder roots, allowing the tree to absorb moisture more efficiently.|$|R
50|$|Syngonium {{species are}} often grown as house plants, usually {{only in the}} {{juvenile}} foliage stages. Syngonium podophyllum is the most commonly cultivated species, and {{is often referred to}} simply as Syngonium. For successful growth, a winter minimum temperature 16 °C to 18 °C (60 to 65°F) must be maintained, rising to 20 °C to 30 °C (68 to 86°F) during the growing season. They require high humidity, including misting the leaves regularly, and good light, but not direct sunlight; they will tolerate low light levels. Water freely from spring to autumn, sparingly in winter. Feed regularly in spring and summer. If juvenile foliage is preferred, cut off all the climbing stems that develop — the plant will remain bushy, rather than climb, and the leaves will be more arrow-shaped. <b>Repot</b> every second spring. Propagation is by cuttings or air layering.|$|E
50|$|Repotting {{is a big}} {{stress to}} any tree, and bare rooting is the biggest stress to a tree. When repotting Satsuki azaleas, {{it is better to}} do it in early to mid spring. Some people say that you should <b>repot</b> after flowering, {{but this is not the}} case. Probably, this is mistaken as {{happening}} in the same year. Flowering is the second biggest stress to a Satsuki. So repotting and flowering in the same year is not a healthy thing to do for a tree. That is why when repotting, do not let the Satsuki flower that year. Instead, use a three-year cycle, allowing repotting in year 1, restyling in year 2 and flowering in year 3. Kanuma is a recommended soil for Satsuki azaleas. Also, it is popular to put yamagoki moss on top of the soil to keep them moist. This will benefit the many feeder roots of the tree.|$|E
