5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extended model for describing topological <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> two sets (objects) in geographic information systems (GIS). First, {{based on the}} definition of the topological <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> two objects, we uncover a sequence of topological <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> two convex sets. Second, an extended model for topological <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> two sets is proposed based on the new definition. The topological <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> two convex sets are expressed as a sequence of 4 × 4 matrices, which are the topological properties of Ao ∩ Bo, Ao, Bo, ∂A ∩ ∂B. The model is also extended for handling the properties of the topological <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> two non-convex sets, where the factor of first fundamental group is added to A ∪ B to handle these complex relations. The results show that the number of topological <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> the two sets is not as simple as finite but infinite and can be approximated by a sequence of matrices.

Exceptions are Automorphic Sudokus which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.|$|E
