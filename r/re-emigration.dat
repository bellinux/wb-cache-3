40|$|This paper aims {{to argue}} about repatriated people from Micronesia (former {{administrated}} islands by Japan in the pacific sea) in the postwar Okinawa society, especially focusing on a group made up to request of <b>re-emigration</b> to Micronesia. A Group, called "NANYO GUNTO KIKANSYA KAI (Returners society' from Micronesia) ", organized by repatriated people in Okinawa 1949. It set up its purpose to re-emigrate to Micronesia and exploit resources of it by Okinawa people including themselves, thereby solving the population problem in Okinawa. This group, however, has changed its main activity from urging <b>re-emigration</b> to memorial activity for war victim. The reasons of this change are main issue of this paper. The first issue {{is the reason why}} repatriated' people strongly wished <b>re-emigration.</b> This paper approached it by analysis on a survey report by Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare about living condition of repatriated people. It showed that they are not in poorer state of the economy than the other Okinawa People, so economic poorness can not be regarded as persuasive reason necessarily. Rather, <b>re-emigration</b> request came from conflict with the US military base. Their residence districts were the area that many military bases -located, so they were suffered from some anxieties about, for example, condemnation of land etc. <b>Re-emigration</b> was an efficient idea to solve that sort of problems at one time for them. The <b>re-emigration</b> project was, however, not achieved finally because of US Military strategy about Micronesia. The Aging of first generation, who were leading people of previous emigrants and also ardent advocates of <b>re-emigration,</b> encouraged this trend. Additionally, Okinawa's reversion to Japanese administration let them lose motivation. In this way, commit of memorial activity for war victim became main issue for KIKANSYAKAI conducted by new generations instead of <b>re-emigration</b> request...|$|E
40|$|First Czech villages {{were founded}} {{in the region of}} Banat, Romania, {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century. The {{original}} impetus had come from the administration who intended to populate the mountainous regions of the then military border. To this day a none too numerous community of Czechs surrounded by other nations have kept their original Czech traditions, speak exclusively Czech, and proudly profess their roots. In the course of the 20 th century these Czech villages were hit by three waves of <b>re-emigration</b> which resulted in a portion of the locals relocating to their ancestral country. The last wave of <b>re-emigration</b> began in 1989, following the reopening of the borders and the simplification of the whole process of relocation, and it essentially continues to this day. Young people in particular come to the Czech Republic hoping to find here a better job, higher wages and better quality of life, which goes hand in hand with it. These expectations are often exaggerated and unrealistic, though. The first part of this thesis presents a theoretical framework of the whole work, and a historical overview of the Czech community and the individual waves of <b>re-emigration</b> which affected it.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the notion of}} return migration with regard to its permanency and temporariness. In reference to selective patterns of return migration, factors conducive to permanent returns and to <b>re-emigration,</b> i. e. subsequent migration after the return, are examined {{with the use of}} a logistic re-gression model. Analyses demonstrated in the article are devoted to return migration to Poland in 1989 - 2002 and based on the 2002 Polish census data. The obtained results confirm earlier findings on the major role of the level of human capital and family attachments in shaping the nature of the return waves. It was revealed that return migrants who decided on a longer stay in Poland were more often living in Polish urban areas, and had higher human capital and stronger family attachments to Po-land, when compared to re-emigrants.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present <b>re-emigration</b> from a diachronic perspective, i. e. between 1918 and 1989. The {{analysis}} focuses on returns during the interwar period, documenting their specifi city, determinants, intensity, as well as on the construction of their ideologies, myths and patterns in a specifi c social and economic context. In historic and sociological terms, the analysed returns are both the background and the reference for comparisons in contemporary research on returns. Knowledge about “old” migration waves may be a useful source of information on macrosocial and global determinants of returns, as well as on state <b>re-emigration</b> policies, and it may help to reconstruct knowledge on experience of return migrants. Recollecting this phenomenon, as well as the process, gains particular importance in the context of a huge wave of contemporary emigration from Poland, on the one hand, and of returns such migration generates, on the other hand. Three important stages of return migration have been distinguished, namely: (1) traditional - before the World War II, (2) during the World War II and directly after its end, as well as at the times of People’s Republic of Poland (by 1989), and (3) after 1989, subdivided into two stages, namely, until 2004 and after 2004 (post-accession to the European Union) ...|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} based on a seven-month {{research}} of a family of Czech re-emigrants from the Romanian Banat. The aim of the research was to find out how these people understand the term home, how they negotiate it and what they related to it; the method employed here consisted of qualitative interviews. The researched sample does not represent the whole population, but rather the studied issue. The main focus was to gather as much exhaustive (and therefore related to understanding, negotiating and constructing of the meaning of the concept home) data related to the issue of home as possible within the given family rather than any universal application or generalization of the collected data to the whole of the Czech re-emigrants from the Banat. The author defines the term home as multidimensional, stemming from an individual and group experience, and from the current situation of an individual person; and as such she tries to depict it through different theoretical concepts. The thesis also presents an outline of a historical-sociological context of the existence of a Czech minority in Romania and its <b>re-emigration.</b> In relation to the main topic of home also emerged other topics, such as motivations for <b>re-emigration,</b> perceptions of Romania and the Czech Republic, response of the majority [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Juillet 2015 This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} socioeconomic integration of forced return migrants, focusing on the Maghreb countries. Starting from {{the hypothesis that the}} return has to be prepared, we test whether a disruption in the migration cycle (such as deportation) increases the individual’s vulnerability and affects his integration from both a structural and sociocultural point of view, using the 2006 MIREM survey. We find that forced returnees are more vulnerable to negative labour market outcomes compared to voluntary returnees. The absence of forced returnees from the labour market, or their underperformances, creates a net loss for the origin country and also incentives to re-migrate. The negative effect is statistically significant not only immediately after return, but also in the long run, at survey time. Forced return is also significantly and negatively correlated with sociocultural integration, reflecting a marginalization of deported migrants in their home environment, which may act as a <b>re-emigration</b> incentive...|$|E

Attention is paid to the migration theory of transnationalism, {{which is based on}} the assumption that migrants continue to maintain relations with their country of origin, which the author tries to prove even in the case of the Banat Czechs. In the theoretical part of the thesis, the reader is briefed on the historical context of migration to Banat and <b>re-emigration</b> to the Czech Republic.

This study should elucidate several key aspects of the cross boarder emigration and <b>re-emigration</b> (be that voluntary or forced) as seen by the respective migrants themselves. In particular, those aspects are: how a long-term residence in a foreign country altered their relationship with respect to their home country, what kind of relationship the migrants developed with respect to their new country of residence and what the very act of emigration/re-emigration itself meant in the life of each individual migrant covered by this study. One of the principal issues this study relates to is this: is it possible to consider the identities of individual migrants as having remained "national" despite their long residence in a foreign country or, alternately, is it correct to state that their identities had changed to that of an "emigrant" flavor. In each individual case of the perceived identity change the study attempts to identify the characteristics of the changed [...] ...|$|E

Nevertheless, the act of return exists as a direct consequence of many earlier life (changing) (dominant) events, including the emigration itself. I considered it essential to make such events an integral part of my investigation (study). In this context, I have considered it essential to interrogate the act of 'homecoming'with the initial act of emigration, of going to exile, of the 'escape'. The testimonies of individual respondents indicated most clearly the key/central role played by the family and its influence, not just on the émigré him/herself, but in the wider context of family background,(cultural) roots, familial orientations, customs and conventions. The family was the one constant category which runs through the entire life cycle, forming the foundation of the individual's social situations and essentially underpins their context.

40|$|Background. Social and {{clinical}} relevance of emigration and <b>re-emigration</b> {{is determined by}} {{a significant amount of}} Ukrainians that emigrate and re-emigrate. Clinical features of depressive disorders have not been studied; as well as risk factors and antiriscs of various forms of depression have not been established yet. Development of comprehensive approaches to the treatment and rehabilitation of these patients is an effective way of resolving of this problem and is of significant scientific, practical, medical and social importance. Objective. The development of measures for treatment of depressive disorders in emigrants and re-emigrants is based on investigation and analysis of clinical-psychopathological phenomenology of depression. Methods. We examined 196 emigrants, 191 re-emigrants and 198 not emigrants with final clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder according to ICD- 10 criteria. Examination was conducted by means of depression rate according to M. Hamilton, the Montgomery-Asberg and Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised and the scale of life quality by WHO QOL- 26. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using nonparametric methods: Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon criterion of signs. Results. It was found that the maximum content of organic acids is accumulated in grass Hyssopus officinalis L.

The paper takes a critical look at these reconfigurations, and the resistances and manipulations that result when people (or their remains) are moved or placed {{in the name of}} ‘coexistence,’ ‘integration’ and ‘sharing’ after the war. In this way, the paper contributes to post-conflict planning literature that is mostly concerned with overcoming segregation and cleansing through ‘integration’ by exploring some of the complexities and problems that can arise with unquestioned embrace of the latter. The paper shows that a very particular and problematic logic of ‘ethnic’ coexistence and ‘physical’ integration drives post-war respacing in Burundi, and that people resist it both with reflexive and physical space strategies. Through a set of paradoxes – refusal to return and staying put, or <b>re-emigration</b> as a response to settling — the paper explores why respacing-for-peace might produce, or fail to prevent, its opposite— conflict, tension and segregation. In the process, the paper questions the dominant ethnic frame through which Burundi conflict (and peace-building) continue to be analysed. The fraught ‘social production,’ however, derives not only from flawed conceptual grids but also political utilities that drive post-war placement and build-up alongside and in contradiction to stated social goals. Finally, the paper shows the utility of a bottom-up approach to tracing transitions to peace. Concepts of ‘ontopolitics’ and ‘orientations’ in space are used to observe the state-citizen bond in production, negotiation, under discussion and in question...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The global {{economic}} crisis {{has created a}} context in which return of low- and unskilled migrant workers has increased in pace and amount. South Indians, who have formed an important labor source for the construction sectors in the Gulf and South-East Asia for decades, are among the most severely hit. The goal of this study has been to examine what happens with the labor migrants after return, i. e. their reintegration patterns and their propensity to re-emigrate, and what policies exist to assist them. The most important fieldwork data were gathered through a survey among 143 return migrants in different locations in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Furthermore, several interviews with key informants, phone calls with the return migrants and document study provided additional qualitative data. Results showed that the period after return is greatly influenced by the preliminary phases of the migration project, starting with initial recruitment and social influence and pressure from within the home community. In these preliminary phases {{the success or failure of}} a migration project is already largely determined. These factors are therefore also of crucial importance in explaining reintegration patterns or the propensity to re-emigrate. It is not uncommon that migrants get exploited during the whole process of migration, eventually leading to problems back in India that hinder reintegration. Many returnees have to cope with debt problems, sometimes so heavy that they are apparently unsolvable. However, not everybody truly tries to reintegrate, since a lot of returnees have the wish to emigrate again. Migration is for many migrants a continuum and does not stop with the first return to India. This <b>re-emigration</b> can be an additional mission for sufficient resource mobilization, or an ultimate effort to solve the financial problems that have been piling up since migration was started. Policies for return migrants hardly exist, although the state of Kerala does have extensive programs for migrants and provides its returnees with welfare and pension schemes...|$|E

In Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan because of military conflicts, revolutions and low living standards number of the Ukrainian diaspora is negligible. Beside this on the Ukrainian diaspora has influence linguistic, cultural and religious distance from the titular ethnic groups. In Belarus, the Ukrainian diaspora lives mainly in Brestregion and major cities. Ukrainian diaspora in Moldovais living mainly in the northern parts of the country and Transnistria.
