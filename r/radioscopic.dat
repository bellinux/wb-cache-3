One case of 50 bottles cost 26 Italian Lire, while a case of 24 bottles cost 14 Italian Lire. At the beginning of the 20th century, carbon dioxide was added to S.Pellegrino to prevent the development of bacteria, especially during long overseas travels. It is still taken from sources in Tuscany and sent to San Pellegrino Terme. The spa facilities were renovated, and in 1928, they were equipped with more modern tools for various diagnostic needs, such as the <b>radioscopic</b> and radiograph room and the microscopic and chemical analysis laboratory. In addition, Granelli reorganized the bottling plant with new equipment, which moved up to a production capacity of 120,000 bottles a day.|$|E

40|$|Multi-energy {{radioscopy}} with normalization to {{a reference}} material is basically an easy-to-realize method with {{no special requirements}} to the equipment. Investigations as described above {{can be done with}} any <b>radioscopic</b> system. It is possible to identify a material by the comparison of two <b>radioscopic</b> images obtained at different accelerating voltages. In order to evaluate composite materials and to characterize material layers which are covered by a surrounding medium three irradiation energies are necessary. Therefore, the images obtained at three accelerating voltages should be imaged as color <b>radioscopic</b> images and evaluated by means of color image processing. Experiments and simulation calculations showed that this technique also allows the identification of materials in layered systems. An important result of simulation calculations is the fact that in many cases signal noise and digitalization errors are critical due to the little differendes in the gray-scali valued of two norm alized images. Therefore, low-noise images, i. e. the application of high integration times and an improved gray-scale value resolution (12 - 16 bit), are necessary. The practical advantage of this technique is the testing of components which can't be accessed wiht conventional analytical methods. This is especially a problem for the characterization of inner layers in layered structures. Multi-Energy Radioscopy can alos be applied to composite materials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method to inspect alu-minum castings automatically from {{a sequence of}} <b>radioscopic</b> im-ages taken at different positions of the casting. The classic image processing methods for flaw detection of aluminum castings use a bank of filters to generate an error-free reference image. This reference image is compared with the real <b>radioscopic</b> image, and flaws are detected at the pixels where the difference between them is considerable. However, the configuration of each filter depends strongly on {{the size and shape}} of the structure of the casting under inspection. A new two-step technique is proposed to detect flaws automatically that uses a single filter. First, the method identi-fies potential defects in each image of the sequence and second, it matches and tracks them from image to image. The key idea of this work is to consider as false alarms those potential defects which cannot be tracked in the sequence. The robustness and reliability of the method have been verified on both real data in which syn-thetic flaws have been added and real <b>radioscopic</b> image sequences recorded from cast aluminum wheels with known defects. Using this method the real defects can be detected with high certainty. This approach achieves good discrimination from false alarms.

40|$|Objectives: gastric bypass is the {{surgical}} procedure that {{is carried out}} most frequently {{in the treatment of}} morbid obesity. Stenosis of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis is a relatively frequent complication that requires endoscopic management. However, the optimal dilation technique is yet to be determined. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dilation with a hydrostatic balloon (CRE) without <b>radioscopic</b> guidance in morbidly obese patients treated by laparoscopic bypass. Material and methods: retrospective review of the data elicited from 525 patients treated against morbid obesity with laparoscopic gastric bypass from January, 2006 to November, 2010. Results: a total of 22 / 525 patients (4. 1 %) developed stenosis of the anastomosis [20 women (91 %), 2 men (9 %) ]. In four patients (18. 2 %), there was an associated anastomotic ulcer, and in one case, there was a history of bleeding of an ulcer treated with sclerosis one month earlier. The diagnosis of stenosis was done in most patients during the first 90 days after the bypass. All cases were resolved by means of endoscopic dilation without <b>radioscopic</b> guidance, 15 cases (68. 1 %) required a single session, 6 cases (27. 2 %) two sessions, and 1 case (4. 5 %) required four sessions. This last case had an associated anastomotic ulcer. The diameter of the balloons ranged from 12 to 20 mm, generally using diameters of 12 - 15 mm in the first session, and increasing them in the following sessions according to the previous result. One patient treated with a 20 mm balloon presented with a small tear, without showing any evidence of leak of contrast medium in the <b>radioscopic</b> guidance, and was thus managed conservatively. In the follow-up, no re-stenoses were detected. Conclusions: in our experience, stenosis of the anastomosis in the laparoscopic gastric bypass is an infrequent complication. When it happens, dilation with a hydrostatic balloon is an effective and safe treatment. <b>Radioscopic</b> guidance during dilation is not strictly necessary if norms of progressive dilation are followed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{establishing}} x-ray {{methods for}} inspection of cast aluminium components by combining two approaches, a <b>radioscopic</b> inspection, and a photon counting system. Indeed, radioscopy {{is widely used}} in castings inspection for automatic defect detection and is an efficient method for characterising rather small thicknesses, typically less than 40 mm. However cast components often show a high range of thicknesses and imaging the whole range is difficult. We propose to use photon-counting measurements to complement the <b>radioscopic</b> image for high thicknesses. Photon counting is not an imaging tool, but the thickness sensitivity obtained from photon-counting measurements (number of x-ray photons transmitted through the object) {{is much better than}} what can be obtained by classical radioscopy for up to 60 mm of aluminium. For high thicknesses of aluminium, within small volumes where defects are believed to be critical, the photon-counting system allows getting information additional to that obtained from classical radioscopy images...|$|E

A dpiX Model SS 2200 imaging panel was used with a Li- 6 enriched, LiF-ZnS(Ag) scintillator screen for a thermal neutron imaging investigation using the Breazeale Nuclear Reactor and the neutron radiography facility at Penn State University''s Radiation Science and Engineering Center. Good quality thermal neutron images were obtained at exposures in the range of 106 to 107 n/cm 2, values that compare favorably with those normally required for a medium-speed film result. Spatial resolution observed was in the order of 2 line pairs/mm, a value consistent with the resolution limitation of the imaging screen. The neutron images showed excellent quality, as determined with radiographs of the modified Type A gage test piece, often used to evaluate thermal neutron <b>radioscopic</b> images. Fourteen consecutive holes in the ''A'' gage test piece were observed, an excellent result as compared to typical neutron <b>radioscopic</b> systems...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a number of}} approaches {{to the problems of}} automatic defect detection in ultrasonic Time of Flight Diffraction (TOFD) and X-ray <b>radioscopic</b> images of butt welds in steel plate. A number of novel image segmentation techniques are developed, two of which feature the use of backpropagation artificial neural networks. Two new methods for defect detection in ultrasonic TOFD images are described - the first uses thresholding of individual one-dimensional A-scans, and the second uses a neural network to classify pixels using two dimensional local area statistics. In addition, three new methods for defect detection in <b>radioscopic</b> images are described - the first is based on the use of two conventional spatial filters, the second uses grey level morphology to replace the 'blurring' stage of conventional "blur and subtract' procedures, and the third uses a neural network to classify pixels using raw grey level data at the input layer. It is considered that all five methods which have been developed show novelty in their methodology, design and implementation, most specifically in that (1) no previous methods for automatic defect detection in TOFD images, (2) very few successful implementations of grey level data processing by neural networks, and (3) few examples of local area segmentation of 'real' textured images for automatic inspection {{have been reported in the}} literature. The methods developed were tested against data interpreted by skilled NDT inspectors. In the case of the ultrasonic TOFD image processing, both automatic methods performed exceptionally well, producing results comparable to that of a human inspector. In the case of the <b>radioscopic</b> image processing, the ANN method also produced results comparable to that achieved by a human inspector and also gave comparable or consistently better results than those obtained using a number of existing techniques...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of X-ray irradiation on mechanical properties of polyester yarn used in production of vascular system prosthesis. Patients with such prosthesis are subjected to multiple X-ray <b>radioscopic</b> exposures. This can negatively influence prosthesis strength and durability. Design/methodology/approach: Polyester yarn tensile strength properties were measured before sterilisation and X-ray irradiation. Next a part of yarn was subjected to irradiation sterilisation. Sterilised and non-sterilised yarn was next exposed to multiple X-ray irradiation and to continuous irradiation. After each irradiation dose tensile strength and elongation at break were measured. Findings: The influence of X-ray irradiation dose on mechanical properties was evaluated. It was established that dose equivalent to multiple X-ray <b>radioscopic</b> exposures did not substantially influenced strength properties of polyester yarn. Research limitations/implications: To fully evaluate the influence of X-ray irradiation on prosthesis strength and durability working in human body environment it is planned to continue described research. Simultaneous influence of X-ray irradiation and body fluids on mechanical properties of polyester yarn will be tested. Practical implications: Research results proved that patients with polyester vascular prosthesis may be subjected to X-ray radioscopy without any anxiety concerning prosthesis strength properties or durability. Originality/value: The main research value is its basic conclusion that multiple X-ray irradiation does not significantly influence strength and flexibility of polyester yarn applied to vascular system prosthesis manufacture...|$|E
40|$|The {{automatic}} evaluation of <b>radioscopic</b> images includes {{the detection of}} deviations from the regular structure of the object under inspection. For this task two principle problems {{have to be taken}} into account: A way for powerful image segmentation must be found which is relative insensitive to noise {{because of the nature of}} x-ray images and the algorithm has to work very quick to satisfy industrial standard. Both problems touch each other because the design of the segmentation algorithm has to be a compromise between efficiency and reliability on the one side and processing time on the other side. The application of image processing methods in the field of non destructive testing like <b>radioscopic</b> inspection requires the consideration of some special conditions. While visual optical images usually contain sharp edges, less noise and relative high percentage of homogeneous greyvalue areas, x-ray images are highly contaminated by noise, have very smooth edges because of scattered radiati on and have only small homogeneous areas and many corner regions because of superposition; the latter condition srongly depends on complexity of the inspected object. This means that deviations or defects like flaws, pores or holes, which can be viewed as kind of impulsive noise, have to be detected both in edge and homogeneous noisy regions. In this paper the subsequent application of background modelling and pixel classification for the realization of this inspection task is presented...|$|E

The CCD camera is modelled according to a general 2 D projective transformation of the output screen of the image intensifier.

40|$|Introduction: Endovascular {{aneurysm}} repair {{requires the}} precise {{deployment of the}} graft. In order to achieve accurate positioning, the anatomical and morphological characteristics of the aorta and its branches is mandatory. Software that perform three dimensional reformatting of multislice tomographic images, allow {{for the study of}} the whole aorto-iliac axis and the perpendicular visualization of the origin of the renal arteries. The correct length of the proximal neck can be evaluated and adequate graft fixation and sealing may be foreseen. A technique is presented, using an software, for the orthogonal correction of the position of the renal arteries in relation to the proximal neck, which may guide the <b>radioscopic</b> orientation intraoperatively. Methods: Within a multiplanar tomographic image reconstruction, virtual triangulation allows for the three dimensional orthogonal correction of the renal arteries' ostia position. The predetermined best angulations for visualization are annotated and used for the positioning of the surgical C-arm. Results/Discussion: Some authors discuss that the anatomic position of the renal vessels seen on the tomographic scan can change during the surgical procedure. It is known that the renal arterys' angular positioning does not alter, even after insertion of stiff guidewires, introducers, and the endograft itself. Therefore, it is possible, using concepts of spacial geometry and orthogonal correction, to predict the ideal bidimensional intraoperative positioning of the radioscopy device in order to reproduce the optimized renal artery ostial projection, ensuring the best accuracy during endograft deployment. Conclusion: As closer to the tomographic reproduction was the <b>radioscopic</b> correction, more careful is the visualization of the ostium of the renal artery, better is the exploitation of the lap for fixing and sealing and the endoprosthesis deployment is more accurate...|$|E

The algorithm mainly uses self-adaptive Simpson integration to sampling, based on the distribution of the X-ray spectrum. Then realize the integration of the projection process. With simulation experiment and practical experiment, we have demonstrated that the new sampling method is not only more accurate but also very efficient.
