The objectives for this review are to describe and critically evaluate breeding methods appropriate to the improvement of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in a long-term breeding programme. The optimum breeding system is dependent on the traits for improvement, and the available physical and human resources. Forage dry matter yield, persistency, disease resistance, nutritional value and seed yield are considered among the most important traits for improvement.

While comparative data are generally consistent with these hypotheses, few manipulative tests have been conducted and those that have provided contradictory results in some cases. Here, we use both comparative and experimental techniques to investigate {{the evolution of the}} Drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid protein Acp 62 F, a protease inhibitor for which extensive functional tests have yielded ambiguous results. Using between-species sequence comparisons, we show that Acp 62 F has been subject to <b>recurrent</b> positive <b>selection.</b> In addition, we experimentally evolved populations polymorphic for an Acp 62 F null allele over eight generations, manipulating the opportunities for natural and sexual selection. We found that the Acp 62 F null allele increased in frequency in the presence of natural selection, with no effect of sexual selection...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{improvement}} of forage traits and seed yield in orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) has been problematic because of geographic separation of forage and seed production locations. Previous work {{has shown that}} a complex multilocation selection program in forage production environments can increase forage yield as well as seed yield in Oregon. The objective of this experiment was to compare target-environment (TE) and nontarget–environment (NTE) selection approaches for increasing seed yield of orchardgrass in Oregon. Two cycles of <b>recurrent</b> phenotypic <b>selection</b> for panicle seed mass (PSM) and agronomic traits were conducted on four popula-tionsin four eastern USA locations (NTE) and one Oregon location (TE). Seed yield was increased in three of four orchardgrass popula-tions by TE selection, averaging 5. 1 % cycle� 1, but was improved by NTE selection in only one of four populations. Conversely, TE selectio...|$|R
40|$|Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is {{the most}} {{important}} forage crop in the world, regarding growing area and economic value, because of its high yield level, good persistence, high protein content and energy value. In alfalfa, concept of intra-population breeding means direct selection for yield, through <b>recurrent</b> phenotypic <b>selection</b> using some form of progeny testing. Significant differences between genotypes were found for green forage and dry matter yields. The observed variation for both yield traits was much higher at population level than for the selected plants that will form new improved population. In the next steps of breeding process selected plants will be intercrossed in isolation to develop a new, improved population. Alfalfa breeding programs should focus on yield per se, with the use of old and new knowledge on the genetic control of yield and with adaptation of existing or developing new breeding procedure...|$|R
