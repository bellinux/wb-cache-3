Moral panics and sexual scandals have long been recognised as key discursive sites in the shaping of modern Britain.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effectiveness of the Australian co-regulatory system in limiting children’s exposure to unhealthy television food advertising by measuring compliance with mandatory and voluntary regulations. An audit was conducted on food and beverage television advertisements broadcast in five major Australian cities during children’s programming time from 1 st September 2010 to 31 st October 2010. The data were assessed against mandatory and voluntary advertising regulations, the information contained in an industry <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>breaches,</b> and the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Results During the two months of data collection there were a total <b>of</b> 951 <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> the combined regulations. This included 619 <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> the mandatory regulations (CTS) and 332 <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> the voluntary regulations (RCMI and QSRI). Almost 83 % of all food and beverages advertised during children’s programming times were for foods classified as ‘Extras’ in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. There were also breaches in relation to the amount of advertising repetition and the use of promotional appeals such as premium offers, competitions, and endorsements by popular children’s characters. The self-regulatory systems were found to have flaws in their reporting and there were errors in the Australian Food and Grocery Council’s compliance report.

30|$|Hay and Knechel (2010) {{explained}} {{the relationship between}} marketing activities and auditing in New Zealand. They stated {{the importance of education}} and professional accountants believe that audit crisis {{in the last several years}} has been rooted in deregulation of the government which caused audit firms to advertise their services and find new customers on their own, thereby making the audit firms to follow a commercial approach. Numerous researchers have emphasized that deregulation of the government on advertising and demands has led auditors to act more competitively, and this can be attributed to lack of related professional skills, which is related to the auditors’ recent wave of failure in the world (Healy and Palepu 2003; Palepu and Healy 2003). In other words, the auditor is expected to report questionable accounting procedures and significant errors and violations. In fact, this issue reminds professional competency and auditor’s independence. The likelihood of discovery <b>of</b> the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract by the auditor depends on the auditor’s competence and the possibility <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> violations discovered, and his independence.

40|$|Abstract: Telecommunication {{increasingly}} {{influences the}} way we live, work, and socialize. Buzzword such as the Internet or broadband networking are omnipresent—so are <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> security <b>breaches.</b> Consequently, security services are indispensable to applications as divers as electronic commerce, linking company networks, telemedicine, and so forth. Whereas application built-in security is widely spread, such as the integration of cryptographic functions into email clients or Web browsers, the diversity of applications carried over public networks strives for concepts that view upon security {{as an integral part}} of the network protocol stack. In this paper, we present two standards that enable network built-in security services: On the one hand, Internet protocol (IP) security is discussed. On the other hand, security services in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks is addressed. The key concepts of both approaches are sketched and—although IP and ATM significantly differ—common aspects of IP security and ATM security are described...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} the situational and offender characteristics associated with prison sentences for Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) breaches. Method: Case narratives from police incident <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> ADVO <b>breach</b> incidents in NSW were analysed. Two samples were examined: (1) breach incidents where the offender involved was imprisoned (n= 250) and (2) breach incidents where the offender involved received a non-custodial sentence (n= 250). The nature <b>of</b> the <b>breach</b> and {{the characteristics of}} persons involved in these two breach samples were compared using descriptive data and logistic regression models. Results: The majority <b>of</b> ADVO <b>breaches</b> in both samples involved male to female offending in spousal/ex-spousal relationships, occurred in the victim’s house and involved face-to-face contact. Compared with offenders in the non-prison group, {{a higher proportion of}} offenders who received a custodial penalty for the breach ADVO matter were male, Indigenous, had 5 or more prior court appearances (including prior offences for domestic violence (DV), assault and breach ADVO), had 3 or more prior prison penalties and had breached two or more conditions <b>of</b> their order. <b>Breaches</b> resulting in prison also had a higher proportion of matters involving physical assault, property damage, psychological aggression and parties who had a history of violence. After controlling for other factors, the following factors were independently associated with imprisonment for ADVO; the offender’s gender, prior imprisonment, prior proven DV offence, history of violence, involvement of physical assault in the breach, victim/offender relationship and residing with the victim. Conclusion: The profile of offenders who receive imprisonment for a breach ADVO offence is significantly different from those who receive a non-custodial penalty for these offences. The nature <b>of</b> the <b>breach</b> and the circumstances surrounding the event also vary for matters where prison is imposed for an ADVO breach...|$|R
