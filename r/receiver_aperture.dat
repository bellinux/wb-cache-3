40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{model for the}} fading channel correlation in general scattering environments. In contrast to the existing correlation models, our new approach treats the scattering environment as non-separable and it is modeled using a bi-angular power distribution. The bi-angular power distribution is parameterized by the mean departure and arrival angles, angular spreads of the univariate angular power distributions at the transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>apertures,</b> and a third parameter, the covariance between transmit and receive angles which captures the statistical interdependency between angular power distributions at the transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>apertures.</b> When this third parameter is zero, this new model reduces to the well known “Kronecker ” model. Using the proposed model, we show that Kronecker model is a good approximation to the actual channel when the scattering channel consists of a single scattering cluster. In the presence of multiple remote scattering clusters we show that Kronecker model over estimates the performance by artificially {{increasing the number of}} multipaths in the channel. I...|$|R

50|$|In simple terms, {{twinkling}} {{of stars}} {{is caused by}} the passing of light through different layers of a turbulent atmosphere. Most scintillation effects are caused by anomalous refraction caused by small-scale fluctuations in air density usually related to temperature gradients. Scintillation effects are always much more pronounced near the horizon than near the zenith (straight up), since the light near the horizon passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere. Atmospheric twinkling is measured quantitatively using a scintillometer. The effects of twinkling are reduced by using a larger <b>receiver</b> <b>aperture.</b> This effect is known as aperture averaging.|$|E

40|$|As {{the amount}} of {{information}} to be transmitted from deep-space rapidly increases, the radiofrequency technology has become a bottleneck in space communications. RF is already limiting the scientific outcome of deep-space missions and could be a significant obstacle in the developing of manned missions. Lasercom holds the promise to solve this problem, as it will considerably increase the data rate while decreasing the energy, mass and volume of onboard communication systems. In RF deep-space communications, where the received power is the main limitation, the traditional approach to boost the data throughput has been increasing the <b>receiver's</b> <b>aperture,</b> e. g. the 70 -m antennas in the NASA's Deep Space Network. Optical communications also can benefit from this strategy, thus 10 -m class telescopes have typically been suggested to support future deep-space links. However, the cost of big telescopes increase exponentially with their aperture, and new ideas are needed to optimize this ratio. Here, the use of ground-based gamma-ray telescopes, known as Cherenkov telescopes, is suggested. These are optical telescopes designed to maximize the <b>receiver's</b> <b>aperture</b> at a minimum cost with some relaxed requirements. As they are used in an array configuration and multiple identical units need to be built, each element of the telescope is designed to minimize its cost. Furthermore, the native array configuration would facilitate the joint operation of Cherenkov and lasercom telescopes. These telescopes offer very big apertures, ranging from several meters to almost 30 meters, which could greatly improve the performance of optical ground stations. The key elements of these telescopes have been studied applied to lasercom, reaching the conclusion that it could be an interesting strategy to include them in the future development of an optical deep-space network.

[...] It was decided to make a sporting version of the P14-M1917 model rifles at the Ilion plant. In 1921, Remington introduced the Model 30 High Power sporting rifle in caliber 30-06 Springfield. Early models differed from the military rifles by deleting the prominent rear sight protection ears and machining the receiver bridge to the same diameter as the receiver ring, and straightening the floorplate. These changes made for a better-looking rifle but magazine capacity was reduced from 6 to 5 rounds. The barrel was of the military profile but shortened slightly to 24". The barreled action was placed into a sporter type stock of plain American black walnut with a schnabel fore-end and a steel buttplate grooved to prevent slipping. A simple <b>receiver</b> <b>aperture</b> sight was fitted to the receiver bridge by a dovetail. This sight was soon discontinued and replaced with one mounted further forward on the barrel band. The Mauser-type cock-on-closing feature, and the double-stage military-type trigger were retained. In 1926, the stock was refined with a higher and thicker comb. A crossbolt was added, and checkering of the pistol grip and fore-end became standard.

In contrast to the majority of works on CSI-assisted AF relays, in this paper, we assume that the estimated CSI is outdated, when the relay amplifies the transmitted signal. The RF link experiences Rayleigh fading, while the FSO link is under the influence of atmospheric turbulence, modeled by the Gamma-Gamma distribution. Novel analytical expressions for the outage probability and the average BER are derived in a power series form, which in some special cases are simplified to offer engineering insight into the effects of important transceiver and channel parameters on the system performance. Numerical and simulation results show that there is an optimal value of the transmitter beam waist, which minimizes the overall outage prob-ability. This optimal value strongly depends on the pointing errors standard deviation. Furthermore, the outage probability varies for several orders of magnitude depending on the transmitter beam waist.
