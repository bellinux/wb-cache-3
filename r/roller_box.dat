40|$|The {{structure}} of high-speed roller door with water film has improved in this study. The flameproof water film system {{is equipped with}} a water circulating device to reduce the water consumption of water film system. The water film is generated at the <b>roller</b> <b>box</b> of the high-speed roller door in this study. The heating test is done with the full-scale heating furnace. Both cases of the water film on unexposed surface and water film on exposed surface passed the fire resistance test based on ISO 834, proving that the high-speed roller door with water film system has 120 A fire resistance period. The main findings indicate that the water film on exposed surface shows that as the amount of water film evaporated by high temperature inside the furnace must be greater than the evaporation capacity of water film on unexposed surface, the required water supply is 660 [*]L more than the water film on unexposed surface...|$|E

5000|$|Forti's first {{development}} of her Dance Constructions series was publicly presented at New York City's Reuben Gallery in December 1960, {{in an exhibition}} Forti shared with Jim Dine and Claes Oldenburg, titled Happenings at the Reuben Gallery. During this exhibition, Robert Morris and Yvonne Rainer performed See Saw, and Forti and Patty Mucha (then Patty Oldenburg, Claes Oldenburg's then-spouse) performed <b>Roller</b> <b>Boxes</b> (then titled <b>Rollers)</b> with the contributions of audience members. In Thinking With the Body (2014, University of Chicago Press and Hirmer), curator Sabine Breitwieser wrote about Forti's Dance Constructions, [...] "One could look at the Dance Constructions as problematizing everyday or, as you call them, pedestrian movements. If you take something out of an everyday context and isolate it, then it becomes something else. Using a rope to scale a steep ramp in Slant Board, for instance, evokes a typical climbing movement, but you've turned it to an isolated action that lacks a purpose, that exists just for itself." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{hall was}} {{designed}} to serve several functions: to show silent movies, for vaudeville productions, and {{to act as a}} social centre for the town. Over time it served as a venue for dances, balls, concerts, and wedding functions, <b>roller</b> skating, <b>boxing,</b> and church services. Constructed of unseasoned milled hardwood, the hall was about 12 metres wide by 18 metres long, with seating for 198 people. It included a sprung dance floor of ¾ inch crow's ash timber, still extant today, and was raised on stumps to avoid flooding. The roof sagged inwards within several years of construction, and this profile remained until renovations during 2006 and 2007.|$|R
40|$|<b>Roller</b> blind <b>boxes,</b> {{also know}} as blind <b>boxes</b> or <b>roller</b> casings, are quite popular {{elements}} in Italian buildings, as total enclosures for the <b>roller</b> blinds. The <b>boxes</b> quite frequently show a removable face, {{for reasons of}} access, {{and in some cases}} air ventilation vents. The peculiar acoustical behaviour of the boxes is due to the presence of apertures and leaks and for this reason manufacturers are focusing their attention on the improvement of their sound insulation performances. An experimental investigation was carried out by sound intensity measurements in a reverberation room to determine the sound insulation of various steel blind boxes. The initial design showed not satisfying sound insulation ratings. A light, sound absorbing inner lining of the casing demonstrated to be even more efficient than a traditional, denser sound insulating treatment, particularly when noticeable leaks were present at the access faces of the box. Suitable absorbing materials such as mineralized wood fibres and polymeric foams were chosen and compared achieving up to 5 dB of improvement for Rw. Analyses of the frequency behaviour of the sound insulation and of the intensity maps were performed. The influence of leaks was finally estimated, demonstrating that a proper sealing could lead up to a further 10 dB performance rise...|$|R

50|$|In 1937, Société Anonyme John Cockerill of Seraing in Belgium {{delivered}} {{four new}} 2-6-2+2-6-2 locomotives, numbered {{in the range}} from NG85 to NG88, which were so similar to the older locomotives that they were initially designated Class NG G13 as well. However, {{in view of the fact}} that all the carrying wheels were fitted with <b>roller</b> bearing axle <b>boxes</b> and arranged as swiveling pony trucks, compared to the Class NG G13 of which the inner carrying wheels were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement, it was soon decided to reclassify them to Class NG G16.|$|R
50|$|It {{was decided}} by BR and EE {{to carry out}} a {{programme}} to refurbish the class and modify the engines with new parts designed by the engine manufacturer. The locos also had modifications to their nose ends, losing the gangway doors and headcode discs in favour of a central <b>roller</b> blind headcode <b>box.</b> The livery also changed to two tone green with grey roof {{similar to that of the}} British Rail Class 55s so they looked every bit a 'Baby Deltic'. The locomotives gradually returned to traffic and became very reliable in traffic except for continuing coolant system problems.|$|R
50|$|The piston valves were {{actuated}} by Walschaerts {{valve gear}} {{and the standard}} SAR type steam reversing gear was arranged on the right-hand side. The engine and tender were both equipped with vacuum brakes and the engine's two 21 in diameter vacuum cylinders were arranged outside the engine's frame and under the running boards, one on either side. The valve gear, brake gear and coupled wheel hubs were soft grease lubricated, while the bronze axle boxes had hard grease lubrication. The leading and trailing bogies were fitted with <b>roller</b> bearing axle <b>boxes</b> while the tender's bogies used plain bearings.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was thoroughly}} modern in design, with a one-piece cast steel frame with Franklin spring-loaded wedge horns, manufactured by Commonwealth Steel Castings Corporation in the United States of America. Like the Class 25 locomotive, it had <b>roller</b> bearing axle <b>boxes</b> on all wheels, {{but not on}} the crank-pins, with cannon boxes on all axles, except those of the inner Bissel trucks which had outside bearings. It had mechanical lubrication throughout, self-adjusting pivots, a U-shaped foundation ring welded to the inner and outer firebox bottom edges, and an all-welded firebox. The engine units also had Commonwealth cast steel type frames.|$|R

Société Anonyme John Cockerill of Belgium delivered four in 1937. Another 22 were built by BP in 1939, 1951 and 1958, the last seven being the last steam locomotives to be built by BP. The final eight locomotives in 1968 were the last new steam locomotives to be ordered by the SAR and were built by Hunslet-Taylor in Germiston, Transvaal.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{units were}} {{identical}} {{to those of the}} Class GMA, except that the cylinders were lined and sleeved to reduce the bore from 20+1/2 to 18+1/2 in to suit the smaller boiler.

40|$|Ventilation {{represents}} {{a significant part}} of heat loss in winter, leading to the need to minimize airflow. However, it is absolutely necessary to ensure indoor air quality and the safety of the users and to control the risk of condensation. Ventilation is responsible on average for 30 %e 40 % of energy consumption in air conditioning in Western European buildings. There is great variability in air change rates (ACH [h 1]) from country to country and the minimum value takes into account comfort, sensory and hygrothermal criteria. In Portugal improvements {{have been made in the}} air permeability of window frames, but despite the improvements also made in installing mechanical extraction ventilation devices in kitchens and toilets, these often do not guarantee the minimum number of air change rates required. Air permeability tests were recently carried out in five flats with identical construction characteristics, in the same building, with the aim of characterizing the air permeability of buildings and components, in Portugal. These data are particularly useful for improving the design of building components (e. g., windows and <b>roller</b> shutter <b>boxes)</b> and to perform simulations with reliable data...|$|R

5000|$|Fred C Rollings in 1899 {{invented a}} device with a {{rotating}} table where cards were {{spread around the}} center using a detent with variable pressure. In 1901, Benjamin Bellows filled a patent for his device which used [...] "gravity alone for all movements of the cards" [...] by dividing guiding them through moving compartments. Various mechanisms were proposed during the following years with different combinations of <b>rollers,</b> card-holding <b>boxes,</b> combs and pins systems. Most of these machines were manually run by turning a crank which would activate the inner gears and rollers. Randomness could be improved by {{increasing the number of}} shuffling turns performed by the operators or by increasing the number of boxes, combs or partitioning chambers in the machines. Some devices were simple boxes with combs that would simulate a manual shuffling like riffle shuffling. In 1925, Charles and William Gunzelmann filed a patent for a simple rhombus-shaped apparatus where the cards were inserted in an upper chamber. Shaking the device would make the cards fall into a lower compartment; the shuffling was ensured by two small wings {{in the middle of the}} box that would distribute the cards. The operator would then turn the box upside down and repeat the operation. A glass windows permitted seeing that all cards had fallen into the compartment.|$|R
50|$|The final build of Standard Stock was a {{small batch}} of 26 motor cars ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell in 1934, after the {{formation}} of the London Passenger Transport Board in the previous year. The Piccadilly line was extended from South Harrow to Uxbridge, and this required an extra eight seven-car trains. These were made up from the new motor cars and some reshuffling of stock between other lines. Although very similar to the 1931 build, there were some minor differences. The 1931 build had used motors with roller bearings for the first time, and ten of the new motor cars were also fitted with <b>roller</b> bearing axle <b>boxes,</b> {{to reduce the amount of}} maintenance required with white metal bearings. With the completion of the 1934 build, the total number of Standard Stock cars was 645 motor cars, 551 trailers and 270 control trailers.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the last}} years of his life, he pioneered a new {{invention}} for showing paintings in motion, which was a distant ancestor of the motion picture. In 1783 he began working on what he termed [...] "décors transparents animés." [...] These were paintings of landscapes on long bands of paper, fifty centimeters high and as many as forty two meters long. These were mounted on two wooden <b>rollers</b> in a <b>box,</b> with the light of day coming into the box from behind and passing through the paper. The landscapes were slowly rolled from one roll to the other, giving the illusion of a walk in the garden. The first moving landscapes he titled [...] "Landscapes of France," [...] "English Gardens," [...] "The Seasons," [...] and [...] "The Banks of the Seine." [...] One of the moving landscapes is preserved at the Museum of Sceaux.|$|R
25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these <b>rollers.</b> The first <b>boxes</b> where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|R
5000|$|Sigmund H Danziger Jr. (1916-1979) founded Homak Mfg. Co. Inc. in 1947 in Chicago. A Chicago southsider {{and son of}} a sales {{representative}} for houseware products, including bathroom scales, Mr. Danziger began his business career “jobbing” for Chicago manufacturers while {{a student at the}} University of Chicago. After the World War II, in which he served as a captain and translator, he purchased a bathroom cabinet manufacturer {{on the south side of}} Chicago for which he was jobbing. Naming the new company Homak, capturing a sign he noted on a hat store, he began manufacturing steel kitchen cabinets and rapidly moved to a 35000 sq ft building, which he designed at 4433 S. Springfield Ave in Chicago. In the early 1960s, an order for tool boxes lead to the production of a hardware line including <b>roller</b> cabinets, tool <b>boxes,</b> and other accessories. Through the 1970s and 1980s, most of the major retailers and chains of the time became either line or private label customers at one time or another, including Sears, Walmart, Kmart, The Home Depot True Value, Ace Hardware, Montgomery Ward, Coast-to-Coast, Costco, Meijer, Pep Boys, Fingerhut, etc. In 1979, Sigmund Danziger died and his wife Gertrude (Trudy), ran the company for the next 25 years. During this time, the company moved to a 400000 sq ft facility in Bedford Park, Illinois at 5151 W 73rd St. while sales grew to $35,000,000 with hardware, automotive, hospital (under Homed TM), and sporting goods lines. One of the major innovations during this period was the introduction of a consumer gun cabinet (under HomSafe TM), which instantly grew to be a major hit at mass retailers, including Bass Pro Shops, Gander Mountain, Dick's Sporting Goods and Sports Authority. Also a line of garage cabinets was introduced for Whirlpool and Sears under the label [...] "Gladiator Garageworks." [...] Homak employed hundreds of people, who enjoyed the prosperity of the industry, and was the largest privately held sheet-metal fabricator in America.|$|R
