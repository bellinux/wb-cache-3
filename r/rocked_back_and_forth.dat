25|$|Although Kelly may {{be better}} known for his paintings, he also worked at {{sculpture}} throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived {{one of his first}} wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its top-right and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. The Rocker series began in 1959 after Kelly's casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then put on the table and <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child's hobby horse with curving rocker supports.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much closer}} to the epicenter, the states of Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Michoacán {{suffered}} only mild to moderate damage. Landslides caused damage at Atenquique, Jalisco, and near Jala, Nayarit. Rockslides were reported along highways near Ixtapa, Guerrero, with sand volcanos and ground cracks in Lazaro Cardenas. Students at the Universidad de las Américas in nearby Puebla reported feeling as if the cafeteria had been lifted and <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> shattering windows and injuring some people but mostly causing panic. A small tsunami caused only mild damage to Lázaro Cárdenas and Zihuatanejo. Some fishing boats were reported missing but these reports were never confirmed. One exceptional case was in Ciudad Guzmán, Jalisco, where about 60 percent of the buildings were destroyed, with about 50 dead. Some damage also occurred as far away as the states of Mexico, Morelos and parts of Veracruz, on the Gulf coast. Coastal and most inland damage was moderated by {{the fact that most of}} the west of Mexico sits on bedrock, which serves to transmit the shockwaves without amplifying them. La Villita, and Infiernillo Dams, near the coast, were superficially damaged and undamaged respectively.|$|E

25|$|Katie {{returns to}} the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> for almost two days straight. Amber comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard {{screaming}} after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, scaring Amber {{out of the house}} before returning to Katie, who resumes <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|R
500|$|Nicholas Lea {{was fitted}} with a mask with tubes for the scene where the alien black oil leaves his body. Lea said filming the scene was horrible, and the scene ended up having to be filmed again a few days later. The similar scene {{from the start of}} the episode with the {{submarine}} captain was accomplished with a dummy head. The depiction of the oil in this scene was originally filmed using a magnetic fluid pulled along with magnets, although the end result of this was deemed not be [...] "menacing" [...] enough, and looked [...] "a little bit comic". To fix this, the sound stage used to represent the submarine's interior was rebuilt so it could be <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> with the movement being used to guide the flow of a different liquid. This effect was then enhanced digitally in post-production. The black oil effect over people's eyes was accomplished by inserting the footage digitally in post production.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor's {{first scene}} in the episode is falling down the chimney and {{presenting}} himself to Kazran. Smith {{was pleased with the}} entrance of his character, noting similarities between the Doctor and Santa Claus. However, a stuntman performed the scene. For the scene in which a sky fish nibbles on the sonic screwdriver, the screwdriver was dangled in front of a greenscreen and tapped with a pen to create the effect of the fish nudging it. To maintain secrecy of the episode's plot, the model shark was given the codename [...] "Clive". The scenes in which the characters ride through the air in a sleigh pulled by one of the flying sharks was filmed in front of a greenscreen. The sleigh was in fact a rickshaw which crew members <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> as a wind machine created the effect of flying through the air. As it was impossible to film underneath the rickshaw, a miniature model of the sleigh was used for the shots underneath the sleigh rather than computer-generated effects.|$|E
60|$|Klaus {{sat down}} at the table, all the color drained {{suddenly}} from his face. He put {{his head in his hands}} and <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mazzone's [...] "accidental trademark" [...] is his <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{while sitting}} in the dugout. On {{television}} broadcasts of Braves games, the camera would often show him <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> during the game. [...] Mazzone's pitching philosophies state that pitchers should throw more between starts (two sessions instead of one) {{and be able to}} throw strikes on the low and outside corner of the strike zone.|$|R
60|$|Eliza hesitated, {{but finally}} reached {{out her hand}} and took the bon-bon. Louise lay {{back in her chair}} and closed her eyes, fearing their eagerness might betray her. When after a time she opened them again Eliza was slowly <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>and</b> chewing the confection.|$|R

60|$|The major {{shuddered and}} {{clapped his hands}} to his eyes. Then he <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> moaning dismally, while Patsy clung to his neck, sobbing and nearly distracted.|$|E
60|$|The {{result was}} that The four <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> while the woman calmly went on screaming. The scream became touched with triumph as more {{crashing}} was heard in the brush.|$|E
60|$|Maddened by {{the sound}} of the water, Jerry had first to endure an {{embracing}} and hugging from the boy, who, squatted on his hams, <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> and mumbled a strange little crooning song. And Jerry, lacking articulate speech, had no way of telling him of the thirst of which he was perishing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the [...] "tick tock" [...] sound is caused by this {{escapement}} mechanism. As the balance wheel <b>rocks</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> the ticking sound is heard.|$|R
50|$|After oviposition, {{the male}} drives the female {{away from the}} nest and guards the eggs. Incubating males <b>rock</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>and</b> {{undulate}} their lateral skin folds, which circulates the water, increasing oxygen supply to both eggs and adult. Incubation lasts from 45 to 75 days, depending on region.|$|R

60|$|Uncle John laughed. He doubled up in {{his chair}} and <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> shaking his little round body as if he had met with the most amusing thing that had ever {{happened}} in his life. Aunt Jane stared at him, while Louise and Beth looked their astonishment, but Patsy's clear laughter rang above Uncle John's gasping chuckles.|$|E
6000|$|Del Bishop {{had told}} them to [...] "get {{the hell out of}} there" [...] when he ran by, and they could not understand. One of them turned up an unheeding, terrified face. Another lay prone and {{listless}} across the thwarts as though bereft of strength; while the third, with the face of a clerk, <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> and moaned monotonously, [...] "My God! My God!" ...|$|E
60|$|When Kink had signed, it {{took the}} united efforts of the three to arouse Bill. Pen in hand, he swayed long over the document; and, each time he <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> in Ans Handerson's eyes flashed and faded a wondrous golden vision. When the {{precious}} signature was at last appended and the dust paid over, he breathed a great sigh, and sank to sleep under a table, where he dreamed immortally until morning.|$|E
50|$|He had a crowd-pleasing quirk {{of always}} {{staying in a}} squat {{position}} for much longer than normal <b>and</b> <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> before returning to his corner during the shikiri, or warm-up phase of a match.|$|R
50|$|As of March 2013 Engle {{resides in}} Pasadena, California. He {{and his wife}} Therese have seven children. He {{is known for his}} gravelly voice, cheerful demeanor, <b>and</b> {{vigorous}} <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> while praying <b>and</b> speaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "After a {{long time}} the stranger-man crawls no more. He stands slowly upon his feet <b>and</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> Also does he take off one mitten and wait with {{revolver}} in his hand, <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> as he waits. His face is skin and bones and frozen black. It is a hungry face. The eyes are deep-sunk in his head, and the lips are snarling. The man and woman, too, get upon their feet and they go toward him very slowly. And all about is the snow and the silence. And in the sky are three suns, and all the air is flashing with the dust of diamonds.|$|R
60|$|In response, slowly, with utmost deliberation, as if {{the destiny}} of empires rested on the certitude of her act, she turned the saucer of coffee upside down on the table. She lifted her right hand, slowly, hugely, {{and in the same}} slow, huge way landed the open palm with a {{sounding}} slap on Tom's astounded cheek. Immediately thereafter she raised her voice in the shrill, hoarse, monotonous madness of hysteria, sat down on the floor, and <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in the throes of an abysmal grief.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw himself}} upon {{his back and}} fairly wallowed at my feet; jumped up and sprang upon me, rolling me upon the ground by his great weight; then wriggling and squirming around me like a playful puppy {{presenting}} its back for the petting it craves. I could not resist the ludicrousness of the spectacle, and holding my sides I <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in the first laughter which had passed my lips in many days; the first, in fact, since the morning Powell had left camp when his horse, long unused, had precipitately and unexpectedly bucked him off headforemost into a pot of frijoles.|$|E
60|$|Yet I {{confess that}} there was no {{particular}} call for cheerfulness on their part. There they crouched by the fire, the pair of them, {{at the end of their}} days, old and withered and helpless, racked by rheumatism, bitten by hunger, and tantalized by the frying-odors of my abundance of meat. They <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in a slow and hopeless way, and regularly, once every five minutes, Ebbits emitted a low groan. It was not so much a groan of pain, as of pain-weariness. He was oppressed by the weight and the torment of this thing called life, and still more was he oppressed by the fear of death. His was that eternal tragedy of the aged, with whom the joy of life has departed and the instinct for death has not come.|$|E
50|$|Johnnie Walker White {{was dropped}} during World War I. In 1932, Alexander II added Johnnie Walker Swing to the line, the name {{originating}} from the unusual {{shape of the}} bottle, which allowed it to <b>rock</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Wobblyman, a {{funny little}} man who cannot lie down. He has a round base which he wobbles about on. He <b>rocks</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> to get around. (He {{has not been}} {{featured}} in the franchise since 2009).|$|R
50|$|Weaving: <b>Rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in a {{repetitive}} {{fashion that}} is correlated to isolation or stall confinement, usually alleviated by pasture turnout possibly a self-stimulating behavior. Problems with weaving can include {{weight loss and}} uneven hoof wear, unnatural stress on the legs and lameness.|$|R
60|$|Followed wars, truces, compromises, victories, and defeats. By 1898, sixty {{thousand}} men {{were on the}} Klondike and all their fortunes and affairs <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> and were affected by the battles Daylight fought. And more and more the taste for the larger game urged in Daylight's mouth. Here he was already locked in grapples with the great Guggenhammers, and winning, fiercely winning. Possibly the severest struggle was waged on Ophir, the veriest of moose-pastures, whose low-grade dirt was valuable only because of its vastness. The ownership of a block of seven claims {{in the heart of}} it gave Daylight his grip and they could not come to terms. The Guggenhammer experts concluded that it was too big for him to handle, and when they gave him an ultimatum to that effect he accepted and bought them out.|$|E
60|$|Bukawai {{placed a}} little on the ground before him, took a pinch of powder from a pouch at his side and {{sprinkled}} it on the embers. A cloud of smoke rose with a puff. Bukawai closed his eyes and <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> Then he made a few passes in the air and pretended to swoon. Mbonga and the others were much impressed. Rabba Kega grew nervous. He saw his reputation waning. There was some fire left in the vessel which Momaya had brought. He seized the vessel, dropped a handful of dry leaves into it while no one was watching and then uttered a frightful scream which drew the attention of Bukawai's audience to him. It also brought Bukawai quite miraculously out of his swoon, but when the old witch-doctor saw the reason for the disturbance he quickly relapsed into unconsciousness before anyone discovered his FAUX PAS.|$|E
60|$|Rikki-tikki's {{eyes grew}} red again, and he danced up to Karait with the {{peculiar}} rocking, swaying motion {{that he had}} inherited from his family. It looks very funny, {{but it is so}} perfectly balanced a gait that you can fly off from it at any angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this is an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he was doing a much more dangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn so quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close {{to the back of the}} head, he would get the return stroke in his eye or his lip. But Rikki did not know. His eyes were all red, and he <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> looking for a good place to hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and tried to run in, but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a fraction of his shoulder, and he had to jump over the body, and the head followed his heels close.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the clavichord was the only {{keyboard}} instrument on which finger vibrato was possible. In 1928, Maurice Martenot—inspired by his experience as a cellist—invented the Ondes Martenot, which featured a keyboard that the player could <b>rock</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> laterally.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2010 Tourism Australia {{displayed}} a caged kangaroo {{on a street}} in Hollywood. The kangaroo was filmed by a concerned member of the public who was reported as saying, [...] "The kangaroo was there in a pen, like a 10 by 12 (foot) pen, straight on the concrete and it was really, really disturbing. It was just disturbing. There were kids who were really upset because this kangaroo was just <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "sitting in midair, {{watching}} me paint {{the ceiling in}} the living room, <b>rocking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth...</b> I was on an 8-foot stepladder.
