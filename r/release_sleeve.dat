50|$|For a long time, {{the members}} of TWOLOUD {{remained}} anonymous. In their live performances they appeared in ninja costumes and on their album covers {{they had never been}} seen. For a long time TWOLOUD was suspected to be a joint project of the Dutch DJs Hardwell and Tiësto. Their anonymity was an advantage to lesser-known artists, who would often announce that they were TWOLOUD. However, in mid-2014, it was announced that TWOLOUD was a project of the two German DJs Manian and D-Style. This was due to pictures the duo was on {{and the fact that they}} were credited on their songs. However, the rumours about the variant of Hardwell and Tiësto did not stop. TWOLOUD were cautious of the response towards the releases, deciding to forgo mentioning their and personnel's real names and credited themselves as Manuel Reuter and Alex Castle, while the <b>releases</b> <b>sleeve</b> contain little information about the background of the project, furthering the mystery about the creators of the releases and leading to speculation whether TWOLOUD is a duo, or a trio.|$|R

6000|$|The Old Man {{might have}} been pardoned the supposition, for Dick's eyes were humid and his face flushed.
