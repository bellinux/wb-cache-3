40|$|A {{combined}} logic- and model-based {{approach to}} fault detection and identification (FDI) in a suction foot control system of a wall-climbing robot {{is presented in}} this paper. For the control system, some fault models are derived by kinematics analysis. Moreover, the logic relations of the system states are known in advance. First, a fault tree is {{used to analyze the}} system by evaluating the basic events (elementary causes), which can lead to a <b>root</b> <b>event</b> (a particular fault). Then, a multiple-model adaptive estimation algorithm is used to detect and identify the model-known faults. Finally, based on the system states of the robot and the results of the estimation, the model-unknown faults are also identified using logical reasoning. Experiments show that the proposed approach based on the combination of logical reasoning and model estimating is efficient in the FDI of the robot...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Energy {{infrastructure}} {{is a critical}} underpinning of modern society. To ensure its safe and healthy operation, a wide-area situational awareness system is essential to provide high-resolution understanding of the system dynamics such that proper actions can be taken in time in response to power system disturbances and to avoid cascading blackouts. This paper focusses on the high resolution or finer-scale analysis of data obtained through the North American frequency monitoring network (FNET) to reveal hidden information. In the power grid, events seldom occur in an isolated fashion. Cascading events and simultaneous events are more common and realistic. We present a new conceptual framework in event analysis, referred to as event unmixing, where we consider real-world events as a mixture {{of more than one}} constituent <b>root</b> <b>event.</b> This concept is a key enabler for the analysis of events to go beyond what are immediately detectable in the system. We interpret the event formation process from spectral mixing perspective and present innovative unsupervised unmixing algorithms to unravel complex events. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combined logistic and model based approach for fault detection and identification (FDI) in the suction foot {{control of a}} climbing robot. For this control system, some fault models are easily given by kinematics equations. Moreover, the logic relations of the system states have been known in advance. Based on {{the combination of the}} logic reasoning and the model based estimation, the novel approach is properly fit for the FDI application to the climbing robot. First a fault tree (FT) constructed from the target system is used in robot safety analysis by evaluating the basic events (elementary causes) which can lead to a <b>root</b> <b>event</b> (a particular fault). Then, the multiple-model adaptive estimation (MMAE) algorithm is used to reliably detect and identify the model-known faults. Finally, based on the system states of the robot and the results of the MMAE, other faults are detected and identified using the logic reasoning. Experimental results validated that the faults of the sensors and actuators in the suction foot control of the robot can be readily detected and identified by this approach.

The central top display shows a Timed Word Tree with staging events (STAGE I, STAGE II, STAGE III, STAGE IV) and {{rooted in the}} death event (DEAD). Selecting the stage nodes, corresponding to severity and extent of disease, the bottom left plot presents survival curves indicating the fraction {{of each of the}} four sets of staged subjects that were still alive after t days, and the box-plot represents the distribution of the time distance the death event. This visualization confirms that this specific dataset follows the known patterns for pancreatic cancer patients and is obtained with just a few intuitive mouse gestures. Abstract — As a mandate in the 2009 ARRS act, all US health care systems are moving toward electronic health record (EHR) systems to capture and store patient data. The EHR is a rich source of health information about individual patients and/or populations. The ability to analyze and identify meaningful patterns in this data has the potential to produce important knowledge. Yet, there is still a considerable gap between what answers are captured in this record and what answers can be effectively extracted from it. To reduce this gap, more intuitive ways of posing questions and obtaining answers are needed. In this paper we present VISCARETRAILS, a system based on timed word trees visualization that summarizes event paths relative to a given <b>root</b> <b>event</b> and are obtained through a simple drag-and-drop user interface. These summaries visually convey information about the nature, frequency and average timing of the event paths, and serve as a natural starting point to obtain further details and compare different paths. We apply VISCARETRAILS in a dataset of pancreatic cancer patients to illustrate its effectiveness...|$|E
