50|$|The {{assault on}} the Typhoon Cannon is successful. The cannon is {{destroyed}} and Korvus is killed. Yet, the allies bicker. With the destruction and collapse of the Typhoon Cannon, {{there is now a}} giant breach in Widow's Wall. Alec Chase of the Liberation front wishes to advance further into the base, but Monhk Erdene of the Shadow <b>Revolution</b> <b>counters</b> that their coalition has captured the Siege Cortex and that further advance into the base {{is not part of the}} mission.|$|E
50|$|The two engines {{selected}} for this test were a 38 and a 22-h.p., having a bore and stroke, respectively, of 124 by 130 mm. and 96 by 130 mm. They were bolted {{down to the}} test bench close together {{in one of the}} large engine testing shops at the Daimler Works. The section of the shop in which they were placed was railed off and under the sole charge and observation of the R.A.C. officials {{from the start of the}} test to the finish. The observers kept watch day and night just as on board a ship, and periodically tested the <b>revolution</b> <b>counters</b> and spring balances to ensure that the engines were always running under full load. Every possible precaution was taken to keep constant and close observation upon the test, and there were never less than two observers on duty.|$|E

50|$|Numbers are entered using slides (one slide per digit) on {{the side}} of the device. The <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> and result counter appear on the top. A single turn of the crank adds the input number to the result counter, at any position, and {{increments}} the <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> accordingly. Pulling the crank upwards slightly before turning performs a subtraction instead of an addition. Multiplication, division, and other functions require a series of crank and carriage-shifting operations.|$|R
5000|$|Tachometers or <b>revolution</b> <b>counters</b> on cars, aircraft, {{and other}} {{vehicles}} show {{the rate of}} rotation of the engine's crankshaft, and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds. This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions. Prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate lubrication, overheating (exceeding capability of the cooling system), exceeding speed capability of sub-parts of the engine (for example spring retracted valves) thus causing excessive wear or permanent damage or failure of engines. This is more applicable to manual transmissions than to automatics. On analogue tachometers, speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by {{an area of the}} gauge marked in red, giving rise to the expression of [...] "redlining" [...] an engine — revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit. The red zone is superfluous on most modern cars, since their engines typically have a revolution limiter which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage. Diesel engines with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral governor which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the tachometers in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a redline.|$|E

50|$|The larger Type II Curta, {{introduced}} in 1954, has eleven digits for data entry, an eight-digit <b>revolution</b> <b>counter,</b> and a fifteen-digit result counter. It weighs 13.15 oz, based on weighing serial number 550973, produced in early 1966.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} of the A7 h-tron quattro is also intentionally very similar to other A7 variants, except the system splash screens include the h-tron logo, and where the <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> would be on a normal A7, there is the efficiency counter, in a suitable green and orange color scheme.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Corbitt led efforts to {{accurately}} measure and certify long distance road race {{courses in the}} United States. The technique, {{based on the work}} of John Jewell of Great Britain, used a calibrated bicycle wheel in conjunction with a <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b> This method is still used today.|$|R
50|$|The {{cabin is}} made from steel and glass fibre and its top is detachable. All windows are made from safety glass and the side windows {{as well as the}} {{windscreen}} are openable. There are seats for driver and two passengers; the driver's seat is adjustable. The gauge panel is comprehensive, including a <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{are usually}} a basic set given {{the size of}} the panel. It {{consists}} of variometer, altimeter, speed indicator in the top line and two smaller engine instruments below (<b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> and valve head temperature indicator). Custom upgrades can be of different kind usually providing communication radios, different GPS devices, integrated engine instruments, Hobbs meter, ELT or turn indicators.|$|R
50|$|The Curta {{was also}} favored by both {{commercial}} and general-aviation pilots, {{before the advent}} of electronic calculators, because of both its precision and the user's ability to confirm the accuracy of his or her manipulations via the <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b> Because calculations such as weight and balance are critical for safe flight, precise results free of pilot error are essential.|$|R

The majority of mobility bouts were less than 30 seconds and shorter than 25 feet. Subjects with TIS used their tilt feature (at least a 15 ° change in position) 16 ± 10 times and spent between 0 and 108 minutes at a fully tilted (> 40 °) position daily. occupancy detector, wheel <b>revolution</b> <b>counter,</b> and position sensor comprise the Wheelchair Activity Monitoring Instrument as used in this study.

50|$|To {{ensure the}} Bug hit its target, a {{mechanical}} system was devised that would track the aircraft's distance flown. Before takeoff, technicians determined {{the distance to}} be traveled relative to the air, taking into account wind speed and direction along the flight path.

When a total <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> reached this value a cam dropped down which shut off the engine and retracted the bolts attaching the wings, which fell off. The Bug began a ballistic trajectory into the target; the impact detonated the payload of 180 lb of explosives.|$|R
