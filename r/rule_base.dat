40|$|The {{majority}} of existing information systems deals with crisp data through crisp database systems. Retrieval of specific queries through fuzzy logic {{systems have been}} a rare approach in research. Use of fuzzy logic <b>rule</b> <b>based</b> systems on data bases has shown efficient results experimentally.

Further experimentally this paper proves that for specific applications on databases using <b>rule</b> <b>based</b> systems can give much better results rather than using simple crisp queries with simple database management.

5000|$|FML allows fuzzy {{systems to}} be coded through a {{collection}} of correlated semantic tags capable of modeling the different components of a classical fuzzy controller such as knowledge base, <b>rule</b> <b>base,</b> fuzzy variables and fuzzy rules. Therefore, the FML tags used to build a fuzzy controller represent the set of lexemes used to create fuzzy expressions. In order to design a well-formed XML-based language, an FML context-free grammar is defined {{by means of a}} XML schema which defines name, type and attributes characterized each XML element. However, since an FML program represents only a static view of a fuzzy logic controller, the so-called eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translator (XSLT) is provided to change this static view to a computable version. Indeed, XSLTs modules are able to convert the FML-based fuzzy controller in a general purpose computer language using an XSL file containing the translation description. At this level, the control is executable for the hardware. In short, FML is essentially composed by three layers: ...|$|E
5000|$|In the US, Federal Communications Commission rules require {{users of}} {{selective}} calling {{to monitor the}} channel (i.e. switch to carrier squelch) before transmitting. In other words, the user must monitor (listen) {{to make sure the}} channel is not in use by someone on another selective calling code before transmitting. To enforce this <b>rule,</b> <b>base</b> stations often have a monitor switch on the microphone. The push-to-talk button is split into two segments. One segment turns the selective calling off. The other segment of the button transmits. A mechanical interlock prevents the transmit button from being pressed until the monitor button is down. This is called, [...] "compulsory monitor before transmit." [...] In mobile radios, microphones are stored in a hang-up box. When the microphone is pulled out of the hang-up, the radio reverts to carrier squelch, (the selective calling feature is disabled). The user automatically monitors—verifies no one else is using the channel—by pulling the mike out of the hang-up box. Hand-held radios sometimes have LED indicators that show when the channel is in use.|$|E
