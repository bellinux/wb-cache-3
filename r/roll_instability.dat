50|$|The {{committee}} {{investigating the}} failed launch on July 26, 2006 {{concluded that the}} failure {{was caused by a}} malfunctioning of the pumping hydraulic drive of combustion chamber #4. The control malfunctioning brought about the disturbances, which led to the <b>roll</b> <b>instability,</b> excessive dispersions of the yaw and pitch angles. Thrust termination occurred at 74 seconds after lift off. The crash site was located 150 km from the launch pad in an unpopulated area of Kazakhstan. Toxic propellants did pollute the crash site, forcing Russia to pay US$1.1m in compensation. The rocket used for this launch was more than twenty years old. Procedures for launch have been changed to prevent future malfunctions of this kind.|$|E
50|$|The NTSB {{examined}} why {{the plane}} was unable to climb once it departed the runway. After conducting airplane performance studies, the NTSB determined that the events of Flight 1141 could only {{be explained by the}} aircraft attempting to take off without its flaps and slats extended to the proper take-off configuration. The aircraft's instability and sudden roll to the right was consistent with known performance of the Boeing 727 with the flaps and slats retracted. The captain continued to pull back on the control column in an attempt to keep the plane's nose raised, which created turbulence over the rear-mounted engines and caused the compressor surges. However, the NTSB concluded that the compressor surges would not have significantly reduced the engines' thrust, and that the plane's failure to gain speed was due to aerodynamic drag on the aircraft due to the high angle of attack, rather than a loss of engine thrust. The NTSB examined the CVR and noted that neither pilot is heard announcing the deployment of the flaps or slats, nor is the sound of the flap lever movement heard. The NTSB considered it extremely unlikely that a pilot would have moved either the flaps or the slats without announcing their actions {{to the rest of the}} flight crew. Based on the aircraft's failure to climb at takeoff speed, its <b>roll</b> <b>instability,</b> and the absence of sounds indicating the flaps or slats were deployed, the NTSB determined that the plane's failure to climb resulted from the flight crew's failure to deploy the flaps and slats as required by the pre-flight checklist.|$|E
40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} early warning based <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> enhancement system is realized through systematic investigations on static and dynamic roll behavior of the vehicles, identification of indicators for the onset of instability, and reliability analysis. The relative and absolute <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> criteria are initially derived from the rollover mechanics of different heavy vehicle combinations. The relative <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> conditions are evaluated under steady cornering maneuvers through development and analysis of static roll plane models. The sensitivity of the static rollover threshold (SRT) measure to variations in design and operating factors of the vehicle and suspension configurations is evaluated and the conditions of relative rollover for different vehicle configurations are identified. A constant velocity three-dimensional model is derived for relative <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> analysis of articulated vehicles under dynamic directional maneuvers. Dynamic rollover threshold of articulated heavy vehicles is proposed {{on the basis of}} effective lateral acceleration (ELA) and relative rollover criterion. The absolute <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> of heavy vehicles is further investigated using energy approach to derive the absolute rollover limits. A number of potential rollover indicators are identified and evaluated for a five-axle tractor semi-trailer combination using the constant velocity three-dimensional vehicle model in terms of their reliability and early warning capability for driver's actions. The effectiveness of proposed indicators for the open-loop roll stability enhancement is investigated through development and analysis of a comprehensive vehicle model, incorporating braking dynamics. Time delays due to driver's reaction and the transportation lag of the braking system are characterized by a variable referred to as reaction delay. The rollover indicators are investigated for their effectiveness for open- loop roll stability control in various cornering and evasive maneuvers, road conditions, braking efforts, and reaction delays. The study revealed that the RSF is the most reliable indicator, irrespective of the vehicle configurations, while its measurability is relatively poor. The indicators based upon lateral acceleration, sprung and unsprung mass roll angles and steering velocity factor yield good correlation with RSF, but exhibit certain sensitivity to variations in design and operating factor...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} a linear stability analysis conducted on a simulated wind-forced ocean front. The ocean surface boundary layer regulates exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere, and the presence of turbulence in the surface layer can greatly impact climate and ocean life. Past research has shown that the combination of horizontal density gradients and wind stress can trigger turbulent <b>roll</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the boundary layer, but the underlying instability mechanisms are not well understood. In this thesis I assess the dominant <b>instability</b> mechanisms of <b>roll</b> <b>instabilities</b> from several Large Eddy Simulation (LES) numerical model solutions. I relate the numerical solutions to a simplified analytical model to draw conclusions about the underlying instability mechanisms. The results show that <b>roll</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the LES solutions convert energy from both ageostrophic and geostrophic shear of the mean flow. Both symmetric instability and Ekman inflection point <b>instability</b> contribute to <b>roll</b> growth, and in some cases, the combination of symmetric instability and Ekman instability form a mixed-mode <b>instability</b> with <b>roll</b> axis oriented obliquely to the front, consistent with the LES solutions. I conclude that wind-forced frontal zones are unstable to baroclinic, symmetric, and Ekman inflection point instabilities depending on the strength of the wind stress and the frontal temperature gradient. Future studies of wind-forced fronts should recognize the impact of Ekman inflection point instability on boundary layer energy dissipation and mixing, and emphasize its importance even in the presence of symmetrically unstable flow conditions...|$|R

The vertical magnetic field (parallel to the gravity) is found to be he most effective to damp the flow, however, complicated flow profiles with "overvelocities" in the comers are typical in the case of a finite cross-section channel. The temperature distribution is shown to be dependent on the flow profile. The linear stability of the flow is investigated by use of the Chebyshev pseudospectral method.

The onset of <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> in articulated vehicles, if assessed accurately and effectively, would lead to the reduction in occurrence of rollover accidents through early warning, thereby preventing the risk of potential loss of lives and property worth millions of dollars annually. The effective detection of an impending rollover hinges on development of reliable and feasible rollover metrics that are capable of providing good lead-time for open-loop rollover warning and control, over a wide range of design and operating conditions. The state-of-the-art in rollover metrics, strategies and warning systems is discussed.

40|$|Convection in an {{inclined}} layer generates {{various types}} of spatio-temporal patterns due to interaction of buoyancy and shear. At small angles of incline, the secondary instability of the uniform base state occurs {{in the form of}} buoyancy dominated longitudinal rolls. Above a critical angle of incline marking a co-dimension 2 point, shear driven transverse <b>roll</b> <b>instabilities</b> take over as the secondary instabilities. Computing the location of the co-dimension 2 point for varying thermal driving and inclination angle and determining all secondary bifurcations together with the resulting tertiary states allows to characterize the nonlinear phase diagram of inclined layer convection system.

At a higher electric field, the second stationary periodic rolls (i. e., abnormal rolls) are also found above a characteristic intensity of the magnetic field H^*. At further higher electric field the second stationary periodic rolls state becomes unstable again, then evolves to more comp^ 1 icated STC (STC-II). Above H^* the abnor-mal <b>rolls</b> <b>instability</b> corresponding to an azimuthal rotation of the director plays key roles on the pattern transitions between stationary and non-stationary {{states as well as}} between the two sta-tionary ones.

40|$|In this work, the {{finite-element method}} (FEM) {{is used to}} develop the {{governing}} equation of motion of the working roll of a four-high rolling mill and to study its vibration due to different process parameters. The working roll is modeled as an Euler Bernoulli beam by taking beam elements with vertical displacement and slope as the nodal degrees-of-freedom in the finite-element formulation. The bearings {{at the ends of}} the working rolls are modeled using spring elements. To calculate the forces acting on the working roll, the interaction between the working roll and the backup roll is modeled by using the work roll submodel, and the interaction between the working roll and the sheet is modeled by using the roll bite submodel (Lin et al., 2003, "On Characteristics and Mechanism of <b>Rolling</b> <b>Instability</b> and Chatter," ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 125 (4), pp. 778 - 786). Nodal displacements and velocities are obtained by using the Newmark Beta method after solving the governing equation of motion of the working roll. The transient and steady-state variation of roll gap, exit thickness profile, exit stress, and sheet force {{along the length of the}} strip have been found for different bearing stiffnesses and widths of the strip. By using this model, one can predict the shape of the outcoming strip profile and exit stress variation which will be useful to avoid many defects, such as edge buckling or center buckling in rolling processes...|$|R
40|$|We study {{shear flow}} instabilities in nematic liquids of planar {{geometry}} (molecules {{parallel to the}} plates limiting the sample) and where molecules are aligned (along Ox) perpendicular to the shear flow direction (along Oy). An external magnetic field reinforces the alignement imposed by surface effects. We develop a bidimensional model which takes into account exactly boundary conditions on the director and the velocity fields. The two types of instability which have been observed by Guyon and Pieranski (homogeneous distortion and convective rolls parallel to Oy) are interpreted {{within the framework of}} this model. We obtain instability thresholds together with the value of the critical wave vector qcx at threshold. Under weak fields the homogeneous distortion (qcx = 0) is achieved, whereas in high fields a <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> develops (qcx ≠ 0). The crossover from one regime to the other takes place at H ≃ 1 kG. Moreover, we show that in either case, as far as the director is concerned, the aspect of the distortion along the z-direction is dominated by only one wave vector qz. Contrary to the case of the homogeneous distortion where q z varies strongly with H, for the <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> qz remains nearly constant and close to π/ 2 a (2 a is the thickness of the sample).

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether quantified {{measurements of}} trunk sway during stance and gait tests {{in patients with}} autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) could be a useful approach to assess ataxia, which is highly relevant for adequate follow-up and future intervention studies. Examined were 11 SCA patients and 11 age-matched, healthy controls. Postural and balance control were quantified using peak-to-peak measurements of trunk angle and angular velocity, in the roll (lateral) and pitch (anterior-posterior) directions, during a battery of stance and gait tasks. In all stance tasks, trunk angle displacement and angular velocity in both the pitch and roll planes were significantly larger in the SCA group compared with the control group. Among the ataxia patients instability was more increased in the pitch than in the roll direction for two-legged stance tasks, especially when standing on foam, with pronounced oscillations in the pitch plane at 1. 4 and 2. 5 Hz. A similar dominance of pitch over <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> was also observed in most gait tasks, especially for tandem gait and while walking with simultaneous head rotations. Trunk sway measurements were effective in detecting and quantifying the gait and balance abnormalities in SCA patients, suggesting that this method might be used for follow-up studies of SCA patients. Furthermore, the method might help to identify early symptomatic individuals and those patients at risk of falling. The postural instability in SCA {{was found to be}} multidirectional, although there is generally more pitch than <b>roll</b> <b>instability</b> corresponding with predominant involvement of the spinocerebellum...|$|E

40|$|Dilute {{mixtures}} of 3 He in superfluid 4 He have Prandtl numbers easily tunable between those of liquid metals and water: 0. 04 < Pr < 2. Moreover, {{owing to the}} tight coupling of the temperature and concentration fields, superfluid mixture convection is closely analogous to classical Rayleigh&# 8211;B&# 0233;nard convection, i. e. superfluid mixtures convect {{as if they were}} classical, single-component fluids, well described by the Boussinesq equations. This work has two goals. The first is to put the theory of superfluid mixture convection on a firmer basis. We accomplish this by combining experiment and analysis to measure superfluid effects on the onset of convection. In the process, we demonstrate quantitative control over superfluid effects and, in particular, that deviations from classical convective behaviour can be made small or at worst no larger than finite aspect ratio effects. The size of superfluid effects at convective onset can be less than a few percent for temperatures 1 < T < 2 K. Comparison of the measured properties of superfluid mixture <b>roll</b> <b>instabilities</b> above the onset of convection (e. g. skewed varicose, oscillatory, and particularly near the codimension- 2 point) to the properties predicted by Boussinesq calculations further verifies that superfluid mixtures convect as classical fluids. With superfluid effects understood and under control, the second goal, presented in Part 2, is to exploit the unique Pr range of superfluid mixtures and the variable aspect ratio (&# 0915;) capabilities of our experiment to survey convective instabilities in the broad, and heretofore largely unexplored, parameter space 0. 12 < Pr < 1. 4 and 2 < &# 0915; < 95.

Centre manifold theory provides a way of constructing a low dimensional {{model of the}} resulting two dimensional flow. Computer algebra implemented in reduce is used to symbolically expand the centre manifold as an asymptotic series in the convective amplitude. The spatial structure functions in this expansion are then found numerically in Matlab.

The results show that active braking is conducive to the roll stability of ASVs during turning, active steering can improve the roll stability of ASVs during turning and passing over obstacles, and adjusting the swing bridge can improve the roll stability of ASVs by changing the vehicle posture and the position of the gravity center...|$|E
40|$|Planing hulls {{sometimes}} exhibit dynamic instabilities, {{endangering the}} safety of passengers and crew. Most of the efforts in understanding these phenomena have concentrated in the vertical plane (e. g., porpoising). Little {{has been done in}} the horizontal plane, where the emphasis has been placed in the understanding of progressive heeling. The physics and conditions under which planing hulls will develop oscillatory <b>roll</b> <b>instabilities</b> (e. g., chine walking) are still not well understood and therefore there are not accepted guidelines to prevent them. Consistent with this need of understanding, in this research a method for investigating the conditions under which high-speed planing hulls can exhibit large oscillatory roll motions parametrically excited by small heave and pitch motions is proposed. A one-way coupling between heave-pitch and roll is assumed, and the roll equation of motion is written as a Hill's equation with third order non-linearities. The stability boundaries in the Ince-Strutt diagram are obtained, the influence of the different terms in the roll equation of motion on these boundaries is discussed, and conditions to be satisfied in order to avoid large amplitude periodic roll motions {{in the vicinity of the}} principal parametric resonance are derived. In order to reduce the coefficients for the roll equation of motion, the generalized forces and moments acting on a planing hull in asymmetric conditions are obtained by the 2 D+t approach. Non-linear models are proposed for roll added mass and roll damping, based on Fourier analysis of the roll moment time series. It is shown that the presence of a third order harmonic of different sign than the first order harmonic in the out-of-phase component reduces the linear roll damping, increasing the probability of parametric roll. Lastly, two of the conditions tested by Judge at the United States Naval Academy are used as case studies. The results show that high-speed planing hulls running at low mean wetted length and low trim are more prone to develop parametric roll than planing hulls running at high mean wetted length and high trim. This is consistent with what is observed in the field where lightly loaded high-speed planing hulls sometimes exhibit "chine-walking"...|$|R
