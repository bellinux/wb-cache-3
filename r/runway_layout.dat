40|$|Risk {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the key objectives pursued by transport safety policies. Particularly, the formulation and implementation of transport safety policies needs the systematic assessment of the risks, the specification of residual risk targets and the monitoring of progresses towards those ones. Risk and safety have always been considered critical in civil aviation. An increase in airport capacity usually involves changes to <b>runways</b> <b>layout,</b> route structures and traffic distribution, which in turn effect the risk level around the airport. For these reasons third party risk becomes an important issue in airports development. Currently, were moving to a wide adoption of Safety Management Systems (SMS) which carries with it a need to undertake risk assessments, either qualitative or quantitative. The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyse safety aspects in civil airports. To avoid subjective interpretations and to increase model accuracy, risk information are collected and evaluated in a rational and mathematical manner. The method may be used to draw risk contour maps so to provide a guide to local and national authorities, to population who live around the airport, and to airports operators...|$|R
50|$|Because {{only one}} {{aircraft}} can land or depart from a runway {{at a given}} time, and because aircraft must be separated by a certain distance or time to avoid collisions, every airport has a finite capacity; it can safely handle only so many aircraft per hour. This capacity depends on many factors, such {{as the number of}} <b>runways</b> available, <b>layout</b> of taxi tracks, availability of air traffic control, and current or anticipated weather. The weather can cause large variations in capacity; strong winds may limit the number of runways available, and poor visibility may necessitate increases in separation between aircraft.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Currently at many airports, runway is the {{limiting}} {{factor for the}} overall throughput. Among the most important parameters are the fixed wake turbulence separation minima expressed in time for take-off clearance and by distance for arrivals on final approach. This wake turbulence separation limits the arrival and departure flow on many airports in Europe already today. Existing departure and arrival wake turbulence separations are sometimes considered over conservative as they do {{not take into account}} meteorological conditions likely to shift, reduce or alleviate their circulations. This paper will present the main aspects of a SESAR project that defines, analyses and develops a verified wake turbulence system according to related operational concept improvements in order to, punctually or permanently, reduce landing and departure wake turbulence separations and, therefore, to increase the runway throughput {{in such a way that}} it safely absorbs arrival demand peaks and/or reduces departure delays. This global objective will be achieved by means of developing a wake vortex decision support system able to deliver in real time position and strength of the wake vortices and to predict their behavior and potential impact on safety and capacity, taking in account actual weather information as well as the airport specific climatological conditions, aircraft characteristics (generated wake vortex and wake vortex sensitivity) and airport <b>runways</b> <b>layout.</b> These functionalities will be progressively included in the wake vortex decision support system to be validated and deployed on airports in order to optimize the runway throughput and reduce delays.

40|$|Successful air {{transport}} systems must satisfy {{the demand for}} flights while maintaining {{a high level of}} service and safety. For airports, which have limited capacities, policy-makers must compromise between maximizing the number of flights served and avoiding excessive delays. Differences between policies adopted in the US and in Europe result in distinct airport performances, the analysis of which reveals best practices. The first point of comparison is over the capacities of a set of the busiest airports in the US and Europe. Under radar-based air traffic control procedures, Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), American airports achieve equal or higher capacities than European airports with similar <b>runway</b> <b>layouts.</b> These discrepancies cannot be explained by the differences in separation requirements alone. Besides, through their extensive use of Visual Flight Rules (VFR), weather permitting, American airports gain an important premium on their capacities. US air traffic control practices and policies clearly result in a more efficient use of airport infrastructure. Second, arrival delays relative to schedule increase {{over the course of the}} day at the US airports, while they remain mostly constant in Europe. Similarly the distributions of these delays show that schedule reliability at airports is significantly better in Europe than in the US. These comparisons underscore the benefits of Europe's policy of airport slot-controls, which cap the number of aircraft movements at a declared capacity. Moreover, arrival delays in the US are much higher under IFR (23 minutes average) than VFR (9 minutes). This shows that the high variability of the capacity of US airports depending on weather conditions, coupled with the tendency toward over-scheduling of flights, is damaging to the national airport system's stability and reliability. From these comparisons stem a few policy recommendations. Airline schedule reliability might benefit from additional controls or economic incentives to rationalize the scheduling of aircraft movements at some US airports. At the same time, some European airports could benefit from increasing their declared capacities. More generally, European aviation authorities should consider relaxing air traffic control separation procedures along the lines of US practices. by Thomas Morisset. Thesis (S.

The Capacity Enhancement Program has a much larger scope and is considering more drastic ways to increase runway capacity. On December 30, 2010, a 13-year $5.2 billion project that would have extended the two main runways and added one new runway was passed by the FAA. The project would also create two new passenger terminals, the first terminal will be built where the current terminal complex is located and the second terminal will be built across from the current terminal complex. The project was also going to relocate the UPS facility and redevelop cargo city, the cargo complex at PHL. The redesigned UPS facility would have required demolition of several houses of nearby Tinicum Township. But after much resistance by the residents of those homes, an agreement was made to keep the homes and expand the airport elsewhere. The new project will now cost $6.4 billion.|$|E

Considering airports with parallel runway systems, the usage of segmented approaches, however, no longer allows simultaneous and independent approach operations according to current guidelines and therefore reduces capacity. In previous work a safety concept was developed {{to pave the way}} towards conducting independent approach operations while utilizing segmented approaches. Although the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) is by definition not part of this kind of safety concept, an important question to answer is whether the current ACAS implementation can be characterized as compatible to the proposed approach geometry. Because classical approaches towards parallel runways are already critical with respect to generating nuisanceACAS alerts, this issue might even be exacerbated due to the segmented routing.

40|$|Although air traffic’s {{growth rate}} has slowed, airport {{capacity}} and environmental issues, especially noise mitigation, {{are identified as}} major challenges that face aviation. From the perspective of flight guidance, the development of segmented or curved approach procedures based on required navigation performance (RNP) allow for rerouting around congested areas and is thus a promising approach in coping with these issues. Considering airports with parallel runway systems, an increased airport capacity can be reached when runways are operated independently. This, however, requires straight precision approaches to be conducted according to current guidelines issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). To help {{pave the way for}} independent operations of segmented approaches at parallel runway systems, an elementary safety concept was developed in previous work that utilizes the ground-based system of precision runway monitoring. Within this concept, a generic airport scenario with two parallel runways was considered, at which a straight approach is proposed for one of the parallel runways and a segmented or curved approach is assumed for a second runway. Based on this, it was shown that a modified concept of precision runway monitoring is capable of achieving target levels of safety comparable to or even more stringent than those defined in the literature for independent parallel precision approaches. Although the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) is by definition not part of this kind of safety assessment, an important question to answer is whether the current ACAS implementation can be characterized as compatible to the proposed approach geometry. Because classical approaches towards parallel runways are already critical with respect to generating nuisance ACAS alerts, this issue might even be exacerbated due to the segmented routing. To approach this issue, a method will be presented in this work that allows for calculating an approach geometry-dependent critical runway spacing that will not result in nuisance ACAS alerts.

40|$|Although runways are {{critical}} components {{that make up}} an airport, few studies have examined their orientations and operations. This is further {{compounded by the fact that}} <b>runway</b> <b>layout</b> design and/or configuration are so complex yet they play a vital role in the airport 2 ̆ 7 s daily operation, capacity, and safety. In this study, I wish to apply GIS techniques, a wind rose model, and a noise distance decay model to achieve two specific objectives: (1) to determine the effectiveness of runways in terms of its orientation, design, and physical layout; and (2) to analyze any socioeconomic and environmental impacts associated with the use and development of O 2 ̆ 7 Hare Chicago International Airport (ORD). The economic impact of this airport that was reviewed includes job employment, annual development, movement of goods and services and tourism. The study highlights the environmental impacts such as noise, lake effects, compatible land use, and other significant factors in relation to the airport and surrounding communities. The noise distance-decay model shows that aircraft noise levels decompose at about 800 feet (243 m) from the O 2 ̆ 7 Hare runways. Areas close to the airport have a 70 db noise level and there are non-homogenous patterns between the day and night sound levels and the distance from the runways. The wind rose model shows that the wind blowing at O 2 ̆ 7 Hare airport has a southern directional bias only two of the eight runways meet the criteria of a northeast/southwest direction. The directions of the winds are predominantly southerly headings and wind speeds are greater than 7 m/s. The integration of rule-based runway networks and the wind rose model results allowed for a visual analysis and comparison of runway networks. The integration enabled the analysis of the wind direction in relation to the landing or takeoff of aircrafts. The final interpretation of this result requires caution as it suggests that the use of daily wind events would provide a better outcome. Although this study has suggested a GIS-based strategy and wind rose model with key four elements it still requires further refinement. Future work should plan to include more analytical models/optimization methods that accounts for most factors that determine the effectiveness utilization of runways.
