40|$|The {{relationship}} between oxpeckers and African ungulates {{has traditionally been}} considered mutualistic, because the birds were thought to reduce the tick loads of their hosts. However, recent field studies have questioned the validity of this assumption. <b>Red-billed</b> <b>oxpeckers</b> {{were found to have}} no impact on the number of ticks living on domestic cattle and they also prolonged the healing time of wounds (Weeks [1999] Anim Behav 58 : 1253 – 9; Weeks [2000] Behav Ecol 11 : 154 – 60). One of the important limitations of these studies {{is the fact that the}} two species did not coevolve, and therefore the results may not be representative of the relationships between oxpeckers and their native African ungulate hosts in general. We carried out observations between <b>red-billed</b> <b>oxpeckers</b> and one of their natural host species, the black rhino, in captivity, to investigate their relationship. We found that the rhinos had oxpeckers present on them for almost half (approximately 45 %) the time that the two species were in the same enclosure. The oxpeckers spent a large proportion (approximately 40 %) of their time on the rhinos foraging, and mostly at wounds. We observed oxpecker...|$|R
40|$|Field {{observations}} of the interactions between <b>red-billed</b> <b>oxpeckers</b> (Buphagus erythrorhynchus) and wild ungulates in Nakuru National Park, Kenya, revealed that specific hosts frequently attempted to manipulate oxpecker foraging. This involved a repertoire of behaviour collectively referred to as resistance behaviour, and often resulted in the oxpeckers either changing their position on the host's body or departing. Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer), {{the most frequently used}} host, performed little resistance behaviour. Waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) were also popular oxpecker hosts, but frequently exhibited vigorous resistance behaviour. Impala (Aepyceros melampus), the third most widely used host species, also utilized resistance behaviours, but allowed a greater proportion of oxpeckers to forage without disturbance. The suite of resistance behaviours employed by waterbuck, impala and also the consequences for oxpecker foraging, differed significantly. Our data suggest that the oxpecker-ungulate interactions in the field are more complex than previously realized with resistance behaviour regularly employed by selected mammalian host species...|$|R

40|$|Oxpeckers reduce tick loads on {{ungulate}} hosts, {{but they}} are also known to feed on and exacerbate wounds. An understanding of the feeding behaviours and host preferences of these birds is important since they serve as agents of tick control on both domestic and wild ungulates. We conducted an observational study at two sites within the Kruger National Park in South Africa, exploring the feeding preferences of both <b>Red-billed</b> and Yellow-billed <b>Oxpeckers.</b> Oxpeckers’ host preferences, body-location preferences on different hosts, prevalence of feeding and non-feeding behaviours, and frequency of tolerance versus rejection in different hosts were determined. It was found that Yellow-billed Oxpeckers had a smaller range of hosts – typically larger-sized ungulates – and that <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Oxpeckers</b> diversify to smallersized ungulate hosts when in competition with Yellow-billed Oxpeckers. Body-location preferences were generally consistent across sites and across host species. Tick feeding and other host-feeding behaviours (around the eyes, nose, mouth and ears, and anogenital areas) were fairly common. Only six incidents of wound feeding, from a total of 855 observations, were recorded. Tolerance by an ungulate host species was not related to Oxpeckers’ host preferences, suggesting that other factors such as ungulate body size, tick species and tick stages on the host animal may {{play a significant role in}} the feeding preferences of Oxpeckers. Conservation implications: It is important to study Oxpeckers’ behavioural feeding preferences so as to better understand their ecology and present distribution, and to determine where they can be reintroduced in future. Reintroduction not only helps with the proliferation of Oxpeckers, but also benefits ungulate hosts through ectoparasite removal and the subsequent control of tick-borne diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} report on the {{occurrence}} of Parafilaria bassoni in the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). Previously this parasite has been recorded only in springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) in Namibia. Haemorrhagic perforations (bleeding points), the usual lesions seen in infected animals, were caused by gravid female parasites ovipositing embryonated eggs. These lesions occurred mainly on the dorsal and lateral sides of buffaloes. Complications of these lesions developed in {{a small number of}} buffaloes because of secondary bacterial infection [subcutaneous abscesses (3 / 178) ] and as a consequence of a localized Type 1 hypersensitivity [large cutaneous ulcers (7 / 178) ]. <b>Red-billed</b> <b>oxpeckers</b> (Buphagus erythrorynchus) appeared {{to play an important role}} in the epidemiology of this parasite as well as in the pathogenesis of the lesions. They reduced the likelihood of spread by ingesting blood containing embryonated eggs, and caused the development of large ulcers by feeding on superficial necrotic skin. From the results of an ELISA test it was determind that P. bassoni infected buffaloes occur throughout the Kruger National Park complex, with a seroprevalence of approximately 34 %.

5|$|Some parasites feed on giraffes. They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on <b>red-billed</b> and yellow-billed <b>oxpeckers</b> to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which {{comes in the form of}} wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. It appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further effected by fungal infections. As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park.|$|R
25|$|An unusual feeding {{strategy}} {{is that of}} the oxpeckers of Africa. They perch on living animals and glean parasites from the animals' hides. On furry animals, such as buffalo, giraffe, and donkey, these birds run their bills through the fur of the animal, using a scissors-like motion to extract ticks and lice from near the skin. When they pull the insect out {{to the end of the}} fur, they catch it and eat it. (On animals with bare hides, such as rhinoceros and hippopotamus, oxpeckers pick at any open wounds the animals happen to have, consuming blood and pus, and possibly keeping the wounds free of maggots.) Historically, rhinoceros and other large wild mammals have been among the favored hosts, but as the populations of large mammals in the African savanna have declined in modern times, the population and range of both <b>red-billed</b> and yellow-billed <b>oxpecker</b> have also changed, and now the birds will use donkeys and domestic cattle as hosts.|$|R

50|$|The {{breeding}} {{season of the}} oxpeckers, {{in at least one}} location, is linked to the rainy season, which affects the activity of their mammalian hosts and the tick loads of those hosts. Both courtship and copulation occur on their hosts as well. They nest in holes, usually in trees but sometimes in other types of cavity, including holes in walls. The nests are lined with grasses and often with hair plucked from their hosts and even livestock such as sheep which are not usually used. The typical clutch is between two and three eggs, but the <b>red-billed</b> <b>oxpecker</b> may lay up to five eggs.|$|E

40|$|Various {{bird species}} feed {{on a variety}} of insects, ticks and other {{external}} parasites, dead and wounded tissue, clots and blood, secretions and organic debris found on the body of other vertebrates (hosts or clients). Herein I present an overview of so called cleaner birds based on literature records, field observations, and photo surveys. I found that 101 bird species in 32 families practice cleaning even if some of them do so very occasionally. Cleaner birds range from the renowned <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Oxpecker</b> Buphagus erythrorhynchus from Africa to the little known Crested Partridge Rollulus roulroul from Malaysia. Clients are mostly medium-sized to large herbivores such as iguanas, tortoises, capybaras, and wild and domestic ungulates, but also include carnivores such as seals and seabirds. Some clients adopt particular, posing postures while being cleaned, whereas others are indifferent or even disturbed by the activity of some cleaner species. Capybaras, giant tortoises and iguanas are among the posing clients, whereas most ungulates remain oblivious to cleaners. Features such as omnivorous diet and/or opportunistic behaviour, and the habit of associating in other ways with larger vertebrates are related to cleaning behaviour. Most cleaner birds inhabit open areas, and forestdwelling cleaners seemingly are few...|$|E
40|$|As habitat loss, predators (human and non-human) {{and disease}} {{epidemics}} threaten species worldwide, protected sanctuaries have become vital to species conservation. Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP) in South Africa {{is at the}} centre {{of one of the}} world’s greatest conservation success stories. The formal proclamation of HiP in 1895 prevented the extinction of the south-central black rhino (Diceros bicornis minor) population. In recent times HiP has been a strategic source population for the D. b. minor range expansion program, facilitating an 18 -fold population increase across southern Africa. However, HiP’s own black rhino population appears to be in decline. Evidence for decline is most often attributed to overpopulation and poor habitat quality that is driving apparently significant increases in the average home range sizes, poor growth rates (i. e., low calf recruitment) and poor body condition of black rhino. Other factors such as non-human calf predation and parasitism have also been raised as potential causes of decline but remain untested. HiP does have some of the highest densities of lion (Panthera leo) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). HiP’s black rhino population also suffers from remarkably severe chronic haemorrhaging lesions caused by a filarial parasite (Stephanofilaria dinniki). Empirical evidence if or indeed why the HiP black rhino population might be in decline is lacking. Investigating this population’s true status and any potential causes of an apparent decline is urgently needed. This thesis therefore aimed to test three hypotheses for poor performance that included: (1) investigations of the average black rhino home range size, (2) confirmation of black rhino calf predation and (3) the relationship between filarial lesions and black rhino body condition. I inserted horn-implant VHF radio transmitters into 14 adult (i. e., > 5 years) female black rhino in HiP and regularly monitored them on-foot over a three-year period. I found that average home range estimates (9. 77 km 2) were not significantly dissimilar to estimates using a similar technique obtained forty years prior (i. e., 7. 5 km²). I also established the first confirmed link between predation attempts and tail amputation during a lion attack on a black rhino calf. Black rhino body condition, while significantly inversely and temporally correlated to lesion severity, {{did not appear to be}} driven by lesion severity itself and highlights the need for further research. An additional research focus for my thesis developed while in the field. I regularly witnessed red-billed oxpeckers (Buphagus erythrorynchus) feeding at black rhino filarial lesions while also alarm calling to alert them to my presence. Studies have found it difficult to empirically show how oxpecker-host interactions have net positive benefits that make it a mutualism. Thus, two chapters were designed to determine if red-billed oxpeckers were predominately mutualistic or parasitic when visiting black rhino. Determining this depended on whether I could identify net positive benefits or net costs to black rhino. Oxpeckers provide rhino with two possible benefits i. e., benefit 1 is cleaning ectoparasites and benefit 2 is increasing vigilance, and one cost i. e., lesion parasitism. More than 50 hours of behavioural observations established that oxpeckers favoured haemorrhaging filarial lesions over sites of tick attachment on black rhino. Moreover, black rhino appeared to be completely tolerant of oxpeckers that fed at lesions. To test whether oxpeckers increased rhino’s anti-predator vigilance, I conducted 84 human approach trials towards black rhino both with and without oxpeckers present. Results showed that rhino were immediately responsive to oxpecker alarm calls and benefitted from more than a two-fold increase in human detection rate and detection distance. Rhino predominately orientated to face towards their sensory blind spot (i. e., downwind) after an oxpecker alarm call. The traditional name (Askari wa kifaru) of the <b>red-billed</b> <b>oxpecker,</b> which translates as the rhino’s guard, appears to be validated. However, future research will need to confirm whether black rhino’s tolerance of parasitic oxpeckers is directly related to vigilance benefits. In summary, black rhino managers in HiP can be confident that the average home range sizes have not increased significantly. Further, predation of calves might be a greater problem than previously realised and requires further investigation. Monitoring changes in the filarial lesion severity of black rhino might be a useful tool for detecting impending changes in a rhino’s condition. Finally, black rhino are clearly eavesdropping and benefitting from oxpecker alarm calls – a co-evolution that has implications for conserving oxpecker populations as well...|$|E
