5|$|Danmarks Radio {{has a large}} {{department}} in Aarhus with over 200 employees. It runs the DR Østjylland radio programme, provides local contributions to DR P4, and produces local regional television programmes. In 1990, TV 2 established its Jutland headquarters in Randers but moved to Skejby in northern Aarhus in 1999. The station broadcasts regional news and current affairs television and radio programmes. Since 2012, it has <b>run</b> <b>its</b> own TV channel, TV 2 Østjylland. Aarhus has its own local TV channel TVAarhus, transmitting since 1984. After an agreement on 1 July 2014, TVAarhus can be watched by 130,000 households in Aarhus, making it the largest cable-transmitted local TV channel in Denmark.|$|E

Critchlow was developing a new style based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter {{did not believe that}} {{he would be able to}} interest anyone in this very different style.|$|E

5|$|A prophecy {{states that}} a female {{child with a}} special {{birthmark}} will herald {{the downfall of the}} evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda. Bavmorda imprisons all pregnant women in her realm to prevent fulfillment of the prophecy. When the prophesied child Elora Danan is born, the mother begs the midwife to hide the infant and smuggle her to safety. The midwife reluctantly accepts and leaves Nockmaar castle unnoticed. The mother is executed, the midwife is hunted down and eventually found. Knowing she cannot escape, she sets the baby on a makeshift raft of grass and sends her down the river hoping for fate to <b>run</b> <b>its</b> course. The midwife is killed by Nockmaar hounds. Bavmorda, furious about the escape, summons her daughter Sorsha and her army's commander, General Kael, to find the baby.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler {{took control}} in Germany in 1933, Borah thought {{well of the}} new chancellor's {{repudiation}} of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. But he was utterly disgusted and alienated by the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This did not initially lead him {{to speak out against}} Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each nation had the right to <b>run</b> <b>its</b> own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with millions of Americans unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak used to <b>run</b> <b>its</b> trains through Cleveland Union Terminal (now Tower City Center), {{which was}} built in 1928 and served as the main {{terminal}} for the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit, and in 1955, the crosstown Red Line. By 1976, because of Cleveland Union Terminal's high rent, the massive size of the facility, {{and the need to}} switch to electric locomotives to access its enclosed platforms, Amtrak decided to construct a smaller station. Lakefront Station was built in 1976–1977 and opened for service in 1977 to provide service for the Lake Shore Limited, which had resumed service via Toledo in 1975. The station officially opened on June 29, 1977, with the formal dedication occurring on July 12. According to Amtrak's employee magazine, a crowd of more than 300 gathered for the dedication of the $552,000 depot. Speakers included Mary J. Head, vice chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors, and Cleveland Mayor Ralph J. Perk. Following the dedication ceremony, attendees were invited to tour the facility and enjoy cake and coffee.|$|E
5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to <b>run</b> <b>its</b> ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E
5|$|Having been governed and {{developed}} by the British South Africa Company since the 1890s, Southern Rhodesia became a self-governing colony within the British Empire in 1923, when it was granted responsible government by Whitehall. The Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, was henceforth empowered to <b>run</b> <b>its</b> own affairs in almost all matters, including defence. Foreign affairs {{was one of the}} few areas reserved by the British government. As the Empire's lone self-governing colony, Southern Rhodesia was considered a sui generis case, almost on a par with a dominion. Starting in 1932, Imperial Conferences included the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those from the dominions, a unique situation which continued after Imperial Conferences were superseded by Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences in 1944.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} African {{territory of}} Rhodesia, officially Southern Rhodesia, {{was a unique}} case in the British Empire and Commonwealth—though a colony in name, it was internally self-governing and constitutionally not unlike a dominion. This situation dated back to 1923, when it was granted responsible government within the Empire as a self-governing colony, following three decades of administration and development by the British South Africa Company. Britain had intended Southern Rhodesia's integration into the Union of South Africa as a new province, but this having been rejected by registered voters in the 1922 government referendum, the territory was moulded into a prospective dominion instead. It was empowered to <b>run</b> <b>its</b> own affairs in almost all respects, including defence.|$|E
5|$|In 1097, {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Nicaea to the Byzantines, Alexios named John as commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army in Anatolia, and tasked with recovering the Aegean littoral from the Turks. To avoid conflict and facilitate negotiations, he was given custody of {{the wife of the}} sultan of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum Kilij Arslan I (r. 1092–1107) and the daughter of Tzachas, who had been captured at Nicaea. John gave command of the fleet to Kaspax, and marched against Smyrna. After a short siege, Tzachas agreed to surrender the city in exchange for his safe departure and guarantees of the inhabitants' safety. The megas doux readily accepted and took possession of the city, naming Kaspax as its governor. Even before Kaspax could assume his duties however, he was murdered by a Muslim, and the enraged sailors of the fleet massacred the people of the city. John Doukas was unable to restrain them, and restored order only after the massacre had <b>run</b> <b>its</b> course. He then left the experienced general Hyaleas behind as doux of the city along with the entire fleet to secure the city, and continued his campaign. From Smyrna, John marched south to Ephesus. There, he defeated the Turkish garrison after a long battle, and took 2,000 captives, who were resettled in the Aegean islands. Petzeas was installed as doux of Ephesus, and John with his army turned inland. He took the cities of Sardeis and Philadelphia, which he entrusted to Michael Kekaumenos, and reached Laodicea, which opened its gates to him. From there, he marched to the fortresses of Choma and Lampe, installing Eustathios Kamytzes as governor, and reached Polybotos, where most of the Turks who had survived at Ephesus had fled. Having caught them by surprise, Doukas's army defeated them and took much booty.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago riot lasted {{almost a}} week, ending {{only after the}} {{government}} had deployed nearly 6,000 National Guard infantrymen. They stationed them around the Black Belt to prevent any further white attacks. By the evening of July 30, most violence had ended. The majority of the rioting, murder, and arson {{was the result of}} white ethnic groups attacking the African American population in the city's Black Belt on the South Side. Most of the casualties and property damage were suffered by black Chicagoans. Newspaper accounts noted numerous attempts at arson; for instance, on July 31, more than 30 fires were started in the Black Belt before noon and all were believed to be arson. Rioters stretched cables across the streets to prevent fire trucks from entering the areas. The mayor's office was informed of a plan to burn down the black area of Chicago and <b>run</b> <b>its</b> residents out of town. There were also sporadic violent attacks {{in other parts of the}} city, including the Chicago Loop. Because of the rioting, 38 people died (23 African American and 15 white), and another 537 were injured, two-thirds of them African American. Patrolman John W. Simpson was the only policeman killed in the riot. Approximately 1,000 residents, mostly African Americans, were left homeless because of the fires. Many African American families had left by train before the rioting ended, returning to their families in the South.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a hurricane on September13, Odile began to accelerate towards the north-northwest {{in the direction of}} the Baja California Peninsula under the influence of both a strengthening mid-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and an upper-level low to the northwest. Following the formation of an eye, Odile began a phase of rapid intensification. Odile attained Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 00:00UTC on September14. Six hours later, the cyclone had reached Category4 intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg), a pressure typical for a Category 5 hurricane. At the time, this pressure reading was tied for the sixth-lowest on record for an east Pacific hurricane. Even though additional deepening was forecast, strengthening leveled off thereafter as an eyewall replacement cycle, common in intense hurricanes, began to <b>run</b> <b>its</b> course. Despite the leveling off in intensity, a United States Air Force aircraft reconnaissance flight observed a barometric pressure of 922mbar (hPa; 27.23inHg); this measurement was the lowest pressure reading officially measured throughout Odile's existence. Nonetheless, the eroding of the hurricane's inner core due to the eyewall replacement cycle resulted in gradual weakening after peak intensity. Still maintaining its north-northwesterly course with little deviation, Odile made landfall near Cabo San Lucas at 04:45UTC on September15 with winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a central pressure of 941 mbar (hPa; 27.79 inHg). The wind estimates tie Odile with Hurricane Olivia in 1967 as the strongest tropical cyclone to move ashore Baja California Sur in the satellite era.|$|E
5|$|With {{relation}} to the human characters, David was conceptualized as not only a surrogate son for Peter Weyland, but {{as a replacement for}} Weyland's estranged daughter, Meredith Vickers. The actress who portrayed Vickers, Charlize Theron, detailed that Ridley Scott perceived Weyland's family and his company, the Weyland Corporation, as being male-dominated, with Vickers' shared DNA being the only attachment. This runs counter to David, who is a synthetic male created to supplant Vickers and uphold the family's patriarchy. Throughout the eight-month rewrite process leading directly into principal photography, Damon Lindelof focused on enhancing David's bondage to Weyland and the Prometheus- despite David being designed to be a surrogate son, he would actually be a proverbial captive to the master and his ship. With Weyland's death {{at the hands of the}} awakened Engineer, David's programming has <b>run</b> <b>its</b> course and every action he takes from thereon out is by his own volition, essentially freeing him. A philosophical element Scott raised about the David 8 model is that he exemplifies the dangers of making an android sentient- with him having the capacity for free will and the ability to create, he crosses a moral boundary that other androids stay within. The contrast between David and the others androids was developed further in , with the creation of the physically identical character Walter, who was made more robotic and unable to create on his own.|$|E
