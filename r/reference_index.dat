25|$|The {{threshold}} for stimulation of bitter taste by quinine averages {{a concentration of}} 8 μM (8 micromolar). The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a <b>reference</b> <b>index</b> of 1. For example, Brucine has an index of 11, is thus perceived as intensely more bitter than quinine, and is detected {{at a much lower}} solution threshold. The most bitter substance known is the synthetic chemical denatonium, which has an index of 1,000. It is used as an aversive agent (a bitterant) that is added to toxic substances to prevent accidental ingestion. This was discovered in 1958 during research on lignocaine, a local anesthetic, by MacFarlan Smith of Gorgie, Edinburgh, Scotland.|$|E
25|$|The ETF {{tracking}} error {{is the difference}} between the returns of the ETF and its <b>reference</b> <b>index</b> or asset. A non-zero {{tracking error}} therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus. The tracking error is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which {{is the difference between}} the ETF’s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index. Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the reference asset or index is illiquid. Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX futures market.|$|E
