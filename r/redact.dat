5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to <b>redact</b> the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time there is concerted effort to re-translate, edit, and even <b>redact</b> works that are not authenticated. For example, `Abdu'l-Bahá on Divine Philosophy, {{published}} in 1916, was not reprinted at the direction of Shoghi Effendi. Also, early editions of Esslemont's Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era contained several passages that could not be authenticated, or were incorrect. These have been reviewed and updated in subsequent editions. This practice has been criticized by observers, but is considered an integral part of maintaining the integrity of the texts.|$|E

25|$|Prešeren {{spent the}} last two years of his life {{occupied}} with private life and his new job as a lawyer in Kranj. According to some accounts, he was planning several literary projects, including a novel in the realistic style and an experimental play, but he was struck with liver disease caused by his excessive drinking in prior years. The revolution of 1848 left him rather indifferent, although it was carried out by the young generation who already saw him as an idol of democratic and national ideals. Before his death, he did however <b>redact</b> his Zdravljica, which was left out from the 1847 volume of poems, and made some minor adjustments for a new edition of his collected poems.|$|E
500|$|In late 1993, Petterson {{was asked}} by {{officials}} in the Clinton administration to deliver a [...] ultimatum to Sudan's Islamist leader, Hasan al-Turabi, and the country's president, Omar al-Bashir. The document contained a brief list of talking points that were designed to warn Sudan's top government officials about any involvement in alleged plots to kill U.S. diplomats working in Sudan. The alleged threats were based on evidence gathered by a foreign agent retained by the C.I.A., data which {{would be used to}} justify Petterson's reduction of American embassy personnel in Khartoum. The agent's information would later be found to have been fabricated, and would force the C.I.A. to <b>redact</b> or delete up to 100 reports on Sudan. Petterson would later state that he did not believe the intelligence findings warranted a draw down in embassy staff.|$|E
500|$|Ron {{speaks in}} a deadpan tone of voice and seldom expresses any kind of emotion, {{although}} he is often shown to be very giddy {{when it comes to}} riddles and meat. He adheres to many stereotypically masculine traits. He claims to have only cried twice: once when he was hit by a bus at age 7; secondly when miniature horse Li'l Sebastian died. Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping, and woodworking. For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall. He describes fishing as [...] "like yoga, except I still get to kill something." [...] He is particularly attracted to brunettes and what he describes as [...] "strong, self-possessed women {{at the top of their}} fields," [...] with professional athletes Steffi Graf and Sheryl Swoopes among his ideal women. He loves breakfast foods and red meats; among the types of food he enjoys are bacon-wrapped shrimp, fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger, and bacon-wrapped turkey legs, which are known in Pawnee as [...] "The Swanson." [...] He also drinks heavily but seldom feels the effects of alcohol or gets hung over. He primarily drinks scotch whisky, claiming that [...] "Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets." [...] He is an extremely private person, going so far as to <b>redact</b> his birthday from government documents to keep others from holding parties for him (though he did reluctantly provide it as [...] "springtime" [...] on a hospital admission form). Ron knows almost nothing about popular culture; he recognizes the name Julia Roberts only as the [...] "toothy gal from Mystic Pizza," [...] and he once confused the Star Wars film franchise with Harry Potter. He enjoys the music of Willie Nelson, being shown listening to [...] "Hello Walls" [...] and [...] "Buddy" [...] during the series. Ron is extremely concerned with the image people have of him and once refused to seek treatment for a hernia; he instead chose to remain immobile at his desk all day and night until April offered to take him to the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|On those grounds, {{the search}} had been {{reasonable}} under O'Connor. Its inception, {{to see whether}} the city needed a higher character limit, was legitimately work-related. Review of the content of the messages was an [...] "efficient and expedient" [...] way of achieving that goal, Kennedy wrote. The OPD's decision to limit the review to just two months' worth of messages, and <b>redact</b> those sent when Quon was off duty further bolstered its case.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, several U.S. {{government}} officials have criticised WikiLeaks for exposing classified information and claimed that the leaks harm national security and compromise international diplomacy. Several human rights organisations requested with respect to earlier document releases that WikiLeaks adequately <b>redact</b> the names of civilians working with international forces, {{in order to prevent}} repercussions. Some journalists have likewise criticised a perceived lack of editorial discretion when releasing thousands of documents at once and without sufficient analysis. In 2016, Harvard law professor and Electronic Frontier Foundation board member Jonathan Zittrain argued that a culture in which one constantly risks being [...] "outed" [...] as a result of virtual Watergate-like break-ins (or 4th amendment violations) could lead people to hesitate to speak their minds.|$|E
2500|$|By 1964, when Gheorghiu-Dej {{signaled}} Romania's {{detachment from}} the de-Stalinized Soviet Union, Răutu was again called upon for ideological maneuvering. Gheorghiu-Dej sided with Red China in the Sino-Soviet divorce, and Răutu helped <b>redact</b> the [...] "April Theses" [...] recognizing [...] "the sovereign rights of each socialist state". He was afterward heard stating his disgust for past Sovietization, sending a shock-wave through academia {{when he spoke}} about those [...] "who have shamefully kowtowed at even the most insignificant Soviet creation", and praised [...] "national values" [...] in the scientific field. He enabled Gheorghiu-Dej's anti-Hungarian rhetoric by sending him {{a report on the}} nationalistic statements made by various Hungarian authors and tolerated by the Hungarian communist government. Răutu also looked on as the regime allowed a partial recovery of his philosophical bugbears (Dobrogeanu-Gherea, then Maiorescu) and a controlled familiarization with Western literature or modernism.|$|E

2500|$|The Book(s) of Samuel {{variously}} describe Samuel {{as having}} carried out sacrifices at sanctuaries, and having constructed and sanctified altars. According to the Priestly Code/Deuteronomic Code only Aaronic priests/Levites (depending on the underling tradition) {{were permitted to}} perform these actions, and simply being a nazarite or prophet was insufficient. The books of Samuel and Kings offer numerous examples where this rule is not followed by kings and prophets, but some critical scholars look elsewhere seeking a harmonization of the issues. In the Book of Chronicles, Samuel {{is described as a}} Levite, rectifying this situation; however critical scholarship widely sees the Book of Chronicles as an attempt to <b>redact</b> the Book(s) of Samuel and of Kings to conform to later religious sensibilities. Since many of the Biblical law codes themselves are thought to postdate the Book(s) of Samuel (according to the Documentary Hypothesis), Chronicles is probably making its claim based on religious motivations. The Levitical genealogy of [...] is not historical, according to modern scholarship.|$|E
