40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent of}} earnings management around substantial open-market share <b>repurchases</b> and tests the hypotheses of opportunistic earnings manipulation and earnings smoothing. We find that earnings management before share <b>repurchases</b> {{is limited to the}} management of discretionary accruals within GAAP rules. This downward earnings management leads to smoother earnings as operating performance deteriorates after <b>repurchases.</b> Despite this deterioration, <b>repurchasing</b> firms experience better operating and stock performance after <b>repurchases</b> than matched firms. Firms with the lowest discretionary accruals before <b>repurchases</b> have the worst deterioration in operating cash flows after <b>repurchases,</b> suggesting that most firms engage in earnings management before <b>repurchases</b> to smooth their earnings rather than to mislead investors. <b>Repurchases</b> tend to precede a decline in business opportunities.

Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E

Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20April 1920.

40|$|We {{would like}} to thank seminar {{participants}} at Indiana University for helpful The use of stock <b>repurchases</b> has fluctuated dramatically over the last two decades: Aggregate <b>repurchases</b> peaked in 1999, when the use of <b>repurchases</b> came close to surpassing the use of dividends, and reached a low in 1991, when the <b>repurchases</b> amounted to only a quarter of dividends. Though several researchers document this trend in <b>repurchases,</b> there has been little explanation provided for why it occurs. In this paper, we investigate why stock <b>repurchases</b> occur in waves by explaining how the trends in aggregate payout policy relate to earnings and the overall economy. Specifically, we estimate the cointegrating relation between earnings and GDP and use the residual from this relation, the deviation in earnings from its trend, as a measure of transitory earnings. We find that <b>repurchases</b> increase with increases in both permanent and transitory earnings. However, the change in dividends paid is not related to transitory earnings but rather only permanent shifts in earnings that result from changes in the macro-economy. Further, transitory earnings are the primary driver in the choice between <b>repurchases</b> i...|$|R

We also examine {{the extent to which}} management stock options influence the choice between open market <b>repurchases</b> and dividend payments. Because the value of management stock options [...] like any call option [...] is negatively related to expected future dividend payments, management can increase the value of its stock options by substituting share <b>repurchases</b> for dividend growth.

We find that stock <b>repurchases</b> contribute more to firm value in countries with strong investor protection than in countries with weak investor protection. We also report that dividends contribute approximately 60 % more to firm value than <b>repurchases</b> in countries with weak investor protection. Furthermore, as the proportion of <b>repurchases</b> in total payouts increases, the marginal value of cash increases in countries with strong investor protection, whereas it declines in countries with weak investor protection. In a poor investor protection environment, the marginal value of cash for a firm that makes 100 % of its payouts via <b>repurchases</b> is 12 cents lower than that for a firm that distributes 100 % of its payouts via dividends. Overall, our findings highlight that stock <b>repurchases</b> are less effective than dividends in mitigating agency problems associated with free cash flow in countries with poor investor protection.
