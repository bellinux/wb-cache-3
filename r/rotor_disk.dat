5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk.</b> Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, {{electro-mechanical}} machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition, polyalphabetic substitution, {{and a kind of}} [...] "additive" [...] substitution. In rotor machines, several <b>rotor</b> <b>disks</b> provided polyalphabetic substitution, while plug boards provided another substitution. Keys were easily changed by changing the <b>rotor</b> <b>disks</b> and the plugboard wires. Although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt, other machines such as the British Bombe were invented to crack these encryption methods.|$|R

50|$|The {{control is}} called the cyclic because it changes the pitch of the rotor blades cyclically. The result is to tilt the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk</b> in a {{particular}} direction, resulting in the helicopter moving in that direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic forward, the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk</b> tilts forward, and the rotor produces a thrust in the forward direction.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{study of the}} properties of aircraft brake materials was made to determine ways of improving friction and wear behavior while minimizing surface temperatures. It is found that frictional variation at high temperature involves material softening and metal transfer, formation of oxides, and surface melting. The choice of proper materials to combat these effects is discussed. Minimum surface temperatures are found to result from use of materials with large density-specific heat and density-specific heat-conductivity factors, use of a higher load-lower friction system, and maximization of the contact area. Some useful trade-off criteria for the size of brake disks against weight considerations are suggested. Additional information on material behavior and peak braking temperatures was gathered from an inspection of used brake pads and <b>rotor</b> <b>disks...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Rotor</b> <b>disks</b> for gas {{turbines}} are heavy components {{and are usually}} designed following a safe-life approach, where the low-cycle fatigue analysis is carried out referring to design life curves with suitable probabilistic margins. However, {{in the case of}} such a heavy component there is the possibility of rare oc- currence of undetected defects or, better, the need to identify the defect acceptability for the different rotor regions (considering stress, temperature, mission profile). In order to carry out such calculations for a turbine ro- tor disk a software named AStrID (Assessment of the Structural Integrity of Disks) has been developed in close cooperation be- tween Politecnico di Milano and Ansaldo Energia (AEN).

50|$|A blisk (portmanteau of bladed disk) is a {{turbomachine}} component comprising both <b>rotor</b> <b>disk</b> and blades.

The downstream wake flow field of the rotor simulators has been observed and measured in the 21 m tilting flume at the Chilworth hydraulics laboratory, University of Southampton. The focus of this work is the proximity of flow boundaries (sea bed and surface) to the <b>rotor</b> <b>disks</b> and the constrained nature of the flow. A three-dimensional Eddy-viscosity numerical model based on an established wind turbine wake model has been modified {{to account for the}} change in fluid and the presence of a bounding free surface. This work has shown that previous axi-symmetric modeling approaches may not hold for marine current energy technology and a novel approach is required for simulation of the downstream flow field. Such modeling solutions are discussed and resultant simulation results are given. In addition, the presented work has been conducted as part of a UK Government funded project to develop validated numerical modeling tools which can predict the flow onto a marine current turbine within an array. The work feeds into the marine energy program at Southampton to assist developers with layout designs of arrays which are optimally spaced and arranged to achieve the maximum possible energy yield at a given tidal energy site...|$|R

40|$|Laminar flow in an unbaffled {{mixing vessel}} stirred by a solid <b>disk</b> <b>rotor</b> and a 4 -blade {{impeller}} was simulated using the CFD software package FLUENT. The computational geometries and grids were generated using a pre-processor software package (Gambit) and then exported to Fluent where the {{rotating reference frame}} approach was employed to predict the flow field. The flow field is characterised by two recirculation regions, the centre of which was investigated. The swirl velocity and the Z-vorticity at the recirculation centre are much higher for the 4 -blade impeller than for the solid <b>disk</b> <b>rotor.</b> Simulated results also show that both the swirl velocity and the Z-vorticity are higher near the impeller. Results show that at Reynolds number (Re) = 200 the 4 -blade impeller exhibits {{a sharp increase in}} the swirl velocity near the axis {{at the bottom of the}} mixing vessel, which generates an upwards vortical flow. The results show that the solid <b>disk</b> <b>rotor</b> may be viable for smooth laminar applications...|$|R
50|$|The {{control is}} called the cyclic because it changes the pitch angle of the rotor blades cyclically. That is, the pitch, or {{feathering}} angle, of the rotor blades changes depending upon their position as they rotate around the hub, so that all blades have the same incidence {{at the same point}} in the cycle. The change in cyclic pitch has the effect of changing the angle of attack, and thus the lift generated by a single blade as it moves around the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk.</b> This in turn causes the blades to fly up or down in sequence, depending on the changes in lift affecting each individual blade. The result is to tilt the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk</b> in a particular direction, resulting in the helicopter moving in that direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic forward, the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk</b> tilts forward, and the rotor produces a thrust vector in the forward direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic to the right, the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk</b> tilts to the right and produces thrust in that direction, causing the helicopter to move sideways in a hover or to roll into a right turn during forward flight, much as in a fixed wing aircraft.|$|E

In early models, the alphabet ring was fixed to the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk.</b> A later improvement was the ability to adjust the alphabet ring relative to the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk.</b> The position of the ring was known as the Ringstellung ("ring setting"), and {{was a part of the}} initial setting prior to an operating session.

40|$|Bearings are {{mechanical}} dissipative systems that, when perturbed, relax {{toward a}} synchronized (bearing) state. Here {{we find that}} bearings can be perceived as physical realizations of complex networks of oscillators with asymmetrically weighted couplings. Accordingly, these networks can exhibit optimal synchronization properties through fine tuning of the local interaction strength {{as a function of}} node degree [Motter, Zhou, and Kurths, Phys. Rev. E 71, 016116 (2005) ]. We show that, in analogy, the synchronizability of bearings can be maximized by counterbalancing the number of contacts and the inertia of their constituting <b>rotor</b> <b>disks</b> through the mass-radius relation, m∼ r^α, with an optimal exponent α=α_× which converges to unity for a large number of rotors. Under this condition, and regardless of the presence of a long-tailed distribution of disk radii composing the mechanical system, the average participation per disk is maximized and the energy dissipation rate is homogeneously distributed among elementary rotors.

At appropriate shaft crosssections, by means of massless membranes, there are attached rigid rings representing <b>rotors,</b> <b>disks,</b> gears, flywheels and others. The proposed model enables us to investigate coupled linear or non-linear lateral torsional Vibrations of the rotating systems in steady-state and transient operating conditions.

40|$|Tesla turbine and its {{applications}} {{in power generation}} and fluid flow were demonstrated by Nicholas Tesla in 1913.

All of the aforementioned limits of Tesla turbines can be addressed by scaling to the microfluidic flow regime. Demonstrated here is a microscale Tesla pump designed and fabricated using a Digital Light Processing (DLP) based 3 D printer with 43 µm lateral and 30 µm thickness resolutions. The miniaturized pump is characterized by low Reynolds number of 1000 and a flow rate of up to 12. 6 mL/min at 1200 rpm, unloaded. It is capable of driving a mixer network to generate microfluidic gradient. The continuous, laminar flow from Tesla turbines is well-suited to the needs of flow-sensitive microfluidics, where the integrated pump will enable numerous compact lab-on-a-chip applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this three-year project was to develop and deliver to NASA Lewis one-dimensional and two-dimensional higher-order theories, and related computer codes, for the analysis, optimization and design of cylindrical functionally graded materials/structural components for use in advanced aircraft engines (e. g., combustor linings, <b>rotor</b> <b>disks,</b> heat shields, blisk blades). To satisfy this objective, a quasi one-dimensional version of the higher-order theory, HOTCFGM- 1 D, and four computer codes based on this theory, for the analysis, design and optimization of cylindrical structural components functionally graded in the radial direction were developed. The theory is applicable to thin multi-phased composite shell/cylinders subjected to macroscopically axisymmetric thermomechanical and inertial loading applied uniformly along the axial direction such that the overall deformation {{is characterized by a}} constant average axial strain. The reinforcement phases are uniformly distributed in the axial and circumferential directions, and arbitrarily distributed in the radial direction, thereby allowing functional grading of the internal reinforcement in this direction...|$|R
40|$|The ingress of hot gas {{through the}} rim seal {{of a gas}} turbine depends on the {{pressure}} difference between the mainstream flow in the turbine annulus {{and that in the}} wheel-space radially inward of the seal. This paper describes experimental measurements which quantify the effect of ingress on both the stator and <b>rotor</b> <b>disks</b> in a wheel-space pressurized by sealing flow. Infrared (IR) sensors were developed and calibrated to accurately measure the temperature history of the rotating disk surface during a transient experiment, leading to an adiabatic effectiveness. The performance of four generic (though engine-representative) single-and double-clearance seals was assessed in terms of the variation of adiabatic effectiveness with sealing flow rate. The measurements identify a so-called thermal buffering effect, where the boundary layer on the <b>rotor</b> protects the <b>disk</b> from the effects of ingress. It was shown that the effectiveness on the rotor was significantly higher than the equivalent stator effectiveness for all rim seals tested. Although the ingress through the rim seal is a consequence of an unsteady, three-dimensional flow field, and the cause-effect relationship between pressure and the sealing effectiveness is complex, the time-averaged experimental data are shown to be successfully predicted by relatively simple semi-empirical models, which are described in a separate paper. Of particular interest to the designer, significant ingress can enter the wheel-space before its effect is sensed by the rotor...|$|R

50|$|Flap back or {{blowback}} is {{a phenomenon}} affecting the rotor of a helicopter as it overcomes dissymmetry of lift through flapping. In forward flight, rotor blades experience more lift as they rotate forward. This increased lift {{is a result of}} an increased relative speed causing the blade to flap up and decrease its angle of attack. As the blade continues to rotate, it achieves its maximum upflapping displacement over the nose of the aircraft and maximum downflapping displacement over the tail. This results in the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk</b> being tilted to the rear and is referred to as flap back, as if the <b>rotor</b> <b>disk</b> had flapped or tilted back, or {{as if it had been}} blown back by the relative wind. The effect is more pronounced at higher airspeeds but more easily recognized as the aircraft accelerates to translational lift airspeeds from a hover. Flap back results in a slowing of the aircraft and the pilot counters the effect by applying forward input to the cyclic control.|$|E
40|$|A {{major concern}} in the {{operation}} of present-day gas turbine engines is the ingestion of hot mainstream gas into rotor-stator disk cavities of the high-pressure turbine stages. Although the engines require high gas temperature at turbine entry for good performance efficiency, the ingested gas shortens the lives of the cavity internals, particularly that of the <b>rotor</b> <b>disks.</b> Steps such as installing seals at the disk rims and injecting purge (secondary) air bled from the compressor discharge into the cavities are implemented to reduce the gas ingestion. Although there are advantages to the above-mentioned steps, the performance of a gas turbine engine is diminished by the purge air bleed-off. This then requires that the cavity sealing function be achieved with as low a purge air supply rate as possible. This, in turn, renders imperative an in-depth understanding of the pressure and velocity fields in the main gas path and within the disk cavities. In this work, experiments were carried out in a model 1. 5 -stage (stator-rotor-stator) axial air turbine to study the ingestion of main air into the aft, rotor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The present work is {{concerned}} with the determination of material parameters to model the inelastic behaviour of an ASTM A 471 steel (24 CrNiMoV 14 - 6, vacuum-treated alloy steel forgings) very often utilised for turbine generator shafts, turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>disks</b> and wheels. Turboalternator shafts suffer very heavy local strain during transients and accidental emergencies (short circuits, out of phase synchronisation, etc.). The experimental work has been performed by strain controlled, completely reversed push-pull low cycle fatigue tests, at room temperature, to determine the stable hysteresis loops and the cyclic curve. The tests have been performed with a servo-hydraulic INSTRON testing machine on ASTM standard specimens. The aims of the study are the characterisation of hardening parameters for an elasto-plastic continuum model, taking into account the use of continuum damage mechanics models into design and structural integrity assessment of mechanical components. Good correlation has been found between the curves modelled by the kinematic hardening parameters and those obtained by experimental fatigue tests.
