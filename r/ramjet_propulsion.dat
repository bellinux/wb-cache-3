Some engine designs combine {{several types of}} engines features into a combined cycle. For instance, the Rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) engine uses a rocket engine inside a ramscoop so that at low speed, the rockets thrust is boosted by ejector augmented thrust. It then transitions to <b>ramjet</b> <b>propulsion</b> at near-supersonic speeds, then to supersonic combustion or scramjet propulsion, above Mach 6, then back to pure rocket propulsion above Mach 10.|$|E
50|$|Another {{improvement}} program was designated the R-77M, {{which made the}} missile longer and heavier, making use of a two-stage motor {{as well as an}} improved seeker. A further product-improvement of the R-77, designated the R-77M1 and then the R-77-PD, was to feature a <b>ramjet</b> <b>propulsion</b> device. This missile was destined for the MiG 1.44 that for the MFI program. The weapon has a laser fuse and an expanding rod warhead that can destroy the variable sized targets. However, due to funding shortage and eventual cancellation of the MiG 1.44, development of this model may have stopped by 1999; no information or announcement regarding the R-77M and R-77-PD has appeared since.|$|E

40|$|Future space {{transportation}} vehicles may well rely {{on high speed}} airbreathing <b>propulsion</b> (<b>ramjets</b> and scramjets) to supply much of their motive power. Because of the tradeoff relationship between engine thrust and vehicle airframe weight, ascent trajectories are typically simulated using a constant dynamic pressure phase during airbreathing acceleration. That is, dynamic pressure is increased to benefit vehicle thrust up to some fixed limit imposed by the vehicle structure. The constant dynamic pressure portion of the trajectory typically begins around Mach 2 or 3 and continues to the maximum airbreathing Mach number or until some convective aeroheating limit is reached. This paper summarizes comparative research on three candidate guidance methods suitable for simulating constant dynamic pressure trajectories.

The ship-launched and land-based missiles can carry a 200 kg warhead, whereas the aircraft-launched variant (BrahMos A) can carry a 300 kg warhead. It has a two-stage propulsion system, with a solid-propellant rocket for initial acceleration and a liquid-fuelled ramjet responsible for sustained supersonic cruise.

50|$|In 1949, Farrar made {{in-flight}} {{observations of}} wing buckling in a Bristol Freighter, which then did full power engine cut tests.

The head of flight test was the designated head of the new Guided Weapons department, to which Farrar then succeeded. Contracts having already been let for army and navy anti aircraft systems, Bristol and Ferranti were teamed to study a longer range system for the Royal Air Force.

40|$|A simple {{model of}} an aero-assisted booster {{is used to}} examine the {{contributions}} of propulsion system type, aerodynamic lift and flight trajectory to the efficiency with which payloads can be placed into low earth orbit. The higher propulsive efficiency of <b>ramjet</b> and scramjet <b>propulsion</b> has the potential of increasing the payload mass ratio significantly. The contributions of turbojet propulsion and aerodynamic lift are less significant. The additional complexity involved in using aerodynamic propulsion and lift requires dealing with a more comprehensive set of design variables than for rocket boosters. The approach taken is to derive a set of sensitivity functions which relate booster performance to the design variables. The problems of optimum mixing of aerodynamic lift with thrust and determining the optimal boost trajectory is treated. The potential payload capacity of a horizontal take-off air-breathing boost vehicle is examined. The optimization problem which considers propulsive efficiency, aerodynamic configuration, and control and guidance issues is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The JB {{designation}} {{was introduced}} by the U.S. Army Air Force in 1943, and covered guided missiles with rocket and/or air-breathing jet (turbojet, pulsejet, <b>ramjet)</b> <b>propulsion.</b> The JB-3, which contractor Hughes called the Tiamat, was a subsonic air-to-air design intended for used against bombers. [...] "It was intended to arm the Northrop-built JB-1 Bat bomber."Development began in January 1944, and the cylindrical vehicle was propelled by a dual-thrust (boost/sustain) solid-fueled rocket motor and had three comparatively large wings with control surfaces for stability and control. The Tiamat used a semi-active radar seeker and the warhead was triggered by a proximity fuze. A large weapon for the time, it weighed 625 pounds with a 100-pound warhead, {{with a range of}} about nine miles at about 600 mph up to 50,000 feet.|$|E
5000|$|Akash is a {{surface-to-air missile}} with an [...] range of 30 km. It has a launch weight of 720 kg, a {{diameter}} of 35 cm and a length of 5.78 metres. Akash flies at supersonic speed, reaching around Mach 2.5. It can reach an altitude of 18 km and can be fired from both tracked and wheeled platforms. An on-board guidance system coupled with an actuator system makes the missile maneuverable up to 15g loads and a tail chase capability for end game engagement. A digital proximity fuse is coupled with a 55 kg pre-fragmented warhead, while the safety arming and detonation mechanism enables a controlled detonation sequence. A self-destruct device is also integrated. It is propelled by an Integrated Ramjet Rocket Engine. The use of a <b>ramjet</b> <b>propulsion</b> system enables sustained speeds without deceleration throughout its flight. The Missile has command guidance in its entire flight.|$|E
50|$|Some sources {{indicate}} that it was also applied to a speculative proposal for a manned aerial reconnaissance version of the A4b winged variant of the A4. This A6 was initially proposed to the German Air Ministry as an uninterceptable reconnaissance craft. It would be launched vertically by rocket, taking it to an apogee of 95 km; after re-entering the atmosphere it would enter a supersonic glide phase, when its single ramjet would be ignited. It was hoped that this would provide 15 to 20 minutes of cruise at 2900 km/h and would allow the aircraft to return to its base and make a conventional runway landing assisted by a drag chute. However, the Air Ministry had no requirement for such an aircraft and the proposal was rejected. Similar concepts (though unmanned) were produced after {{the war in the}} form of the USA's SM-64 Navaho missile and the USSR's Burya, both intercontinental cruise missiles with <b>ramjet</b> <b>propulsion.</b>|$|E
50|$|CF-03B <b>ramjet</b> is the <b>propulsion</b> {{engine of}} Drone-6 and it {{required}} mother aircraft to reach speed of Mach 0.75 to release Drone-6. A solid rocket booster motor is attached {{at the end}} of engine, with output power at 70.5 t/s, with sustaining time of 3.5 to 4.7 seconds. At an altitude of 8 km, the thrust of CF-03B ramjet is 2018 kg and propels Drone-6 to Mach 2.2. At an altitude of 20 km, the thrust of CF-03B is 446 kg and propels Drone-6 to Mach 2.5. Drone-6 is usually launched at an altitude of 9.3 km. Obviously, such speeds are too slow to simulate SR-71, and {{this was one of the}} primary reasons the Drone-6 project was finally cancelled. Although failing to fulfill the mission of simulating SR-71, Drone-6 was used in extremely limited application is support of developing other SAMs, mainly because there was nothing else to replace it, as a result of political turmoil in China at the time, namely, Cultural Revolution, which also prevented later plans to improve CF-03B ramjet from being carried out.|$|R
40|$|These notes {{deal with}} the {{integration}} of a (sc) ramjet engine in either an axisymmetric or a waverider type of cruise missile configuration. The integration aspects relate to {{the integration of the}} external and internal flow paths in geometrical configurations that are being considered worldwide. Integration of these two flow paths combined with the vehicle concept that flies an equilibrium cruise flight (lift = weight and thrust = drag) has led to an evaluation tool, HyTEC (Hypersonic Technology Evaluation Code) that estimates the system performance parameter cruise flight range as function of design options: vehicle concept (axisymmetric or waverider) and scale, <b>ramjet</b> or scramjet <b>propulsion</b> and mission options (e. g. flight speed, flight altitude). First-order engineering relations for the aerodynamic and propulsive forces in the supersonic and hypersonic flight regime constitute the basis of this tool.

40|$|Many {{countries}} are developing technologies for future hypersonic air breathing cruise missiles. These missiles are foreseen {{to be employed}} against, amongst others, deeply buried targets. The main technological challenges are related to severe aerodynamic heating and complex physical processes of aerodynamics and combustion at hypersonic flight speed. This paper reports on {{a study of the}} flight mechanics of these systems. Engineering methods for both aerodynamics and propulsion were extracted from literature and have been integrated in a so-called system engineering tool which allows for a performance analysis of the complete system. Two baseline configurations have been defined for this performance analysis (an axi-symmetric and waverider type of configuration). The system engineering tool allows for studying design choices (e. g. <b>ramjet</b> or scramjet <b>propulsion)</b> and for studying the effect of subsystem model uncertainties on overall system performance. These studies can be done {{for a wide range of}} mission parameters (like cruise flight Mach number, weapon dimensions, etc). The first system analyses that have been performed have yielded insight in the effects of design choices and model uncertainties on system performance. More exhaustive system analyses will help in determining the directions for follow-on research by narrowing down the broad range of possible designs for hypersonic air breathing cruise missiles and by focussing on developing more detailed prediction models for subsystem aspects that influence system performance most.
