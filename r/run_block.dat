5000|$|Before the 2013 season, Jeff Deeney of Pro Football Focus (PFF) named Boone the 49ers' secret superstar for his {{performance}} in 2012. Deeney stated: [...] "Boone was a force in the running game as his +18.6 <b>run</b> <b>blocking</b> grade was best among all right guards. He also ranked second among all guards by receiving a negative grade on only 4.7% of his <b>run</b> <b>blocks.</b> Boone also held his own in the passing game as he earned a +2.1 rating during the regular season, and his 20 QB pressures allowed tied him for 17th lowest out of 50 guards who played at least 400 passing snaps." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a rookie}} in 2004, Snee started all 11 {{games in which}} he played at right guard, a job he won in {{training}} camp. Snee and the line provided enough <b>run</b> <b>blocking</b> for Barber again for him to rush for a then team record 220 yards vs. the Kansas City Chiefs. He also helped blocking against the Oakland Raiders and helped Barber rush for 203 yards, including a team-record 95-yard touchdown. His pass blocking enabled Eli Manning to pass for 3,762 yards, the 5th-highest total in franchise history. Snee also provided enough <b>run</b> <b>blocking</b> for Barber to rush for a franchise record 1,860 yards. He was then selected as a fourth alternate to the NFC Pro Bowl team.|$|R

5000|$|In 1984, Jimmy Johnson {{arrived as}} the new head coach and named him a starter as a sophomore, rushing for a team leading 906 yards on 146 carries (6.2 average) and 11 touchdowns.

50|$|A running play {{occurs when}} the quarterback hands the ball to another player, who then {{attempts}} to carry the ball past {{the line of scrimmage}} and gain yards, or the quarterback keeps the ball himself and runs beyond the line of scrimmage.

5000|$|Tight end: The Tight End ("TE") was {{traditionally}} a {{blocking position}} {{but is now}} considered a combination wide receiver/lineman. TEs normally line up on {{the line of scrimmage}} next to the tackles. They are among the most well-rounded athletes on the field as they must be strong enough to <b>run</b> <b>block</b> and pass block as well as agile enough to run pass routes and catch the football.|$|E
50|$|The quarterback {{takes the}} snap and drops back to fake a handoff to the running back. The quarterback then rapidly pulls {{the ball back}} from the faked handoff, trying to hide it from the defense. The running back {{continues}} to move upfield {{as if he has}} the ball in his hands. The offensive line starts to <b>run</b> <b>block,</b> but then quickly goes into pass protection.The receivers appear to block at first, then go into their routes.|$|E
50|$|The Ducks {{maintain}} their lead the all-time series 24-16 (.600), however, every victory earned by the Wildcats since 2007 {{has been a}} major upset of the Ducks with each win coming over an Oregon team ranked in the top ten {{at the time of the}} game (2007 #2; 2013 #10; 2014 #2). The main storyline following the game continued to be the Ducks beleaguered offensive line, allowing Mariota to be sacked five times during the game, and unable to effectively <b>run</b> <b>block</b> or fight back against a three-man pass rush.|$|E

50|$|The third game of {{the season}} was a Thursday Night game against the Carolina Panthers. Beatty started the game at LT. The {{offensive}} line blocked well in pass protection and <b>run</b> <b>blocking.</b> 4th year RB Andre Brown, in his first career start, ran for 113 yards and 2 TD's. This game was arguably Beatty's finest game as a pro to date.|$|R
50|$|Also called dive, plunge, buck, guts, slam or {{numerous}} other names. The most basic run play is a {{run up the}} middle. In this case, the ball is handed off from the quarterback to a running back. The back then aims for a predetermined hole between his offensive linemen. This hole can be either between center and guard or between guard and tackle. The offensive line will <b>run</b> <b>block,</b> pushing defenders away from the chosen hole. Often, the fullback will lead block through the hole first to clear a path for the half back or running back.|$|E
5000|$|It was a {{frustrating}} loss for Penn State, especially for quarterback Christian Hackenberg, who was constantly under pressure due to poor blocking. For his part, coach James Franklin bemoaned {{the fact that}} it is [...] "hard to call a game when you can’t consistently <b>run</b> <b>block</b> and you can’t consistently protect the quarterback." [...] Conspicuously, Geno Lewis, one of Penn State's top receivers entering the game, rarely played, an anomaly for which Franklin had little explanation. Penn State's defense was hamstrung by horrendous field position, which put them in difficult situations all night. The win for Michigan avenged their preceding month of turmoil with a strong performance from their defense, which held Penn State's offense in check.|$|E

50|$|Generally, pro-style offenses {{are more}} complex than typical college or high school offenses. They are balanced, {{requiring}} offensive lines that are adept at both pass and <b>run</b> <b>blocking,</b> quarterbacks (QBs) with good decision-making abilities, and running backs (RBs) {{who are capable of}} running between the tackles. Offenses that fall under the pro-style category include the West Coast offense, the Air Coryell offense, and the Erhardt-Perkins offensive system.|$|R
5000|$|The Cartoon Network, {{launched}} in 1992, {{was perhaps the}} fastest-growing network aimed primarily at children; thanks to extensive support from sister networks TBS and TNT, it became widely popular within five years of its launch. Originally only airing classic animation from the archives of Time Warner (which includes productions from Turner Broadcasting System, Warner Bros., MGM and Hanna-Barbera), it began airing its own original animated programming (Cartoon Cartoons) similar in format to those found on Nickelodeon beginning as early as 1995. Like Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network has {{a wide range of}} demographics ranging from preschoolers to adults. It is credited with {{a major role in the}} American Animation Renaissance in the 1990s, bringing animation back into popularity and running many different styles of animation as possible. It also brought anime into prominence in late 1990s with its Toonami action block and aired late night programming such as the Midnight <b>Run</b> <b>block,</b> ToonHeads and Space Ghost Coast to Coast; the last of these was directed squarely at, and proved to be popular with, older audiences and lead the way for the creation of its young adult late night block Adult Swim in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|The veer {{requires}} precision, execution, and smarts. The {{ability of}} the QB to identify weakness in defensive alignment is paramount, as the veer can take quick advantage of a defensive misalignment. The veer {{also can be used}} with great effect when the offensive line is a strength of the team. Over time, the ability to pass out of the Veer has also been utilized depending on the quarterback's ability to [...] "bounce" [...] into a moving pocket to make short range passes. The most effective methods of passing out of the Veer also places emphasis on the interior linemen's ability to [...] "sell" [...] the defense on a <b>run</b> <b>block</b> scheme. Short yardage or goal line offensive situations are ideal for a Veer option pass play. The receivers that are the best options for a pass play out of the Veer are the first running back through the line who runs a [...] "go" [...] route isolating the frozen safety; the slot receiver who can release quickly from a block to run a skinny [...] "go" [...] route behind the cornerback or a tight end that can release out of his interior block and find an open seam underneath the lone safety. A third component to the Veer that comes with some passing success is the ability to run trick or gadget plays to take advantage of over anxious defensive backs and over pursuing linebackers. Once the ability to pass out of the Veer has proven successful, the countering of the Veer becomes more conventional and the safeties and cornerbacks must respect the pass first before attacking the line of scrimmage.|$|E
40|$|The {{elapsed time}} for {{external}} mergesort is nor-mally dominated by I/O time. This paper {{is focused on}} reducing I/O time during the merge phase. Three new buffering and read-ahead strategies are proposed, called equal buffering, extended forecasting and clustering. They exploit the fact that virtually all mod-ern disks perform caching and sequential read-ahead. The latter two also collect information during run formation (the last key of each <b>run</b> <b>block)</b> which is then used to preplan read-ing. For random input data, extended fore-casting and clustering were found to reduce merge time by 30 % compared with traditional double buffering. Clustering exploits any tem-poral skew in input runs to further {{reduce the number of}} seeks...|$|E
5000|$|Pass {{blocking}} for {{a center}} {{is similar to}} <b>run</b> <b>blocking</b> for a center. The center will initially help guards based on {{the position of the}} defensive linemen. In the case of a blitz, the center may need to pick up a rushing linebacker, safety or corner. A good center also needs to stay vigilant during pass blocking to protect against defensive stunts and twists.|$|R
