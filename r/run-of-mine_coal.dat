The breaker was built in 1939 to replace the Maxwell Breaker which was located at the colliery. <b>Run-of-mine</b> <b>coal</b> arriving at the breaker was washed and cleaned to remove impurities, principally slate. It was crushed and screened to specific sizes desired by customers. Considered an ultra-modern plant when constructed, it used Menzies Cones to separate coal from waste. The breaker was operated by the Blue Coal Corporation, {{a subsidiary of the}} Glen Alden Coal Company. It processed 7,000 tons of Anthracite coal per day. The final product was sprayed with a blue dye and sold as “Blue Coal.” Railcars were loaded underneath the breaker and shipped to markets. The long decline of the anthracite industry after World War II caused Blue Coal to declare bankruptcy and cease operations in 1976.|$|E
40|$|Coal {{preparation}} {{is widely regarded}} as a cost effective method for reducing the amounts of potentially hazardous air pollutant precursors (HAPPs) that occur as trace elements in the <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coals.</b> Unfortunately, many existing coal preparation plants are inefficient in removing trace elements because of poor circuit design and inadequate liberation of coal and mineral matter. These problems are often difficult to correct in the absence of characterization data regarding the mineralogical association and washability of trace elements in <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coals.</b> Therefore, the first step in removing the trace elements through coal {{preparation is}} to characterize the modes of association for trace elements in a coal seam. The purpose of this project was to link the occurrence of specific trace elements to the mineralogy and washability characteristics of different eastern U. S. coal seams.

The program provided cost-shared support for research and development projects that could accelerate the commercialization of affordable, high-efficiency, low-emission, coal-fueled electric generating technologies. Clean coal technologies developed under this program would serve as prototypes for later generations of technologies to be implemented in the industrial sector.

The {{beneficiation}} of {{ultrafine coal}} by froth flotation {{is a widely}} used process, and its importance {{for the treatment of}} - 0. 1 mm coal has been appreciated of late in South African coal washing plants. A number of problems adversely affect the efficiency of this process, such as poor liberation, poor floatability, gangue entraiment/entrapment, and high mass recovery which can lead to throughput limitations in coal flotation equipment. Reverse coal flotation is a novel process which has been proposed to address three problems occurring in the conventional, "forward flotation" of coal, namely: high mass recovery, gangue entrainment and the variability of floatability of South African coals. In this process, the entire gangue fraction in the coal would. be floated in a single step process, with the clean coal product reporting as the tailings. To the author's knowledge, no_ such process has been investigated previously for coal flotation. In this thesis, a reverse flotation process for ultrafine coal beneficiation was developed from first principles. In order to obtain a clear understanding and interpretation of experimental flotation results, artificial feed mixtures consisting of blends of "pure" gangue and "pure" coal were used for a large section of the experimental testwork. Having established the technical viability of the process on these artificial mixtures, the flotation work was extended to four South African <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coals.</b> The study comprised the selection of suitable reagents for reverse flotation and the evaluation of these reagents experimentally.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Steam {{gasification}} {{has been}} extensively researched in order to optimise and efficiently utilise coal. Reactivity on powdered coal has received considerable attention, however, due to equipment limitation large coal particle research has not progressed to the same extent. The lack of knowledge regarding the steam gasification reactivity of large coal particles is the main motivation of this study. A South African Highveld seam 4 coal {{was used in this}} investigation. Conventional coal characterisation was conducted on a representative sample of the <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coal</b> sample. The results obtained for the conventional analysis are typical for what is found in literature for a South African Highveld seam 4 coal. The <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coal</b> was sieved into particle size fractions for easy hand selection of large coal particles. The single coal particles were hand selected on size and shape and afterwards a density cut (1400 – 1500 kg/m 3) was used as the final selection criterium. The particles, selected according to size, shape and density, were used for the petrographic analysis, char pore structure analysis and reactivity experiments. The petrographic analysis of the raw coal particles was conducted on 5 and 30 mm particles. Both samples are clasified as inertinite rich bitiminous, medium rank C coal. The maceral concentartion varied with particle size. The char pore structure of the 5, 10, 20 and 30 mm coal particles were also studied. It was observed that an increase in the particle size decreased the char porosity, reduced pore diameter and increased surface area (BET surface area for gas adsorption and pore area for mercury porosimetry). Steam gasification reactivity experiments using 5, 10, 20 and 30 mm coal particles at gasification temperature ranging from 775 to 900 °C were conducted. The ash produced after gasification was studied to determine the degree of fragmentation. A large degree of fragmentation was observed for the 30 mm coal particles when compared to the other (smaller) coal particles. To quantitatively determine the influence of particle size on the reactivity of coal, the validity of powdered reactivity models were tested on the reactivity results of large coal particles. Fundamental models, like the homogenous, shrinking core and random pore models, were found to fit most of the experiments, but the fitted constants lacked a chemical / physical meaning. The semi-empirical Wen model accurately predicts the experimental carbon loss and was used for modelling. The initial reactivities obtained from the Wen model were used to quantatively determine the influence of temperature and particle size on the steam gasification kinetics. The activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plots for the 5, 10, 20 and 30 mm particles are 165, 145, 150 and 143 kJ/mol, respectively. In order to determine the influence of particle size on the reactivity of coal the initial reactivity obtained from the Wen model was normalised using the 30 mm coal particle reactivity. This showed that a six fold decrease in particle size resulted in a twofold increase in steam gasification reactivity. Also, no significant difference in reactivity is observed for the 20 and 30 mm coal particles and it is proposed that the large degree of fragmentation of the 30 mm particle is responsible for this phenomenon. The increase in reactivity observed with a decrease in particle size is proposed to be a combination of different conversion mechanisms as well as a combination of several different factors (fragmentation, petrographic composition and char pore structure) which are dependent on coal particle size.

40|$|Column {{flotation}} provides excellent {{recovery of}} ultrafine coal while producing low ash content concentrates. However, column flotation is not efficient for treating fine coal containing {{significant amounts of}} mixed-phase particles. Fortunately, enhanced gravity separation has proved {{to have the ability}} to treat the mixed-phased particles more effectively. A disadvantage of gravity separation is that ultrafine clay particles are not easily rejected. Thus, a combination of these two technologies may provide a circuit that maximizes both the ash and sulfur rejection that can be achieved by physical coal cleaning while maintaining a high energy recovery. This project is studying the potential of using different combinations of gravity separators, i. e., a Floatex hydrosizer and a Falcon Concentrator, and a proven flotation column, which will be selected based on previous studies by the principle investigator. The gravity/flotation circuits will be compared based on their optimum separation performance which will consider ash and total sulfur rejection and energy recovery as well as the probable error (E{sub p}) value obtained from washability analyses.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. During Sasol-Lurgi Fixed Bed Dry Bottom coal gasification, {{the mineral}} matter in coal {{undergoes}} various transformations. Heat induced transformation due to low ash fusion temperatures leads to agglomeration of the ash particles to sizes varying from tiny particles to lumps larger than 100 mm. Channel burning and {{instability in the}} ash bed can occur as a result. It is therefore important to understand and anticipate the reactions of the mineral matter prior to feeding the coal into a gasifier. The principal aims of this thesis were to investigate the effect of minerals and mineral associations on the ash fusion temperature of coal. Ash fusion temperature {{was used as a}} measure of the expected behaviour of the ash bed during gasification. Representative samples of <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coal</b> from three sources were density separated and then comprehensively characterised. The predominant basic oxides present were identified to be Ca, Mg and Fe due to the presence of calcite, dolomite and pyrite. The results showed highest linear correlations with SiO 2 and CaO and confirmed literature that low ash fusion temperatures may be attributed to increased basic oxide levels and low SiO 2 /AI 2 O 3 ratios. The combined removal of Ca, Mg and Fe by chemical fractionation resulted in an increase in ash fusion temperature. Different combinations of minerals were removed by different leaching agents. Chemical fractionation selectively altered the mineral content of coal which in turn provided valuable information on mineral interactions. This was clearly illustrated in the models developed for the calculation of ash fusion temperature. Master...|$|E

These samples included (i) a ''reject'' material that was collected from the pyrite trap of a pulverizer at a coal-fired power plant, (ii) an ''intermediate'' product that was selectively withdrawn from the grinding chamber of a pulverizer at a power plant, and (iii) a <b>run-of-mine</b> feed <b>coal</b> from an operating coal preparation plant. Tests were conducted with these samples to investigate the effects of several key parameters (e. g., particle size, charger type, sample history, electrode coatings, etc.) on the performance of the bench-scale separator...|$|R
30|$|Bituminous coal mined by {{longwall}} methods {{has gradually}} grown from 45  % of U.S. underground coal production in 1999 (NRC 2002) to 53  % in 2012 (EIA 2013) {{of the underground}} mined coal. Most of this production uses large longwall shearers cutting moderately thick coal beds (> 2  m). The remaining underground production comes from mines with continuous miners using room-and-pillar methods and often employing the “super-section layouts” for increased productivity (Chugh 2007). The increased cutting capability of modern mining machines combined with a gradual decrease in coal seam thickness has resulted {{in an increase in}} the OSD in the <b>run-of-mine</b> (ROM) <b>coal.</b> Therefore, the amount of coal waste has increased. Most of the OSD is associated with mining of immediate roof strata. However, in the Interior Coal Basin in the Midwestern USA as much as 0.25  m of dilution actually comes from the mining of the floor due to weak floor strata below the coal seam. In most mines there exist opportunities to significantly improve mine profitability and improve coal quality through reductions in OSD. The sulfur content of bituminous US coals varies geographically. Lower sulfur coals are mined in Central and Southern Appalachia as premium metallurgical and steam generation. Interior Basin bituminous coals are generally high sulfur (~ 2  %) and are exploited for power generation. Western sub-bituminous and bituminous coals are generally lower in sulfur and used primarily for power generation.|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that the optimum separation performances achieved by multiple stage cleaning using various column flotation technologies and single stage cleaning using a Packed-Flotation Column are superior to the performance achieved by the traditional release procedure, {{especially in terms of}} pyritic sulfur rejection. This superior performance {{is believed to be the}} result of the advanced flotation mechanisms provided by column flotation technologies. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop a suitable process utilizing the advanced froth flotation mechanisms to characterize the true flotation response of a coal sample. Work in this reporting period concentrated on developing a modified coal flotation characterization procedure, termed as Advanced Flotation Washability (AFW) technique. The new apparatus used for this procedure is essentially a batch operated packed-column device equipped with a controlled wash water system. Several experiments were conducted using the AFW technique on a relatively high sulfur, - 100 mesh Illinois No. 5 <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coal</b> sample collected from a local coal preparation plant. Similar coal characterization experiments were also conducted using the traditional release and tree analysis procedures. The best performance curve generated using the AFW technique was found to be superior to the optimum curve produced by the traditional procedures. For example, at a combustible recovery of 80 %, a 19 % improvement in the reduction of the pyritic sulfur content was achieved by the AFW method while the ash reduction was also enhanced by 4 %. Several tests are on-going to solidify the AFW procedure and verify the above finding by conducting Anova analyses to evaluate the repeatability of the AFW method and the statistical significance of the difference in the performance achieved from the traditional and modified coal characterization procedures...|$|E
40|$|Coal quality plays {{a crucial}} role both {{economically}} and environmentally in the operation of a coal-fired power plant. These plants are designed to operate most efficiently when coal of consistently good quality is used as the feed. For example, the ash content should be monitored to control slagging problems in the burners. For emission control purposes the sulfur content of the feed should be carefully scrutinized. This realization of the importance of coal quality to the end-user has made the prediction of coal quality an important concern. Computerized mine planning systems can be used to help suppliers predict the quality of future coal shipments. One such system was implemented at an underground coal mine to determine its performance in an operating environment. Following some extensive revisions to the system, the results of the implementation exercise showed the ability of this mine planning system to account for coal quality while producing a workable short-range plan. To be of direct use to the end-user, the mine planning results should be adjusted to account for mining dilution and subsequent beneficiation of the <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coal.</b> To help power plant owners in predicting the quality of the power plant feed a computer program was developed to solve the blending problem faced by plants dependent on multiple sources of supply. This interactive program utilizes the predictions from the mine planning system to obtain a goal programming formulation of the blending problem. This type of problem formulation gives the program the flexibility needed to solve the blending problem in both long and short term time frames. Use of the program in both planning scenarios was illustrated by examples. The results showed the ability of the program to determine the best blend possible based on a set of user-specified objectives. Use of this interactive blending program in conjunction with the mine planning system provides the capability of computerized prediction of coal quality from mine mouth to blended plant feed. Implementation of these planning aids on a routine basis will assist the owners of coal-fired power plants in their attempts to maximize plant efficiency and maintain environmental standards...|$|E
40|$|Dense medium cyclone (DMC) is a high-tonnage {{device that}} {{is widely used}} to upgrade <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>coal</b> in the coal industry. It is known that the {{complicated}} multiphase flow in the DMC is technically difficult and expensive to experimentally investigate. In recent years, {{with the development of}} computational technology, various mathematical models based on the flow fundamentals such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and its combination with discrete element method (DEM) {{have been shown to be}} effective in overcoming this difficulty. In practice, the material properties fed in the DMC such as coal particle density and size distribution and their interaction are important variables affecting the DMC performance. Particularly, many problems frequently confronted in the operation of DMCs (e. g., vortex finder/spigot overloading, surging and system instability) are basically related to these variables. Although many studies have been done to help understand the underlying mechanisms, no systematic study has been made to examine the effects of these variables on DMC performance. In this work, the effects of particle density and size distribution and their interaction are systematically studied using a previously developed CFD-DEM model. In particular, Johnsons SB function, which is able to describe a wide range of distribution, is employed to represent the particle density and/or size distribution. The simulation results are analysed in terms of medium and particle flow patterns, particle-fluid, particle-particle and particle-wall interaction forces to elucidate the mechanisms. Based on the newly obtained CFD-DEM results in this thesis, a previously developed PC-based DMC model, which can readily run on a personal computer (PC), to predict the DMC performance as a function of a range of variables in an easy, fast and cost-effective way, is further developed and extended. Finally, the extended PC-based model is used to optimize the DMC designs for coal preparation through representative examples, in comparison with several typical designs in the industry. In addition, some new rules for DMC scale-up are proposed to meet industrial needs. It is shown that the developed PC-based model can indeed offer a cost-effective way to design, operate and optimize DMC process under different conditions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Run-of-mine</b> (ROM) <b>coal</b> {{sampling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors in determining the disposition of ROM coal for an overall emission control strategy. Determination of the amount of sample, or still better, the frequency of ROM coal sampling is thus essential to the analysis of overall emission control strategies. A simulation model of a portion of the Upper Freeport coal seam in western Pennsylvania was developed employing conditional simulation. On the simulated deposit, different mining methods were simulated to generate ROM coal data. ROM coal data was statistically analyzed to determine the sampling frequency. Two schemes were suggested: (1) the use of geostatistical techniques if there is spatial correlation in ROM coal quality, and (2) the use of classical statistics if the spatial correlation in ROM coal quality is not present. Conditions under which spatial correlation in ROM coal quality can be expected are also examined. To link the ROM coal and coals from other sources to coal stockpiles and subsequently to solve coal blending problems, where varying qualities of stockpiled coals are normally used, an interactive computer program was developed. Simple file-handling, for stockpiling problems, and multi-objective goal programming technique, for blending problems, provided their solutions. The computer program was made suitable for use on both minicomputer and microcomputer. Menu-driven and interactive capabilities give this program a high level of flexibility that is needed to analyze and solve stockpiling and blending problems at the power plant...|$|R
40|$|With {{the current}} {{challenges}} facing the Australian coal industry, a major Australian coal miner has achieved significant improvements from {{the implementation of a}} continuous mining system, a Wirtgen Surface Miner 4200 SM, at an open cut coal mine in South East Queensland. Due to the multiple thin seam characteristics of the deposit, selective mining practices are critical. This often results in decreased productivity when using Conventional Mining (CM) equipment. The Wirtgen Surface Miner (WSM) cuts, crushes and loads coal and Interburden (IB) onto a truck in a single step and thereby replaces multiple CM equipment for ripping, stacking and loading. This paper presents an in-field study, assessing the benefits gained from implementing the 4200 SM. When implementing new technology it is important to evaluate its performance compared to the existing system. The trial program was therefore structured around Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) referring to the CM system. The evaluation contains empirical assessments combined with theoretical calculations and literature research. A key challenge of the project was to compare a continuous mining system, i. e. the 4200 SM, against a discontinuous, multi-handling mining system. A commensurable evaluation of both mining systems was achieved by defining a CM-unit. Objectives of the evaluation were productivity, unit costs, Health-Safety and Environmental (HSE) performance, deposit recovery, <b>Run-Of-Mine</b> (ROM) <b>coal</b> quality and impacts on the Coal Handling and Processing Plant (CHPP). The WSM has demonstrated increased productivity, improved HSE performance, minimised loss and dilution, positive impacts on the CHPP, more consistent particle size distribution containing more target product size, as well as significant mining unit cost savings compared to the conventional dozer rip, stack and load process. On average, the mining unit costs are reduced by about 60 %, considering different rock properties in coal and IB. The fuel usage per volume mined decreases even more significantly, resulting in a reduction of carbon emissions...|$|R
40|$|Dense medium {{separation}} (DMS) {{plants are}} typically used to beneficiate <b>run-of-mine</b> (ROM) <b>coal</b> in coal metallurgy. These plants normally {{make use of}} a dense medium cyclone as the primary processing unit. Because of the deviations in the ROM quality, the production yield and quality become difficult to maintain. A control system could benefit such operations to maintain and increase product throughput and quality. There are many different methods for developing a control system in a metallurgical operation; however, what is most fundamental {{is the use of}} a mathematical model to design a controller. For this reason, a first principle dynamic mathematical model has been developed for a DMS circuit. Each unit operation is modelled individually, then integrated together to form the complete system. The developed DMS circuit dynamic model is then used to simulate the process. It is also found that most models developed for DMS operations typically make use of steady-sate analysis and that very little literature is available on dynamic models of this kind. Difficulties that arise when validating a model in metallurgical processes are insufficient measurement points or the challenges in measuring certain variables, such as physical properties (e. g. particle size) or chemical components (e. g. ash percentage). This paper also explains how the Runge-Kutta approximation can be used in simulating DMS unit processes with intermediate online measurements that may be available. This can ultimately assist in verifying the accuracy of the simulation. One of the other problems that can occur when developing models from first principles is the estimation of model parameters. Specifically when non-linear state-space relationships are developed, one must ensure that there is a unique solution for the parameters in question. A method employing parameter identifiability is also presented in this dissertation to illustrate its use. In addition the process of estimating parameters is explained and illustrated.
