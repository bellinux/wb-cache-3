40|$|International audienceRearing social animals like pigs in {{isolation}} from conspecifics can have consequences on behaviour and physiology. The aim of this experiment {{was to determine whether}} rearing conditions affect body postures. We adapted a method for quantitative evaluation of postures based on geometric morphometrics, developed in horses, for pigs and applied it in different conditions. Forty eight 75 -day old females were reared either alone in 2. 25 m 2 pens (IH, N = 24 animals and 4 groups) or in groups of four in 4. 64 m 2 pens (GH, N = 24) for two weeks. They were habituated to human handling (stroking, speaking) and marking on their backs every day, and tested individually once a day for 10 min in a corridor outside the home pen during the two subsequent weeks. We observed their behaviour and posture during the first exposure to the test (novelty), and the fourth and fifth (after habituation). On the sixth and seventh tests, a familiar stockperson was present in the corridor (human presence). Before each test, the animals were marked with seven landmarks along their length, corresponding to anatomical points and easily located. An experimenter took pictures of the animals walking along the corridor, and these pictures were transferred to tps software for analysis. GH animals were more often active in the <b>rearing</b> <b>pen</b> than IH (median (IQ) 15 % of observations [12 - 20 %] versus 2 % [0 - 13 %]; P < 0. 05). All animals except one IH initiated contact with the handler during the last sessions of handling (Fisher's exact test, ns). Principal Component Analyses revealed significant effects of rearing and testing conditions on pigs’ behaviour and posture. Novelty led to fewer vocalisations and more exploration for IH than GH animals (P < 0. 05), but there were no differences between treatments after habituation to the testing situation. The backs of IH animals were more rounded than those of GH (P < 0. 05; dimension 1 of PCA), independently of the test condition. Human presence had no effect on posture. In conclusion, the method based on geometric morphometrics that we developed to study pig posture detected variations in walking posture in pigs associated with rearing conditions. Postures might reflect affective states in pigs, as shown in other species, but further studies are needed to verify thi...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the Royal Society via the DOI in this record. Subtle {{variations}} in early rearing environment influence morphological, cognitive and behavioural processes that together impact on adult fitness. We manipulated habitat complexity experienced by young pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in their first seven weeks, adding a third accessible dimension by placing elevated perches in their <b>rearing</b> <b>pens</b> mimicking natural variation in habitat complexity. This simple manipulation provoked an interrelated suite of morphological, cognitive and behavioural changes, culminating in decreased wild mortality of birds from complex habitats compared with controls. Three mechanisms contribute to this: Pheasants reared with perches had a morphology which could enable them to fly to the higher branches and cope with prolonged roosting. They had a higher propensity to roost off the ground at night in the wild. More generally, these birds had more accurate spatial memory. Consequently, birds were at a reduced risk of terrestrial predation. The fitness consequences of variation in early rearing on behavioural development are rarely studied in the wild but we show that this is necessary because the effects can be broad ranging and not simple, depending on a complex interplay of behavioural, cognitive and morphological elements, even when effects that the treatments provoke are relatively short term and plastic.

The {{objective of this}} study was to estimate the impact of this rearing method on the performance of lambs from the Romane breed, but also their short and medium-term immune and behavioual responses. Lambs were assigned to three rearing treatments: left with the mother (one lamb per dam), or separated at 3 days of age and fed either with a commercial milk substitute or with milk from Lacaune ewes milked daily. When weaned at 45 days, the lambs of the three treatments were mixed, reared in single sex groups and fed with hay and concentrate. Lambs fed commercial milk had significantly lower growth rate before 22 days than mothered lambs, those fed Lacaune milk being intermediate. No difference was detectable later on and the final weight was similar. Artificially reared lambs, regardless of the type of milk, seemed more active in their <b>rearing</b> <b>pens</b> and less afraid of humans in tests performed at 21 days. The fleece around the perianal area of lambs fed commercial milk tended to be dirtier than in lambs fed with ewe’s milk without any increase on the presence of pathogens in the faeces.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to compare net-pen rearing methods to {{traditional}} hatchery methods of rearing upriver bright fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawvtscha). Fish were reared at several densities in net pens at three Columbia River backwater sites during 1984 - 1987, and in a barrier net at one site during 1984 - 1986; methods included both fed and unfed treatments. The purpose of this report is to summarize the results obtained from the unfed treatments and the current return of adults from all fed treatments and the barrier net. Zooplankton were the primary food item of unfed fish. Fish <b>reared</b> in net <b>pens</b> utilized insects colonizing the nets as an additional food source, whereas those reared in the barrier net did not.

At 55. 2 days of age, 52 Swiss Large White pigs were blocked by litter and assigned by BW to four experimental groups: barrows (C), immunocastrated boars (IC), entire males (EMG) <b>reared</b> in group <b>pens</b> and entire males (EMP) <b>reared</b> in individual <b>pens.</b> In experiment 1, the effects of the method of castration were investigated (experimental groups C, IC and EMG). In experiment 2, the effects of housing on entire male pigs were evaluated (experimental groups EMG and EMP). All pigs had ad libitum access to standard diets from weaning to 107 kg BW. The two vaccinations (Improvac®) were applied to the IC pigs at an average BW of 22. 6 and 73. 0 kg. In experiment 1, average daily gain (ADG) did not (P > 0. 05) differ among the experimental groups. However, EMG consumed less feed and had a better feed-conversion ratio than C (P 0. 05) differ between EMP and EMG. However, EMP pigs consumed more feed than EMG pigs and had a poorer feed efficiency (P < 0. 01 for each). In conclusion, EMG pigs had a better feed efficiency than IC pigs and their carcasses were leaner, but the risk of boar tainted pork was elevated. Group-housing negatively affected average daily feed intake but not ADG of entire males. At the moment, immunocastration offers a good approach to avoid castration and minimize the risk of boar tain...|$|R
40|$|Rearing of finfish and {{shellfish}} in cages and pens in water-based confinements is an aquaculture technique which is gaining importance world-wide for intensive exploitation of existing, especially large, fresh or brackish water and marine resources. The confined aquaculture {{systems such as}} cages, pens or enclosures consist of growing of young fry of finfish or shellfish to a large size, within netting or screening, which allows free circulation of water. Enclosure is a confined bay, where shoreline is typically closed-off by a net or a screen barrier on all but one side. The <b>rearing</b> facility in <b>pen</b> is almost man-made, the sides being covered by bamboo-matting, netting or screening. The bottom in both, enclosures and pens, however, is bound by lake bed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{response}} of adrenal glands of Single Comb White Leghorn laying hens housed under different population densities was studied. The birds were <b>reared</b> in floor <b>pens</b> {{until they were}} 19 weeks of age, after which they were housed in cages. Cage size was 30. 5 X 50. 8 cm. Three, four, or five birds were housed per cage. Corticosterone concentrations were measured in all birds 48 and 96 hr following housing in cages and weekly thereafter for 6 weeks. Corticosterone concentrations were consistently higher in the serum of birds housed five per cage than in birds housed three or four per cage. It was concluded {{that in order to}} minimize physiological stress in cage layers, more than 387 cm 2 per bird should be considered...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{possibility}} of producing Muscovy drake*Pekin duck crosses, the authors monitored the fertility of the egg obtained in natural mating for one year. A total of 16 Muscovy drakes and 40 Pekin ducks were <b>reared</b> in outdoor <b>pens</b> with two different male/female ratio, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3. The results showed significant differences between egg fertility of the two male/female ratio (1 : 2 = 72. 9 % and 1 : 3 = 58. 1 %, P< 0. 01). The egg fertility decreased with laying time (P< 0. 01). The observation of the reproductive behaviour showed a strong resistance of the Pekin duck against the repeated attempts of rape particularly in flocks with male/female ratio 1 : 3...|$|R
40|$|Sheep, <b>reared</b> worm-free in <b>pens</b> and aged 12 - 36 weeks, were {{infected}} each weekday with 2000 infective T. colubriformis larvae (L 3). Establishment was measured {{at various times}} {{during the course of}} infection and the rate of development of resistance to new infection was found to be faster in older than in younger hosts. In addition arrested development at the exsheathed L 3 stage was found to be less marked in older hosts. Sheep which had experienced natural infection on pasture up to 20 weeks of age before exposure, in pens, to the same experimental infections as their worm-free counterparts showed similar immune responses. However, at 36 weeks of age, pasture-reared sheep had acquired a high level of resistance to infection with T. colubriformis...|$|R
