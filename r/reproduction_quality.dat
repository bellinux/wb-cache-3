2500|$|Digital {{speakers}} {{have been}} the subject of experiments performed by Bell Labs as far back as the 1920s. The design is simple; each bit controls a driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate sound <b>reproduction</b> <b>quality),</b> the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent analog digital conversion problems, the effect of aliasing is unavoidable, so that the audio output is [...] "reflected" [...] at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the sampling frequency, causing an unacceptably high level of ultrasonics to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.|$|E
2500|$|Headphones {{are made}} {{in a range of}} {{different}} audio <b>reproduction</b> <b>quality</b> capabilities. [...] Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the high fidelity of expensive units designed for music listening by audiophiles. [...] Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) phone jack for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using Bluetooth connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players. [...] Due to the spread of wireless devices in recent years headphones are increasingly used by people in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit. [...] Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as audio engineers mixing sound for live concerts or sound recordings and DJs, who use headphones to cue up the next song they will play without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and call center employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.|$|E

The goals of the program include purposes specific to the five NATA performance domains.

The last days of processing were covered by The New York Times, National Geographic, and network television. Edited by Stang and fellow photographer Bill Barrett, Kodachrome: End of the Run presents a selection of four-score Kodachrome images shot on more than 100 carefully hoarded roles of the film by Webster University students, faculty, and staff over a five-month period and processed by Dwayne's in the final hours as the last processing chemicals ran out. The book includes special essays by Stang, famed Time Magazine worldwide pictures editor Arnold Drapkin, and Dwayne's Photo vice president Grant Steinle. The entire collaboration is described in detail in Stang's essay.|$|R
50|$|With the {{addition}} of electronic amplification developed by Curt Stille in the 1920s, the telegraphone evolved into wire recorders which were popular for voice recording and dictation during the 1940s and into the 1950s. The <b>reproduction</b> <b>quality</b> of wire recorders was significantly lower than that achievable with phonograph disk recording technology. There were also practical difficulties, such as the tendency of the wire to become tangled or snarled.
