25|$|In 1863, the French chemist E. Caventou {{isolated}} {{a previously}} unknown hydrocarbon from the pyrolysis of amyl alcohol. This hydrocarbon {{was identified as}} butadiene in 1886, after Henry Edward Armstrong isolated it from among the pyrolysis products of petroleum. In 1910, the Russian chemist Sergei Lebedev polymerized butadiene and obtained a material with <b>rubber-like</b> properties. This polymer was, however, found to be too soft to replace natural rubber in many applications, notably automobile tires.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{gas mask}} was {{developed}} in 1944 by the US Army Chemical Warfare Service. It was made of plastic and <b>rubber-like</b> material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I gas masks and fitted the user's face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by a filter canister screwed {{on the side of}} the gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.|$|E
25|$|Advanced players {{improve their}} {{performance}} {{through a number}} of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or <b>rubber-like</b> materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.|$|E
25|$|Insects gain kinetic energy, {{provided}} by the muscles, when they accelerate. When the wings begin to decelerate {{toward the end of}} the stroke, this energy must dissipate. During the downstroke, the kinetic energy is dissipated by the muscles themselves and is converted into heat (this heat is sometimes used to maintain core body temperature). Some insects are able to utilize the kinetic energy in the upward movement of the wings to aid in their flight. The wing joints of these insects contain a pad of elastic, <b>rubber-like</b> protein called resilin. During the upstroke of the wing, the resilin is stretched. The kinetic energy of the wing is converted into potential energy in the stretched resilin, which stores the energy much like a spring. When the wing moves down, this energy is released and aids in the downstroke.|$|E
25|$|Solidifying: Solidifiers are {{composed}} of tiny, floating, dry ice pellets, and hydrophobic polymers that both adsorb and absorb. They clean up oil spills by changing the physical state of spilled oil from liquid to a solid, semi-solid or a <b>rubber-like</b> material that floats on water. Solidifiers are insoluble in water, therefore {{the removal of the}} solidified oil is easy and the oil will not leach out. Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wild life and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Xylene, Methyl Ethyl, Acetone and Naphtha. The reaction time for solidification of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer. Some solidifier product manufactures claim the solidified oil can be thawed and used if frozen with dry ice or disposed of in landfills, recycled as an additive in asphalt or rubber products, or burned as a low ash fuel. A solidifier called C.I.Agent (manufactured by C.I.Agent Solutions of Louisville, Kentucky) is being used by BP in granular form, as well as in Marine and Sheen Booms at Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan, Alabama, to aid in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's {{welcoming}} aesthetics, and some, its visual design. Kill Screen considered the game's affect delightful and Destructoid said its bright color scheme and <b>rubber-like</b> surfaces were disarming and recalled {{the feel of}} an inflatable castle. Polygon reviewer described the title as having [...] "old-school sensibilities" [...] in its arcade-style visual design, with simple geometry and flat 2D art. He added that the game succeeds in particular because of its [...] "goofy tone" [...] and [...] "delightful wrapper" [...] of music, scrolling ticker, and fanciful announcers, which managed to charm him without appearing inauthentic. GameSpot reviewer wrote that Videoball audiovisual replication of 1990s-era Sega aesthetics triggered instant [...] "warm and fuzzy ... nostalgia". Reviewers said that the game's visuals deceptively betrayed the depth of its gameplay. Calixto of Kill Screen concluded that Videoball [...] "feels like it's trying to knock down barriers to entry" [...] in its [...] "bubbly and peaceful" [...] visual design, with gradients and 90s Japanese arcade-style music. He thought, however, that the voiceovers were somewhat campy.|$|E
2500|$|In certain cases, endodontic therapy may be {{necessary}} {{for the restoration of}} a tooth. [...] Endodontic therapy, also known as a [...] "root canal", is recommended if the pulp in a tooth dies from infection by decay-causing bacteria or from trauma. [...] In root canal therapy, the pulp of the tooth, including the nerve and vascular tissues, is removed along with decayed portions of the tooth. The canals are instrumented with endodontic files to clean and shape them, and they are then usually filled with a <b>rubber-like</b> material called gutta percha. [...] The tooth is filled and a crown can be placed. [...] Upon completion of root canal therapy, the tooth is non-vital, as it is devoid of any living tissue.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic stethoscopes require {{conversion}} of acoustic sound waves to electrical signals which {{can then be}} amplified and processed for optimal listening. Unlike acoustic stethoscopes, which are all {{based on the same}} physics, transducers in electronic stethoscopes vary widely. The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor. Another method, used in Welch-Allyn's Meditron stethoscope, comprises placement of a piezoelectric crystal {{at the head of a}} metal shaft, the bottom of the shaft making contact with a diaphragm. 3M also uses a piezo-electric crystal placed within foam behind a thick <b>rubber-like</b> diaphragm. The Thinklabs' Rhythm 32 [...] uses an Electromagnetic Diaphragm with a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive sensor. This diaphragm responds to sound waves, with changes in an electric field replacing changes in air pressure. [...] The Eko Core enables wireless transmission of heart sounds to a smartphone or tablet.|$|E
2500|$|Leading {{proponents of}} the 1960s Psychedelic Art {{movement}} were San Francisco poster artists such as: Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Stanley Mouse & Alton Kelley, and Wes Wilson. Their Psychedelic Rock concert posters were inspired by Art Nouveau, Victoriana, Dada, and Pop Art. The [...] "Fillmore Posters" [...] {{were among the most}} notable of the time. Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, <b>rubber-like</b> distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style. The style flourished from roughly the years 1966 to 1972. Their work was immediately influential to album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers. Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors, the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music. This was mixed with slide shows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form, and to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely [...] "trippy" [...] atmosphere for the audience.|$|E
60|$|The broad {{tires of}} these unique fliers are but <b>rubber-like</b> gas bags {{filled with the}} eighth Barsoomian ray, or ray of propulsion--that {{remarkable}} discovery of the Martians that has made possible the great fleets of mighty airships that render the red man of the outer world supreme. It is this ray which propels the inherent or reflected light of the planet off into space, and when confined gives to the Martian craft their airy buoyancy.|$|E
60|$|The {{immediate}} {{business was}} the systematic {{exploitation of the}} fact that Trafford had worked out the problem of synthesizing indiarubber. He had done so with an entire indifference to the commercial possibilities of the case, because he had been irritated by the enormous publicity given to Behrens' assertion that he had achieved this long-sought end. Of course the production of artificial rubbers and <b>rubber-like</b> substances {{had been one of the}} activities of the synthetic chemist for many years, from the appearance of Tilden's isoprene rubber onward, and there was already a formidable list of collaterals, dimethybutadiene, and so forth, by which the coveted goal could be approached. Behrens had boldly added to this list as his own a number of variations upon a theme of Trafford's, originally designed to settle certain curiosities about elasticity. Behrens' products were not only more massively <b>rubber-like</b> than anything that had gone before them, but also extremely cheap to produce, and his bold announcement of success had produced a check in rubber sales and widespread depression in the quiveringly sensitive market of plantation shares. Solomonson had consulted Trafford about this matter at Vevey, and had heard with infinite astonishment that Trafford had already roughly prepared and was proposing to complete and publish, unpatented and absolutely unprotected, first a smashing demonstration of the unsoundness of Behrens' claim and then a lucid exposition of just what had to be done and what could be done to make an indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from the natural product. The business man could not believe his ears.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the year}} 2000 lasers only {{produced}} lower quality in <b>rubber-like</b> materials. In these <b>rubber-like</b> materials, {{which had a}} rough structure, higher quality was impossible. Since the year 2000 fiber lasers have been introduced to give a much increased engraving quality direct into black polymeric materials. Also at the Drupa 2004 the direct engraving of polymer plates was introduced. This had also {{an effect on the}} rubber-developers who, in order to stay competitive, developed new high quality <b>rubber-like</b> materials. The development of suitable polymeric compounds has also allowed the engraving quality achievable with the fibre lasers to be realised in print. Since then direct laser engraving of flexo-printingforms is seen by many as the modern way to make printing-forms for it is the first real digital way.|$|E
