40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the association between efficacy of self-management to prevent recurrences in patients with depression, and actual episodes <b>of</b> <b>recurrence.</b> We divided 110 patients with depression into a non-recurrence group (n = 60) and a recurrence group (n = 50), and compared the two groups in regard to socio-demographic and medical variables, scores on the scale for the efficacy of self-management to prevent <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> depression, and scores on the Beck’s Depression Inventory. The factors associated with episodes <b>of</b> actual <b>recurrence</b> were tested with the logistic regression analysis, and the efficacy of self-management to prevent <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> depression was extracted as a factor independently associated with recurrence. The results suggested a statistically significant association between depression <b>recurrence</b> and efficacy <b>of</b> self-management to prevent <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> depression.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{evaluate}} a possible effect of lipid lowering drugs on <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> ventricular arrhythmias (VA) after {{implantable cardioverter defibrillator}} (ICD) implantation. BACKGROUNDIn patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), lipid lowering drugs reduce total and sudden cardiac death. Because the mechanism is not completely understood, we studied whether these drugs have a favorable influence on the occurrence of life-threatening VA in patients with CAD and ICD implants. METHODSWe conducted an observational study in 78 patients with CAD and life-threatening VA, treated with an ICD. After ICD implantation, 27 patients were on treatment with lipid lowering drugs (group I) and 51 were not (group II). Patients were studied for the following end points: <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> VA requiring ICD intervention, cardiac death and hospitalization. RESULTSAfter a mean follow-up of 490 ± 319 days, 35 patients (45 %) had <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> VA requiring ICD intervention. In multivariate analysis, the use of lipid lowering drugs (chi-square 6. 33, p = 0. 012) and poorly tolerated sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia as initial presentation (chi-square 4. 84, p = 0. 028) remained as independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> VA. Patients in groups I and II had similar baseline clinical characteristics, but patients in group I had a lower incidence <b>of</b> <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> VA (6 / 27 or 22 % vs. 29 / 51 or 57 %, p = 0. 004) and of the combined end points of cardiac death and hospitalization (4 / 27 or 15 % vs. 23 / 51 or 45 %, p = 0. 015) compared with patients in group II. CONCLUSIONSThis is the first observation {{that the use of}} lipid lowering drugs is associated with a reduction <b>of</b> <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> VA in patients with CAD and ICD implants. These data require confirmation in a prospective randomized trial...|$|R

In short, lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions. All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in pornography aimed at men.|$|E
