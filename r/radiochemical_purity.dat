Methods: The migration of the radiochemical components of 99 mTc- tetrofosmin was evaluated using various chroma-tography media with ethyl acetate as the solvent. After op-timization of the miniaturized system, <b>radiochemical</b> <b>purity</b> assessments were performed simultaneously on 23 99 mTc-tetrofosmin preparations using both recommended and min-iaturized chromatography systems. Results: A miniaturized chromatography system consisting of Whatman 1 chromatography paper with ethyl acetate was developed for the <b>radiochemical</b> <b>purity</b> assessment of 99 mTc-tetrofosmin. <b>Radiochemical</b> <b>purity</b> results for 99 mTc-tetrofosmin preparations were similar with both recom-mended and miniaturized chromatography methods, with a mean difference of 1. 5 %:!:: 1. 2 % (s. d.). Differences in radio-chemical purity results between the two chromatography systems were less than 2 % (20 of 23 evaluations) with most preparations. Conclusion: <b>Radiochemical</b> <b>purity</b> results for 99 mTc-tetro-fosmin preparations were similar with both the manufactur-er's recommended chromatography and miniaturized chro-matography systems.
