50|$|Begun in Cambridge, {{continued}} in London and completed in America, {{this is very}} similar to the previous collection in that it contains a mix of introspective and self-analytical works and shorter impressionist poems. As a result of his reading of HÃ¶lderlin, Cernuda had started to use enjambement. His increasing use of this device gave his poetry a duality <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> - <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual line and <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phrase. Since he tended not to use rhyme or even assonance, <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line tends to be swamped by that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phrase, resulting in an effect that is often close to prose.|$|R
25|$|Antiarrhythmic agents, {{also known}} as cardiac {{dysrhythmia}} medications, are a group of pharmaceuticals {{that are used to}} suppress abnormal <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart (cardiac arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, McBrain {{collaborated with}} Andrew Chapman {{on a book}} {{entitled}} Iron Maiden & Nicko McBrain's <b>Rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beast, which was published by Warner Bros.

After selling internationally for several years, the book {{was taken out of}} print. Used copies are occasionally found for sale online.|$|E
25|$|The himmela in the tenkutittu {{style is}} more {{cohesive}} {{to the entire}} production. <b>Rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chande and maddale coupled with the chakrataala and jaagate of the bhaagavatha create an excellent symphonic sound. The dance form in tenkutittu strikes {{the attention of the}} audience by 'Dheengina' or 'Guttu'. Performers often do dhiginas (jumping spins in the air) and will continuously spin (sometimes) hundreds of times. Tenkutittu is noted for its incredible dance steps; its high flying dance moves; and its extravagant rakshasas (demons).|$|E

25|$|The Roosevelt Administration {{was under}} assault during Roosevelt's second term, which {{presided over a}} new dip in the Great Depression {{in the fall of}} 1937 that {{continued}} until most of 1938. Production and profits declined sharply. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938. The downturn was perhaps due to nothing more than the familiar <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business cycle. But until 1937 Roosevelt had claimed responsibility for the excellent economic performance. That backfired in the recession and the heated political atmosphere of 1937.|$|E
25|$|A form of {{classical}} Indian music called Maharishi Gandharva Veda is purported to integrate and harmonize the cycles and <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> listener's body. Gandharva Veda is an upaveda and is codified {{in a number}} of texts that came to be known collectively at Gandharva Veda, an auxiliary text attached to Sama Veda. Mukund Lath writes that Gandharva Veda is a sacred corpus of music, derived from the still more ancient sama, a sacred Vedic form of music. Compact discs of the music are published by the Maharishi University of Management Press.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that circadian desynchronization and work overload may also impair performance. Specifically, a controlled laboratory study by Wright et al. evaluated {{the relationship between}} circadian rhythms and performance by assessing body temperature, which is regulated by the circadian mechanisms of the body. Body temperature is at its highest near the circadian peak and lowest near the circadian minimum (this is when the body is driven to sleep). It has long been recognized that a positive relationship exists between daily <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body temperature and neurobehavioral performance and alertness in humans.|$|E

It is adjacent to the Mandela Gardens, which were opened by Nelson Mandela in 2001. A number of public art features, fountains, a canal and greenery can be found here as an oasis among the city centre excitement.|$|E
25|$|Work songs {{frequently}} feature {{call and}} response structures and {{are designed to}} enable the laborers who sing them to coordinate their efforts {{in accordance with the}} <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs. They are frequently, but not invariably, composed. In the American armed forces, a lively oral tradition preserves jody calls ("Duckworth chants") which are sung while soldiers are on the march. Professional sailors made similar use of a large body of sea shanties. Love poetry, often of a tragic or regretful nature, prominently figures in many folk traditions. Nursery rhymes and nonsense verse used to amuse or quiet children also are frequent subjects of traditional songs.|$|E
25|$|The {{practices}} of Maharishi Ayur-Veda {{are said to}} be authentic, though Francis Zimmerman says that they are biased toward gentleness, avoiding violent or painful treatments that were historically part of ayurveda in early India. He also says that Maharishi Ayur-Veda involves an ideological confusion of Ayurvedic categories. In 1985, Maharishi Ayurveda doctors met with outside consultants, who suggested that some traditional Ayurvedic remedies would not be accepted by American consumers. The principal difference between Maharishi Ayur-Veda and traditional Ayurveda is the emphasis on the role of consciousness and the use of Transcendental Meditation, as well as the highlighting of the need to express positive emotions and attuning one's life to the natural <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E
40|$|A general {{description}} <b>of</b> circadian <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea-pen is given.

This idea {{may be a}} kind of metabolic theory. Some difficulties for this theory are examined, and, despite these difficulties, <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metabolic theory is again emphasized and the reasons for supporting this theory are explained. Some other considerations on <b>the</b> circadian <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea-pen are also presented and the recent literature which seems to support the metabolic theory is reviewed...|$|R

25|$|Egypt {{has long}} been a {{cultural}} focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} Morricone's {{score for}} Electric Sheep Magazine, Robert Barry expressed that the compositions {{of the film}} eschew [...] "the soaring heroic melodies and pounding horse-hoof <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leone films" [...] and that the music closely resembles Morricone's own 1970s horror film soundtracks, Florian Fricke's music for Werner Herzog's films, and modernist compositions by Luciano Berio and Pierre Boulez. He also noted that solo violins (playing fifth intervals) and flutes are used in creating Wagnerian leitmotifs to highlight Silence's conflict within the society he is placed in.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} praised the piece, {{with the author}} of a survey of American music noting that the <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waltz and ragtime {{combined}} to produce an [...] "ingenious and delightful example of such a stylistic accommodation", showing that the composer was an [...] "adventurous classicist par excellence" [...] because he was able to combine tradition and innovation in a consistently inventive way. Another critic, the arranger of Joplin's music for solo Guitar, wrote that Bethena displayed Joplin's characteristic syncopated style in a [...] "seductive" [...] manner even in the waltz's 3/4 time signature.|$|E
