40|$|When one splits spacetime {{into space}} plus time, the Weyl {{curvature}} tensor (vacuum Riemann tensor) gets {{split into two}} spatial, symmetric, and trace-free tensors: (i) the Weyl tensor’s so-called electric part or tidal field Ɛ_(jk), which raises tides on the Earth’s oceans and drives geodesic deviation (the relative acceleration of two freely falling test particles separated by a spatial vector ξ^k is Δa_j=-Ɛ_(jk) ξ^k), and (ii) the Weyl tensor’s so-called magnetic part or (as we call it) frame-drag field B_(jk), which drives differential frame dragging (the precessional angular velocity of a gyroscope {{at the tip of}} ξ^k, as measured using a local inertial frame at the tail of ξ^k, is ΔΩ_j=B_(jk) ξ^k). Being symmetric and trace-free, Ɛ_(jk) and B_(jk) each have three orthogonal eigenvector fields which can be depicted by their integral curves. We call the integral curves of Ɛ_(jk) ’s eigenvectors tidal tendex lines or simply tendex lines, we call each tendex line’s eigenvalue its tendicity, and we give the name tendex to a collection of tendex lines with large tendicity. The analogous quantities for B_(jk) are frame-drag vortex lines or simply vortex lines, their vorticities, and their vortexes. These concepts are powerful tools for visualizing spacetime curvature. We build up physical intuition into them by applying them to a variety of weak-gravity phenomena: a spinning, gravitating point particle, two such particles side-by-side, a plane gravitational wave, a point particle with a dynamical current-quadrupole moment or dynamical mass-quadrupole moment, and a slow-motion binary system made of nonspinning point particles. We show that a rotating current quadrupole has four rotating vortexes that sweep outward and backward like water streams from a <b>rotating</b> <b>sprinkler.</b> As they sweep, the vortexes acquire accompanying tendexes and thereby become outgoing current-quadrupole gravitational waves. We show similarly that a rotating mass quadrupole has four rotating, outward-and-backward sweeping tendexes that acquire accompanying vortexes as they sweep, and become outgoing mass-quadrupole gravitational waves. We show, further, that an oscillating current quadrupole ejects sequences of vortex loops that acquire accompanying tendex loops as they travel, and become current-quadrupole gravitational waves; and similarly for an oscillating mass quadrupole. And we show how a binary’s tendex lines transition, as one moves radially, from those of two static point particles in the deep near zone, to those of a single spherical body in the outer part of the near zone and inner part of the wave zone (where the binary’s mass monopole moment dominates), to those of a rotating quadrupole in the far wave zone (where the quadrupolar gravitational waves dominate). In Paper II we will use these vortex and tendex concepts to gain insight into the quasinormal modes of black holes, and in subsequent papers, by combining these concepts with numerical simulations, we will explore the nonlinear dynamics of curved spacetime around colliding black holes. We have published a brief overview of these applications in R. Owen et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 151101 (2011). We expect these vortex and tendex concepts to become powerful tools for general relativity research in a variety of topics...|$|E
40|$|Chirality is {{not just}} a {{structural}} artifact in biology but it may provide for a genuine biological advantage. This is due to the phenomenon of chiral interaction (CI) which is described here for mechanical-chiral devices. The main mechanical feature of chiral interaction is its mode of selecting one direction of rotation out of two possible and opposite ones. For example, a given chiral device such as a <b>rotating</b> water <b>sprinkler,</b> <b>rotates</b> in one direction. What does rotate in the opposite direction is the mirror of this given sprinkler. This mode of operation indicates space-time (PT) invariance which causes it to be also time-irreversible. This also causes a chiral device to become non-ergodic on microscopic level. This prevents certain chiral systems from readily reaching thermal equilibrium, and causes the system to act non-ergodically, which is crucial for living systems as well as for molecular evolution. 1 I...|$|R
50|$|Underground {{sprinklers}} function through {{means of}} basic electronic and hydraulic technology. This valve {{and all of}} the sprinklers that will be activated by this valve are known as a zone. Upon activation, the solenoid, which sits on top of the valve is magnetized lifting a small stainless steel plunger in its center. By doing this, the activated (or raised) plunger allows air to escape from the top of a rubber diaphragm located {{in the center of the}} valve. Water that has been charged and waiting on the bottom of this same diaphragm now has the higher pressure and lifts the diaphragm. This pressurized water is then allowed to escape down stream of the valve through a series of pipes, usually made of PVC (higher pressure commercial systems) or polyethylene pipe (for typically lower pressure residential systems). At the end of these pipes and flush to ground level (typically) are pre measured and spaced out sprinklers. These sprinklers can be fixed spray heads that have a set pattern and generally spray between 1.5-2m (7-15 ft.), full <b>rotating</b> <b>sprinklers</b> that can spray a broken stream of water from 6-12m (20-40 ft.), or small drip emitters that release a slow, steady drip of water on more delicate plants such as flowers and shrubs. use of indigenous materials also recommended.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study evaporation and drift losses (EDLs) with two types of sprinklers: <b>rotating</b> spray plate <b>sprinklers</b> (RSPS) and fixed spray plate sprinklers (FSPS), both installed at two different heights (1 and 2. 5 m above the ground). A field test was carried out during three seasons at an irrigated plot with a centre pivot, in Albacete (Spain). The results show that EDLs were significantly higher with the FSPS placed 2. 5 m above the ground (FSPS 2. 5) than with the RSPS placed 1 m above the ground (RSPS 1). The EDLs obtained for the FSPS 2. 5 combination were 8 % for night irrigation events and 13. 7 % for daytime irrigation events. The lowest EDL values were registered with RSPS 1, ranging from 3. 3 to 8. 2 % under night and day operation conditions, respectively. These results were obtained for an average wind speed of 1. 3 m/s at night and 3. 5 m/s during the day, and were normally below 5 m/s. <b>Rotating</b> spray plate <b>sprinklers</b> Fixed spray plate sprinklers Sprinkler irrigation Drop diameter...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the design}} of {{sprinkler}} irrigation systems is discussed generally and consideration is given to sprinkler spacing and precipitation. The subject of uniformity of water application is reviewed and relevant research work is surveyed. Overlapped distribution patterns obtained from indoor experiments on individual sprinklers are presented, analysed and examined {{in a variety of}} ways, which are then compared and criticised. Methods of measuring and describing the nonuniformity of application by irrigation systems which use <b>rotating</b> <b>sprinklers</b> are investigated. Certain methods have advantages for particular purposes but it is demonstrated that no single method is adequate for all purposes. Therefore, the question of a reliable way of determining the degree of non-uniformity to be tolerated is examined. It is concluded that a combination of measures, e. g., the Christiansen uniformity coefficient and the USDA pattern efficiency, together with a histogram, would give a reasonable description of an overlapped distribution pattern for most design purposes, but the addition of a visual presentation, which is necessary in some cases, would give a better description. Also, various measures of non-uniformity are found to correlate strongly. It is verified that offsetting sprinklers half the move distance for alternate watering is beneficial in most cases but it is found that the degree of improvement varies considerably. Further, the change in non-uniformity which results from the pressure variation along a lateral is shown to be a factor which should be considered in design. It is demonstrated how the relative disposition of substantial areas of low and high precipitation is important in relation to orchards, row crops and such conditions as local soil variations. Also, examination of visual presentations of precipitation surfaces of overlapped distribution patterns, including some derived from hypothetical geometrical profiles, reveals characteristics which open up the possibility of permitting the designer to confine attention to easily located critical regions of precipitation. A new research programme is proposed which is directed towards extending the scope and refining the work of this study, particularly in relation to critical regions of precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Chirality is {{considered}} by many scientists to be mainly a geometric concept. There exists also a physical aspect of chirality which is largely being overlooked at. Two examples of mechanical devices are introduced here that represent ``Physical Chirality''. These are a <b>rotating</b> water <b>sprinkler</b> and a variant of Crookes' radiometer. When interacting with appropriate media, they both choose only one mode of rotation out of two possible ones. Such a behavior does not obey time-reversal invariance, which is regarded to be a rule in classical mechanics. This is due to their chiral nature. Instead, they do obey a space-time (ST) law of invariance, that is, what is rotating in the opposite direction is the mirror-image of the given device. In a recent experiment of Koumura et al. they discovered a similar behavior of a molecular rotor. The possible biological significance of physical chirality is emphasized hereby, and the conclusion is that chiral molecular systems do not reach readily thermal equilibrium. In other words: ``Physical chirality does feed on negative entropy'', and therefore, it may well be of crucial value to life...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to assess the effect of soil cracks on soil moisture distribution under various sprinkler irrigation applications and to identify the optimal irrigation strategy that enhances soil moisture distribution and reduces water drainage for the upper soil layer 0 - 250 mm. The assessment was made for six irrigation events: the first two were for 10 and 46 mm water applications using a hand shift-set sprinkler system. The second set was for 43 and 19 mm water applications using the lateral move system with fixed sprayer heads and the third pair of events were for 43 and 32 mm water applications using the lateral move system with <b>rotating</b> <b>sprinklers.</b> The experiments were conducted on two adjacent fields at the University of Queensland, Gatton, Australia. Each field was divided into 2 m × 2 m grids that covered 62 sampling locations. For each event, the initial soil moisture content (SMC) was measured at each sampling location before irrigation. After irrigation, catch can readings were recorded for each sampling location. After 12 h overnight, the second set of soil moisture measurements was taken at each location. The area 1 distribution of SMC for the studied applications was quantified. An attempt was made to identify the relationship between the applied water uniformity using catch cans and the soil moisture uniformity using gravimetric water content measurements. The study also took into consideration variables that could affect the soil physical and hydrological properties including the field slope, the soil texture, the infiltration rate, the salt content and the soil organic matter content of the two fields. Since the soils were cracking clay Vertisols, further analyses were conducted on the crack dynamics, size and distribution using image analysis techniques. The research findings demonstrated that the cracks were the main contributors to water drainage below 250 mm soil depth due to the micro-run off from the crust surface to the cracks. The cracks ranged from a few millimeters to more than 40 mm in width. It was observed that the cracks which were wider than 15 mm remained open after irrigation for the specified application rates. Improving the irrigation system application uniformity did not always result in higher uniformity of the surface SMC (0 - 250 mm). The event that best enhanced soil moisture distribution and thus improved soil moisture recharging was observed after the sixth irrigation event when the field received 32 mm water application. The soil was at a relatively high initial SMC of 25 %, (which represented 43. 3 % of the plant available water range) and the sprinkler water uniformity was rather high above 87 % Christiansen coefficient of uniformity (CUc). At this SMC, the extent of soil cracking is limited. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
30|$|One {{problem is}} that {{sometimes}} {{there appears to be}} a disconnection involving the utilization of Alfvén’s frozen field approximation. The approximation is often taken to mean that field and flow are everywhere parallel, namely that both are directed together, with one being a scalar multiple of the other. This could not be less true. It is this conclusion that goes beyond what the actual approximation asserts. If both fields were everywhere parallel, then both vector fields would be identical, except for a common factor, relating the two. This is an area of mathematics that is well understood within the field of linear algebra. When such a situation arises, namely having two vector fields with a linear factor relating the two, the fields are called “isomorphic,” meaning that the two fields are “essentially the same.” Yet one of the first uses of Alfvén’s frozen field approximation by Parker (1958) illustrated the total lack of isomorphic behavior. His early theory of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strongly suggested that the IMF lies on an Archimedean spiral, while the fluid flow of the solar wind is approximately radially outwards. Within a decade, the Archimedes field geometry and the radially flowing solar wind were observed. The two fields were disparate, and did not simply bear an isomorphic relationship to each other. Parker’s use of the simple pattern of a <b>rotating</b> water <b>sprinkler</b> served to illustrate the “garden hose geometry.” Hence there is no isomorphic behavior between the vector magnetic field and flow velocity. Hence this illustrates that one has to be very careful not to misuse Alfvén’s approximation. There may be other mistakes involved, however, to this author, the common mistake people make of relating fluid motions, is lack of understanding is the difference between streamlines and streaklines.|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>rotating</b> {{spray plate}} <b>sprinklers</b> (RSPS) {{can reduce the}} water and energy {{requirements}} in pressurized irrigation systems. Installation of RSPS in continuous move irrigation machines, such as traveling trailers (nozzle booms), presents relevant advantages compared to sprinkler-gun machines. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop design criteria for continuous-move irrigation machines using the RSPS Nelson Rotator R 3000 D- 4. Water distribution by this RSPS was evaluated in an indoor facility under the following experimental conditions: 6. 1, 7. 0, and 7. 8 mm nozzle diameters; 1. 0 and 1. 5 m nozzle height above the ground; and working pressures of 100, 150, and 200 kPa. The water distribution patterns were overlapped at 3 and 4 m distances, the simulated Christiansen uniformity coefficient averaged 91. 8 %, and the simulated average precipitation rate under the different experimental conditions ranged between 23 and 57 mm·h- 1. These values are acceptable for a wide range of irrigation-machine applications.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of two types of spray <b>sprinklers</b> was performed. <b>Rotating</b> spray plate <b>sprinklers</b> (RSPSs) and fixed spray plate sprinklers (FSPSs) were evaluated individually in open field conditions. The water distribution, wind drift, and evaporation losses during the evaluations were measured under low, medium, and high wind speed conditions with three nozzle diameters and two nozzle heights above the soil surface. Individual spray sprinkler water distributions were mathematically overlapped to simulate the water distribution resulting from sprinkler machines. The water distribution of the RSPS had a conical shape, whereas the FSPS concentrated the water application in a circular crown. The uniformity coefficient of the simulated water application in sprinkler machines fitted with RSPSs or FSPSs was > 93 % in all cases. However, the RSPS could attain a higher uniformity coefficient at higher spacing along the lateral. For the nozzle diameters of 6. 7 and 7. 9 mm, the wetted width produced by the RSPS was larger {{than that of the}} FSPS. Also, the peak instantaneous precipitation rate of the RSPS was smaller than that of the FSPS.
