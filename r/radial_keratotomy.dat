25|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>keratotomy</b> is a {{refractive}} surgery procedure where the surgeon makes a spoke-like pattern of incisions into the cornea to modify its shape. This early surgical option for myopia {{has been largely}} superseded by LASIK and other similar procedures. LASIK is absolutely contraindicated in keratoconus and other corneal thinning conditions as removal of corneal stromal tissue will further damage an already thin and weak cornea. For similar reasons, <b>radial</b> <b>keratotomy</b> has also generally not been used for people with keratoconus.|$|E
25|$|LASIK is most {{similar to}} another {{surgical}} corrective procedure, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and both represent advances over <b>radial</b> <b>keratotomy</b> in the surgical treatment of refractive errors of vision. For patients with moderate to high myopia or thin corneas which cannot {{be treated with}} LASIK and PRK, the phakic intraocular lens is an alternative. As of 2011, over 11 million LASIK procedures had been performed in the United States and as of 2009 over 28 million have been performed worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s, the microkeratome and keratomileusis {{technique}} {{were developed}} in Bogotá, Colombia, by the Spanish ophthalmologist Jose Barraquer. In his clinic, he would cut thin (one hundredth of a mm thick) flaps in the cornea to alter its shape. Barraquer also investigated {{how much of the}} cornea had to be left unaltered in order to provide stable long-term results. This work was followed by that of the Russian scientist, Svyatoslav Fyodorov, who developed <b>radial</b> <b>keratotomy</b> (RK) in the 1970s and [...] designed the first posterior chamber implantable contact lenses (phakic intraocular lens) in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the most}} common cause of infections of burn {{injuries}} and of the outer ear (otitis externa), and {{is the most}} frequent colonizer of medical devices (e.g., catheters). Pseudomonas can be spread by equipment that gets contaminated and is not properly cleaned or on the hands of healthcare workers. [...] Pseudomonas can, in rare circumstances, cause community-acquired pneumonias, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonias, being one of the most common agents isolated in several studies. Pyocyanin is a virulence factor of the bacteria and has been known to cause death in C. elegans by oxidative stress. However, [...] salicylic acid can inhibit pyocyanin production. One in ten hospital-acquired infections is from Pseudomonas. Cystic fibrosis patients are also predisposed to P. aeruginosa infection of the lungs. P. aeruginosa may also be a common cause of [...] "hot-tub rash" [...] (dermatitis), caused by lack of proper, periodic attention to water quality. Since these bacteria like moist environments, such as hot tubs and swimming pools, they can cause skin rash or swimmer's ear. [...] Pseudomonas is also a common cause of postoperative infection in <b>radial</b> <b>keratotomy</b> surgery patients. The organism is also associated with the skin lesion ecthyma gangrenosum. P. aeruginosa is frequently associated with osteomyelitis involving puncture wounds of the foot, believed to result from direct inoculation with P. aeruginosa via the foam padding found in tennis shoes, with diabetic patients at a higher risk.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>keratotomy</b> (RK), {{developed}} by Russian ophtalmologist Svyatoslav Fyodorov in 1974, uses spoke-shaped incisions, always {{made with a}} diamond knife, to alter {{the shape of the}} cornea and reduce myopia or astigmatism; this technique is, in medium to high diopters, usually replaced by other refrective methods.|$|E
50|$|Caster {{earned his}} B.A. from Harvard College in 1976 and his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1980.

50|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>keratotomy</b> (RK) is a {{refractive}} {{surgical procedure}} to correct myopia (nearsightedness) {{that was developed}} in 1974, by Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a Russian ophthalmologist. Though it has been largely supplanted by newer operations, such as photorefractive keratectomy, LASIK, Epi-LASIK and the phakic intraocular lens, RK remains popular for correction of astigmatism in certain patients.|$|E
5000|$|Mini Asymmetric <b>Radial</b> <b>Keratotomy</b> - Used in eye {{surgery to}} cure {{keratoconus}} and correct astigmatism. It {{consists of a}} series of microincisions of variable depth, with a length between 1.75 and 2.25 millimeters, always made with a diamond knife, designed to cause a controlled scarring of the cornea, which changes its thickness and shape.|$|E
50|$|RK enjoyed great {{popularity}} {{during the}} 1980s, {{and was one}} of the most studied refractive surgical procedures. Its 10-year data was published as the PERK (Prospective Evaluation of <b>Radial</b> <b>Keratotomy)</b> study, which proved the onset of progressive hyperopia — often found a decade after the original surgery — is due to continued flattening of the central cornea.|$|E
50|$|Marvin Leo Kwitko, FACS, FICS, FRCS, KStJ (March 3, 1931 - August 20, 2002) was a Canadian {{ophthalmologist}} who pioneered in cataract {{surgery and}} laser eye surgery. He {{is one of}} Canada’s most distinguished ophthalmologic writers and surgeons. Kwitko was the first doctor in Canada to insert intraocular lens implants during cataract surgery (1967) and the first doctor in Canada to perform <b>radial</b> <b>keratotomy</b> surgery (1979).|$|E
5000|$|Amoils {{was also}} awarded a patent for his [...] "rotary {{epithelial}} scrubber", an improvement on the brush first developed by Ioannis Pallikaris that removes corneal epithelial cells {{in preparation for}} photorefractive keratectomy. Another development of his in 1970, was the diamond vitrectomy cutter, various instruments enabling micro-control of blade depth in <b>radial</b> <b>keratotomy,</b> {{as well as the}} oval comparator, or astigmometer, to control astigmatism after cataract surgery.|$|E
5000|$|Limbal Relaxing Incisions (LRI) are a {{refractive}} {{surgical procedure}} to correct minor astigmatism in the eye. Incisions are {{made at the}} opposite edges of the cornea, following {{the curve of the}} iris, causing a slight flattening in that direction. Because the incisions are outside of the field of view, they do not cause glare and other visual effects that result from other corneal surgeries like <b>Radial</b> <b>Keratotomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Computerized corneal {{topography}} can {{be employed}} for diagnostics. It is, in fact, one of the exams the patients have to undergo prior to the Cross-linking and the Mini Asymmetric <b>Radial</b> <b>Keratotomy</b> (M.A.R.K.). For example, the KISA% index (keratometry, I-S, skew percentage, astigmatism) is used {{to arrive at a}} diagnosis of keratoconus, to screen the suspect keratoconic patients and analyse the degree of corneal steepness changes in healthy relatives.|$|E
50|$|In 1974 a {{refractive}} procedure called <b>Radial</b> <b>Keratotomy</b> (RK) {{was developed}} in the USSR by Svyatoslav Fyodorov and later introduced to the USA. RK involves making a number of cuts in the cornea to change its shape and correct refractive errors. The incisions are made with a diamond knife. Following the introduction of RK, doctors routinely corrected nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism using various applications of incisions on the cornea.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, Rangaswamy Srinivasan, at the IBM Research laboratory, {{discovered}} that an ultraviolet excimer laser could etch living tissue, with precision {{and with no}} thermal damage to the surrounding area. He named the phenomenon [...] "ablative photo-decomposition" [...] (APD).Five years later, in 1985, Steven Trokel at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University in New York City, published his work using the excimer laser in <b>radial</b> <b>keratotomy.</b> He wrote, ...|$|E
5000|$|Mini Asymmetric <b>Radial</b> <b>Keratotomy</b> (MARK), {{developed}} by Italian ophtalmologist Marco Abbondanza in 1993 and improved in 2005. It {{consists of a}} series of microincisions, always made with a diamond knife, designed to cause a controlled cicatrisation of the cornea, which changes its thickness and shape. This procedure, if done properly, is able to cure the astigmatism and the first and second stage of the keratoconus, avoiding the cornea transplant.|$|E
50|$|Later, Mehta's focus {{shifted to}} Refractive surgery and did {{pioneering}} work on <b>Radial</b> <b>Keratotomy</b> and Excimer surgery. He wrote a book, <b>Radial</b> <b>Keratotomy</b> Principle & Practice, in 1990 {{which is a}} reference text on the subject. When Optikon, an Italian manufacturer of ophthalmological equipment, toured India with a Phacoemulsification machine for promotional purposes, Mehta bought the equipment from them and visited USA to receive training on phacoemulsification under William F. Maloney in 1988. His researches with the equipment resulted {{in the development of}} new techniques including vertical lens rotation, a tangential chop technique, and lens coring. In 2000, he founded Mehta International Eye Institute, attached to the Colaba Eye Hospital, for advanced research on ophthalmology, which has since been awarded the Big Brand Research Service Excellence Award for the Best Eye Hospital in Mumbai in 2011. He also established Netra Rukshak Rural Eye Hospital, a charity hospital in Karjat, a small village with tribal people as majority population. Besides the text book on Keratotomy, he is also the co-author of The Art of Phacoemulsification, a descriptive text and reference manual on phacoemulsification.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s he {{developed}} the surgical technique he is most famous for, the <b>radial</b> <b>keratotomy,</b> to change {{the shape of the}} cornea and cure myopia. In 1986, Fyodorov designed the first posterior chamber phakic IOL in the [...] "collar-button" [...] or [...] "mushroom" [...] configuration and manufactured the pIOL from silicone. In 1980 he became the head of the Moscow Research Institute of Eye Microsurgery. In 1988 he founded the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex.|$|E
