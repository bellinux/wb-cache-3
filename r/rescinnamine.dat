Rauwolfia serpentina also makes MIAs with therapeutic potential, such as reserpine and <b>rescinnamine</b> which have antihypertensive properties and also show promise in treating drug-resistant cancers. Reserpine and <b>rescinnamine</b> are structurally very similar, and they differ only in the length of their acyl side chain groups, with reserpine having a trimethoxybenzoyl moiety (C 1 -C 6) and <b>rescinnamine</b> having a trimethoxycinnamoyl moiety (C 3 -C 6) esterified to the alkaloid backbone. The esterification of these trimethoxy acyl groups to the alkaloid backbone is likely catalyzed by an acyltransferase enzyme. The formation of trimethoxy derivatives will require methyltransferase activity acting on the para- position of these hydroxycinnamics and/or hydroxybenzenoids before their assembly. This study describes the cloning and characterization of a novel methyltransferase (RsOMT 1) from R. serpentina roots which methylates both caffeic acid and sinapic acid at the para position to form isoferulic acid and trimethoxycinnamic acid respectively, suggesting it {{may be involved in}} the biosynthesis of trimethoxy derivatives.

40|$|Lipase inhibitors have {{generated}} a great interest {{because they could}} help in the prevention or the therapy of lipase-related diseases. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} work was to evaluate by HPLC, and using Candida rugosa lipase as model, the inhibitory effect of several saponins: beta-aescin, digitonin, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and Quillaja saponin (QS); flavonoids: 3 -hydroxyflavone, 5 -hydroxyflavone, (+) -catechin and kaempferol; and alkaloids: aspidospermine, papaverine, physostigmine, pilocarpine, raubasine, <b>rescinnamine,</b> reserpine and trigonelline. The inhibition produced by most of these compounds is described here for the first time. Saponins appeared very active, being beta-aescin and digitonin the most active compounds (IC 50 = 0. 8 - 2. 4 x 10 (- 5) M). The inhibitory activity of flavonoids was lower than that of saponins (except GA), and (+) -catechin and kaempferol were the most active. Alkaloids was the most heterogeneous group assayed, varying from <b>rescinnamine,</b> with an IC 16 similar to that of digitonin, to papaverine and others which showed almost no inhibition. In conclusion, beta-aescin, digitonin, kaempferol or (+) -catechin, strong lipase inhibitors with a low toxicity and present herbal drugs used for lipase-related diseases such as acne or ulcer, are promising candidates for the prevention or the treatment of these diseases.

Gastric haemorrhage was also produced within 6 hours when 5 -hydroxytryptamine (10 mg. /kg.) was injected every half-hour. Neither reserpine nor 5 -hydroxytryptamine produced gastric haemorrhage in mice which had been vagotomized by tying the oesophagus at the cardio-oesophageal junction or which had been pre-treated with iproniazid. Amphetamine was less effective than iproniazid in preventing gastric haemorrhage after reserpine, and the following drugs were ineffective: cocaine, methyl phenidate (Ritalin), amarin, caffeine, nikethamide, lysergic acid diethylamide and its 2 -bromo derivative (BOL 148). Gastric haemorrhage was not observed in mice which had been given substantial doses of atropine or of hexamethonium before reserpine.

Cholinesterase inhibitory assay and molecular docking were performed to get insight of the inhibitory activity and molecular interactions of the compounds. The compounds showed good to moderate cholinesterase inhibitory activity with IC 50 values in the range of 8. 06 to 73. 23 µM. Compound 7 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Compounds 1, 2, 5 and 6 were found to be selective towards BChE, while compounds 3, 4 and 7 were dual inhibitors, having almost equal inhibitory activity on both AChE and BChE. Molecular docking revealed that compounds 6 and 7 interacted differently on AChE and BChE, by means of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. In AChE, the indole moiety of both compounds interacted with the residues lining the peripheral anionic site, whereas in BChE, their methoxy groups are primarily responsible for the strong inhibitory activity via interactions with residues at the active site of the enzyme.

Author Summary With only one effective drug, praziquantel, currently used to treat most worldwide cases of schistosomiasis, there exists a pressing need to identify alternative anthelmintics before the development of praziquantel-resistant schistosomes removes our ability to combat this neglected tropical disease. At present, the most widely adopted methodology used to identify promising new anti-schistosome compounds relies on time consuming and subjective microscopic examination of parasite viability in response to in vitro schistosome/compound co-culturing. In our continued effort to identify novel drug and vaccine targets, we detail a dual-fluorescence bioassay that can objectively be used for assessing Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula viability in a medium or high- throughput manner to suit either academic or industrial settings. The described methodology replaces subjectivity with sensitivity and provides an enabling technology useful for rapid in vitro screens of both natural and synthetic compound libraries. It is expected that results obtained from these quantifiable in vitro screens would prioritize the most effective anti-schistosomal compounds for follow-up in vivo experimentation. This highly-adaptable dual-fluorescence bioassay could be integrated with other methods for measuring schistosome phenotype and, together, be used to greatly accelerate our search for novel anthelmintics. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{constituents of}} Ochrosia oppositifolia, Rauvolfia reflexa (Apocynacea) and Actinodaphne machrophylla (Lauracea) have been studied. The compounds were {{extracted from the}} bark and leaves of the plants using n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol as solvents. The crudes were subjected to extensive chromatographic techniques such as column chromatography (CC), preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Structural elucidation was established through several spectroscopic methods, such as 1 D-NMR (1 H, 13 C, DEPT, NOE), 2 D-NMR (COSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC), UV, IR, and MS (GCMS, LCMS and HREIMS) and comparison with the published data. In this study, a total of twenty eight known and new compounds were isolated. Three known indole alkaloids namely isoreserpiline (120), neisosposinine (121) and reserpinine (122) were isolated from the bark of Ochrosia oppositifolia. Ten indole alkaloids and one β- carboline alkaloid {{were obtained from the}} bark of Rauvolfia reflexa, these are rauvolfine B (123), rauvolfine C (124) vinorine (125), <b>rescinnamine</b> (126), cantleyine (127), akuammilan- 17 -oic acid, 1, 2 -dihydro- 3 -hydroxy- 1 -methyl-, methyl ester (128), undulifoline (129), macusine B (130), isoreserpiline (120), akuammilan- 17 -oic acid, 12 -hydroxy-, methyl ester (131) among these rauvolfine B (123) and rauvolfine C (124) appeared to be new. In addition, six known phenolic compounds and one new β- carboline alkaloid were isolated from the leaves of Rauvolfia reflexa namely 17 -methoxy-carbonyl- 14 - heptadecaenyl- 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy cinnamate (132), 3 -methyl- 10, 11 -dimethoxyl- 6 -methoxycarbonyl- β- carboline (133), (E) -methyl 3 -(4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxyphenyl) acrylate (134), 1, 2, 3, 4 - tetrahydro - 1 - oxo-β- carboline (135), 3 -hydroxy-β-carboline (136), (E) - 3 -(3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyphenyl) acrylic acid (137) and benzenepropanoic acid, 3 - methoxy ii (138). 17 -methoxy-carbonyl- 14 - heptadecaenyl- 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy cinnamate (132), and 3 - methyl- 10, 11 -dimethoxyl- 6 - methoxycarbonyl- β- carboline (133) were the new compounds isolated from the leaves of Rauvolfia reflexa. The bark of Actinodaphne machrophylla has afforded eight known isoquinoline alkaloids, cycleanine (139), (-) - 10 -demethylxylopinine (140), reticuline (141), (+) - laurotetanine (142), (+) - bicuculine (143), (-) α- hydrastine (144), (+) - parafumine (145) and (+) - anolobine (146). Six samples from the bark and leaves of ochrosia oppositifolia including three crude extracts and three indole alkaloids and eight isoquinoline alkaloids from the bark of Actinodaphne machrophylla have been tested for their in-vitro inhibitory activity against P. falciparum 3 D 7. Among the crude extracts of Ochrosia oppositifolia dichloromethane crude extract of bark showed the most potent inhibitory activity, with the IC 50 value of 0. 05051 μg/mL, the other crude extracts and compounds showed weak or no inhibitory activity against P. falsiparum as compare as standard which is chloroquine. Three indole alkaloids isolated from the bark of Ochrosia oppositifolia and eight isoquinoline alkaloids isolated from the bark of Actinodaphne machrophylla showed moderate in vitro antiplasmodial activities against Plasmodium falciparum 3 D 7 with the IC 50 of 0. 29 μM, 0. 75 μM and 1. 13 μM for isoreserpiline (120), neisosposinine (121), reserpinine (122) and 0. 08 μM, 1. 18 μM, 3. 11 μM, 0. 65 μM, 0. 26 μM, 3. 99 μM and 1. 38 μM for cycleanine (139), (-) - 10 -Demethylxylopinine (140), reticuline (141), (+) - laurotetanine (142), (+) – bicuculine (143), (-) - a- hydrastine (144), (+) - parfumine (145) and (+) - anolobine (146) respectively which are comparible with standard chloroquine. Antialzheimer activity of crude extracts and pure compounds isolated from the leaves and the bark of Rauvolfia reflexa was carried out. The dichloromethane and ethanol crude iii extracts of the leaves and methanol crude extract of the bark exhibited good inhibitory activity against both enzymes, while the methanol crude extract of the leaves showed moderate inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Cytotoxic effects of rauvolfine B (123), macusine B (130) and isoreserpiline (120) against different cancer and normal cell lines were determined. At the tested concentrations (1. 5 – 250 μM), macusine B (130) and isoreserpiline (120) did not effectively suppress the cell proliferations of cancer cells. Rauvolfine B (123) revealed moderate cytotoxic effects against two breast cancer cells (MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231) and colon cancer cells (HT- 29). However, test on colon cancer cells (HCT- 116), rauvolfine B (123) elicited the strongest cytotoxic effect with IC 50 value of 46. 86, 39. 93 and 33. 38 μM after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment respectively. Rauvolfine B (123) was selected for further study on the possible mechanism as it shown potential activity activity against HCT- 116 cell line. Morphological changes in the treated HCT- 116 cells with rauvolfine B (123) were observed under fluorescent microscope.
