50|$|Coaxial rotors {{solve the}} problem of main <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> by turning each set of rotors in {{opposite}} directions. The opposite torques from the rotors cancel each other out. Rotational maneuvering, yaw control, is accomplished by increasing the collective pitch of one rotor and decreasing the collective pitch on the other. This causes a controlled dissymmetry of torque.|$|E

50|$|The Cierva W.9 was a British 1940s {{experimental}} helicopter with a three-blade tilting-hub controlled main <b>rotor,</b> and <b>torque</b> compensation achieved using a jet of air {{discharged from the}} rear port side of the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|Most {{helicopters}} have {{a single}} main <b>rotor,</b> but <b>torque</b> created as the engine turns the rotor causes {{the body of the}} helicopter to turn in the opposite direction to the rotor (by conservation of angular momentum). To eliminate this effect, some sort of anti-torque control must be used.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{feasibility}} study {{for a new}} type ofbearingless motor is carried out by FEM analyses. The feature of the proposed bearingless motor is using a rotor with rectifier circuit coils. The optimum geometrical dimensions of the proposed bearingless motor are determined by comparing the <b>rotor</b> <b>torques</b> at various <b>rotor</b> tooth lengths. The dimension with which the motor has relatively minimum fluctuation and sufficient torque is chosen to build a test machine. In order to realize the radial forces control, a control currents arrangement is proposed. Finite Element Method (FEM) analyses are also used for evaluating {{the property of the}} proposed arrangement. The feasibility of the proposed bearingless motor has been verified by the analysis results. Key Words: Bearingless motor, Rectifier circuit coil, FEM analysis. 1...|$|R
50|$|The rotor {{is modeled}} as an {{infinitely}} thin disc, inducing a constant velocity along {{the axis of}} rotation. The basic state of a helicopter is hovering. This disc creates a flow around the rotor. Under certain mathematical premises of the fluid, there can be extracted a mathematical connection between power, radius of the <b>rotor,</b> <b>torque</b> and induced velocity. Friction is not included.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{problems}} with any single set of rotor blades is the torque (rotational force) exerted on the helicopter fuselage in the direction opposite to the rotor blades. This torque causes the fuselage to rotate in the direction opposite to the rotor blades. In single rotor helicopters, the antitorque rotor or tail rotor counteracts the main <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> and controls the fuselage rotation.|$|E
50|$|Changes on the CH-53E {{also include}} a {{stronger}} transmission and a fuselage stretched 6 ft. The main rotor blades were changed to a titanium-fiberglass composite. The tail configuration was also changed. The low-mounted symmetrical horizontal tail {{was replaced by a}} larger vertical tail and the tail rotor tilted from the vertical to provide some lift in hover while counteracting the main <b>rotor</b> <b>torque.</b> Also added was a new automatic flight control system. The digital flight control system prevented the pilot from overstressing the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The 1750 Norelfe {{was based}} on the Matra Cantinieau MC.101A, an earlier {{helicopter}} designed by Jean Cantinieau. It had a single main <b>rotor,</b> with <b>torque</b> control through a movable duct {{at the end of the}} tailboom. Powered by a Turbomeca Artouste turboshaft, the first of two Norelfes flew on 28 December 1954.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to two {{three-phase}} asynchronous motors system {{running by}} connectionless-mode, and considering {{the system to}} be required to run in strict synchronous way under different load, the method of field-oriented vector control is used. Thus, the control loops of <b>rotor</b> flux, <b>torque</b> and <b>rotor</b> speed are constructed to make two-motor system run synchronously by torque distribution. The simulation results illustrate its effectiveness and good dynamic and static performance...|$|R
50|$|The first {{practical}} helicopters {{were developed}} during World War II, {{and many more}} designs appeared in the following years. For general use, the configuration developed in the USA by Igor Sikorsky quickly came to dominate. Control was achieved by an articulated rotor head with cyclic and collective pitch controls, while <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> was counteracted by a sideways-facing tail rotor. Helicopters entered widespread use in many diverse roles including air observation, search and rescue, medical evacuation, fire fighting, construction and general transport to otherwise inaccessible locations such as mountain sides and oil rigs.|$|E
50|$|A blocked rotor test is {{conducted}} on an induction motor. It {{is also known}} as short circuit test, locked rotor test or stalled torque test. From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The blocked <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> test is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked rotor current test is conducted on squirrel cage rotor motors.|$|E
50|$|McDonnell Douglas {{developed}} the NOTAR (NO TAil Rotor) system, which eliminates having any rotating parts {{out in the}} open. The NOTAR system uses a variable pitch ducted fan driven by the helicopter's powerplant, but the ducted fan is mounted inside the fuselage ahead of the tail boom, and the exhaust passes through the tail boom to the end, where it is expelled out one side. This creates a boundary layer which causes the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tail boom according to the Coandă effect. This creates a force which cancels out the main <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> and provides directional control. The advantages of the system {{are similar to the}} Fenestron system discussed above.|$|E
2500|$|Most CMGs hold {{rotor speed}} {{constant}} using relatively small motors to offset changes due to dynamic coupling and non-conservative effects. [...] Some academic {{research has focused}} on the possibility of increasing and decreasing rotor speed while the CMG gimbals. [...] Variable-speed CMGs (VSCMGs) offer few practical advantages when considering actuation capability because the output <b>torque</b> from the <b>rotor</b> is typically much smaller than that caused by the gimbal motion. The primary practical benefit of the VSCMG when compared to the conventional CMG is an additional degree of freedom—afforded by the available rotor torque—which can be exploited for continuous CMG singularity avoidance and VSCMG cluster reorientation. Research has shown that the <b>rotor</b> <b>torques</b> required for these two purposes are very small and within the capability of conventional CMG rotor motors. Thus, the practical benefits of VSCMGs are readily available using conventional CMGs with alterations to CMG cluster steering and CMG rotor motor control laws. The VSCMG also {{can be used as a}} mechanical battery to store electric energy as kinetic energy of the flywheels.|$|R
25|$|The Saunders-Roe Skeeter {{is a light}} all-metal, two-seat {{single-rotor}} helicopter, {{complete with}} a tail <b>rotor</b> for <b>torque</b> compensation and yaw control. It was intended to perform as an all-purpose rotorcraft, primarily being used for light civil {{work as well as}} aerial observation and training missions in military service. The handling characteristics were broadly similar to comparably-sized rotorcraft of the era, while possessing the necessary simplicity, robustness, and reliability that commonly typified trainer aircraft.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{analysis}} of a two-dimensional two [...] bucket Savonius rotor, using ANSYS Fluent solver, is presented. Computational methods of fluid dynamics are used to estimate the aerodynamic forces acting on the <b>rotor,</b> the <b>torque</b> and the power extracted by the Savonius rotor. In addition, an {{analysis of}} the results for different turbulence models is performed. Numerical investigations are compared with the experiment of the Sandia National Laboratories...|$|R
5000|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} was conical, tapering to the tail. Instead of a side-mounted anti-torque tail rotor the Nord used a system patented by its designer where an axially driven pusher propeller, rotating within a circular shroud, forced air through four rotatable, vertical airfoils {{mounted on the}} shroud trailing edge. The shroud was intended to protect the propeller from the rotor downwash, to guard the propeller from objects {{on the ground and}} protect ground staff from the propeller. Air deflected from the blades balanced <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> automatically, using information from an hydraulic torque sensor, and also controlled yaw. [...] Two horizontal surfaces controlled fore and aft motion (pitch). In addition the propeller provided thrust for forward propulsion.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a stator}} pole is energized, the <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> {{is in the}} {{direction}} that will reduce reluctance. Thus the nearest rotor pole is pulled from the unaligned position into alignment with the stator field (a position of less reluctance). (This is the same effect used by a solenoid, or when picking up ferromagnetic metal with a magnet.) In order to sustain rotation, the stator field must rotate {{in advance of the}} rotor poles, thus constantly [...] "pulling" [...] the rotor along. Some motor variants will run on 3-phase AC power (see the synchronous reluctance variant below). Most modern designs are of the switched reluctance type, because electronic commutation gives significant control advantages for motor starting, speed control, and smooth operation (low torque ripple).|$|E
50|$|Bruno Nagler began {{wind tunnel}} {{experiments}} into helicopter design in 1926 and developed the first practical swash plate.The Nagler NH-120 {{was developed to}} test the idea of counteracting <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> with a small separate rotor. The engine was mounted above the main rotor on a shaft, and the anti-torque rotor was mounted above both. The NH-160 had a conventional helicopter engine and rotor layout, {{with the exception of}} the smaller anti-torque rotor mounted under the fuselage between the landing skids. Yaw control on both was effected through changing the difference in rotational speed between the two rotors, using a series of disc brakes. A small tail surface provided directional stability in forward flight. The smaller rotor would spin at a higher rpm, with about 60 percent of the load,. the main rotor being adjustable for lift control.|$|E

40|$|It is {{possible}} to design cylindrical helical gearing profiles such that an externally lobed inner gear rotates inside an internally lobed outer gear while maintaining continuous lines of contact between the gears. The continuous contact between {{the inner and outer}} rotors (analogous to the main and gate rotors in a conventional screw machine) creates a series of separate working chambers. In this type of machine the rotors have parallel axes of rotation, and if both rotors are free to rotate about their own axes, these axes can be fixed in space. The use of ported end plates is proposed to control the period during which fluid is allowed to enter or leave the working chambers of the internally geared screw machine. As with conventional screw machines, these internally geared rotors can then be used to achieve compression or expansion of a trapped mass of fluid, and the machine geometry can be designed in order to optimise performance for particular applications. This paper describes the geometrical analysis of some simple rotor profiles and explores the effect on <b>rotor</b> <b>torques</b> for particular applications of this novel screw configuration...|$|R
50|$|Anton Flettner was {{an early}} rotary-wing pioneer in Germany, he {{developed}} a torqueless rotor by powering it with small engines fixed directly to the blades driving propellers. this arrangement drove the <b>rotor</b> without transmitting <b>torque</b> (other than bearing friction) to the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The Martin Jetpack {{is a small}} VTOL {{device with}} two ducted fans that provide lift and a 2.0-litre V4 piston 200-horsepower {{gasoline}} engine. Although its pilot straps onto it and does not sit, the device cannot be classed as a backpack device because it is too large to be worn while walking. Although the Martin Jetpack {{does not meet the}} Federal Aviation Administration's classification of an ultralight aircraft: it meets weight and fuel restrictions, but it cannot meet the power-off stall speed requirement. The intention is to create a specific classification for the jetpack - it uses the same petrol used in cars, is relatively easy to fly, and is cheaper to maintain and operate than other ultralight aircraft. Most helicopters require a tail rotor to counteract the <b>rotor</b> <b>torque,</b> which, along with the articulated head complicate flying, construction, and maintenance enormously. The Martin Jetpack is designed to be torque neutral - it has no tail rotor, no collective, no articulating or foot pedals - and this design simplifies flying dramatically. Pitch, roll and yaw are controlled by one hand, height by the other.|$|E
5000|$|By early 1924, Savonius had {{developed}} a rotor with a cylinder open to the airflow. The two oppositely arranged vanes in this cylinder produced a high <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> {{that could be used}} directly for energy production. It is not known whether he succeeded in propelling a ship primarily through the Magnus effect, as originally intended. But a short biography of Savonius has suggested that such an application could well be possible, provided that a technical solution is found to convert the rotational motion of the cylinders into thrust. This suggests a successful outcome for his research into the rotor as a suitable mechanism for ship propulsion. Savonius-like rotor kites demonstrate that the operating principle is useful and that in principle the rotor makes the Magnus effect available.This invention for the use of wind energy was patented in Finland in 1926 and later in many other countries. The name [...] "Savonius-Rotor", under which the invention is still known today, was bestowed by the German patent authorities. In the same year that the Finnish patent was granted, Savonius published his book The wing-rotor in theory and practice.|$|E
5000|$|Fairey Aviation was {{one such}} {{company that was}} {{intrigued}} by the potential of rotary-wing aircraft, and proceeded to develop the Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne in accordance with Specification E.16/47. The Gyrodyne was a unique aircraft {{in its own right}} that defined a third type of rotorcraft, including autogyro and helicopter. Having little in common with the later Rotodyne, it was characterised by its inventor, Dr. J.A.J. Bennett, formerly Chief Technical Officer of the pre-Second World War Cierva Autogiro Company as an intermediate aircraft designed to combine the safety and simplicity of the autogyro with hovering performance. Its rotor was driven in all phases of flight with collective pitch being an automatic function of shaft torque, with a side-mounted propeller providing both thrust for forward flight and <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> correction. On 28 June 1948, the FB-1 proved its potential during test flights when it achieved a world airspeed record, having attaining a recorded speed of 124.3 mph [...] The programme was not trouble-free however, a fatal accident involving one of the prototypes occurring in April 1949 due to poor machining of a rotor blade flapping link retaining nut. The second FB-1 was modified to investigate a tip-jet driven rotor with propulsion provided by propellers mounted at the tip of each stub wing, being renamed the Jet Gyrodyne.|$|E
25|$|A {{dynamically}} tuned gyroscope (DTG) is a rotor {{suspended by}} a universal joint with flexure pivots. The flexure spring stiffness {{is independent of}} spin rate. However, the dynamic inertia (from the gyroscopic reaction effect) from the gimbal provides negative spring stiffness proportional to {{the square of the}} spin speed (Howe and Savet, 1964; Lawrence, 1998). Therefore, at a particular speed, called the tuning speed, the two moments cancel each other, freeing the <b>rotor</b> from <b>torque,</b> a necessary condition for an ideal gyroscope.|$|R

Design concept also applied to couple two airplane engines to set of propellers in such way both propellers turn as long as at least one engine operates...|$|R
40|$|Grid voltage swell {{will cause}} {{transient}} DC flux {{component in the}} doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) stator windings, creating serious stator and <b>rotor</b> current and <b>torque</b> oscillation, which is more serious than influence of the voltage dip. It is found that virtual resistance manages effectively to suppress <b>rotor</b> current and <b>torque</b> oscillation, avoid the operation of crowbar circuit, and enhance its high voltage ride through technology capability. In order to acquire the best virtual resistance value, the excellent particle library (EPL) of dynamic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed. It takes the rotor voltage and rotor current as two objectives, which has a fast convergence performance and high accuracy. Simulation and experimental results verify {{the effectiveness of the}} virtual resistance control strategy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, an {{electromechanical}} integrating toroidal {{drive is}} proposed and its operating principle is introduced. The equations of electromechanical coupled {{force and the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> for the drive are given by means of electromagnetic theory and mechanical principle. The influenced factors of the <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> are analysed and their influences are obtained. There are periodic changes in the <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> and the change mainly depends on the tooth number of planet. The changes of the <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> along with mechanical and electric parameters of the drive and the limit-driving torque of the drive are presented. The limit driving torque is influenced by rotating angle of the planet and other factors. The minimum limit value decides the load-carrying ability of the drive. The equal-limit torque conditions between planet–worm and planet–stator are discussed. In order to obtain the equal-limit torque, a deterministic relation should be met among the current of the worm, the magnetic induction intensity of the permanent magnet stator, and the airgap thickness...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the steady-state model, performance, and stability {{analysis of a}} mixed pole machine with a new operational mode which provides a <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> and an n -phase rotor electrical output power to a shaft-mounted rotating electrical load. The machine operated under this mode {{can be used in}} applications that require contactless power, such as in robotics, or applications that require independent control of both <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> and rotor electric power, such as for contactless rotational antennas and turret systems. The performance assessment includes electromagnetic torque, electrical efficiency, mechanical efficiency, and total efficiency based on both simulation and experimentation. The effect of electrical loading and stator voltage on both <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> and rotor electric power is also considered. The machine steady-state stability is introduced by plotting the machine operating characteristics that determine all stable operating regions of the machine under the proposed mode of operation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} a closed loop current control drive system which provides independent control of <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> and rotor current in a salient-pole synchronous machine. The machine is modeled using a d-q equivalent circuit in the rotor reference frame. The analysis shows that if the rotor current and its derivative are continuous functions, it is possible to derive equations for both the d and q axis stator currents that control the electric power transferred to a resistive load mounted on the rotor and independently control the <b>rotor</b> <b>torque.</b> The drive system is affected by factors included in the derived d-q axis stator currents. The effect of these factors, namely, d-q axis inductance, command rotor current, and flux perturbation frequency is investigated using both simulation and experimentation. Further, the effect of increasing interpolar cut-out on both <b>rotor</b> <b>torque</b> and rotor electric power is investigated. The technique eliminates the need for slip rings. The machine would find such uses as in rotational antenna and turret systems, or other situations where power is required for an electric load mounted on a rotating assembly...|$|E
40|$|Floating {{reference}} frames {{were investigated}} {{in order to}} allow first order vibration analysis in the presence of large system rotations. When the deformations of an elastic continuum are expanded in terms of the free-free modes of an unconstrained system, the rigid body modes are found to be fixed relative to the Tisserand frame, with respect to which the relative momentum is zero. The proof presented for this is based on the orthogonality condition for modes with distinct natural frequencies. This result also guarantees the independence of coordinates for all modes with nonzero natural frequencies. A Modified Tisserand Constraint is introduced in order to define a floating reference frame with similar properties for an elastic body which contains a spinning rotor. Finite element equations of motion are derived for a completely flexible spacecraft with momentum exchange controllers, using a Modified Tisserand Frame. The deformable systems covered in this application are assumed to undergo only small rotations, and therefore the <b>rotor</b> <b>torques</b> must formally be small, although in engineering applications {{it may be possible to}} relax this constraint. A modal analysis is performed for the system and the resulting set of equations is reduced in number by a truncation procedure for more efficient system simulation...|$|R

Additionally, motor parameters such as stator and rotor winding resistances, and self- and mutual-inductance values are required to complete the model.|$|R
