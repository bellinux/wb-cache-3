40|$|AbstractA <b>revised</b> <b>allocation</b> {{system for}} cadaveric kidney {{donations}} {{was introduced in}} Hong Kong in July 1996 {{to take into consideration}} the age and waiting time of patients on the waiting list for transplantation, and the degree of HLA mismatch of the potential donor against the waiting patients. In recognition of the established benefits of transplanting donor kidneys with zero mismatched antigens against the recipient, the revised system provided that cadaveric kidneys would be transplanted whenever possible to patients against whom the donor had zero mismatched antigens. A total of 168 kidneys were allocated over a 45 -month period using the revised system. The 3 -year actuarial graft survival was 83 %, which exceeded the figure reported for the same population 3 years previously. It is concluded that the revised system is fulfilling its desired objective to remove some older, long-term patients from the waiting list but that additional follow-up is required...|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} environmental cost allocation on production cost and the outcome for environmental management decisions. Using a <b>revised</b> cost <b>allocation</b> – referred to in this paper as environmental cost allocation – the paper contrasts overhead allocation between traditional cost allocation and environmental cost allocation. In addition, production cost derived from the traditional allocation of waste cost is compared with the <b>revised</b> environmental cost <b>allocation.</b> Findings indicate that a <b>revised</b> environmental cost <b>allocation</b> discloses more accurate overhead cost and hence production cost; and that management is motivated to make informed environmental management decisions if a product related environmental cost is made to reflect in the production cost of the polluting product. The paper highlights the practical significance of objective environmental cost allocation on corporate waste management, which thus creates a valuable awareness {{on the part of}} the management and accountants of firms in developing countries for the need to fine-tune the dominant traditional costing system.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the vertebrate dorsal midline (floor plate, notochord, and hypochord) has been an area of classical research and debate. Previous studies in vertebrates have led to contrasting models for the roles of Shh and Notch signaling in specification of the floor plate, by late inductive or early allocation mechanisms, respectively. Here, we show that Notch signaling plays an integral role in cell fate decisions in the dorsal midline of Xenopus laevis, similar to that observed in zebrafish and chick. Notch signaling promotes floor plate and hypochord fates over notochord, but has variable effects on Shh expression in the midline. In contrast to previous reports in frog, we find that Shh signaling is not required for floor plate vs. notochord decisions and plays a minor role in floor plate specification, where it acts in parallel to Notch signaling. As in zebrafish, Shh signaling is required for specification of the lateral floor plate in the frog. We also find that the medial floor plate in Xenopus comprises two distinct populations of cells, each dependent upon different signals for its specification. Using expression analysis of several midline markers, and dissection of functional relationships, we propose a <b>revised</b> <b>allocation</b> mechanism of dorsal midline specification in Xenopus. Our model is distinct from those proposed to date, and {{may serve as a}} guide for future studies in frog and other vertebrate organisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{recognition of}} the success of liver transplantation as a treatment for most types of acute and chronic liver failure has led to increased referrals for transplantation in the setting of a relatively fixed supply of cadaver donor organs. These events have led to a marked lengthening of the waiting time for liver transplantation, resulting in increased deaths of those on the waiting list and sicker patients undergoing transplantation. Nearly 5000 liver transplantations were performed in the United States in 2000, while the waiting list grew to over 17, 000 patients. The mounting disparity between the number of liver transplant candidates and the limited supply of donor organs has led to reassessment of the selection and listing criteria for liver transplantation, as well as revision of organ allocation and distribution policies for cadaver livers. The development of minimal listing criteria for patients with chronic liver disease based on a specific definition for decompensation of cirrhosis has facilitated the more uniform listing of patients at individual centres across the United States. The United Network for Organ Sharing, under pressure from transplant professionals, patient advocacy groups and the federal government, has continuously <b>revised</b> <b>allocation</b> and distribution policies based on the ethical principles of justice for the individual patient versus optimal utility of the limited organ supply available annually.

Variability of design specifications within the tolerance field may affect the dynamic behaviour of the assembled structure more than that of any individual component substructure. Among modelling strategies, non-predictive techniques such as post-processing of data from a set of randomly assembled structures and analysis of sensitivities to uncertain variables are considered.

Where the workload contains or consists of database queries, adaptive query processing (AQP) changes the way in which a query is being evaluated while the query is running. In parallel environments, available adaptations may change the allocation of query fragments to a machine, for example to remove load imbalance or change the parallelism level. Most AQP strategies act on individual queries with the objective of reducing response times. However, where adaptations affect the usage of shared resources, or the principal goal is to meet quality of service targets rather than to minimize overall response times, locally beneficial decisions may have globally detrimental effects. This paper describes the use of utility functions to coordinate adaptations that assign resources to query fragments from multiple queries, and demonstrates how a common framework can be used to support different objectives, specifically to minimize overall query response times and to maximize the number of queries meeting quality of service goals. Experiments using simulation compare the use of utility functions with the more common heuristic control strategies, demonstrating situations in which significant benefits can be obtained...|$|R

The fairly large amount of spectrum that will be freed up in the analog TV switch-off is known as the digital dividend. Many EU countries have decided to partially allocate these frequencies, through market mechanisms, to mobile use, but a large fraction of the dividend is supposed to remain in the hands of broadcasters. An efficient management of the spectrum requires that the use of this resource should be supported through appropriate incentive policies.

The author analyzed the quantitative research results relative to the A 4 R theory’s four procedural conditions of transparency {{and concluded that the}} A 4 R theory it was not ‘fine grain’ enough to identify the complexity of the tribunal resource allocation decision making. Quantitative analysis revealed that Board decisions were influenced by elements of the Board’s procedure. In particular, the author’s statistical analysis found that the Board’s procedures statistically did affect resource allocation decisions by disadvantaging self- represented parties and, for a certain year, parties not participating in the tribunal’s hearing orally/in person. Research Question # 2 : What substantive arguments affect the resource allocation decisions of the Board? This study confirmed that submissions by the parties – the patient and OHIP - affected resource allocation decisions. However, within these substantive arguments the research found that patients and administrative requirements {{played a key role in}} determining out of country coverage of non emergency inpatient health services (OCCNEIHS). The research also identified that more patients requesting OCCNEIHS argued for treatment to be considered acceptable than argued that treatment domestically would be delayed.

40|$|Resource {{allocations}} {{are among}} the most important decisions for any organization. Nonprofit organizations are no different than their for-profit counterparts—effective resource allocation {{is the best way to}} achieve strategic objectives. While the for-profit goal is primarily shareholder wealth, nonprofit goals are more complex—the links between resource allocation and productivity are not always clear. ^ In the 1970 s, many higher education institutions faced austere times and were forced to consider organizational structure changes that improved their chances for long-term survival. Several moved from a centralized allocation system to a decentralized system—deciding that local leaders had better information on which to base decisions and could move faster to make academic program adjustments in a changing educational marketplace. ^ One of the notable decentralized models is Responsibility Center Management (RCM). Because all of the revenues are allocated to the unit that earns it, the RCM model requires a methodology to charge revenue-generating units for their share of central administrative activities. ^ There is no evidence that any one of the allocation methodologies reviewed in this study is completely effective in allocating central costs. Most of the methodologies are based on averaging, and, since the average does not represent any individual unit, the methodologies can become dysfunctional over time. A review of financial data finds that fast-growth academic units in this study benefited most from the various allocation methodologies in place. ^ While some administrators interviewed thought the system fairly allocated costs, the majority felt that it was less than perfect in aligning benefits with allocations. Many pointed to the lack of defined service levels for activities funded through the allocation system, which is an important element in perceived fairness. Even though there were issues in how the allocation systems worked, it was clear that there was strong support of the decentralized model. ^ When developing or <b>revising</b> cost <b>allocation</b> methodologies, institutions should focus on five areas: (a) determine the cost drivers of administrative activities, (b) create allocation pools based on cost drivers, (c) distribute costs on a consistent basis, (d) move from average to marginal cost rules, and (e) create reasonable transition periods for change. ...|$|R
