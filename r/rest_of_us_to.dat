2500|$|Affectionately nicknamed [...] "Go" [...] and towering at {{a whopping}} five-foot [...] "ape", the Gorilla is the Phoenix Suns {{favorite}} primate. Most notably, fans {{are familiar with}} the Gorilla for his on the court antics where he raises the Phoenix Suns flag in the name of team-pride, performs notorious slam dunk routines and fires up the crowd. From his early days in the Banana Republic to his education at Fur-man University, the Gorilla has always had a passion for basketball. Before his debut with the Phoenix Suns, the Gorilla delivered singing telegrams. However, in 1980 the Gorilla's fate changed when he stepped onto the court during a game and surprised unsuspecting players and fans. His antics became an instant hit and the Gorilla {{has been a member of}} the Phoenix Suns ever since. Since then, the gorilla, has been known for his slapstick humor during the games such as his stadium stairs all to the sound of the Rocky Theme, and the fantastic dunks that are performed before each 4th quarter. The Gorilla would do a few push-ups on the court, then head off in a quest to climb the stairs of both the lower and upper level of the Coliseum to get to the top. When he reached the base of the upper level, he’d stop for a second to soak up the applause, then head to the top of the building. When he got there, the crowd would explode. It never failed. Also, one of his more beloved skits was at a Knicks home game where he came out to Frank Sinatra's Theme from New York, wearing a hat, with several pieces of garbage stuck to his leg. Halfway through the song, a group of [...] "muggers" [...] attacked him, and he staggered off the court afterwards. Give him credit, The Gorilla has always been more than a slapstick comedian. In a way, though, that's what makes The Gorilla so much fun. He's not really there just to cheer on the Suns – although he does so with great enthusiasm. The Gorilla just wants to have fun, and wants the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> have fun with him.|$|E

6000|$|... "'If {{you want}} the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> help you, you'd better get things started yourself,' said old Mr. Skunk, {{carefully}} combing out his big, plumy tail.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, Cindy Cohn, {{then the}} legal {{director}} of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, praised Cryptome as [...] "a really important safety valve for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> as <b>to</b> what our government is up to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect," [...] said Mrs. Wilkins, [...] "they {{are just}} the {{ordinary}} sort of Christian, like the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> anxious <b>to</b> do {{the best they can}} for themselves, and not too particular as to doing other people in the process." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, General. I and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> swore <b>to</b> {{protect the}} lady Heliodore {{and to be}} as her father or her brothers. Do you bide here. I will go to search for her, either with a vessel full of armed men, or alone, disguised." ...|$|R
60|$|Mayfield's broad {{face had}} reddened with indignation; but now his curiosity drove out every other emotion, and {{he leaned forward}} with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> hear the old man's story.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sancta Maria!' cried Saxon, dashing {{forward with}} the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> find out {{the cause of the}} delay. 'We must on at any cost! A halt now will ruin our camisado.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Couldn't {{you have}} got here earlier, Bella?" [...] he asked. [...] "In another few minutes you'd have spoiled the drive--the birds can't be far off the dip of the ridge. Hardly fair to the keepers or the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take these risks, is it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Writing in Commonweal, Eugene McCarraher commended Unger and West's [...] "sweeping but {{sensible}} proposals," [...] but {{contended that}} their {{celebration of the}} practices of vanguard industry as a path for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> reach economic equality was misguided: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To make a {{necklace}} for playing Indian Chief," [...] explained Davy, climbing upon Anne's lap. [...] "He's got fifteen already, and everybody's else's promised, so there's no {{use in the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> starting <b>to</b> collect, too. I tell you the Boulters are great business people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Merrifield and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are {{inclined}} <b>to</b> {{think that what}} stands highest <b>of</b> all with <b>us</b> is endangered by mixed schools,' said Mr. Doyle.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the very}} point we are met to consider," [...] she said. [...] "For five years we {{have been trying to}} find out whether we are {{justified}} in continuing the human race. Castalia has anticipated our decision. But it remains for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make up our minds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] Lady Mary replied, decidedly. [...] "Mr. Ruff is here entirely as my guest. He {{has been}} in the room with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> look at them, and it was he, by the bye, who {{discovered}} a much more satisfactory way of boarding the windows. Anything else, Mr. Dory?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ach! {{and so had}} he, too, {{until he}} remembered his own skin, and went off with the only horse and all the powder, leaving her and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> starve. Well, you won't go, and Prinsloo won't go, nor my boy either, for I'll see to that; so Meyer must go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said March, [...] "undertakers must live, {{even if the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have <b>to</b> die to let them." [...] Lindau laughed, and March went on: [...] "But I'm glad it isn't your funeral, Lindau. And you say you're not sick, and so I don't see why we shouldn't come to business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twas her head, mostly," [...] said Patsy, {{giving her}} cousin an admiring hug; [...] "she kept her wits while the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were scared <b>to</b> death." ...|$|R
6000|$|M. Pigeonneau stood staring, his syrup in his hand; then {{he slowly}} turned away. He looked {{about at the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> as <b>to</b> appeal from Miss Ruck’s insensibility, and went to deposit his {{rejected}} tribute on a bench. “Won’t {{you give it to}} me?” asked Miss Church in faultless French. “J’adore le sirop, moi.” ...|$|R
6000|$|His comrade {{looked at}} him with half-closed eyes. [...] "Would you wish to live if you looked like that, or do you want the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> find out what he went through? I'm {{responsible}} for those men yonder--and it's only antedating the thing a month or two. The life is almost rotted out of him. Stand clear! We must get it over!" ...|$|E
60|$|I saw he had fallen, {{like the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> think mainly of the house. Now {{that all the}} living {{members of the family}} were plunged in {{irremediable}} sorrow, it was strange how we turned to that conjoint abstraction of the family itself, and sought to bolster up the airy nothing of its reputation: not the Duries only, but the hired steward himself.|$|E
6000|$|What did it mean? Taking the worldly {{point of}} view, it {{appeared}} to mean that Mr. Godfrey had {{been the victim of}} some incomprehensible error, committed by certain unknown men. A dark conspiracy was on foot in the midst of us; and our beloved and innocent friend had been entangled in its meshes. When the Christian hero of a hundred charitable victories plunges into a pitfall that has been dug for him by mistake, oh, what a warning it is to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be unceasingly on our guard! How soon may our own evil passions prove to be Oriental noblemen who pounce on us unawares! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{worked at}} it in the evenings in the granary loft, and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> forebore <b>to</b> {{question}} him concerning it, because he evidently disliked talking about his literary efforts. But this evening I had to ask him if he would soon have it ready, as I wanted to make up the paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{the back}} trail, if ye like," [...] said Bill Cowan, {{with a loud}} laugh. [...] "I reckon the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> kin float <b>to</b> Vincennes on Davy's drum." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> began <b>to</b> {{look very}} grave, {{and to think}} that we must get to liking Sunday some time or other, or {{it would be a very}} bad thing for us. As we drew near the dwelling, the compact and business-like form of Aunt Kezzy was seen {{emerging}} from the house to hasten our approach.|$|R
60|$|Later, in {{the guest}} house at Mur, Higgs told us his story. After his {{betrayal}} by Shadrach, which, it appeared, was meant to include us all, for the Professor overheard the hurried talk between him and a Fung captain, he was seized and imprisoned {{in the body of}} the great sphinx, where many chambers and dungeons had been hollowed out by the primæval race that fashioned it. Here Barung the Sultan visited him and informed him of his meeting with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> whom apparently he had taken a great liking, and also that we had refused to purchase a chance of his release at the price of being false to our trust.|$|E
60|$|He {{took part}} in {{parliamentary}} business {{at the beginning of}} December. On December 3rd he spoke on Ireland with immense fervour and passion. He was roused violently by the chairman’s attempt to rule out strong language from debate, and made a vehement passage on that point. The substance of the speech was rather thin and not new, but the delivery magnificent. The Irish minister rose to reply at 7.50, and Mr. Gladstone reluctantly made up his mind to dine in the House. A friend by his side said No, and at 8.40 hurried him down the back-stairs to a hospitable board in Carlton Gardens. He was nearly voiceless, until {{it was time for the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go back. A speedy meal revived him, and he was soon discoursing on O’Connell and many other persons and things, with boundless force and vivacity.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{has been}} one {{exquisite}} copy, I have heard," [...] said Hilda, [...] "by an artist capable of appreciating {{the spirit of the}} picture. It was Thompson, who brought it away piecemeal, being forbidden (like the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us)</b> <b>to</b> set up his easel before it. As for me, I knew the Prince Barberini would be deaf to all entreaties; so I had no resource but to sit down before the picture, day after day, and let it sink into my heart. I do believe it is now photographed there. It is a sad face to keep so close to one's heart; only what is so very beautiful can never be quite a pain. Well; after studying it in this way, I know not how many times, I came home, and have done my best to transfer the image to canvas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} must get up early," [...] cried Athelny, [...] "and he must work like the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> He's got <b>to</b> earn his board. No work, no dinner, my lad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{the hell}} didn't {{you tell a}} feller?" [...] reproachfully growled the Arizonian. Frank and Jim held each other upright, and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> gave way <b>to</b> as hearty if not as violent mirth.|$|R
60|$|A {{couple of}} {{soldiers}} snapped {{the first ring}} {{around the neck of}} a powerful white slave, and one by one the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were herded <b>to</b> our places, and the work <b>of</b> shackling <b>us</b> neck <b>to</b> neck commenced.|$|R
6000|$|As a child, Jean {{neglected}} my books. When she {{was nine}} years old Will Gillette invited her and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a dinner at the Murray Hill Hotel in New York, in order that we might get acquainted with Mrs. Leslie and her daughters. Elsie Leslie {{was nine years}} old, and was a great celebrity on the stage. Jean was astonished and awed to see that little slip of a thing sit up at table and take part in the conversation of the grown people, capably and with ease and tranquillity. Poor Jean was obliged to keep still, for the subjects discussed never happened to hit her level, but at last the talk fell within her limit and she had her chance to contribute to it. [...] "Tom Sawyer" [...] was mentioned. Jean spoke gratefully up and said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, 'Thank you, Sergeant Pritchard,' she says. 'The least I {{can do is}} to mark it for you in {{case you}} change your mind. There's no great demand for it in the Fleet,' she says, 'but to make sure I'll put it at the back o' the shelf,' an' she snipped off a piece of her hair ribbon with that old dolphin cigar cutter on the bar--remember it, Pye?--an' she tied a bow round what was left--just four bottles. That was '97--no, '96. In '98 I was in the Resiliant--China station--full commission. In Nineteen One, mark you, I was in the Carthusian, back in Auckland Bay again. Of course I went up to Mrs. B.'s with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see how things were goin'. They were the same as ever. (Remember the big tree on the {{pavement}} by the side-bar, Pye?) I never said anythin' in special (there was too many of us talkin' to her), but she saw me at once." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{observe that}} this seems almost the {{necessary}} end {{at least of}} writers. LES BLANCS ET LES BLEUS (for instance) is of an order of merit very different from LE VICOMTE DE BRAGLONNE; and if any gentleman can bear to spy upon the nakedness of CASTLE DANGEROUS, his name I think is Ham: let it be enough for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> read of it (not without tears) {{in the pages of}} Lockhart. Thus in old age, when occupation and comfort are most needful, the writer must lay aside at once his pastime and his breadwinner. The painter indeed, if he succeed at all in engaging the attention of the public, gains great sums and can stand to his easel until a great age without dishonourable failure. The writer has the double misfortune to be ill-paid while he can work, and to be incapable of working when he is old. It is thus a way of life which conducts directly to a false position.|$|E
5000|$|Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio stated: [...] "Tonight, New York {{has lost}} a giant. Mario Cuomo {{was a man of}} unwavering {{principle}} who possessed a compassion for humankind that was without equal. He established the gold standard in New York State for how public servants should act, and set an example that the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> continue <b>to</b> aspire to today." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of your colonial seethings and heavings, I suppose you have some leisure to consult equally the hopeful prophets and the dismal prophets who are all wiser than any <b>of</b> the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> as <b>to</b> things at home here. My own strong {{impression}} is that whatsoever change the new Reform Bill may effect will be very gradual indeed and quite wholesome.|$|R
40|$|For {{the final}} assignment, our group chose to add normal mapping and shadow volumes. We chose these topics {{for a couple}} {{different}} reasons. For normal mapping, one the group members had some background in normal mapping and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> wanted <b>to</b> learn how it worked and how to implement it. Similar for shadow volumes, we wanted {{to learn more about}} how it worked and try it out for ourselves...|$|R
