The {{addition}} of Trompe l’oeil flies to works of art is believed to have begun in the 15th century, right as Christus became active. Art Historians are generally split between two different interpretations of their use. Many art historians believe the fly to hold religious symbolism, functions as connotations of sin, corruption, mortality, etc. Art historians believe that a fly was used to evoke such images in connection with Satan’s moniker Beelzebub—the Lord of the Flies. More recently, art historians are beginning to view the inclusion of Trompe l’oeil flies as a professional calling card, with art historian Felix Thülemann describing it as “a selfconscious representation of superior painterly prowess. It is believed that this is why the fly generally appears <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the artist’s signature (the fly’s position <b>right</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> ‘Petrus ΧΡΙ <b>Me</b> Fecit’ hinting that the fly might be the referent of ‘me’ rather than the painting.) ...|$|R
