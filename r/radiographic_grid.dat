50|$|One {{drawback}} of a fixed <b>radiographic</b> <b>grid</b> is that {{it creates}} grid lines on the image. Hollis Potter (1880-1964) showed in 1920 that the grid lines could be eliminated by moving the grid {{at right angles to}} the grid lines during the exposure. If the range and speed of motion is sufficient, the grid lines will be blurred out. The motion may be oscillating, vibrating, or reciprocating and must be continuous and smooth. The motion must also begin before exposure and continue until after exposure.|$|E
40|$|JC: [...] ABSTRACT [...] - P 4 Osteoclastoma seen between 1965 and 1984 is presented. All {{patients}} received megavoltage therapy using Telecobalt. Tumour dose of 45 Gy to 55. 3 Gy in 15 to 18 fractions {{had been}} delivered. All patients had quantitation of pre-treatment tumour volume and post-treatment response using a <b>radiographic</b> <b>grid.</b> CT scan measurements have complimented the grid quantitation in recent years. Follow through visits from 5 to 24 years post-treatment (mean follow up 9. 2 years) have shown optimum tumor regression, bone recalcification and restitution of joint functions amongst these patients. No case of bone sarcoma has been detected. Our observations {{lead us to}} support megavoltage radiation therapy as the treatment of choice for accessible and inaccessible osteoclastoma...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundVarious methods, {{including}} {{clinical and}} radiographic techniques, {{can be used}} to assess periodontal regeneration in interproximal areas. The goal {{of the present study was}} to compare the papilla length relative to the alveolar bone crest measured by clinical, intrasurgical, and radiographic techniques. Materials and methodsThe study sample included 250 interproximal papillae in 68 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. The papilla length from the alveolar bone crest was measured clinically (as the actual papilla length, APL), intrasurgically (as the bone probing length, BPL), and radiographically (as the radiographic bone length, RBL). Measurements were standardized by using acrylic resin stents, XCP rinn, a paralleling technique, and/or a <b>radiographic</b> <b>grid.</b> ResultsThe mean (± standard deviation) for RBL was 4. 9 ± 0. 8 mm, BPL was 5. 1 ± 0. 6 mm, and APL was 5. 1 ± 0. 6 mm. Correlations between RBL and APL and between BPL and APL were 0. 918 and 0. 943, respectively (both P< 0. 01). ConclusionsIf the clinical recordings are appropriately standardized, then noninvasive radiographic methods {{can be used to}} evaluate the papilla length with good accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Radiation doses {{have been}} {{monitored}} {{for a long}} time, as we are aware that radiation can produce biological effects. However, there is {{a limited amount of}} information available on patient dose from cervical spine examinations. In addition, the techniques used are variable between radiographic departments and even radiographers within one department. The difference in technique of particular concern is the use of <b>radiographic</b> <b>grids.</b> While it reduces scatter and improve image quality, the use of a grid demands increased exposure factors and dose to obtain the same optical density on the film. Method: This study investigated the range of doses for lateral cervical spine examinations in the Hunter and Sydney metropolitan regions of New South Wales, Australia. Radiation doses were calculated from X-ray tube output measurements and patient exposure parameters. Results: Differences in dose for 116 patients (53 non-grid, 63 grid) examined on 13 X-ray units were analysed. The study calculated the mean entrance surface dose for the non-grid system (228 μGy) to be significantly lower at the 95 % significance level than the mean entrance surface dose for the grid techniques (505 μGy). However, the use of a grid for computed radiography systems did not produce any differences in dose with the use or non-use of a grid, while there was a three-fold increase for film-screen systems. Conclusion: The increased level of dose and the inherent air-gap nature of the lateral cervical spine examination raises severe doubt on the use of anti-scatter grids and the recommendation is that they should not be used...|$|R
40|$|Context: There are few {{applicable}} {{methods and}} scant literature on using non-specific {{image analysis software}} to assess and quantify post-periodontal surgery bone-fill. Aims: The present study describes the method of digital subtraction radiography (DSR) and morphometric area analysis (MA) in assessing bone-fill following regenerative periodontal therapy by using two image processing tools. Settings and Design: For the bone-fill assessment, radiographs of 78 angular bone defects from 30 subjects who underwent periodontal flap surgery with hydroxyapatite bone graft placement were utilized. Materials and Methods: The initial radiographic image obtained at baseline was subtracted from the radiographic images taken at 12 / 24 weeks by using the commercially available image processing software. After digital subtraction, the digitized and excluded interdental bone was transferred to open source software for area calculation. Bone-fill calculated by using DSR and MA was compared to the bone-fill values obtained by using the 1 mm 2 counting grid placed over the digital sensor. Statistical Analysis: Intragroup comparison of bone-fill between various groups was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. One-way ANOVA followed by the post hoc test was used for intragroup and intergroup comparison. Results: DSR and MA showed higher mean bone-fill levels over <b>radiographic</b> <b>grid.</b> Conclusion: Considering that the software aims to reduce the inaccuracy behind manual assessment of bone-fill, the overestimation of bone-fill as compared to a grid {{may be attributed to}} the enhanced sensitivity of the method...|$|E
