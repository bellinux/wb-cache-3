Beginning in early 2011, Romney presented a more relaxed visual image, including more casual attire.|$|E
5|$|With his {{increasing}} reputation, local Republicans urged Harrison {{to run for}} Congress. He initially confined {{his political}} activities to {{speaking on behalf of}} other <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates,</b> a task for which he received high praises from his colleagues. In 1872, Harrison campaigned for the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana. Former governor Oliver Morton favored his opponent, Thomas M. Browne, and Harrison lost his bid for statewide office. He returned to his law practice and, despite the Panic of 1873, he was financially successful enough to build a grand new home in Indianapolis in 1874. He continued to make speeches on behalf of <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates</b> and policies.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{accepted}} his narrow defeat and {{spent most of}} the next year working on the second volume of Twenty Years of Congress. The book continued to earn him enough money to support his lavish household and pay off his debts. Although he spoke to friends of retiring from politics, Blaine still attended dinners and commented on the Cleveland administration’s policies. By the time of the 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates,</b> especially {{in his home state of}} Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates</b> there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E

5|$|Caspersen was an {{influential}} donor to <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates</b> {{at the state}} and national level. In the 1980s, he was a major supporter of former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean. He served as a town commissioner in Jupiter Island, Florida, an exclusive upper-class enclave, for four years, resigning a few weeks before his suicide in September 2009.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 election, Romney {{laid the}} groundwork for a likely 2012 presidential {{campaign}} by using his Free and Strong America political action committee (PAC) to raise money for other <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates</b> and pay his existing political staff's salaries and consulting fees. A network of former staff and supporters around the nation were eager for him to run again.|$|E
5|$|In the campaign, Hunter {{emphasized}} {{his conservative}} credentials, {{focusing on the}} issues of border security, the War on Terrorism, and trade. Throughout 2007, he was in the second tier of <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates,</b> consistently receiving three percent or less support among Republicans in national polls. However, the campaign reached a high point after Hunter won the Texas Straw Poll.|$|E
50|$|Two years later, in 2008, he won {{re-election}} to {{a second}} term, defeating the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> Charles Brickhouse, with 98 percent of the vote. In 2010 he won re-election to a third term, easily defeating the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> Frank Voyticky.|$|R

5|$|The library {{announced}} that it would once again host the first Republican primary debate among 2012 <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates,</b> initially scheduled for May 2, 2011, but later postponed it until after other debates. The debate was co-hosted by NBC News and Politico. The debate took place on September 7, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} never close, and the Nixon/Agnew ticket won 49 states and over 60 {{percent of the}} vote in gaining re-election. Trying to {{position}} himself as the frontrunner for 1976, Agnew campaigned widely for <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates,</b> something Nixon would not do. Despite Agnew's efforts, Democrats easily held both houses of Congress, gaining two seats in the Senate, though the Republicans gained twelve in the House.|$|E
5|$|Biden had {{remained}} {{low in the}} opinion polls {{when compared to other}} candidates. A Rasmussen survey taken September 19–24 put him in fourth place among his Democratic opponents at 4%, trailing Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards. In the American Research Group, Biden was fourth at 5% behind Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards, for the month of October 2007. In head-to-head matchups with <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates,</b> Biden trailed Senator John McCain on January 10, 2007 38% to 46%.|$|E
50|$|Virginia {{voted for}} the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate,</b> {{incumbent}} President Ulysses S. Grant over the Democratic and Liberal <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate,</b> former U.S. Representative Horace Greeley. This was the first presidential election that Virginia participated in after {{the events of the}} U.S. Civil War. It was also the first presidential election in which the state voted for a <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> and would not occur again until 1928. The election was still very close in this state and Grant won Virginia by a margin of almost 1%.|$|R
50|$|He {{was elected}} as an Independent <b>Republican</b> <b>{{candidate}}</b> to the 44th United States Congress and reelected as a <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> to the 45th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1875 until March 3, 1879.

5|$|Harney County {{voters in}} 2012 voted heavily Republican. In the general {{election}} in November, Republican Mitt Romney won about 73percent of the votes for U.S. President to about 23percent for Democrat Barack Obama, while other candidates and parties shared the remaining 4percent. In the contest for the U.S. Congressional 2nd District Representative, Republican Greg Walden garnered about 83percent of the vote. In races for state offices, <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates</b> won between 63 and 69percent {{of the vote in}} Harney County.|$|E
5|$|Kemp gave public speeches for $35,000 apiece {{between his}} time as Housing Secretary and his Vice Presidential nomination. By 1994, Kemp had {{embarked}} on 241fund-raising dinners to raise $35million for a 1996 Presidential bid and to pay off his 1988 campaign debts. After stepping down from his $189,000 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development job, Kemp personally earned $6.9million {{in the next three}} years, primarily for speaking on behalf of local <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates.</b> During the Super Bowl XXVIII festivities, Kemp hosted a notable fundraiser series.|$|E
5|$|Sampson won the {{election}} {{by a majority of}} over 32,000 votes, although every other Republican candidate lost by small margins. In the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat James Breathitt, Jr. defeated Sampson's running mate, E. E. Nelson, by 159 votes out of more than 700,000 cast. It was estimated that the Jockey Club spent half a million dollars to defeat Beckham and the large majority for Sampson versus the close defeat of all other <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates</b> suggested some type of fraud, although none was ever proven.|$|E

5|$|After {{rendering}} noncombat {{service in}} World War II and graduating from law school, Nunn entered local politics, {{becoming the first}} Republican county judge {{in the history of}} Barren County, Kentucky. He worked on the campaigns of <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates</b> for national office, including John Sherman Cooper, Thruston Morton, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the Republican nominee for governor in 1963, but ultimately lost a close election to Democrat Ned Breathitt. An executive order signed by Governor Bert T. Combs that desegregated Kentucky's public services became a major issue in the campaign. Nunn vowed to repeal the order if elected, while Breathitt promised to continue it.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary {{had a very good}} chance of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates.</b>|$|E
5|$|For his campaign, Romney {{assembled}} a veteran group of Republican staffers, consultants, and pollsters. He was little-known nationally, though, and stayed around the 10percent support range in Republican preference polls {{for the first}} half of 2007. He proved the most effective fundraiser of any of the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidates</b> and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune. These resources, combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner John McCain's campaign, made Romney a threat to win the nomination and the focus of the other candidates' attacks. Romney's staff suffered from internal strife; the candidate himself was at times indecisive, often asking for more data before making a decision.|$|E
