Res. 37 (17) (1997) 2325; Wilson & Wilkinson, Vis. Res. 38 (19) (1998) 2933). Under experimental conditions similar to Wilson et al. we found this advantage to be largely contingent on the pattern being viewed through a circular aperture. Because rotation of a random dot set cannot lead to the presence of unmatched dots at the boundary of a circular aperture, the integrity of low spatial frequency information at the boundary reliably indicates the presence of rotational, but not translational, structure. When we removed this cue, either using a square aperture or surrounding a round aperture with noise dots, none of the nine subjects tested showed any statistically significant advantage for <b>rotational</b> Glass <b>patterns</b> (although at least two did take longer to master the task with translational compared to <b>rotational</b> <b>patterns).</b> We go on to show generally similar patterns of global integration for both <b>rotational</b> and translational <b>patterns.</b> We conclude that this paradigm presently offers no concrete psychophysical evidence for specialised concentric orientation detectors...|$|R

The virtue of these patterns (composed {{of a set of}} randomly distributed elements combined with a geometrically transformed copy) for studying object formation is that they allow ready isolation of local processes, the combination of dots to form a perceptual pair, from global processes, the combination of dipoles into the percept of an overall <b>rotational</b> or translational <b>pattern.</b> We find that a contrast difference within dot-pairs reduces the ability to resolve local features; large differences totally abolish the perception of the pattern. Contrast differences between dot-pairs lessen, but do not abolish, the global integration among local features. In both cases the effect is proportional to the ratio of the two contrast levels employed. Effects which differ for rotations and translations, are consistent with the greater areal integration required to resolve <b>rotational</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

In case 4, the risk of re-ankylosis after gap arthroplasty was considered high because of the underlying disease, ankylosing spondylitis. Total reconstruction of TMJ with prosthesis was planned to avoid the risk of re-ankylosis. The patient has restored his former range of mouth opening, but his jaw still deviates to the affected side, which is accounted for by the prosthesis rather than re-ankylosis. In contrast with TMJ, which functions in both rotational and translational patterns, the prosthesis functions in a purely <b>rotational</b> <b>pattern</b> due to the loss of lateral pterygoid muscle attachment.

The theory is formulated by using the damping theory, and the perturbation factor of the perturbed angular-correlation function, which contains the effects of the changes of the states of the environment on the angular correlation, is obtained.

In order to determine the nuclear electric quadrupole moment in an excited state, which cannot be done by the usual microwave methods, a rotational technique is suggested and the theory has been developed for the case of asymmetric fields.

When the same button was used to report reflection and positive words, responses were faster than when the same button was used to report reflection and negative words. We take this association to indicate an implicit preference for reflectional patterns. In subsequent experiments, a reflected pattern was preferred to a rotation or translation, and a <b>rotational</b> <b>pattern</b> was preferred to random patterns. In some cases these results were not in agreement with verbally reported preferences, but implicit preferences were always predicted by the speed at which patterns could be identified.

In this paper, we show that by considering higher order three-dimensional cavity modes of rectangular channels in thin-layered acoustofluidic manipulation devices, a wider family of transducer-plane streaming patterns are found. As an example, we present a transducer-plane streaming pattern, which consists of eight streaming vortices with each occupying one octant of the plane parallel to the transducer radiating surfaces, which we call here eight-octant transducer-plane streaming.
