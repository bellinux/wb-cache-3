In this way, the aim of this work is the design of a procedure and algorithm to adjust a propagation model considering measurement campaigns performed in different environments (dense-urban, urban, sub-urban and rural). The methodology relies on the adjustment of the Xia-Bertoni propagation model parameters using the Least Mean Square (LMS) method, considering the collected measurements and the simulation model parameters obtained from a Geographic Information System (GIS). Coverage simulations and measurement results are compared using a 3 -Dimensional city model (terrain and buildings) for different terrain topologies (flat, hills and canyons) and environments. The resulting adjusted model has been tested and compared with other common models (COST 231 and Okumura-Hata) using specific metrics, thus proving its validity for different frequencies, environments and terrain topologies. In order to validate the procedure and designed algorithm, this Master Thesis gathers real data from measurement campaigns carried out in different cities: Gävle (Sweden), Bucaramanga (Colombia), Valencia (Spain) and Munich (Germany). Besides, this work provides an insight on best practices to perform measurement campaigns.

40|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>frequency</b> sensor <b>networks</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popular as an indoor localization and monitoring technology for gaining unobtrusive situational awareness of the surrounding environment. The localization effort in these networks is built upon the well-established fact that the received signal strength measurements vary due to a person's presence on the line-of-sight of a transmitter-receiver pair. To date, modeling this decrease in received signal strength and utilizing it for localization purposes have received {{a considerable amount of}} attention in the research field. However, when the person is in the close vicinity of the line-of-sight but not obstructing it, the signal reflected from the human body is also affecting the received signal strength and can be used for occupancy assessment purposes. In this paper, we first model the effect of human-induced reflections as a function of communication frequency, and then use the model as a basis for energy based occupancy detection. The derived methods are evaluated numerically and the detection probability of the proposed detector is validated with experimental data. The results suggest that when more than eight frequency channels are utilized, presence of a person can be detected using RSS measurements of a single transmit-receive pair with detection probability higher than 0. 95 and false alarm probability less than 0. 01 in an area of 2 m x 2. 5 m.
