To achieve this goal, it is necessary to effectively manage the large volume of existing information as well as new information that will be developed through the NHEP {{monitoring program}}. Data and information about NH’s estuaries now exists in multiple formats within a variety of organizations. Existing monitoring programs are designed to meet the missions of the various implementing organizations.

This Data Management Plan contains protocols for data reporting to the NHEP to facilitate data integration. Different protocols will be applied to different types of data (e. g., chemical, geospatial, and biological).

40|$|The use of {{isotopes}} {{of transition}} metal has opened many perspectives {{in the development}} of novel compounds utilizable for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. In order to be exploited, though, they must be stabilized by chelating systems in coordination complexes. The tricarbonyl complexes of Technetium(I) and Rhenium(I) have assumed important roles in these fields as they are readily conjugated to biomolecules to form stable probe useful in the targeting approach. In this context the amino acid histidine represents a valuable ligand for bioconjugation. Since little is reported on the chemistry and speciation of Re(I) and Tc(I) in aqueous solution, here, we analyze the interaction of fac-[Re(H 2 O) 3 (CO) 3]+ with histidine or with the simple imidazole ring by means of potentiometric and spectroscopic techniques.

40|$|In {{the first}} item of this <b>report,</b> <b>coordination</b> of the surface {{substance}} with activity of adaptation enzyme has been studied. Purified polysaccharide-polypeptide-lipid compound had strong activity to promote the activity of adaptation enzyme, although ribonucleic acid-Mgpolysaccharide-polypeptide-lipid compound did not show any action on enzyme. Furthermore, this activity was strongest in polysaccharide-polypeptide compound. However, polypeptide or lipid had no such activity.

In the second item, the author described the bacterial toxin obtained by shaking and its relation to surface structures of the bacterial cell. By shaking bacterial cell with ribonucleic acid purified from the same kind of bacteria, there were obtained two kinds of hemolytic toxin, e. g. one contained ribonucleic acid and other contained polysaccharide. When energy substance, such as glucose, was added sufficiently, latter was predominantly produced. On the contorary, when the mixture was shaked without energy substance, former was predominantly produced. Thus, intimate relation with energy metabolism was found in the production of this kind of toxin.

The chelation bonds facilitate the ligand-metal center interaction and generate substantial charge transfer phenomena. The ease of crystallization is ascribed to the relatively weak Bi(III) -Cl bonds that serve to connect the organic ligands and the similar crystalline packing motifs of the reactant (1) and the product (1 ‚BiCl 3). The synthesis of compound 1 ‚BiCl 3 indicates that semiconductive networks can be effectively accessed by linking electroactive organic ligands through intervening metal halide moieties.
