5000|$|It {{was created}} by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (...) as a federally chartered, private {{corporation}} responsible for guaranteeing the timely <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> and interest to investors in a new agricultural secondary market. The secondary market allows a lending institution to sell a qualified farm real estate loan to an agricultural mortgage marketing facility, or pooler, which packages these loans, and sells to investors securities that are backed by, or represent interests in, the pooled loans. Farmer Mac guarantees the timely <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> and interest on these securities and, under authorities granted in 1995, can also serve as a loan pooler.|$|E

40|$|Mortgages {{characterized}} by negative or low early amortization schedules amplify the macroeconomic {{effects of a}} housing risk shock. We analyze the role of mortgage amortization in a two-sector DSGE model with housing risk and endogenous default. Mortgage loan contracts extend to two periods and have adjustable rates. The fraction <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> to be repaid {{in the first period}} can vary. As the fraction <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> to be paid in the first period falls, steady-state mortgages and leverage increase and the impact of a housing risk shock on consumption and output is amplified. Borrowers prefer negative amortization. If free to choose the amortization schedule, borrowers would repay most <b>of</b> the <b>principal</b> in the last period of the contract. Low early <b>repayments</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> allow borrowers to hold on to their housing stock and postpone default to the second period having incurred small sunk costs.

50|$|Credit risk: First {{and most}} importantly, it {{substantially}} reduces the credit {{risk of the}} loan or bond. In a bullet loan (or bullet bond), {{the bulk of the}} credit risk is in the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>principal</b> at maturity, at which point the debt must either be paid off in full or rolled over. By paying off the principal over time, this risk is mitigated.|$|R

40|$|A {{conventional}} bond is a {{debt instrument}} {{consisting of a}} series of periodic coupon payments plus the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>principal</b> at maturity. As the name suggests, a zero-coupon bond has no coupon payments. It has only a single payment consisting <b>of</b> the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>principal</b> at maturity. The zero-coupon bond is sold at a discount and then redeemed for its face value at maturity. The return to the investor is the difference between the face value of the bond and its discounted purchase price. In this article, the author examines the investment characteristics of zero-coupon bonds. In particular, a type of zero-coupon bond known as a strip bond is discussed. A strip bond is created by stripping coupon payments from conventional bonds. The strip bond market in Canada has grown substantially since the late 1980 s and is now an integral part of Canadian fixed-income markets. As well, the opportunity to trade in the strip bond market improves the liquidity and efficiency of Canadian fixed-income markets, thus helping to reduce the overall cost of borrowing to the government. ...|$|R

5000|$|Debt {{is money}} owed by one party, the {{borrower}} or debtor, {{to a second}} party, the lender or creditor. The borrower may be a sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. The lender may be a bank, credit card company, payday loan provider, or an individual. Debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing <b>of</b> <b>repayments</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> and interest. A simple way to understand interest is {{to see it as}} the [...] "rent" [...] a person owes on money that they have borrowed, to the bank from which they borrowed the money. Loans, bonds, notes, and mortgages are all types of debt. The term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on economic value. For example, in Western cultures, a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a [...] "debt of gratitude" [...] to the second person.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{debenture}} refers {{specifically to}} an unsecured corporate bond, i.e. a bond {{that does not}} have a certain line of income or piece of property or equipment to guarantee <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> upon the bond's maturity. Where security is provided for loan stocks or bonds in the US, they are termed 'mortgage bonds'.|$|E

5000|$|Banks are public, not private, {{institutions}} that make grants, not loans, to business enterprises. According to Schweickart, these grants {{do not represent}} [...] "free money", since an investment grant counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring interest payments but no <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Between 1975 and 1982, Latin American debt to {{commercial}} banks increased at a cumulative {{annual rate of}} 20.4 percent. This heightened borrowing led Latin America to quadruple its external debt from US$75 billion in 1975 to more than $315 billion in 1983, or 50 percent of the region's gross domestic product (GDP). Debt service (interest payments and the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal)</b> grew even faster as global interest rates surged, reaching $66 billion in 1982, up from $12 billion in 1975.|$|E
50|$|Human Capital Contracts are {{characterized}} by an initial investment amount by the capital provider, followed {{by a series of}} periodic dividend payments made from the receiver of the capital to the provider. These payments are variable in amount, proportional with the capital receiver's income, and may never total the initial investment amount made the capital provider. In contrast, a loan is a form of debt, characterized by interest payments based on a fixed principal amount, where the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>principal</b> is a necessary condition of the loan.|$|R
40|$|Liabilities can be {{guaranteed}} {{by a third}} party. Guarantees are arrangements whereby the guarantor commits to pay or assume the liability of another entity (the original debtor) if certain conditions are met (such as inability of the original debtor to pay). Guarantees may include <b>repayments</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> and/or interest payments. A debt guarantee involves three institutional units: original creditor, original debtor, and guarantor. Activation of a debt guarantee creates a new liability and the guarantor now becomes the new debtor. This raises issues on how to treat flows between the original debtor and creditor and between the original debtor and the guarantor (the new debtor). Activation of guarantees affects transactions or other economic flows. Usual cases of guarantees in terms of institutional units involved and motivations may be: (1) government providing guarantees for borrowing by public enterprises or private enterprises (for example, to encourage certain types of activities), (2) financial intermediaries providing guarantees as services for payment of a fee, and (3) parents providing guarantees for their subsidiaries (for example, to cut interest costs). The treatment of flows arising from an activation of guarantees may also need to conside...|$|R
50|$|Applicants must be family-sized farmers, who {{are denied}} credit by private and {{cooperative}} sources, and have reasonable prospects {{for success in}} the farm operation. Operating loans are made to farmers to help them pay their operating expenses for such productions costs as feed, seed, fertilizer, and pesticides, and to meet other essential operating expenses. The scheduled repayment is usually over 1 to 7 years depending on loan purposes. The interest rate on direct loans is determined by the Farm Service Agency and does not exceed the federal cost of borrowing plus 1 percentage point. However, loans to limited resource borrowers can be made at significantly below market rates. The interest rate on guaranteed loans is negotiated between the borrower and the lender. USDA guarantees the timely <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> 90% <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> and interest on guaranteed loans, and in some cases can subsidize the interest rate on these loans. The amount USDA can directly lend or guarantee each year is determined in the annual congressional appropriations process.|$|R

50|$|A {{guaranteed}} investment contract (GIC) is {{a contract that}} guarantees <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time. Guaranteed investment contracts are typically issued by life insurance companies qualified for favorable tax status under the Internal Revenue Code (for example, 401(k) plans). A GIC is used primarily as a vehicle that yields a higher return than a savings account or United States Treasury securities and GICs are often used as investments for stable value funds. GICs are {{sometimes referred to as}} funding agreements, although this term is often reserved for contracts sold to non-qualified institutions.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{functions}} of the FO loan program is to assist farmers, especially beginning farmers, in the purchase and enlargement of farms. An eligible borrower must be unable to obtain sufficient credit from a commercial lender, but must assure reasonable prospects of success in the farm operation. Loans are made for up to 40 years. The interest rate is determined by USDA, and cannot exceed the cost of funds to the Government plus 1 percentage point. However, direct loans to limited resource borrowers can be made at significantly below the federal cost of funds. The interest rate on guaranteed loans is negotiated between the borrower and the lender. USDA guarantees the timely <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> 90% <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> and interest on guaranteed loans, and in some cases can subsidize the interest rate on these loans.

5000|$|As of 2007 real GDP {{increased}} by {{the highest percentage}} {{since the fall of}} the Soviet Union at 8.1%, the ruble remains stable, inflation has been moderate, and investment began to increase again. In 2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy had achieved [...] "unprecedented macroeconomic stability". Russia is making progress in meeting its foreign debts obligations. During 2000-01, Russia not only met its external debt services but also made large advance <b>repayments</b> <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> on IMF loans but also built up Central Bank reserves with government budget, trade, and current account surpluses. The FY 2002 Russian Government budget assumes payment of roughly $14 billion in official debt service payments falling due. Large current account surpluses have brought a rapid appreciation of the ruble over the past several years. This has meant that Russia has given back much of the terms-of-trade advantage that it gained when the ruble fell by 60% during the debt crisis. Oil and gas dominate Russian exports, so Russia remains highly dependent upon the price of energy. Loan and deposit rates at or below the inflation rate inhibit the growth of the banking system and make the allocation of capital and risk much less efficient than it would be otherwise.|$|R
5000|$|A revenue bond is {{a special}} type of {{municipal}} bond distinguished by its guarantee <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating entity associated {{with the purpose of}} the bonds, rather than from a tax. Unlike general obligation bonds, only the revenues specified in the legal contract between the bond holder and bond issuer are required to be used for <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>principal</b> and interest <b>of</b> the bonds; other revenues (notably tax revenues) and the general credit of the issuing agency are not so encumbered. Because the pledge of security is not as great as that of general obligation bonds, revenue bonds may carry a slightly higher interest rate than G.O. bonds; however, they are usually considered the second-most secure type of municipal bonds.|$|R
