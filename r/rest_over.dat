5|$|The Blackdown Hills form a flat plateau {{dominated}} by hard chert bands, {{made up of}} clay with flints, of Upper Greensand with some remnants of chalk. The cretaceous rocks <b>rest</b> <b>over</b> eroded Jurassic and Triassic beds, with an outcrop of Rhaetian beds. In the western areas the Upper Greensand is devoid of calcareous material but the sands yield fossils of marine bivalves and gastropods (snails) preserved in silica.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Lufthansa Consulting {{was awarded}} a {{management}} contract with Air Madagascar, {{with a view to}} improving the airlines' efficiency and making it an attractive enterprise for privatisation. The airline's creditors in November 2002 agreed to forgive half of the company's debts and rescheduled the <b>rest</b> <b>over</b> a three-year period. Because of the political crisis, the first half of 2001 saw a 66% drop in passenger traffic and a 71% drop in freight, which damaged the airline's revenues. The airline resumed flights to Paris from Antananarivo on 27 April 2003, taking over from Blue Panorama Airlines which had been operating on its behalf since the crisis began.|$|E
25|$|Modern Gourd Dance regalia {{consists}} of a red and blue blanket draped over the shoulders. (This accessory represents night and day). Some dancers change the blanket to <b>rest</b> <b>over</b> the heart red {{during the day and}} blue after dark. A skunk berry (Ka-hole) and silver beaded bandolier fastened on the left shoulder is draped across the heart. The red skunk berry bandolier was added as a memorial tribute to a battle fought with Cheyenne warriors. The aftermath left the land covered with red blood and is represented by the red skunk berries. A handkerchief bundle of Indian perfume, gathered from the foothills, is tied {{to the back of the}} bandolier.|$|E

25|$|The basic physics behind {{neutrino}} oscillation can {{be found}} in any system of coupled harmonic oscillators. A simple example is a system of two pendulums connected by a weak spring (a spring with a small spring constant). The first pendulum is set in motion by the experimenter while the second begins at <b>rest.</b> <b>Over</b> time, the second pendulum begins to swing {{under the influence of the}} spring, while the first pendulum's amplitude decreases as it loses energy to the second. Eventually all of the system's energy is transferred to the second pendulum and the first is at rest. The process then reverses. The energy oscillates between the two pendulums repeatedly until it is lost to friction.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} memorial {{has three}} main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large open windows on either wall and ceiling, {{to commemorate the}} date of the attack. Rumor says the 21 windows symbolically represents a 21-gun salute or 21Marines standing at eternal parade <b>rest</b> <b>over</b> the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site will confirm this was not the architect's intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the sunken decks. It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, leis were tossed in the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen.|$|E
25|$|Glasses, {{also known}} as {{eyeglasses}} or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds {{them in front of}} a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which <b>rest</b> <b>over</b> the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness. Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes {{as well as in the}} lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} works {{have been carried}} out for the {{evaluation}} of a ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundation, supported by geogridreinforced sand and subjected to centric load. Few experimental studies have been made on the calculation of bearing capacity of shallow foundation on geogrid-reinforced sand under eccentric loading. The purpose of this research work is to conduct model tests in the laboratory by utilizing rectangular surface foundation <b>resting</b> <b>over</b> the reinforced sand. The model tests have been conducted using rectangular footing with B/L= 0. 5 & 0. 33. The average relative density kept up throughout all the tests is 69 %. The sand is reinforced by multiple layers (2, 3 & 4) of geogrid. The eccentricity varies from 0 to 0. 15 B with an increment of 0. 05 B. Distance of first layer of geogrid layer from bottom of footing and the distance between two consecutive geogrid layers have been kept constant. The load settlement curve for each tests have been plotted to calculate ultimate bearing capacity. Parametric studies have been made to find the impact of eccentricity on bearing capacity of the foundation. The ultimate bearing capacity of eccentrically loaded square footings can be computed by knowing the ultimate bearing capacity of square footing under central load and a reduction factor (RkR) for reinforced condition. The reduction factor is developed {{based on the results of}} laboratory model tests on geogrid reinforced soil. The ultimate bearing capacity of eccentrically loaded rectangular footing <b>resting</b> <b>over</b> geogrid reinforced sand can be calculated by knowing the ultimate bearing capacity of rectangular footing <b>resting</b> <b>over</b> reinforced sand bed and subjected to central vertical load by using reduction factor (RkR). An equation for reduction factor for rectangular footing <b>resting</b> <b>over</b> geogrid reinforced sand is developed based on laboratory model test results...|$|R
