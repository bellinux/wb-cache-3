40|$|We present time-resolved {{spectrophotometry}} of the pulsating DA {{white dwarf}} G 29 - 38. As in previous broad-band photometry, the light curve shows {{the presence of}} a large number of periodicities. Many of these are combination frequencies, i. e., periodicities occurring at frequencies that are sums or differences of frequencies of stronger, <b>real</b> <b>modes.</b> We identify at least six <b>real</b> <b>modes,</b> and at least five combination frequencies. We measure line-of-sight velocities for our spectra and detect periodic variations at the frequencies of five of the six <b>real</b> <b>modes,</b> with amplitudes of up to 5 km/s. We argue that these variations reflect the horizontal surface motion associated with the g-mode pulsations. No velocity signals are detected at any of the combination frequencies, confirming that the flux variations at these frequencies do not reflect physical pulsation, but rather mixing of frequencies due to a non-linear transformation in the outer layers of the star. We discuss the amplitude ratios and phase differences found for the velocity and light variations, as well as those found for the <b>real</b> <b>modes</b> and their combination frequencies, both in a model-independent way and in the context of models based on the convective-driving mechanism. In a companion paper, we use the wavelength dependence of the amplitudes of the modes to infer their spherical degree. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, mn. sty. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

25|$|To {{maintain}} {{compatibility with}} older operating systems and applications, the 640 KB barrier remained {{part of the}} PC design even after the 8086/8088 had been replaced with the Intel 286 processor, which could address up to 16 MB of memory in Protected mode. The 1 MB barrier also remained {{as long as the}} 286 was running in <b>Real</b> <b>mode,</b> since DOS required <b>Real</b> <b>mode</b> which uses the segment and offset registers in an overlapped manner such that addresses with more than 20 bits are not possible. It is still present in IBM PC compatibles today if they are running in <b>Real</b> <b>mode</b> such as used by DOS. Even the most modern Intel PCs still have the area between 640 and 1024 KB reserved. This however is invisible to programs (or even most of the operating system) on newer operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X) that use virtual memory, because they have no awareness of physical memory addresses at all. Instead they operate within a virtual address space, which is defined independently of available RAM addresses.|$|E

When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; <b>real</b> <b>mode</b> was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while <b>real</b> <b>mode</b> on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 2000, Microsoft {{released}} Windows ME (Millennium Edition), {{the last}} DOS-based version of Windows. Windows ME incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required {{the removal of}} the ability to access a <b>real</b> <b>mode</b> DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs), expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as System File Protection and System Restore, and updated home networking tools. However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of <b>real</b> <b>mode</b> DOS support. PC World considered Windows ME {{to be one of the}} worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{developed}} Windows 3.1, {{which included}} several minor improvements to Windows 3.0, but primarily consisted of bugfixes and multimedia support.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the theoretical basis for modal {{analysis of a}} general nonconservative system. The modal analysis uses only <b>real</b> <b>modes</b> {{in terms of the}} dis-placements as well as velocity coordinates and converts the system to a real, uncoupled, second-order form. This is the flrst time that such a transformation has been presented in the literature. Earlier works pre-sented modal analysis in the flrst-order state-space, of which, only the gyroscopic conservative system analy-sis was conducted with <b>real</b> <b>modes.</b> The modal analysis presented herein is a general framework which can be specialized for speciflc systems, e. g., self-adjoint conser-vative systems or gyroscopic conservative systems. For a self-adjoint conservative system the modal analysis reduces to the normal modal analysis. A byproduct of the modal analysis is the generation of transformations from the original physical coordinates to the real, un-coupled modal space. Such transformations are shown to be quite useful in understanding the behaviour of a nonconservative system. It is used in the present paper to shed light on the destabilizing efiect of damping in circulatory system...|$|R

25|$|The {{protected}} mode of the 80286 was not utilized until {{many years after}} its release, {{in part because of}} the high cost of adding extended memory to a PC, but also because of the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs. For example, in 1986 the only program that made use of it was VDISK, a RAM disk driver included with PC DOS 3.0 and 3.1. A DOS could utilize the additional RAM available in {{protected mode}} (extended memory) either via a BIOS call (INT 15h, AH=87h), as a RAM disk, or as emulation of expanded memory. The difficulty lay in the incompatibility of older real-mode DOS programs with protected mode. They simply could not natively run in this new mode without significant modification. In protected mode, memory management and interrupt handling were done differently than in <b>real</b> <b>mode.</b> In addition, DOS programs typically would directly access data and code segments that did not belong to them, as <b>real</b> <b>mode</b> allowed them to do without restriction; in contrast, the design intent of protected mode was to prevent programs from accessing any segments other than their own unless special access was explicitly allowed. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode environment that allowed all programs access to all segments (by putting all segment descriptors into the GDT and assigning them all the same privilege level), this undermined nearly all of the advantages of protected mode except the extended (24-bit) address space. The choice that OS developers faced was either to start from scratch and create an OS that would not run the vast majority of the old programs, or to come up with a version of DOS that was slow and ugly (i.e., ugly from an internal technical viewpoint) but would still run a majority of the old programs. Protected mode also did not provide a significant enough performance advantage over the 8086-compatible <b>real</b> <b>mode</b> to justify supporting its capabilities; actually, except for task switches when multitasking, it actually yielded only a performance disadvantage, by slowing down many instructions through a litany of added privilege checks. In protected mode, registers were still 16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64kB segments, just like in <b>real</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later, two new {{versions}} were released: Windows/286 2.1 and Windows/386 2.1. Like prior {{versions of}} Windows, Windows/286 2.1 used the real-mode memory model, but {{was the first}} version to support the High Memory Area. Windows/386 2.1 had a protected mode kernel with LIM-standard EMS emulation.

25|$|Microsoft did {{not change}} all of the Windows code to 32-bit; parts of it {{remained}} 16-bit (albeit not directly using <b>real</b> <b>mode)</b> for reasons of compatibility, performance and development time.

25|$|The Intel 80286 had a 24-bit {{address bus}} {{and was able}} to address up to 16MB of RAM, {{compared}} to the 1MB addressability of its predecessor.

25|$|The Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) is the 32-bit {{protected}} mode kernel {{at the core}} of Windows 9x. Its primary responsibility is to create, run, monitor and terminate virtual machines.

The VMM works with virtual devices (loadable kernel modules, which consist mostly of 32-bit ring 0 or kernel mode code, but may include other types of code, such as a 16-bit <b>real</b> <b>mode</b> initialisation segment) to allow those virtual devices to intercept interrupts and faults to control the access that an application has to hardware devices and installed software. Both the VMM and virtual device drivers run in a single, 32-bit, flat model address space at privilege level 0 (also called ring 0). The VMM provides multi-threaded, preemptive multitasking.

On June 15, 2000, the company released a new version of its hand-held operating system, Windows CE 3.0. The main change was the new programming APIs of the software. Previous versions of Windows CE supported only a small subset of the WinAPI, the main development library for Windows, and with Version 3 of Windows CE, the operating system now supported nearly all of the core functionality of the WinAPI. The next update to the consumer line, Windows ME (or Windows Millennium Edition), was released on September 14, 2000.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of time-resolved optical spectra of the ZZ Ceti white dwarf, HS 0507 + 0434 B. Using the wavelength dependence of observed mode amplitudes, we deduce the spherical degree, l, of the modes, most of which have l= 1. The presence {{of a large number of}} combination frequencies (linear sums or differences of the <b>real</b> <b>modes)</b> enabled us not only to test theoretical predictions but also to indirectly infer spherical and azimuthal degrees of <b>real</b> <b>modes</b> that had no observed splittings. In addition to the above, we measure line-of-sight velocities from our spectra. We find only marginal evidence for periodic modulation associated with the pulsation modes: at the frequency of the strongest mode in the lightcurve, we measure an amplitude of 2. 6 +/- 1. 0 km/s, which has a probability of 2 % of being due to chance; for the other modes, we find lower values. Our velocity amplitudes and upper limits are smaller by a factor of two compared to the amplitudes found in ZZ Psc. We find that this is consistent with expectations based on the position of HS 0507 + 0434 B in the instability strip. Combining all the available information from data such as ours is a first step towards constraining atmospheric properties in a convectionally unstable environment from an observational perspective.
