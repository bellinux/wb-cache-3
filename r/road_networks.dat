5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast, particularly in New England. The heightened precautions were {{due in part}} to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24in (610mm) in the town of Ewan. This would make the storm the wettest in state history. The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to <b>road</b> <b>networks.</b> Damage in the state amounted to $4million. Farther north in New England, strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves.

5|$|The {{percentage}} of England's population living in towns {{continued to grow}} but in absolute terms English towns shrunk significantly {{as a consequence of}} the Black Death, especially in the formerly prosperous east. The importance of England's Eastern ports declined over the period, as trade from London and the South-West increased in relative significance. Increasingly elaborate <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> were built across England, some involving the construction of up to thirty bridges to cross rivers and other obstacles. Nonetheless, it remained cheaper to move goods by water, and consequently timber was brought to London from as far away as the Baltic, and stone from Caen brought over the Channel to the South of England. Shipbuilding, particular in the South-West, became a major industry for the first time and investment in trading ships such as cogs was probably the single biggest form of late medieval investment in England.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRoad {{network is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} keys to regional development of a region. The huge developmental cost of the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> demands effective utilisation, which can be attained only when there is proper connectivity and orientation. But the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> in many urban areas develop in an organic growth pattern. Hence a great emphasis needs to be given to the connectivity pattern of the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> Urban <b>road</b> <b>network</b> has less theoretical research. Only some developed countries have carried out the evaluation of urban <b>road</b> <b>network</b> and hence it has great potential for development and application prospects. In this study an attempt has been made to analyse the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> connectivity and spatial pattern existing in Calicut city in India, and hence to determine if the network connectivity can explain significant variance in the spatial pattern of the network structure. Analysis reveals that transport network fractality is directly varying with respect to connectivity and coverage of the study area. Network density could better predict fractality of the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> than any other connectivity indicators. This means that there is significant relationship between the level of <b>road</b> <b>network</b> development and the network spatial structure within the study area...|$|R
