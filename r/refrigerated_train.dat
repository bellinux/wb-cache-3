50|$|Cattle {{were first}} brought to Argentina in 1536 by Spanish conquistadors. Due to the {{geography}} of the Pampas and a small national market, the cattle multiplied rapidly. Railway building within Argentina and the invention of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trains</b> and ships in the late 19th century made an export market and Argentina's beef export industry started to thrive. The flipped seasons between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres meant that Argentine beef came onto the market {{at a time of}} year when beef was less at hand in the Northern Hemisphere, which further lifted the potential export market in the United States and European markets.|$|R
40|$|The {{somatic cell}} count (SCC) of {{refrigerated}} raw milk reflects {{the occurrence of}} mastitis in the herd and the management of rural property. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the SCC of the refrigerated raw milk and its determinant factors in dairy properties of Viçosa, State of Minas Gerais. Monthly, milk samples were taken from 44 cooling tanks during 2012. A structured questionnaire was applied to evaluate the production and management characteristics of the herds. There was a significant variation (p < 0. 05) in the mean SCC of the milk, which was lower from June to August. Higher mean SCC and percentages of samples above the limit set by the legislation were observed in months of higher rainfall and ambient temperature (p < 0. 05). Mechanical milking, lower milk yield, productivity, inadequate milking procedures, equipment hygiene, and water quality were all factors that influenced (p < 0. 05) the SCC of raw <b>refrigerated</b> milk. Milker <b>training</b> is required for production of low SCC milk...|$|R

40|$|We are posting this 10 -year-old {{white paper}} {{to support an}} {{upcoming}} survey description paper for the SDSS-III Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) led by PI Dr. Steven Majewski. The white paper presented here was a contribution to a 2005 "futures" planning process for the Astrophysical Research Consortium led by Dr. Donald York that examined both prospects for extending the work of SDSS and SDSS-II as well as enhancing {{the capabilities of the}} Apache Point 3. 5 -meter telescope and the overall scientific reach of the Consortium. This particular white paper describes the potential for using the Sloan 2. 5 -meter telescope and its fiber optic infrastructure to conduct a galactic plane chemical abundance survey in the low-extinction 1. 6 um H-band. The survey would target > 1000 red giant stars per night selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey using a > 200 fiber near-infrared spectrograph operating at spectral resolution of R~ 24, 000 with a magnitude limit of H~ 12 - very close to the final APOGEE implementation. A number of features suggested in the white paper did not survive to the actual survey including an R~ 3000 low-resolution spectral mode emphasizing kinematics to a fainter magnitude limit of K~ 14, a tunable high-resolution grating (retired by using three HAWAII- 2 RG arrays to cover most of the H-band all at once), a <b>refrigerated</b> optical <b>train</b> (the actual APOGEE is LN 2 cooled), and the use of InGaAs arrays (HgCdTe remained the most mature technology at the time of construction). The white paper also suggests making the APOGEE instrument accessible to the 3. 5 -meter telescope at Apache Point, a project now underway. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{means by}} which crops can be {{improved}} are many and varied. Plant breeding is designed not only to increase yields but also to develop varieties that can thrive under environmental stress (such as drought or salinity) and also resist major pests and diseases. Crop quality is a highly variable characteristic. It is influenced by both {{the treatment of the}} crop during its growth and storage and by any preceeding genetic manipulation. The rising demand for high-quality food has also Increased the demand for plants with specific characteristics that can be obtained through bioscience. Over the last twenty years plant micropropagation has graduated from academic laboratories to industrial complexes. The advantage of micropropagation is the disease-free nature of the material that can be planted. The Royal Agricultural Society of England held a symposium last year on crop improvement with special reference to bioscience which brought together researchers from the world's most important plant genetic research centres. The discussions ranged from the philosophical: 'plant breeding is technology rather than science' to the practical: 'many genebanks In the tropics face rampant genetic erosion' {{because of a lack of}} <b>refrigerated</b> storerooms, <b>trained</b> personnel and financial support. The collection, preservation and distribution of germplasm were presented as a central working theme of the 13 research centres of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Other participants discussed chromosome manipulation, genetic modification, environmental change, and cell and tissue culture. Researchers also considered ethical and theoretical questions such as: How far can bioscience go ? Can the future include a scenario in which non-plant protein will be produced by plants ?

40|$|The {{phase-out}} of CFCs has shed a {{new light}} over natural refrigerants, which have null global warming potentials. Air would be a natural choice, and although the Brayton cycle usually exhibits a lower coefficient of performance when compared to vapor-compression systems of same capacity, it has been considered in applications other than aircraft cooling. These include gas separation, food processing and preservation, <b>refrigerated</b> containers and <b>train</b> air-conditioning. Price perspectives in the oil market also make the Brayton cycle an alternative to be considered as an option for automotive air conditioning. Even though the Brayton cycle is often employed in low temperature applications, the ambient humidity level {{is essential for the}} uninterrupted operation. For applications far below the ambient air dew point, the condensate is likely to cause icing at the turbine outlet, causing duct obstruction and system failure. The use of a solid desiccant would provide a thorough humidity control, allowing for increased pressure ratios (and thus lower expansion temperatures) even for significant ambient humidity levels. In the standard Brayton refrigeration cycle, the air is collected by the compressor at ambient conditions, and compressed through a specified compression ratio. The air is then cooled back to the ambient temperature at a regenerator, and sub-sequentially expanded through a turbine to the ambient pressure, at a low temperature. At the proposed cycle, the air is collected by a desiccant wheel and dehumidified, before it is admitted to the compressor. Accordingly, it can be compressed under a significant pressure ratio, without incurring in ice formation when later expanded. The desiccant wheel is dried using the hot air at the compressor outlet, by a heat exchanger which collects the heat that would be otherwise dumped by the regenerator. A mathematical model for the proposed cycle is developed, consisting of a system of non-linear equations which stems from mass and energy balances applied to each individual cycle component. The results show that the desiccant assisted cycle allows for frost-free operation even for temperatures below - 60 °C, which is required for fish preservation warehouses...|$|R

3000|$|The working {{conditions}} of the RR/CMc/SCNDP {{can be described as}} follows. Let G S, G T, and G D signify the sets of supply, transportation, and demand sites, respectively. Also, the G 0 is defined as the set of all supply and transportation sites (G 0  = G S ∪ G T), the sites for which close/open decisions are necessary. The set G 0 can be called [...] "facilities". All of the facilities and transportation links are capacitated and have a maximum level (capacity) in order to service to the demand sites. Suppose S be the set of scenarios, each of which distinguishes a set of facilities, transportation links, and transportation vehicles that are simultaneously disrupted. Suppose s =  0 as the nominal scenario in which no disturbances happen. The set P illustrates several types of products that should be produced and transported to the demand sites. The set L presents different kinds of transportation links. For example, for each link, it is assumed that three various quality levels (i.e., |L| =  3) may be considered; each of which is defined as follows: the paved road with the standard quality (type 1), the paved road with low quality (type 2), and the dirt road (type 3). As seen, if a link with type 1 quality is constructed, its establishment cost will be more than the other types, while its capacity is more and its transportation cost is lower than the other quality types of transportation links. Here, links (roads) with three quality types are defined; however, several quality types can be defined for the problem. Also, the set V shows several types of transportation vehicles. The best type of the vehicle has the highest cost of investment, but the lowest cost of transportation and the worst type is vice versa. Several vehicles, which can be used and categorized as different types of vehicles are airplane, helicopter, <b>train,</b> <b>refrigerated</b> pickups/truck, etc. These vehicles are selected with regard to the required investment cost, the necessity of the product (e.g., drug or medical service), probability of system risk, or other practical factors.|$|R
