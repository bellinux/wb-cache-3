25|$|On August 3, a VCheKa {{section for}} combating counterrevolution, {{speculation}} and sabotage on railways was created. On August 7, 1918, Sovnarkom adopted a decree {{on the organization}} of the <b>railway</b> <b>section</b> at VCheKa. Combating counterrevolution, speculation, and malfeasance on railroads was passed {{under the jurisdiction of the}} <b>railway</b> <b>section</b> of VCheKa and local Cheka. In August 1918, railway sections were formed under the Gubcheks. Formally, they were part of the non-resident sections, but in fact constituted a separate division, largely autonomous in their activities. The gubernatorial and oblast-type Chekas retained in relationship to the transportation sections only control and investigative functions.|$|E

25|$|The first {{residents}} of Embrun settled {{the town in}} 1845. François Michel named the town in 1857 after Embrun, France. The town's early economy was based on lumber, as the area was heavily forested and the soils too moist for good agriculture. In the 1870s, however, with deforestation {{and the advent of}} land drainage technologies, agriculture replaced lumber as Embrun's main industry. The town grew rapidly in the late 19th century, a trend accelerated by the advent of the railway in 1898 (see <b>Railway</b> <b>section</b> below).|$|E
25|$|The Madrid–Galicia {{high-speed}} rail line will connect {{the city of}} Madrid with the region of Galicia and the Atlantic Axis {{high-speed rail}} line in the North West of Spain via Santiago de Compostela.

Construction on the northernmost part of this section between the cities of Ourense and Santiago de Compostela began late 2004 and this part was inaugurated in December 2011. The southern part between Olmedo and Zamora entered revenue service on 17 December 2015. Constructions on the central part, which crosses some of Spain's most remote and fragile nature areas, are expected be completed in 2019. The line is currently served by Alvia trains.|$|E
25|$|From 1920, semi-official {{histories}} {{had been}} written by Hermann von Kuhl, the 1st Army Chief of Staff in 1914, Der Deutsche Generalstab in Vorbereitung und Durchführung des Weltkrieges (1920) and Der Marnefeldzug in 1921, by Lieutenant-Colonel Wolfgang Förster who had written Graf Schlieffen und der Weltkrieg (1925), Wilhelm Groener, head of Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, the wartime German General Staff) <b>railway</b> <b>section</b> in 1914, published Das Testament des Grafen Schlieffen: Operativ Studien über den Weltkrieg in 1929 and Gerhard Tappen, head of the OHL operations section in 1914, had written Bis zur Marne 1914: Beiträge zur Beurteilung der Kriegführen bis zum Abschluss der Marne-Schlacht in 1920. The writers called the Schlieffen Memorandum of 1905–06 an infallible blueprint and that all Moltke (the Younger) {{had to do was}} implement it, to almost guarantee that the war in the west would be won in August 1914. Instead, Moltke had diluted the plan, by increasing the force of the left wing {{at the expense of the}} right and this had caused the failure to defeat decisively the French armies. By 1945, the official historians had also published two series of popular histories but in April, the Reichskriegsschule building in Potsdam was bombed and nearly all of the war diaries, orders, plans, maps, situation reports and telegrams usually available to historians studying the wars of bureaucratic states, were destroyed.|$|E
