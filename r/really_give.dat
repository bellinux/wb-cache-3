25|$|One {{objection}} is that {{a democratic}} republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech {{in the context of}} the ritual of pledging allegiance. Another objection is that the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot <b>really</b> <b>give</b> their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making. Another criticism {{is that a}} government requiring or promoting this phrase violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

[...] There was originally a joke in the episode in which a gay couple walked into [...] "Flaming Moe's", assuming {{that it was a}} gay bar because of the name.

They never saw one another as children {{and he did not}} know them at all. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a [...] "carefree, well-to-do man who didn't <b>really</b> <b>give</b> a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant.

Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series, but had not contacted her or her representatives. Eventually, Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that [...] "nothing's happened yet". He continued in his interview with E! Online: [...] "I'd kill to get Jennifer on the show, and if I had any inclination it was happening, I would be telling everybody 'cause I don't <b>really</b> <b>give</b> a sh-t.

And my family’s in it." [...] A 15-second preview {{of the project was}} released on April 14, 2014, while the final product was premiered through the online retailer Ssense on April 16, 2014. It was the first of several [...] "shoppable" [...] music videos released through the retailer, in partnership with London magazine System.

It's the perfect conclusion to a consistently surprising hip-hop album." [...] Lauren Martin of Fact gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "In short, on My Name Is My Name, Pusha doesn’t <b>really</b> <b>give</b> much away about his past, present or future, and it's a disconcerting thought for an album posited as a vanguard for a more [...] "real" [...] presentation of rap."

[...] Anthony Pascale, in his review for TrekMovie.com, said that the production design in the episode was the best yet for New Voyages. He credited this to the direction and improvements in the lighting, {{as well as the}} improved special effects. Pascale said that the guest appearances of Moses and Takei [...] "fits in the fine tradition of memorable Trek guest characters", saying that the [...] "alluring" [...] Moses played Alana with a [...] "subtle charm". Overall, he said that [...] "fans of fan films and Star Trek: New Voyages are sure to be pleased.

500|$|... 20th Century Fox, Gracie Films, and Film Roman {{produced}} an animated The Simpsons film that {{was released on}} July 27, 2007. The production staff of The Simpsons had entertained {{the thought of a}} film since early in the series, but production never came together. Groening felt a feature-length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series. The film was directed by David Silverman and written by a team of Simpsons writers comprising Groening, Brooks, Jean, Reiss, Mirkin, Scully, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards and did not cease, taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. He also wanted to make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, as [...] "we wanna <b>really</b> <b>give</b> you something that you haven't seen before." [...] Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded.|$|E
500|$|The 30 March 1967 photo {{session with}} Cooper also {{produced}} {{the back cover}} and the inside gatefold, which the musicologist Ian Inglis describes as conveying [...] "an obvious and immediate warmth... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images". McCartney explained: [...] "One {{of the things we}} were very much into in those days was eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; <b>really</b> <b>give</b> love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, {{if you look at it}} you'll see the big effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms. Moore believes that the inclusion of these items helped fans [...] "pretend to be in the band". However, many others have speculated that there may be a deeper meaning.|$|E
500|$|In July 1969, Hammill {{had begun}} {{performing}} solo at The Marquee in London, and {{since there was}} no group, he decided to record what was intended to be his first solo album at Trident Studios on 31 July and 1 August, with Banton, Evans, and Ellis as session musicians. However, through a deal worked out by Stratton-Smith, the album, The Aerosol Grey Machine, was released in September 1969 by Mercury under the band's name in return for releasing the band from their contract. The album was initially only released in the United States with hardly any promotion at all, so sales were minimal, but the group decided to reform {{in the middle of the}} recording session. Ellis had already committed to joining Juicy Lucy and was replaced by Evan's former bandmate in The Misunderstood, Nic Potter. The band had also enjoyed flautist Jeff Peach's contributions to the album and wanted to recruit a further instrumentalist. [...] "There was always the idea of having another melodic instrument," [...] recalled Evans. [...] "He 'll play a solo, sure, and <b>really</b> <b>give</b> it something, but he doesn't want to do that all the time." [...] Peach was approached to become a full-time member, but dropped out after one rehearsal. The position was eventually filled by saxophonist and flautist David Jackson, who had previously played in a band called Heebalob with Smith. Hammill had already sat in with Heebalob at the Plumpton National Jazz Festival on 9 August, and, impressed by Jackson's playing, invited him to join the band, partly because he also needed a flatmate to help pay with the rent.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} of the series {{positive}} reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8.2/10 based on 5 reviews. Jim Kaz of IGN gave the season a similar score at 8/10. While at first hesitant of the series, believing it to be [...] "another horror/sci-fi/occult hybrid currently igniting ratings", he found the [...] "eerie and intricate storylines" [...] to overcome the [...] "initial impressions of Clearasil ads and Paris Hilton in House of Wax". Praising the cliffhangers and the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors, Kaz deemed Supernatural [...] "one-helluva edge-of-your-seat, ball-burner of a series with a forceful script, excellent acting (said pretty boys included) and some fine special effects". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune thoroughly enjoyed the season, and [...] "really, really liked" [...] the Roadhouse. Not understanding why the Roadhouse was not used more throughout the season, she was [...] "pretty annoyed" [...] when it was destroyed. Ryan also favored the new hunter characters, especially Ash, and was [...] "not thrilled" [...] when Ash was killed. Regarding Sam and Dean, she noted the series' [...] "ability [...] the brotherly conflicts and emotions threaded through a well-plotted monster-of-the-week story". While she enjoyed Tricia Helfer's guest appearance, she did not enjoy the stunt casting of Linda Blair and would have preferred a [...] "more skilled actress". The season received a grade of a B- from Brian Tallerico of UGO, who found it [...] "frustrating" [...] due {{to the use of}} the [...] "same predictable formula" [...] that did not meet the standards of the first season. Other problems he found included [...] "the brothers [...] whiny and mopey and [...] everything too seriously". However, he believed that the season ended [...] "strong"—he liked how the main storyline was wrapped up, opening new storylines—and noted that there were some [...] "excellent" [...] episodes. Tallerico praised the [...] "tongue-in-cheek Winchester adventure" [...] "The Usual Suspects", feeling that it had [...] "enough pop culture references to make Tarantino jealous" [...] and the [...] "pitch-perfect mix of tones that make the show so great". He also found [...] "Nightshifter" [...] to be the [...] "best action hour of Supernaturals second year", deeming it [...] "riveting from beginning to end". Also applauding the season's cliffhanger was Peter Brown of iFMagazine, who gave the season a B+. He enjoyed the expansion of the series' mythology, as well as the new characters introduced. He also praised the [...] "haunting music and sounds that <b>really</b> <b>give</b> a chilling feel to each and every episode", feeling them to be Emmy-worthy.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the series}} finale, Gilligan {{said that it}} was {{difficult}} to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: [...] "I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore." [...] Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's character intrigued him so much that he [...] "didn't <b>really</b> <b>give</b> much thought on how well it would sell," [...] stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was [...] "such an odd, dark story" [...] that could have difficulties being pitched to studios.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also written}} by Asser that Alfred {{did not learn}} to read until he {{was twelve years old}} or later, which is {{described}} as [...] "shameful negligence" [...] of his parents and tutors.

A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; [...] "I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest." [...] After excitedly asking, [...] "Will you <b>really</b> <b>give</b> this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?" [...] Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.|$|E
