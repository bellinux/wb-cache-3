40|$|In this study, {{we present}} {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> of electric utilities in the United States over the period, 1990 - 2004. This is a period marked by major attempts to introduce competition in the industry {{with the expectation that}} it will lead firms to improve their <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> and ultimately to lower consumer prices. The actual experience has been surprising, since electricity prices have either fallen little or even risen sharply in some states. Relying on recent advances in the estimation of <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency,</b> we find that firms in jurisdictions that adopted competitive mechanisms have lower <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> compared to firms in jurisdictions where rate-of-return regulation was retained. Furthermore, we provide evidence that firms in states that adopted competition have experienced decreases in <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency,</b> while firms in states with traditional regulation saw increases in efficiency over time. Since the introduction of deregulation has brought greater discretion to managers, we also examine the impact of various organizational choices on <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Interestingly, the separation of the generation function from other functions, a hallmark of the effort to deregulate the industry, is associated with an adverse impact on <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency.</b> These findings question the claim that competition necessarily fosters higher <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Alternatively, true competition may have been circumvented. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of agricultural biotechnology {{and the subsequent}} introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the food system {{have been among the}} most controversial issues surrounding the increasingly scrutinized agri-food system. They have received considerable attention in the economics literature with the main focus being on the optimal regulatory response to products of biotechnology. This paper builds on the literature on the regulation of products of biotechnology by placing the analysis of labeling decisions in a multi-country context. Specifically, the objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effect of the strategic interdependence between countries on their regulatory responses to products of biotechnology. The paper analyzes the strategic effects of national regulatory decisions on labeling of GM products and identifies the determinants of the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium labeling regimes in a small number of producing countries that supply the world market of an agricultural product. Analytical results show that the Nash equilibrium configuration of labeling regimes in countries that have adopted the GM technology depends on (i) the distribution of consumer preferences and the level of consumer aversion to GM products; (ii) the size of the segregation and labeling costs in these countries; (iii) the <b>relative</b> <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the cost effectiveness of the GM technology; (iv) the market power of the life science companies; and (v) the strength of intellectual property rights in these countries. ...|$|E
40|$|Asian {{container}} ports {{suffer from}} a number of problems including insufficient port and/or terminal capacity, inefficient management and bureaucratic administration. This may be {{due in part to the}} fact that the majority of the region’s ports are controlled and/or operated by public entities. To deal with these problems, port authorities of a number of countries in the region have launched programmes that aim to attract private capital into both the existing and new facilities. As a conse-quence, these schemes have kick-started a revolutionary new operating milieu where inter- and even intra-port competition is rife. In many instances, this has engendered the perception that organi sational restructuring (including privatisation) is not only desirable, but necessary. A key claim made with respect to organisational reforms is that the transformation of ownership from public to private sector will improve economic efficiency, as well as general welfare. Associated eco-nomic theories and existing empirical studies, however, fail to establish clear-cut evidence supporting this claim. Indeed, econometric analysis of the <b>relative</b> <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the port sector pre- and post-privatisation seems to suggest that ownership itself does not seem to be categorically related to efficiency in port operations.

There was a significant {{growth in the number of}} government companies in India that effectively crowded out the entry and growth of private enterprise. This took place from the mid to late 1950 s to the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. Correspondingly, the amount of private equity capital invested in firms declined until the late 1980 s and early 1990 s when there was an upsurge of private investment activity. Another feature was that a small number of government companies absorbed most of the corporate sector equity investment in India. The growth in the share of government companies in India that crowded out the entry and growth of private enterprises has had a significantly negative effect on India's industrial competitiveness. After the introduction of reforms in 1991, {{there has been a}} significant crowding in by private enterprises, displacing the government companies from their key position as holders of a very large portion of equity capital, and also reversing the trend in the decline of competitiveness of Indian industry as a whole.

The <b>relative</b> <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> of public ports visâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 4 aâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 4 vis private ports is evaluated in terms of efficiency frontiers of the industry at a fairly high degree of rigour. By applying the techniques of efficiency measurement the various ways that a British port producer might depart from overall productive efficiency were systematically explored. These include: production on {{the interior of the}} production possibilities set; production in the congested region of the boundary of the production possibilities set; and deviation from the scale that arises from the longâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 4 run competitive equilibrium. As well as static productive performance, productive performance relative to dynamic production frontiers is also the subject of investigation. Both mathematical programming techniques and econometric techniques are employed. To fulfil the tasks in the empirical analysis, the econometric approach has been enhanced in two ways. First, a less restrictive structure of production technology is specified in estimating efficiency frontiers in order to define parametric measures in a more meaningful way. Second, Solow's (1957) measure of productivity growth is reconsidered in a context of stochastic frontier functions, which enables us to translate efficiency gains over time into a movement towards frontiers and a movement of the frontiers. As far as British ports are concerned we found no evidence for believing the inefficiency associated with public ownership to be unavoidable.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine and compare hot metal and cold type production of display advertising for newspapers. The classical hot metal system uses a lead alloy as its basic building material while modern cold type production uses photographic means. Some advantages of using cold type are the improved quality of the final product, increased versatility in ad composition, possibilities for major labor savings, the lower skills required for the compositor and less production space required for the machinery. Some disadvantages of cold type production are the major investment required for new equipment, higher materials costs, difficulty in producing proofs, labor relations and retraining difficulties, and the durability of the press plates. The data for the hot metal method consisted of a sample of 195 ads. The eight major operations studied were Markup Time, Type Slips Time, Stereotype Time, Typesetting Time, Composing Time, Proof Pulling Time, and Correction Time. Thirty-seven factors, such as {{the size of the}} ad and the number of lines of type, were hypothesized to effect the operation times. These operation times and factors were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis to formulate a mathematical model of the hot metal system. For this cold type system, circumstances prevented making a complete model but data for a sample of 15 ads was collected. The data for the sample of cold type ads was used in the hot metal regression model to determine comparable times for production of the ads by both systems. Experimental results showed that it would take three times as long to compose the ads by hot metal. When combined labor and materials costs are considered, hot metal costs 1. 6 to 2. 8 times as much as cold type depending on the wage rates considered and the <b>relative</b> <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> of both plants. Administrative and most overhead costs were considered to remain constant no matter what production system was used. The depreciation rate for the cold type operations is 3. 06 times that of the hot metal system studied. Recommendations for further study include: 1. Reevaluate hot metal regression model using transformations in order to reduce non-linearities. 2. Reformulate the cold type system so that equivalent production work can be measured to produce a cold type regression model. 3. Extend the study of cold type and hot metal into news and classified production. 4, Use the complex regression models to determine major variables so that simplified models could easily be prepared by any interested newspaper. 5, Determine realistic cost comparisons including the effects of unequal depreciation rates, taxes, and interest. 6.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a model capturing managers' disclosure policies in settings in which disclosure is rewarded {{by the financial}} market because disclosure implies that managers are endowed with information and endowment of information may potentially improve the firm's <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency.</b> It provides sufficient condition for a threshold disclosure equilibrium to obtain and compares disclosure policies in a setting in which endowment of information improves the firm's <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> with disclosure policies in a setting in which endowment of information has {{no impact on the}} firm's <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Managers' disclosure policies are shown to depend crucially on whether the endowment of information is exogenous or endogenous. When the endowment of information is exogenous, an increase in the usefulness of information in improving the firm's <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> leads to a decrease in the disclosure threshold and hence an increase in the amount of information disclosed. In contrast, when the endowment of information is endogenous, an increase in the usefulness of information in improving the firm's <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> has no effect on the disclosure threshold but leads to a decrease in the probability with which information is acquired and hence a decrease in the amount of information disclosed. As, in the threshold disclosure equilibrium, the net present value of information acquisition arising from any increase in production efficiency is negative, an increase in the usefulness of information in improving the firm's <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> thus reduces the inefficiency caused by information acquisition.

40|$|A central {{objective}} of port privatization and/or deregulation policies is stimulating greater efficiency by engendering {{a more competitive}} market and commercial approach to management. Korea provides {{a prime example of}} a nation that is implementing such policies. Also, its ports play a pivotal role in world shipping, particularly in the ever-burgeoning container market. The success of these policies in increasing the <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Korean container terminals is assessed. The UK container terminal sector provides a useful benchmark for comparison since privatization and deregulation have formed an integral part of UK port reforms for nearly 20 years and the effect on efficiency, having had time to mature, will be much easier to gauge. The stochastic frontier model is justified as the chosen methodology for estimating <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> levels and is applied to cross-sectional data under a variety of distributional assumptions.

Results are consistent and suggest (1) The degree of private sector involvement in sample container terminals is positively related to <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> and (2) Improved <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> has followed the implementation of privatization and deregulation policies within the Korean sector. Even though not categorical, these conclusions are important because the market for container throughput is internationally competitive and if policies which promote competition between Korean container terminals lead to greater <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency,</b> this will inevitably make the sector as a whole more competitive internationally. ...|$|R

To compare this approach with classical bed capacity planning techniques. Methods: A simulated data-based evaluation of the impact that the variability in hospital department activity produces upon the performance of methods used for determining the number of beds required. The evaluation criteria included <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> measured by the bed occupancy rate, accessibility measured by the transfer rate of patients due to lack of available beds and a proxy of clinical effectiveness, by the proportion of days during which there is no possibility for unscheduled admission. Results: When the variability of the number of daily patients increases, the Target Occupancy Rate favors <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency</b> at the expense of accessibility and proxy clinical effectiveness. On the contrary, when the variability of the department activity is marginal, the Target Activity Rate penalizes the proxy of clinical effectiveness, and the Target Occupancy Rate underoptimizes <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The method we propose led to a superior performance in terms of accessibility and proxy of clinical effectiveness at the expense of <b>productive</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Such a situation is suitable for intensive care units.
