[...] In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The patient needs to be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA testing prior to performing the test (see below).

Sweden has long tradition of opportunistic screening services.

In this retrospective cohort study we describe the testing behavior for genital Chlamydia trachomatis among youth in Stockholm County, with a focus on <b>repeated</b> <b>testing.</b> Specifically we (a) study positivity rates among single and repeat testers, we (b) estimate the incidence of <b>repeat</b> <b>testing</b> and the rates of infection in <b>repeat</b> <b>testing</b> episodes, and we (c) estimate time to <b>repeat</b> <b>testing</b> and factors associated with <b>repeat</b> <b>testing.</b> All youth (aged ≥ 12 and < 26) that tested for Chlamydia trachomatis in one of 33 Youth Health Clinics in Stockholm County between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012 were included in the study. The cohort comprised a total of 65, 951 individuals who did 119, 699 tests during the study period. 42 % of youth were repeat testers, the incidence of <b>repeat</b> <b>testing</b> was 35. 0 / 100 person years.

Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was employed to assess the repeatability of GM levels. In a subset of 14 GM positive sera, <b>repeat</b> <b>testing</b> was performed on both the original serum and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) pre-treated sample. There was a significant reduction in GM signals on <b>repeat</b> <b>testing</b> following ST storage (median GM index: 0. 65 vs. 0. 19; p < 0. 001) and LT storage (median GM index: 0. 56 vs. 0. 10; p < 0. 001) of serum samples. Of samples that were initially GM positive, an average GM index reduction of 50 % was seen, with approximately two-thirds becoming GM negative on <b>repeat</b> <b>testing</b> of the same sample. In contrast, GM signal loss was not seen on <b>repeat</b> <b>testing</b> of BAL fluid following ST or LT storage. When GM positive serum samples were <b>repeat</b> <b>tested</b> using EDTA pre-treated serum from the first step of the testing protocol, all samples remained GM positive. In contrast, when the same samples were <b>repeat</b> <b>tested</b> from the original collected serum, 9 samples (64 %) became GM negative. The significant reduction in GM signals during ST and LT storage of serum samples has implications for clinical management.

A subset of specimens was forwarded for confirmatory assays (Gen-Probe) individualized for alternative N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis targets. An 18 -month audit revealed that 230 of 29, 977 C. trachomatis screens (0. 8 %) and 41 of 29, 064 N. gonorrhoeae assays (0. 1 %) yielded low-positive data. When a subset of 40 low-positive N. gonorrhoeae screens was <b>repeat</b> <b>tested,</b> 20 (50. 0 %) remained positive; 22 (55. 0 %) of the screens remained positive following performance of the confirmatory assay.

40|$|Objective: People {{who manage}} newborn hearing {{screening}} programs are often told that repeating OAE hearing screening {{more than two}} or three times per ear unacceptably increases the probability of false-negatives (i. e., passing babies who have permanent hearing loss). This study evaluated the accuracy of that recommendation. Design: A 2. 0 cc coupler and three human ears with hearing loss were used to estimate the number of false-negative results per 1, 000 OAE screening tests. Using those results, together with the prevalence of hearing loss among newborns, we calculated the number of babies that would be missed due to <b>repeated</b> <b>testing.</b> Results: If 100, 000 newborn ears were each tested 10 times, only 1 % of the ears with hearing loss would be missed due to statistical probability of false-negatives resulting from <b>repeated</b> <b>testing.</b> Conclusions: Excessive <b>repeated</b> <b>testing</b> in a newborn hearing screening program waste time, raises questions about the accuracy of the test, and may disturb the infant, family, or hospital staff.
