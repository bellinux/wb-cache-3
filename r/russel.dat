5|$|Applewood Farm is a {{farmstead}} in Ledyard, Connecticut, United States. Constructed in 1826 by <b>Russel</b> Gallup, {{the farmhouse}} was built with a colonial center chimney design with Federal style details {{that has been}} modernized to the early 20th century without significantly changing the floor plan. Named after the apple orchards planted by <b>Russel</b> Gallup, Applewood Farm developed significantly under the ownership of Everett Gallup, the last {{member of the family}} to own the property. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen and a 40-acre parcel was sold off in November 1984. After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 1987, the property included five contributory structures, the farmhouse, corn crib, barn, silo and chicken coop. The property also has one non-contributing structure, a machinery shed from the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|Sixty skin biopsies of fifty-eight {{non-treated}} {{patients with}} cutaneous leishmaniasis from Nicaragua were studied. Biopsies were classified according to Ridley's histopathologic groups: 36 (60 %) {{were included in}} group B (diffuse necrosis), 14 in group C (focal necrosis), 7 (11. 6 %) in group D (reactive tuberculoid). Only three biopsies remained unclassified. None of our cases could be included in groups A and E. Immunohistochemistry disclosed in 17 cases <b>Russel's</b> bodies secreting IgM and only one IgG positive. There was no correlation between the histopathologic groups {{and the presence of}} <b>Russel's</b> bodies. However, we believe the presence of <b>Russel's</b> bodies help the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Correlation between morphological patterns and the different leishmania species was also considered...|$|R

5|$|This naturalistic {{explanation}} fitted {{well with}} the recent account of evolution by Alfred <b>Russel</b> Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined in his famous 1859 book The Origin of Species.

5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a {{new term}} coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred <b>Russel</b> Wallace's concept of warning coloration.

Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E

5|$|Many readers {{praised the}} series for its {{attention}} to detail and realism {{in the area of}} military tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's military experience (he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible. He frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals, and also credits his friend Lee <b>Russel,</b> a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E
