50|$|The heating {{from the}} core creates a thermal head that assists the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> in {{recirculating}} the water inside of the RPV. A BWR can be designed with no <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> and rely entirely on the thermal head to recirculate the water inside of the RPV. The forced recirculation head from the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> is very useful in controlling power, however, and allows achieving higher power levels that would not otherwise be possible.

5000|$|On March 28, 2010, {{there was}} a fire in a {{lubrication}} system for one of the water pumps that feeds water for generation of steam. Reactor power automatically lowered to 68% due to the reduction in feed water flow, and the fire was extinguished in less than three hours. Two plant fire brigade personnel were brought to a local hospital for [...] "heat stress" [...] following the fire. No customers lost power during this event. On February 9, 2016, the plant was unexpectedly shut down for maintenance to a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump.</b> The reactor was brought back to full power by February 20, 2016.|$|E
50|$|The launch was {{originally}} scheduled for 28 April, {{the first day}} of a 31-day launch period when Earth and Venus were properly aligned. However, the liftoff was scrubbed at T-31 seconds because of a problem with the liquid hydrogen <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> on Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) No. 1, and a vapor leak in the liquid hydrogen recirculation line between the orbiter and external tank. On the rescheduledliftoff date of 4 May 1989, the launch was again delayed until the final five minutes of the launch window due to cloud cover and excessive crosswinds at KSCs Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF). Good landing conditions were required at the SLF in case of a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) abort early in the flight.|$|E
50|$|The first {{reactors}} to use internal <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> {{were designed}} by ASEA-Atom (now Westinghouse Electric Company by way of mergers and buyouts, {{which is owned by}} Toshiba) and built in Sweden. These plants have operated very successfully for many years.|$|R
50|$|Unit 2 of {{the station}} was scrammed from 100% power to a {{shutdown}} on June 1, 2016, at 9 am. The reactor was shut down due to an electrical fault, causing the stopping of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps.</b> The steam bypass valves {{that lead to the}} main condenser were opened and Limerick went through a normal hot shutdown process.|$|R
50|$|The RPV and Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) have {{significant}} improvements, {{such as the}} substitution of RIPs, eliminating conventional external recirculation piping loops and pumps in the containment that in turn drive jet pumps producing forced flow in the RPV. RIPs provide significant improvements related to reliability, performance and maintenance, including a reduction in occupational radiation exposure related to containment activities during maintenance outages. These pumps are powered by wet-rotor motors with the housings connected {{to the bottom of}} the RPV and eliminating large diameter external recirculation pipes that are possible leakage paths. The 10 internal <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> are located at the bottom of the annulus downcomer region (i.e., between the core shroud and the inside surface of the RPV). Consequently, internal <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> eliminate all of the jet pumps in the RPV, all of the large external <b>recirculation</b> loop <b>pumps</b> and piping, the isolation valves and the large diameter nozzles that penetrated the RPV and needed to suction water from and return it to the RPV. This design therefore reduces the worst leak below the core region to effectively equivalent to a 2 in leak. The conventional BWR3-BWR6 product line has an analogous potential leak of 24 or more inches in diameter. A major benefit of this design is that it greatly reduces the flow capacity required of the ECCS.|$|R
50|$|The SLCS is {{a backup}} to the reactor {{protection}} system. In {{the event that}} RPS is unable to scram the reactor for any reason, the SLCS will inject a liquid boron solution into the reactor vessel {{to bring it to}} a guaranteed shutdown state prior to exceeding any containment or reactor vessel limits. The standby liquid control system is designed to deliver the equivalent of 86 gpm of 13% by weight sodium pentaborate solution into a 251-inch BWR reactor vessel. SLCS, in combination with the alternate rod insertion system, the automatic <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> trip and manual operator actions to reduce water level in the core will ensure that the reactor vessel does not exceed its ASME code limits, the fuel does not suffer core damaging instabilities, and the containment does not fail due to overpressure during the most extreme full power scram failure.|$|E
5000|$|Boiling water {{reactors}} {{generally have}} negative void coefficients, and in normal operation the negative void coefficient allows reactor {{power to be}} adjusted by changing the rate of water flow through the core. However, the negative void coefficient can cause an unplanned reactor power increase in events (such as sudden closure of a steamline valve) where the reactor pressure is suddenly increased. In addition, the negative void coefficient can result in power oscillations {{in the event of}} a sudden reduction in core flow, such as might be caused by a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> failure. Boiling water reactors are designed to ensure that the rate of pressure rise from a sudden steamline valve closure is limited to acceptable values, and they include multiple safety systems designed to ensure that any sudden reactor power increases or unstable power oscillations are terminated before fuel or piping damage can occur.|$|E
5000|$|E. Suction Cleaner: In {{the opinion}} of the {{committee}} the only satisfactory method of removing the dirt, hair, etc., settling on the bottom of a pool is by means of a suction cleaner. As such cleaners are commonly operated by the circulation pumps; they may be classed as an adjunct to the recirculation system. When a suction cleaner is to be operated by the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump,</b> a gate with graduated stem or other registering device should be provided for throttling the flow from the pool outlet to permit the pump to operate at maximum efficiency when the suction cleaner is in use. Fixed pipe connections for attachment of suction cleaner to pump suction should be of ample size to reduce friction to a minimum and the cleaner and all removable connections should be designed to provide a maximum velocity at the suction nozzle.XXVI Cleaning PoolA.

50|$|The mPower {{incorporates}} several {{features of}} the boiling water reactor (BWR). Like a BWR, the mPower reactor's primary coolant/moderator was highly purified water (with no boric acid). The Reactor Water Cleanup System ensures that primary system water remains pure. Similar to the ABWR, the mPower reactor had integral coolant <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> inside the Integral Reactor Vessel (IRV). The mPower reactor control rods are inserted {{from the top of}} the core and insert upon scram under gravity. All of the primary coolant was in the liquid phase during normal operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{two-phase}} fluid (water and steam) above the core enters the riser area, {{which is the}} upper region contained inside of the shroud. The height of this region may be increased to increase the thermal natural <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumping</b> head. At {{the top of the}} riser area is the moisture separator. By swirling the two-phase flow in cyclone separators, the steam is separated and rises upwards towards the steam dryer while the water remains behind and flows horizontally out into the downcomer or annulus region. In the downcomer or annulus region, it combines with the feedwater flow and the cycle repeats.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{there are}} also other means of {{controlling}} reactivity. In the PWR design a soluble neutron absorber, usually boric acid, {{is added to the}} reactor coolant allowing the complete extraction of the control rods during stationary power operation ensuring an even power and flux distribution over the entire core. Operators of the BWR design use the coolant flow through the core to control reactivity by varying the speed of the reactor <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps.</b> An increase in the coolant flow through the core improves the removal of steam bubbles, thus increasing the density of the coolant/moderator with the result of increasing power.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 This {{study focused}} on the {{potential}} water and energy savings from implementing a revised schedule of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> connected to a condensing gas tankless water heater located in a study home in Portland, Oregon. The existing <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> activation schedule was studied for {{its impact on the}} overall water use and energy efficiency of the water heater. Utilizing the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> for water events was found to reduce overall water consumption by 14. 84 times the consumption when not using the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump.</b> The use of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> was also found to reduce the energy efficiency of the water heater by 7. 82 %. Based on these findings, a revised schedule was developed for homeowner adoption. Regional expansion of this technology was examined through the development of a suitability index that highlighted building and homeowner characteristics likely to lead to technological adoption. This suitability index was applied to a map of the Portland metro area to identify suitability hotspots for energy policy applications on a larger scale. Results of the expanded analysis indicated that there are significant impacts to water consumption and energy efficiency with the adoption of this technology.

50|$|For example, if {{the reactor}} got too hot, it would trigger {{a system that}} would release soluble neutron {{absorbers}} (generally a solution of borated materials, or a solution of borax), or materials that greatly hamper a chain reaction by absorbing neutrons, into the reactor core. The tank containing the soluble neutron absorbers would be located above the reactor, and the absorption solution, once the system was triggered, would flow into the core through force of gravity, and bring the reaction to a near-complete stop. Another example was the Isolation Condenser system, which relied {{on the principle of}} hot water/steam rising to bring hot coolant into large heat exchangers located above the reactor in very deep tanks of water, thus accomplishing residual heat removal. Yet another example was the omission of <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> within the core; these pumps were used in other BWR designs to keep cooling water moving; they were expensive, hard to reach to repair, and could occasionally fail; so as to improve reliability, the ABWR incorporated no less than 10 of these <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps,</b> so that even if several failed, a sufficient number would remain serviceable so that an unscheduled shutdown would not be necessary, and the pumps could be repaired during the next refueling outage. Instead, the designers of the simplified boiling water reactor used thermal analysis to design the reactor core such that natural circulation (cold water falls, hot water rises) would bring water {{to the center of the}} core to be boiled.|$|R

40|$|The {{capability}} to vent in zero gravity without resettling is a technology need that involves practically all uses of sub-critical cryogenics in space, and would extend cryogenic orbital transfer vehicle capabilities. However, {{the lack of}} definition regarding liquid/ullage orientation coupled with the somewhat random nature of the thermal stratification and resulting pressure rise rates, lead to significant technical challenges. Typically a zero gravity vent concept, termed a thermodynamic vent system (TVS), consists of a tank mixer to destratify the propellant, combined with a Joule-Thomson (J-T) valve to extract thermal energy from the propellant. Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) {{was used to test}} both spray-bar and axial jet TVS concepts. The axial jet system consists of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> heat exchanger unit. The spray-bar system consists of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump,</b> a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger, and a spray-bar positioned close to the longitudinal axis of the tank. The operation of both concepts is similar. In the mixing mode, the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> withdraws liquid from the tank and sprays it into the tank liquid, ullage, and exposed tank surfaces. When energy extraction is required, {{a small portion of the}} recirculated liquid is passed sequentially through the J-T expansion valve, the heat exchanger, and is vented overboard. The vented vapor cools the circulated bulk fluid, thereby removing thermal energy and reducing tank pressure. The pump operates alone, cycling on and off, to destratify the tank liquid and ullage until the liquid vapor pressure reaches the lower set point. At that point, the J-T valve begins to cycle on and off with the pump. Thus, for short duration missions, only the mixer may operate, thus minimizing or even eliminating boil-off losses...|$|E

There are no steam separators, steam dryers, internal <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps,</b> or <b>recirculation</b> flow inside the pressure vessel.

40|$|The dry out {{criterion}} (MCPR) {{has been}} {{calculated for the}} most limiting H 2 -events for Forsmarks unit 2 and 3, at operating points that are normally not analyzed before each cycle. The operating points that normally are regarded as {{the ones with the}} lowest margin to dry out are the ones where the thermal power is the highest at agiven recirculation flow. This report shows {{that this is not the}} case for Forsmark 3. MCPR-values at partial power operating points are higher for the limiting case inside rather than on the boundary of the region of operation. It is therefore recommended that the method for determining the dry out criterion for Forsmark 3 is revised to account for this effect. It is recommended that the number of operating points studied is increased or that a conservative value is established of how large the effect of operating point can have on MCPR. This conclusion does not, however, apply to Forsmark 2 where the most limiting case has its largest MCPR-values at the boundary. The effect on MCPR of changing the A/B- and scram-runback ramps of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> for Forsmark 3 has also been calculated. The alternative rampused was found to give a decrease in the MCPR value between about 20 - 30 units, depending on fuel type, at partial power operation.

40|$|In {{designing}} {{systems for}} the long-term storage of cryogens in low gravity space environments, one must consider the effects of thermal stratification on excessive tank pressure that will occur due to environmental heat leakage. During low gravity operations, a Thermodynamic Venting System (TVS) concept is expected to maintain tank pressure without propellant resettling. The TVS consists of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump,</b> Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion valve, and a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger combined with a longitudinal spray bar. Using {{a small amount of}} liquid extracted by the pump and passing it though the J-T valve, then through the heat exchanger, the bulk liquid and ullage are cooled, resulting in lower tank pressure.
