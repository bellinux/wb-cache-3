40|$|BACKGROUND: Surgical {{correction}} of congenital anorectal malformations could be complicated by fecal incontinence. Some authors believe that {{preservation of the}} fistula is associated with improved outcome. <b>Rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> is a well-established method to evaluate postoperative functional outcome in these patients and can demonstrate successful transplantation of the fistula. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we report {{the results of our}} series of patients with anorectal malformations and an externally accessible fistula, who underwent pre- and postoperative <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> studies. DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a tertiary neonatal and pediatric surgical center. PATIENTS: Patients with anorectal malformations, who underwent preoperative <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> of the fistula and postoperative <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> of the neoanus between January 2002 and December 2011 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and postoperative <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> results were compared by using paired t test or contingency tables (p values < 0. 05). RESULTS: Twelve female patients with rectoperineal (n = 7, 58 %) or rectovestibular (n = 5, 42 %) fistula were treated by anterior sagittal anorectoplasty or minimal posterior sagittal anorectoplasty. Complete transposition of the fistula was achieved in all patients. Normal presence of rectoanal inhibitory reflex was demonstrated in all pre- and postoperative <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> studies. There were no differences between pre- and postoperative <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> in the length of the high-pressure zone (2. 3 ± 0. 6 cm vs 2. 5 ± 0. 8 cm (p = 0. 5)) and resting pressure (59. 4 ± 18. 2 mm Hg vs 62. 1 ± 19. 2 mm Hg (p = 0. 62)). At a median follow-up of 665 days (range, 290 - 1165 days), all patients have voluntary bowel movements, with no incontinence or soiling. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its small sample size and by single-institution bias. CONCLUSION: Preoperative <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> of rectoperineal or rectovestibular fistula showed the presence of functional anal structures within the fistula in all patients. We speculate that fistula-preserving surgery in patients with anorectal malformations is associated with improved bowel function outcome. © The ASCRS 2013...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We present 12 -month followup {{results of}} {{functional}} evaluation and safety {{assessment of a}} modification of hemorrhoidal artery ligation (DGHAL) called Recto-Anal-Repair (RAR) in treatment of advanced hemorrhoidal disease (HD). Methods: Patients with grade III and IV HD underwent the RAR procedure (DGHAL combined with restoration of prolapsed hemorrhoids to their anatomical position with longitudinal sutures). Each patient had <b>rectal</b> examination, anorectal <b>manometry,</b> and QoL questionnaire performed before 3 months, and 12 months after RAR procedure. Results: 20 patients completed 12 -month followup. There were no major complications. 3 months after RAR, 5 cases of residual mucosal prolapse were detected (25 %), while only 3 patients (15 %) reported persistence of symptoms. 12 months after RAR, another 3 HD recurrences were detected, {{to a total of}} 8 patients (40 %) with HD recurrence.

40|$|Background. Rectum {{resection}} {{with total}} mesorectal excision (TME) and neorectal anastomosis often compromises anorectal function. Insight into {{the underlying mechanisms}} is lacking. Therefore, a prospective {{study was designed to}} investigate the relationship between clinical and functional outcomes preoperatively and postoperatively. Methods. Eleven patients with rectal cancer were examined before and 4 and 12 months after surgery and compared with 11 healthy volunteers (HVs). Anorectal (neorectal) function was examined by clinical outcome questionnaire, anal <b>manometry,</b> <b>rectal</b> compliance, and sensation. Six HVs also underwent barostat measurements in the sigmoid colon. Results. Clinical parameters of soiling and passive incontinence (loss of stool without sensation) increased significantly until 12 months postoperatively, whereas urgency and tenesmus increased temporarily, returning to preoperative values at 12 months. In anorectal measurements, anal sphincter function was grossly preserved; however, rectal-anal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) was decreased at 4 months but recovered after 1 year. Neorectal compliance was similar to that of HV sigmoid, increasing slightly after 12 months but still significantly lower than that of normal rectum. Neorectal sensation to pressure distention was similar to that of normal rectum, however accompanied by smaller volumes. Neorectal distention induced contractions of large amplitude at 4 months, returning to normal after 12 months. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the transient increase in urgency and tenesmus after surgery results from a temporary increase in neorectal "irritability " accompanied by some adaptation of compliance in time. In contrast, episodes of incontinence and soiling are increased after I year most likely because of reduced neorectal capacity and RAIR recovery {{in the presence of a}} low basal anal sphincter pressur...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Most {{pediatric}} constipation {{cases may}} {{be treated with}} an adequate diet and moderate use of laxatives and enemas. A significant proportion of patients, however, does not show improvement with these therapeutic measures. In these cases, {{it is necessary to}} establish the differential diagnosis between functional and structural constipation. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the result of two methods of evaluation, manometry before biopsy and biopsy alone. Methodology: This cross sectional study was carried out in the children with chronic constipation that were referred to Mofid Children Hospital and underwent <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> from 2002 - 2006. Chi-square test was used for the analysis. Results: From 347 patients who underwent anorectal manometry, 134 patients had evidence that indicated neurologic abnormality and hirschprung disease. From these patients, based on parental agreement, biopsy were obtained from 69 patients. Histopathologic study was performed on 69 samples, and 57 (82. 6 %) specimens had evidence of neuroanatomic abnormality as a cause of the disease.

40|$|Purpose: Impaired {{functional}} {{outcome is}} common after a low anterior resection (LAR). Pelvic floor rehabilitation (PFR) might improve functional outcome after a LAR. The {{aim of this}} systematic review is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of PFR in improving functional outcome. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched using the terms fecal incontinence, colorectal neo-plasm/surgery, LAR, rectal cancer, anterior resection syndrome, bowel habit, pelvic floor, training, therapy, physical ther-apy, rehabilitation and biofeedback. Of the 125 identified records, 5 articles were included. Results: The 5 included studies reported on 321 patients, of which 286 patients (89 %) underwent pelvic floor training. Three studies included patients with anterior resection syndrome after a LAR while the remaining studies included a se-ries of patients after a LAR. Functional outcome was mostly assessed by using the Wexner incontinence scale. Quality of life was assessed in one study, and in three studies, <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> was performed. After PFR, the functional outcome was improved in four studies, as was the quality of life. Conclusion: This systematic review demonstrated that PFR is useful for improving the functional outcome after a LAR.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the indicated referrals to a tertiary centre {{for patients with}} anorectal symptoms, {{the effect of the}} advised treatment and the discomfort of the tests. METHODS: In a retrospective study, patients referred for anorectal function evaluation (AFE) between May 2004 and October 2006 were sent a questionnaire, as were the doctors who referred them. AFE consisted of anal <b>manometry,</b> <b>rectal</b> compliance measurement and anal endosonography. An indicated referral was defined as needing AFE to establish a diagnosis with clinical consequence (fecal incontinence without diarrhea, 3 rd degree anal sphincter rupture, congenital anorectal disorder, inflammatory bowel disease with anorectal complaints and preoperative in patients for re-anastomosis or enterostoma, anal fissure, fistula or constipation). Anal ultrasound is always indicated in patients with fistula, anal <b>manometry</b> and <b>rectal</b> compliance when impaired continence reserve is suspected. The therapeutic effect was noted as improvement, no improvement but reassurance, and deterioration. RESULTS: From the 216 patients referred, 167 (78 %) returned the questionnaire. The referrals were indicated in 65 %. Of these, 80 % followed the proposed advice. Improvement was achieved in 35 % and a reassurance in 57 % of the patients, no difference existed between patient groups. On a VAS scale (1 to 10) symptoms improved from 4. 0 to 7. 2. Most patients reported no or little discomfort with AFE. CONCLUSION: Referral for AFE was indicated in 65 %. Beneficial effect was seen in 92 %: 35 % improved and 57 % was reassured. Advice was followed in 80 %. Better instruction about indication for AFE referral is warranted...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Anorectal {{dysfunction}} {{is common}} after pelvic radiotherapy. This study aims {{to explore the}} relationship of subjective and objective anorectal function with quality of life (QoL) and their relative impact in patients irradiated for prostate cancer. METHODS: Patients underwent anal <b>manometry,</b> <b>rectal</b> barostat measurement, and completed validated questionnaires, at least 1 year after prostate radiotherapy (range 1 - 7 years). QoL {{was measured by the}} Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale (FIQL) and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Bowel domain (EPICB) -bother subscale. Severity of symptoms was rated by the EPICB function subscale. RESULTS: Anorectal function was evaluated in 85 men. Sixty-three percent suffered from one or more anorectal symptoms. Correlations of individual symptoms ranged from r = 0. 23 to r = 0. 53 with FIQL domains and from r = 0. 36 to r = 0. 73 with EPICB bother scores. They were strongest for fecal incontinence and urgency. Correlations of anal sphincter pressures, rectal capacity, and sensory thresholds ranged from r = 0. 00 to r = 0. 42 with FIQL domains and from r = 0. 15 to r = 0. 31 with EPICB bother scores. Anal resting pressure correlated most strongly. Standardized regression coefficients for QoL outcomes were largest for incontinence, urgency, and anal resting pressure. Regression models with subjective parameters explained a larger amount (range 26 - 92 %) of variation in QoL outcome than objective parameters (range 10 - 22 %). CONCLUSIONS: Fecal incontinence and rectal urgency are the symptoms with the largest influence on QoL. Impaired anal resting pressure is the objective function parameter with the largest influence. Therefore, sparing the structures responsible for an adequate fecal continence is important in radiotherapy planning...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Pelvic floor {{rehabilitation}} is {{an appealing}} treatment {{for patients with}} fecal incontinence but reported results vary. This {{study was designed to}} assess the outcome of pelvic floor rehabilitation in a large series of consecutive patients with fecal incontinence caused by different etiologies. METHODS: A total of 281 patients (252 females) were included. Data about medical history, anal <b>manometry,</b> <b>rectal</b> capacity measurement, and endoanal sonography were collected. Subgroups of patients were defined by anal sphincter complex integrity, and nature and possible underlying causes of fecal incontinence. Subsequently patients were referred for pelvic floor rehabilitation, comprising nine sessions of electric stimulation and pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback. Pelvic floor rehabilitation outcome was documented with Vaizey score, anal <b>manometry,</b> and <b>rectal</b> capacity measurement findings. RESULTS: Vaizey score improved from baseline in 143 of 239 patients (60 percent), remained unchanged in 56 patients (23 percent), and deteriorated in 40 patients (17 percent). Mean Vaizey score reduced with 3. 2 points (P = 50 percent was observed in 32 patients (13 percent). Mean squeeze pressure (+ 5. 1 mmHg; P = 0. 04) and maximal tolerated volume (+ 11 ml; P = 0. 01) improved from baseline. Resting pressure (P = 0. 2 2), sensory threshold (P = 0. 52), and urge sensation (P = 0. 06) remained unchanged. Subgroup analyses did not show substantial differences in effects of pelvic floor rehabilitation between subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic floor rehabilitation leads overall to a modest improvement in severity of fecal incontinence, squeeze pressure, and maximal tolerated volume. Only in a few patients, a substantial improvement of the baseline Vaizey score was observed. Further studies are needed to identify patients who most likely will benefit from pelvic floor rehabilitation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Eighty to {{ninety percent}} of Hirschsprung's disease (HD) {{patients}} present in newborns. However, the diagnosis of HD in the neonatal period remains difficult. Our present study aims to propose a diagnostic scoring system and hope this will increase early diagnosis of HD and avoid unnecessary rectal biopsy. Methods: In the first study period, 57 suspected HD patients (0 - 3 months) completed our predetermined study protocol in which barium enema (BE), <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> (RM) and full-thickness rectal biopsy were performed. Symptoms, signs and investigations were analysed for their correlation with HD diagnosis. A HD diagnostic scoring system was developed according to the statistical results and was assessed in 74 patients in the second study period. Results: Forty-five patients were diagnosed with HD in the first study period. A HD scoring system was developed in which delayed meconium, tight anus, BE and RM were diagnostic factors. A cut-off point of 3 provided 84 % of HD patients score > 3, whereas 75 % non-HD patients score £ 3 (p < 0. 05). In the second study group, patients with score £ 3 were selected for rectal biopsy.

40|$|Background: Low {{anterior}} rectal resection is {{an option}} for low rectal cancer. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the clinical and manometric findings before and after low anterior resection in patients with rectal cancer. Methods: In a before-after prospective experimental study, 29 patients with colon cancer who were candidate for elective low anterior resection surgery in Imam Khomeini hospital were enrolled. In preoperative period, the data regarding the anorectal function were gathered and all the patients were assessed by an eight channel rectal manometer. After the surgery, patients were evaluated regarding current anorectal function and underwent <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> for the second time. Results: The mean of defecation time was significantly higher in postoperative period compared with preoperative period (2. 48 ± 0. 78 vs. 0. 94 ± 0. 36 time per day). In postoperative period, gas incontinence was significantly higher in comparison to the preoperative period (27. 59 % vs. 0 %). However, the fecal incontinence rates were comparable. Compared with preoperative period, max resting pressure was significantly reduced in postoperative period (53. 20 ± 17. 45 vs. 64. 32 ± 17. 33 mmHg). The same was true about max squeezing pressure (140. 21 ± 35. 50 vs. 150. 37 ± 33. 16 mmHg). Urgency also increased in postoperative period (48. 28 % vs. 0 %). Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that following low anterior resection surgery for patients with rectal cancer, the defecation time, gas incontinence and urgency increase but max resting and squeezing pressure decrease...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sacral nerve {{modulation}} (SNM) {{using an}} implantable pulse generator is gaining increasing acceptance {{in the treatment}} of several functional disturbances of the urinary and intestinal tract. This new therapeutic approach offers new possibilities {{in the treatment of}} fecal incontinence (FI) by means of its possible effects on anorectal physiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with FI, six of whom had associated urinary disturbances, underwent permanent SNM after successful peripheral nerve evaluation tests. All had a clinical evaluation including FI grading systems (American Medical systems, AMS; Continence Grading System, CGS) and quality of life questionnaires (Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life, FIQL), and anorectal physiology tests performed before and during electrostimulation. Two patients had a lead displacement which was repositioned. Median follow-up was 14 months (range 6 - 48 months). RESULTS: AMS scores decreased significantly from 101 to 67 after 24 months CGS scores from 15 to 2 after 2 months. The median number of episodes of major incontinence per 2 weeks decreased from 14 to 1 after 24 months. FIQL scores improved significantly in the nine patients tested from an overall score of 1. 59 to 3. 3, with improvement in all areas of the FIQL. Four of the six patients with associated urinary disturbances had a significant improvement in their symptoms. Anal resting and squeezing tone did not change significantly, nor did rectal volumetry, compliance, rectoanal inhibitory reflex, or length of the anal high-pressure zone, while 24 -h <b>rectal</b> <b>manometry</b> showed inhibition of the spontaneous rectal motility complexes after meal and on awakening in the only two patients undergoing this investigation. CONCLUSION: Although the mechanism of action of SMN is still unclear and requires further investigations, clinical results are very encouraging, confirming the role of this new and safe procedure in the treatment of FI and associated urinary disturbance...|$|E
40|$|Aims Fecal {{incontinence}} (FI) is embarrassing, {{resulting in}} poor quality of life. Rectal sensation {{may be more}} important than sphincter strength to relieve symptoms. A single-blind, randomized controlled trial among adults with FI compared the effectiveness of rectal balloon training (RBT) and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) versus PFMT alone. Methods We randomized 80 patients, recruited from the Maastricht University Medical Centre. Primary outcome was based on the Vaizey score. Secondary outcomes were the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (FIQL), 9 -point global perceived effect (GPE) score, anorectal <b>manometry,</b> <b>rectal</b> distension volumes, and thresholds of anorectal sensation. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Results Forty patients were assigned to combined RBT with PFMT and 40 to PFMT alone. Adding RBT did not result in a significant improvement in the Vaizey score [mean difference: - 1. 19; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 3. 79 to 1. 42; P= 0. 37]. Secondary outcomes favoring RBT were: Lifestyle subscale of the FIQL (0. 37; 95 % CI: 0. 02 - 0. 73; P= 0. 04), GPE (- 1. 01; 95 % CI: - 1. 75 to - 0. 27; P= 0. 008), maximum tolerable volume (49. 35; 95 % CI: 13. 26 - 85. 44; P= 0. 009), and external anal sphincter fatigue (0. 65; 95 % CI: 0. 26 - 1. 04; P= 0. 001). Overall, 50 % of patients were considered improved according to the estimated minimally important change (Vaizey change â¥- 5). Conclusions RBT with PFMT was equally effective as PFMT alone. Secondary outcomes show beneficial effects of RBT on urgency control, GPE, and lifestyle adaptations. Characteristics of patients who benefit most from RBT remain to be confirmed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Fecal {{incontinence}} (FI) {{is defined}} as the recurrent involuntary excretion of feces in inappropriate places or at inappropriate times. It is a major and highly embarrassing health care problem which affects about 2 to 24 % of the adult population. The prevalence increases with age in both men and women. Physiotherapy interventions are often considered a first-line approach due to its safe and non-invasive nature when dietary and pharmaceutical treatment fails or in addition to this treatment regime. Two physiotherapy interventions, rectal balloon training (RBT) and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) are widely used in the management of FI. However, their effectiveness remains uncertain since well-designed trials on the effectiveness of RBT and PFMT versus PFMT alone in FI have never been published. Methods/Design A two-armed randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted. One hundred and six patients are randomized to receive either PFMT combined with RBT or PFMT alone. Physicians in the University Hospital Maastricht include eligible participants. Inclusion criteria are (1) adults (aged ≥ 18 years), (2) with fecal incontinence complaints due to different etiologies persisting for at least six months, (3) having a Vaizey incontinence score of at least 12, (4) and failure of conservative treatment (including dietary adaptations and pharmacological agents). Baseline measurements consist of the Vaizey incontinence score, medical history, physical examination, medication use, anorectal <b>manometry,</b> <b>rectal</b> capacity measurement, anorectal sensation, anal endosonography, defecography, symptom diary, Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale (FIQL) and the PREFAB-score. Follow-up measurements are scheduled at three, six and 12 months after inclusion. Skilled and registered physiotherapists experienced in women's health perform physiotherapy treatment. Twelve sessions are administered during three months according to a standardized protocol.

40|$|Aim—The {{incidence}} of anorectal symptoms after radiotherapy (RTH) for localised pelvic malignant disease is unclear. In addition, {{the effects of}} pelvic irradiation on both anorectal motility and sensory function are poorly defined. A prospective study was therefore performed on 35 patients (55 - 82 years of age) with localised prostatic carcinoma before and {{four to six weeks}} after RTH to assess its effects on anorectal function.  Methods—Anorectal symptoms were assessed by questionnaire. Anorectal pressures at rest and in response to voluntary squeeze, rectal distension, and increases in intra-abdominal pressure were evaluated with perfused sleeve side hole <b>manometry.</b> <b>Rectal</b> sensation was tested during graded balloon distension. Rectal compliance was calculated by the pressure-volume relation obtained during the testing of rectal sensation. Ultrasound was used to determine anal sphincter structure and integrity.  Results—RTH had no effect on anal sphincter morphology. The frequency of defecation increased after RTH (7 (3 - 21) v 10 (3 - 56) bowel actions a week; p< 0. 01). After RTH, 16 patients had faecal urgency and eight faecal incontinence, compared with five and one respectively before RTH (p< 0. 01 for each). Basal and squeeze sleeve recorded pressures were reduced after RTH (54 (3) v 49 (3) mm Hg (p< 0. 05) and 111 (8) v 102 (8) mm Hg (p< 0. 01), before and after RTH respectively; means (SEM)). Rectal compliance was reduced after RTH (1. 2 v 1. 4 mm Hg/ml, p< 0. 05). After RTH, threshold volumes for perception of rectal distension were lower in the 16 patients who either experienced faecal urgency for the first time (13 patients) or reported worsening of this symptom (three patients) compared with the remaining patients (34 (4) v 48 (5) ml respectively, p< 0. 05).  Conclusion—Faecal incontinence (23 %) is a common problem four to six weeks after RTH for prostatic carcinoma and is associated with minor reductions in anal sphincter pressures. The high prevalence of faecal urgency in patients after RTH may be related to alterations in rectal perception of stool. ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: A retocele é causa comum de constipação por defecação obstruída. Freqüentemente está relacionada com outras causas de defecação obstruída, e os exames de fisiologia anal são importantes para o diagnóstico preciso da causa de constipação intestinal. OBJETIVO: observar a influência da retocele nos exames de fisiologia anal, e a necessidade da realização desses após o diagnóstico da retocele. MÉTODO: Para este trabalho foram estudados 40 pacientes com diagnóstico de defecação obstruída. Todos os pacientes foram submetidos aos exames de manometria, sensibilidade retal, eletromiografia, latência do nervo pudendo e proctografia, e foram separados em 2 grupos: portadores e não portadores de retocele. Foram encontrados 18 pacientes com retocele, e o diagnóstico mais freqüentemente associado foi o anismus. Em relação aos exames foi encontrada diferença significante apenas na proctografia no ângulo ano retal, demonstrando que a presença de retocele não interferiu nos resultados de exames de fisiologia anal quando comparados com outros constipados, mas esteve associada a outras causas de constipação, como anismus que necessita de outro tipo de tratamento.

INTRODUCTION: Rectocele is {{a common}} cause of {{constipation}} for obstructed defecation. It often is related with other causes of outlet obstruction and the examinations of anal physiology tests are important for necessary diagnosis of the constipation cause. OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of rectocele in the anal physiology tests {{and the necessity of}} its accomplishment to the diagnosis of rectocele. METHOD: In this study, 40 patients with diagnosis of outlet obstruction had been analyzed. All the patients had been submitted to <b>manometry,</b> <b>rectal</b> sensitivity, electromyography, pudendal nerve latency and proctography and they had been separated in 2 groups: carriers and non-carriers of rectocele. 18 patients with rectocele had been found and the diagnosis often associated was anismus. In relation to the examination there was significant difference only in the proctography in the rectal angle, demonstrating that the presence of rectocele did not intervene with the results of the examination of anal physiology when compared with the other constipated, but it was associated with other causes of constipation such as anismus that needs another type of treatment. CONCLUSÃO: Rectocele did not intervene with the values of the examination of anal physiology, but it was associated with other diagnosis, therefore it is important the accomplishment of the examination...|$|R
