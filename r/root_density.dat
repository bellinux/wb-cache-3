50|$|Because ectomycorrhizas {{are small}} and possess a limited contact area with the {{surrounding}} soil, the presence of extramatrical hyphae significantly increases the surface area {{in contact with the}} surrounding environment. Increased surface area means greater access to necessary nutrient sources. Additionally, the presence of rhizomorphs or mycelial cords, can act comparably to xylem tissue in plants, where hollow tubes of vessel hyphae shuttle water and solubilized nutrients over long distances. The abundance and spatial distribution of host root tips in the rhizosphere is an important factor mediating ectomycorrhizal community assembly. <b>Root</b> <b>density</b> may select for the exploration types best suited for a given root spacing. In Pine systems, Fungi that display short-distance exploration types are less able to colonize new roots spaced far from the mycorrhiza, and long-distance types dominate areas of low <b>root</b> <b>density.</b> Conversely, short-distance exploration types tend to dominate areas of high <b>root</b> <b>density</b> where decreased carbon expenditure makes them more competitive than long-distance species. The growth of extramatrical mycelium has a direct effect on the mutualistic nutrient trading between ectomycorrhizal fungi and their hosts. Increased hyphal occupation of the soil allows the fungus to take greater advantage of water and nutrients otherwise inaccessible to plant roots and to more efficiently transport these resources back to the plant. Conversely, the increased costs in carbon allocation associated with supporting a fungal partner with an extensive mycelial system presents a number of questions related to {{the costs and benefits of}} ectomycorrhizal mutualism.|$|E

Slopes that had high <b>root</b> <b>density</b> (due to dense vegetation on the surface) were less likely to undergo slope failure. This is because a high root length density results in low soil water content which in turn results in an increase in shear strength and a decrease in soil permeability.

5000|$|Bottom-up effects {{occur when}} the density of a {{resource}} affects the density of its consumer. For example, in the figure above, an increase in <b>root</b> <b>density</b> causes an increase in herbivore density that causes a corresponding increase in predator density. Correlations in abundance or biomass between consumers and their resources give evidence for bottom-up control. An often-cited example of a bottom-up effect {{is the relationship between}} herbivores and the primary productivity of plants. In terrestrial ecosystems, the biomass of herbivores and detritivores increases with primary productivity. An increase in primary productivity will result in a larger influx of leaf litter into the soil ecosystem, which will provide more resources for bacterial and fungal populations to grow. More microbes will allow an increase in bacterial and fungal feeding nematodes, which are eaten by mites and other predatory nematodes. Thus, the entire food web swells as more resources are added to the base. [...] When ecologists use the term, bottom-up control, they are indicating that the biomass, abundance, or diversity of higher trophic levels depend on resources from lower trophic levels.|$|E

5000|$|Stage one is {{the reason}} this {{algorithm}} is so efficient and is what sets it apart from most other factoring algorithms. Because the FFT (fast Fourier transform) is {{used to evaluate the}} polynomial, a fast evaluation over a dense grid in the complex plane is possible. In order to use the FFT, the grid is structured in polar coordinates. In the first phase of this stage, a grid is designed with concentric circles of a particular radius intersected by a set of radial lines. The positions and spacing of the radial lines and the circles are chosen to give a grid that will hopefully separate the expected roots. Because the zeros of a polynomial with random coefficients have a fairly uniform angular distribution and are clustered close to the unit circle, it is possible to design an evaluation grid that fits the expected <b>root</b> <b>density</b> very well. In the second phase of this stage, the polynomial is evaluated at the nodes of the grid using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). It is because of the extraordinary efficiency and accuracy of the FFT that a direct evaluation is possible. In the third phase of this first stage, a search is conducted over all of the 3 by 3 node cells formed in the grid. For each 3 by 3 cell (see Figure below), if the value of the polynomial at the center node of the cell (the [...] "x") is less than the values at all 8 of the nodes on the edges of the cell (the [...] "o's"), the center is designated a candidate zero. This rule is based on the “Minimum Modulus Theorem” which states that if a relative minimum of the absolute value of an analytic function over an open region exists, the minimum must be a zero of the function. Finally, this set of prospective zeros is passed to the second stage. The number is usually slightly larger than the degree because some were found twice or mistakes were made. The number could be less if some zeros were missed.|$|E

Channel density and soil loss rate increased with the increase in understory-degradation in the forested hillslopes. Simple correlation analysis indicated that channel density was negatively correlated with fine <b>root</b> <b>density</b> (diameter< 1 mm and 1 – 2 mm) and grass and shrub covers, but not with coarse roots (diam. 2 – 5 mm and 5 – 10 mm) and mulch and tree covers. The principal component regression revealed fine <b>root</b> <b>density</b> (diam. < 1 mm), shrub and grass covers were the most important predictors for channel density in the forested hillslopes. Tree cover, mulch cover and coarse <b>root</b> <b>density</b> were found to have much less influence on channel density. For the model established from this study using principle component regression, vegetation variables could explain 82 % variance of channel density. Conclusions We conclude that fine <b>root</b> <b>density</b> and grass and shrub covers are the most important factors in controlling soil erosions in forested hillslopes. These parameters should be taken into consideration in assessing reforestation for soil erosion control in hilly areas such as that in southwestern China or other similar regions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Although both {{aboveground}} and belowground {{components of}} vegetation act together in reducing soil erosion, mainly the aboveground component has received attention in past research. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the contribution of roots in soil erosion control and the effect of <b>root</b> <b>density</b> in soil erodibility and soil physical properties. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. Hugo) was grown in soil pans, and laboratory rainfall simulation experiments were conducted after 4, 8, 12 weeks of their growth with seeding density of 50 kg ha- 1, after 4 weeks for seeding density of 100 kg ha- 1, and on a control. The experiments with ryegrass were done in the presence of complete plants and after clipping off the shoots. Roots of ryegrass grew rapidly, attaining densities of 0. 614 kg m- 2 and 2. 280 kg m- 2 in 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. With increasing <b>root</b> <b>density,</b> splash and wash decreased exponentially. There was positive correlation between soil shear strength and <b>root</b> <b>density,</b> but no influence of roots on bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity was observed...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was used to}} examine the interactions of NH 4 + transport to rice roots, as well as to calculate <b>root</b> length <b>densities</b> required to relate N uptake to concentrations of NH 4 + in solution around the rooting medium for three water treatments: water table 30 cm below the surface, 15 cm below the surface and a flooded system. Measured uptake was greatest for the plants under the 30 cm treatment, followed by the 15 cm treatment, then the flooded treatment. Solution concentrations were highest under the flooded treatment followed by the 30 cm treatment, then the 15 cm treatment. Calculated <b>root</b> length <b>densities</b> were greatest for the plants under the 30 cm water table treatment, followed by those under the 15 cm treatment, then the flooded treatment. Measured <b>root</b> length <b>densities</b> were similarly greatest for the plants under the 30 cm water table treatment, followed by those under the 15 cm water table depth treatment, then the flooded treatment. However, differences between measured and calculated <b>root</b> length <b>densities</b> became significant for all treatments after 30 days of treatment imposition. Transport rates varied with treatments but uptake rates did not reflect these differences in transport rates, thus, transport through the growth medium did not limit uptake of nitrogen by the plants...|$|R
50|$|However, in Australia and Southern Africa, {{the story}} is different. Here, runoff {{variability}} {{is much higher than}} in other continental regions of the world with similar climates. Typically temperate (Köppen climate classification C) and arid (Köppen climate classification B) climate rivers in Australia and Southern Africa have as much as three times the coefficient of variation of runoff of those in other continental regions. The reason for this is that, whereas all other continents have had their soils largely shaped by Quaternary glaciation and mountain building, soils of Australia and Southern Africa have been largely unaltered since at least the early Cretaceous and generally since the previous ice age in the Carboniferous. Consequently, available nutrient levels in Australian and Southern African soils tend to be orders of magnitude lower than those of similar climates in other continents, and native flora compensate for this through much higher <b>rooting</b> <b>densities</b> (e.g. proteoid <b>roots)</b> to absorb minimal phosphorus and other nutrients. Because these roots absorb so much water, runoff in typical Australian and Southern African rivers does not occur until about 300 mm (12 inches) or more of rainfall has occurred. In other continents, runoff will occur after quite light rainfall due to the low <b>rooting</b> <b>densities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Root hairs are {{unicellular}} elongations {{of certain}} rhizodermal cells that improve the uptake of sparingly soluble and immobile soil nutrients. Among different Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, <b>root</b> hair <b>density,</b> length {{and the local}} acclimation to low inorganic phosphate (Pi) differs considerably, when analyzed on split agar plates. Here, genome-wide association fine mapping identified significant single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the increased <b>root</b> hair <b>density</b> {{in the absence of}} local phosphate on chromosome 1. A loss-of-functionmutant of the candidate transcription factor gene WRKY 6, which is involved in the acclimation of plants to low phosphorus, had increased <b>root</b> hair <b>density.</b> This is partially explained by a reduced cortical cell diameter in wrky 6 - 3, reducing the rhizodermal cell numbers adjacent to the cortical cells. As a consequence, rhizodermal cells in positions that are in contact with two cortical cells are found more often, leading to higher hair density. Distinct cortical cell diameters and epidermal cell lengths distinguish other Arabidopsis accessions with distinct <b>root</b> hair <b>density</b> and −Pi response from diploid Col- 0, while tetraploid Col- 0 had generally larger root cell sizes, which explain longer hairs. A distinct radial root morphology within Arabidopsis accessions and wrky 6 - 3 explains some, but not all, differences in the root hair acclimation to –Pi...|$|R
