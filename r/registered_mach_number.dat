Transition Reynolds number was found to increase with increasing <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> at a rate depending simultaneously on <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> and roughness height. The laminar boundary layer was found to tolerate increasing amounts of roughness as <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> increased. For a given <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> an optimum roughness height was found which gave a maximum laminar run greater than was obtained with a smooth surface...|$|R
