Two manufacturers sell products to customers through one retailer and also provide product-related services. Three participators decide prices and service levels independently.

40|$|Remanufactured {{products}} offer better environmental benefits, {{and governments}} encourage manufacturers to remanufacture through various subsidy policies. This practice has shown that, {{in addition to}} product sales, <b>remanufactured</b> <b>product</b> can also achieve its value through social donation. Based on the <b>remanufactured</b> <b>product</b> value realization approaches, governments provide two kinds of incentive policies, which are <b>remanufactured</b> <b>product</b> sales subsidies and <b>remanufactured</b> <b>product</b> donation subsidies. This paper constructs a two-stage Stackelberg game model including a government and a manufacturer under two different policies, which can be solved by backward induction. By comparing the optimal decision of the two policies, our results show that, compared with the remanufacturing sales subsidy, donation subsidy weakens the cannibalization of remanufactured products for new products and increases the quantity of new products. It reduces the sales quantity of remanufactured products, but increases their total quantity. Under certain conditions of low subsidy, the manufacturer adopting sales subsidy provides better economic and environmental benefits. Under certain conditions of high subsidy, the manufacturer adopting donation subsidy offers better economic and environmental benefits. When untreated product environmental impact is large enough, donation subsidy policy has a better social welfare.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{choosing}} an appropriate channel for the marketing channel structure of <b>remanufactured</b> fashion <b>products.</b> To be specific, we consider a remanufacturer who has two options for selling the products: (1) provide the <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> to a manufacturer, then the manufacturer sells both new <b>products</b> and the <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> to customers, and (2) sell the <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> directly to customers. Because of the relatively low acceptance of <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> and environment consciousness of customers in developing countries like China, we model the two scenarios as decentralized remanufacturing supply chains, with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader and the government offering subsidy to the remanufacturer to incentivize remanufacturing activities. We find that the subsidy can incentivize remanufacturing activity regardless of the remanufacturer’s channel choice. A “too high” or “too low” subsidy makes the remanufacturer compete with the manufacturer, and an intermediate subsidy results in cooperation between the two members of the remanufacturing supply chain. Meanwhile, if the customers’ acceptance for <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> is higher, the remanufacturer {{will be more likely to}} compete with the manufacturer.

40|$|Remanufacturing is {{a product}} {{recovery}} strategy resulting in end-of-life products being returned to as new condition or better and receiving a warranty at least equivalent to the original. To differentiate remanufacturing from other forms of product recovery, a clear definition of a <b>remanufactured</b> <b>product</b> is essential. At present two distinct methods for understanding end-of-life recovery strategies exist; a) the use of tools and b) definitions. These current methods fall short however of categorically stating what is {{and what is not}} a <b>remanufactured</b> <b>product.</b> Therefore, the responsibility of classifying a product as remanufactured is left to individuals and organizations and so potential exists for products to be incorrectly labelled.

H 577 P ISE 2016 Aydin 213 pages :color illustrationsTo {{satisfy the}} {{increasingly}} diversified customer needs, many companies {{have adopted the}} product line design (PLD) approach to provide a variety of products for customers. In the PLD approach, both marketing and engineering issues need to be considered. In recent years, {{an increasing number of}} companies have offered <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> to customers by remanufacturing their end-of-life and returned products in response to social concerns, the enforcement of regulations on environmental protection, and the increasing potential of green markets. This research aims to investigate the integrated marketing and engineering approach to PLD with consideration of <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products.</b> <b>Remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> are normally produced from returned new products and quite often launched in markets where the new products exist. However, the simultaneous consideration of new and <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> in PLD was not found in previous studies. In addition, the coordination of supply chain parties in performing PLD with consideration of <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> was not addressed. PLD quite often involves market surveys, demand estimation, market segmentation, and market potential estimation. Its solutions can be largely affected by various uncertainties. Two types of uncertainties are studied in this research. The first is the uncertainties associated with market potential estimation and survey data in the development of market demand models that were not properly addressed in previous studies. The second type is the uncertainties about the quantity, timing, and quality of returned products. Determining the optimal quantity and quality of product returns for remanufacturing under uncertain quality and multi-period of returns was likewise not properly addressed in earlier studies. In this research, a methodology for optimal PLD with consideration of <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> is proposed based on an integrated marketing and engineering approach. The proposed methodology can address the abovementioned problems by (1) considering the fuzziness associated with survey data and market potential estimation in the development of market demand models using fuzzy regression and fuzzy estimate generation of market potential, (2) simultaneous consideration of new and <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> in a PLD in centralized and decentralized supply chain networks, and (3) determining the optimal quantity and quality of product returns for remanufacturing under multi-period and uncertain quality of the returns. The proposed methodology mainly involves conducting conjoint surveys, generation of fuzzy market demand models, generation of dynamic demand models for simultaneous consideration of new and <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> in PLD, coordination of closed-loop supply chain for PLD, formulation of multi-objective optimization models and their solutions, as well as determining optimal product returns for remanufacturing. A case study on the PLD of tablet PCs based on the proposed methodology was conducted to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. Three validation tests were performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed methodology. Results of the first test indicated that the profit and market share of a PLD for the maximum profit scenario estimated based on the proposed methodology was better than those estimated based on the methodology with separate consideration of new and <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products.</b> Results of the second test showed that estimated market demand for the normal scenario based on the proposed fuzzy demand model was very close to that based on the multinomial logit model. The third validation test was about the quantity and quality grades of product returns for remanufacturing. The test results indicated that the inventory cost of the returned tablet PCs would cause a 0. 5 %- 1. 1 % increase in the total cost of the remanufactured tablet PCs, while the uncertainty in the quality of returns would result in 4 %- 6 % change in the total cost.

We consider a decentralised closed-loop supply chain in which one OEM can purchase new components from one supplier to produce new products and collect used products from consumers to produce <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products.</b> The key feature of our model is that the OEM can select a centralised or decentralised control mode to manage its manufacturing and remanufacturing activities before the supplier prices the new component.

40|$|Remanufacturing {{has become}} more {{prominent}} as a recovery process to mitigate the massive disposal of short life-cycle product at its end-of-use. However, <b>remanufactured</b> <b>product</b> is often perceived to be inferior to new product, and it has lower value in consumer’s willingness to pay. To increase the perceived quality of the <b>remanufactured</b> <b>product,</b> manufacturer offers a warranty, since {{one of the three}} roles possessed in warranty is being a signal to product reliability. This paper studies the pricing decisions and warranty level decision for new and remanufactured products in a closed-loop supply chain consists of a manufacturer and a retailer. The optimization modeling is performed under Stackelberg game with manufacturer as the leader. We found that higher expansion effectiveness coefficient would increase the supply chain profit. Also, there is an interval of demand’s speed of change, where the total profit would be at its highest. The optimum warranty level can be achieved regardless the initial warranty level set at the beginning of retailer’s optimization. Furthermore, the remanufactured product’s wholesale and retail prices are influenced by the expansion effectiveness coefficient...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a single-product production-inventory system with independent product returns. Returned items require remanufacturing operations before being sellable again. Production and remanufacturing operations are {{performed by a}} single shared resource. Switching times and costs are neglected. Customer demand can be fulfilled without distinction by either newly produced or <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products.</b> Two inventories are considered: the remanufacturable inventory composed of product returns, and the serviceable inventory composed of new and <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products.</b> We use a continuous-time model with Markovian assumptions: demands and returns follow independent Poisson processes, production and remanufacturing times are exponentially distributed. We further assume linear holding and backlogging costs. We want to find the optimal policy that minimizes costs...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we combine {{two aspects}} of remanufacturing, namely product {{acquisition}} management and marketing (pricing) of the <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products.</b> We consider an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) who decides on the acquisition prices offered for returns from different quality types and on selling prices of new and <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products,</b> in a single period setting. We develop a procedure for determining the optimal prices and corresponding profit of the OEM, and conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the effect of different model parameters on the optimal strategies and profit. An important managerial insight is that the optimal solution is {{not to have the}} same profit per remanufactured item for all return types, but to if the minimum cost for acquisition and remanufacturing of some core type is lower...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to explore}} the reasons {{underlying}} the key assumption in the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) literature that consumers' purchase intention is lower for <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products</b> than for new products. It aims to complement the predominantly operation-focused CLSC research by examining consumers' perception of and behavior relating to <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A theoretical model is developed by integrating the concepts of perceived benefits and product knowledge with the theory of planned behavior and the theory of perceived risk. Then the model is examined through an empirical study in the Chinese automobile spare parts industry involving 288 respondents and using structural equation modeling. Findings – The results indicate that purchase intention is directly influenced by purchase attitude followed by perceived behavioral control and indirectly influenced by perceived risk, perceived benefit and product knowledge via attitude. Therefore, effective measures to promote consumers' purchase intention rely on coordinated policies built on multiple pillars instead of single factors. Originality/value – This {{is one of the}} first empirical studies {{to explore the}} factors that underpin consumers' purchase intention regarding <b>remanufactured</b> <b>products.</b> The results can be used to validate the key assumptions in operational models and foster new research in the context of CLSCs...|$|R
