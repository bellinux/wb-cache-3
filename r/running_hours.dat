With the privatisation of the UK's electricity supply industry in 1990, the station passed into the ownership of National Power. In 1991, the two 275MW units at Blyth B (units 5 & 6) were decommissioned on the grounds of economy, despite the station having been modernised in the early 1980s. This decommissioning resulted in 260 job losses.|$|E
25|$|The Dutton Park Ferry was {{operational}} {{between the}} University of Queensland, St Lucia and Dutton Park. As a prank, the University of Queensland's Student Union created a petition with approximately 4,000 signatures, largely {{gathered from the}} Regatta Hotel, and convinced Lord Mayor Clem Jones {{of the need for}} the ferry service. Upon completion of the Pamela Sue ferry the service began in March 1967. Six months after it commenced the number of passengers was well short of expectations. In 1967, the fare was 5 cents, the service had limited <b>running</b> <b>hours</b> and catered for 300 passengers a day. At its highpoint the service had two boats, a fare of $1.40, four captains, serviced 1,900 passengers per day and <b>running</b> <b>hours</b> from 06:30 until 21:55, five days a week. Over the years 3 boats serviced the crossing. The 1974 Brisbane Flood washed away landings and destroyed ferries. The Dutton Park crossing was Brisbane's only wholly privately run ferry service. Its closure occurred on 17 December 2006, when the new Eleanor Schonell Bridge opened.|$|E
