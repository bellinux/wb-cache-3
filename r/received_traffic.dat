50|$|In particular, in {{multicast}} socket networking, {{an example}} of promiscuous traffic is when a socket configured to listen on a specific multicast address group A with a specific port P, noted A:P, <b>receives</b> <b>traffic</b> from A:P but also from another multicast source. For instance, a socket is configured to <b>receive</b> <b>traffic</b> from the multicast group address 234.234.7.70, port 36000 (noted 234.234.7.70:36000), but <b>receives</b> <b>traffic</b> from both 234.234.7.70:36000 and 234.234.7.71:36000.|$|R

50|$|The {{recipient}} of traffic {{that has been}} policed will observe packet loss distributed throughout periods when incoming traffic exceeded the contract. If the source does not limit its sending rate (for example, through a feedback mechanism), this will continue, and may appear to the recipient as if link errors or some other disruption is causing random packet loss. The <b>received</b> <b>traffic,</b> which has experienced policing en route, will typically comply with the contract, although jitter may be introduced by elements in the network downstream of the policer.|$|E

50|$|A purely {{software-based}} {{implementation of}} the receiving traffic distribution, known as receive packet steering (RPS), distributes <b>received</b> <b>traffic</b> among cores later in the data path, {{as part of the}} interrupt handler functionality. Advantages of RPS over RSS include no requirements for specific hardware, more advanced traffic distribution filters, and reduced rate of interrupts produced by a NIC. As a downside, RPS increases the rate of inter-processor interrupts (IPIs). Receive flow steering (RFS) takes the software-based approach further by accounting for application locality; further performance improvements are achieved by processing interrupt requests by the same cores on which particular network packets will be consumed by the targeted application.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The WiFi handoff setup {{compares the}} data <b>traffic</b> <b>received</b> by {{different}} APs in the network. Since the initial stations of AP_ 0 are mobile ones, AP_ 0 <b>receives</b> data <b>traffic</b> {{only at the}} beginning and then at end of simulation when its stations start their tour and come back. Additionally, it <b>receives</b> data <b>traffic</b> when the stations started from south visit its section and get connected to it. In contrast to AP_ 0, AP_ 2 has stable stations, so the data <b>traffic</b> <b>received</b> by it does not drop to 0 like AP_ 0 's traffic. As expected, its <b>received</b> data <b>traffic</b> doubles when the moving stations from west and south cross its section. AP_ 3 is visited by all moving stations at the same time. Hence, its <b>received</b> data <b>traffic</b> is tripled when this happens during simulation. Hence the throughput and delay for the wlan MS is obtained. The vertical handover setup consists of a gateway, application server providing voice service to the wimax BS and to the wlan router. Index Terms- AP, DCF, PCF, LAN, WLA...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{continue}} the charter flights in the next winter season, Öger Tours and Birgenair went into a cooperation with Alas Nacionales in summer 1995. This Dominican airline was founded in Puerto Plata by the Finn Matti Puhakka and six other shareholders earlier that year. The company owned an Air Operator Certificate, but no aircraft at that time. It was agreed that Birgenair organize and operate the flights of Alas Nacionales. In return Matti Puhakka and his business partners were offered a remuneration of 10 DM per registered passenger. After Alas Nacionales <b>received</b> <b>traffic</b> rights to Germany the airline officially leased a Boeing 767-200ER from Birgenair. On 25 October 1995 the Turkish aircraft was registered in the Dominican Republic as HI-660CA. A week later the flights to Germany began. They were carried out by Turkish crews.|$|E

50|$|In 1948 {{the company}} was nationalised and {{became a part of}} British Waterways. By the 1960s traffic was dwindling and the {{official}} head of the main line of the navigation became the new steelworks at Aldwarke, below Rotherham. Repeated proposals were made in the 1960s and 1970s to upgrade the system to allow larger vessels as far as Rotherham. Go-ahead was finally given in the early 1980s: the channel was deepened to 8 feet and the locks were rebuilt to take 700 ton vessels. A new wharf and freight terminal were built in Rotherham utilising the disused riverside bus depot as warehousing; various other facilities on the navigation below Rotherham were upgraded. The improvements were opened in 1983. Although these have <b>received</b> <b>traffic</b> sporadically since (and are still used in a limited fashion today), the upgrade was not the success that was hoped.|$|E
