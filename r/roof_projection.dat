50|$|The Philbrook House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, {{resting on}} a granite {{foundation}} and finished in weatherboards. It has asymmetrical and irregular massing typical of the Queen Anne period, with a tower at the northeast corner topped by a bell-shaped roof. A porch extends across most of the front (eastern) facade, with a shed roof, gable above the stairs, and turned posts connected by a balustrade and a delicate wooden screen at the top. The roof is basically hipped, although there are cross gables, and a large front gable which includes a small semicircular <b>roof</b> <b>projection</b> at its peak.

40|$|Snølaststandarden, NS-EN 1991 - 1 - 3 : 2003 beskriver hvordan snølasten forekommer på et flernivåtak uten helning og hvordan dimensjonering for snølasten foreligger. I snølaststandarden er ikke snølasten på den nedre takflaten beskrevet når takflaten er delvis eller fullstendig overdekket av et takutstikk. Fastsettelsen av snøstandardens beskrivelse av snølasten på den nedre takflaten når takflaten er delvis eller helt overdekket av et takutstikk ble utført ved hjelp av erosjonsforsøk og deposisjonsforsøk i en vindtunnel med filtrert sand. Ved deposisjonsforsøkene eroderte ca 30 % av sanden av den øvre takflaten når den nedre takflaten var i le for vinden og ca 60 % når den nedre takflaten var på lo {{side for}} vinden. På den nedre takflaten økte sandlaget med 0 - 7 % når vinden blåste av takflaten, mens sandlaget minket med 8 - 21 % når vinden blåste på takflaten. Innenfor drivlengden ls= 30 cm på den nedre takflaten er formfaktoren, angitt av snølaststandarden, tilstrekkelig stor. Utenfor drivlengden ls er erosjonen av sand i samtlige forsøk for liten til at formfaktoren fra snølaststandarden kan anses som bevart. Videre ble det observert at sanden på den nedre takflaten organiserte seg som en sandtopp rett under kanten på takutstikket når vinden blåste av den nedre takflaten. Når vinden blåste på den nedre takflaten posisjonerte sandtoppen seg 2 - 3 cm innenfor kanten på takutstikket. Ut fra denne observasjonen ble en situasjon med uheldige værforhold i løpet av en vinter diskutert, hvor dannelsen av en «dobbel snøfonn» på den nedre takflaten kan føre til at den underliggende takkonstruksjonen blir overbelastet. Eurocode 1 part 1 - 3 : General actions - Snow loads with the Norwegian {{national}} annex, NSEN 1991 - 1 - 3 : 2003 describes {{the accumulation of}} a snow load upon a multilevel roof surface. Eurocode 1 part 1 - 3 also describes how to prevent damage from the snow load {{by the use of}} appropriate calculations. However, there is no description within the Eurocode that describes how to calculate a snow load on the lower roof surface if the roof surface is slightly, or completely covered, by a <b>roof</b> <b>projection.</b> Erosion- and deposition experiments in a wind tunnel with sieved sand were performed to examine the Eurocode’s description of a snow load on the lower roof surface and its sufficiency upon the addition of a <b>roof</b> <b>projection</b> as part of the construction. The results from the deposition experiments showed approximately 30 % erosion of sand on the upper roof surface when the lower roof surface was on the leeward side. With the lower roof surface facing into the wind did an erosion of sand of approximately 60 % occur on the upper roof surface. Facing the same way, the lower roof surface experienced an erosion of sand of 8 - 21 %. With the lower roof surface on the leeward side of the wind, did a deposition of sand of 0 - 7 % occur on the lower roof surface. The multileveled roof surface drift length was ls= 30 cm. Within this length, the snow load shape coefficient assigned by the Eurocode was proved sufficient. The snow load shape coefficient was not approved outside the drift length, ls. A sand profile was observed on the lower roof surface with its peak strictly beneath the <b>roof</b> <b>projection</b> edge, when the lower roof surface was on the leeward side of the wind. The same phenomenon was observed when the wind faced the other way, but with the sand profile peak positioned 2 - 3 cm slightly inside the vertical projection of the <b>roof</b> <b>projection</b> edge. This led to the discussion of a “worst case” scenario with bad weather conditions in the winter, where a double snow load could accumulate on the lower roof surface and lead to an overload situation on the construction of the roof.

50|$|This {{building}} {{which is}} now {{in the middle of the}} hospital site, originally faced the extension of North Street which was closed in the 1960s. The original maternity ward is a long one storeyed reinforced concrete building surrounded by an infilled timber framed verandah. The corrugated iron clad hipped roof extends over the early verandahs space, making it quite steeply pitched. Three small projections from the south eastern facade which would originally have been the rear elevation, house individual rooms and these are <b>roofed</b> with hipped <b>projections</b> from the principal roof. Adjoining the building at the western end is a small separately hipped roofed building. The other end of the former maternity ward is linked by a short semi enclosed walkway to a separate hipped roof structure. This small reinforced concrete structure, which was always intended as part of the larger maternity complex, is also surrounded by infilled verandahs, and the interior is substantially intact, with original internal partitioning, openings, ceilings and other joinery.|$|R
50|$|The plan of this -story {{brick house}} {{derives from the}} vernacular L-plan and has a T {{extension}} in the rear. A hip roof and a gable roof section intersect to form the L.

Two tall chimneys with elaborate corbelling project from the hip roof section. Divisions between stories are subtly emphasized. Pairs of stringcourses divide the basement, first, second and third stories from one another. The division between the basement and first floor is further emphasized by color differentiation in the brick. The red brick of the basement was left unpainted, whereas the brick and mortar joints {{of the rest of the}} house except that on the T extension, have been painted various shades of brown and tan to create a varigated effect.
