40|$|After being ostracized, {{people would}} try to {{socially}} <b>reconnect</b> with others. However, people high in social anxiety (HSA) might be more unwilling to <b>reconnect</b> with new affiliates than people low in social anxiety (LSA) because HSA individuals are more pessimistic and fear about the interaction with others.

The focus of the conference was on the long-term consequences of prolonged unemployment, from national and international perspectives, but particularly in the United States. The keynote speech to the conference by economist Richard B.

5|$|Ocean {{started writing}} songs for Channel Orange in February 2011 with {{songwriter}} and producer Malay, {{his friend and}} creative partner since their start {{in the music industry}} as songwriters.

Channel Orange was written in two weeks, according to the singer.|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and <b>reconnected</b> to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E

The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were <b>reconnected</b> in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
5|$|Agatha is <b>reconnected</b> to the PreCrime system. While {{attempting}} to comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains {{that as he}} {{could not afford to}} let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway16 (Bus. US16) was a {{business}} route in the Grand Rapids area in the 1950s and 1960s. When US16 was rerouted to replace Byp. US16 around the southern and western sides {{of the city in}} 1953, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated as the business loop. That loop followed Remembrance Avenue southeasterly to Leonard Avenue in Walker Township. From there, the loop turned easterly on Leonard over the Grand River to Monroe Avenue before turning south parallel to the river along Monroe into downtown. In downtown Grand Rapids, Bus. US16 turned eastward on Fulton Avenue into East Grand Rapids. There the loop followed Cascade Road into Cascade Township where it <b>reconnected</b> to US16 at the intersection with 28th Street. Bus. US16 lasted until 1962 when US16 was decommissioned in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|He {{imagined}} {{it as an}} homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb, he <b>reconnected</b> with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000, breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters. In addition, {{it would be the}} company's first film in which all characters are human.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and <b>reconnected</b> the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
