A Swallow is a type of bird which lives in 'houses' made of mud on cliffs, under eaves, and other such overhangs. It is said that the Swallows return to their homes at the Mission every year on March 19 th. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
40|$|The Nabataeans {{were highly}} {{creative}} in their {{adaptation of the}} Greco-Roman construction techniques. Based on their specific natural resources and lexicon of architectural elements, the Nabataeans thus developed their own techniques. Indeed, the size and elaborate nature of many of their monuments would require such innovations, as physically manifested in the two vertical rows of slots located on the <b>recessed</b> <b>back</b> face <b>wall</b> {{on either side of}} the façade of el-Khazneh in Petra in Jordan. These slots have been a matter of some debate on whether their function was for footholds or for scaffolding. Though the slots have been discussed in passing, no scholar has made the in-depth critical investigation in determining their proper technical and functional approach with reference to their preserved fully recorded dimensions. Thanks to a recent study using a combination of 3 D laser scanner and reflector-less total station, we now have precise measurements of the well preserved individual slots. This article is concerned with the particular case of these slots. A detailed examination of these slots in relation to their size and depth, position and arrangement within the façade, probably credits their use, both, as foot holes, and as supports for a smart and simple scaffolding structure. The paper suggests and exemplifies that, these slots are part of an authentic Nabataean construction technique, and they were the foundations used to fix a wooden lightweight socket in a diagonal changeabla cantilever scaffolding. This new assumption is supported with schematic sections and illustrations showing alternative combinations of the cantilever scaffolding at different slot heights, using the embedded putlog and diagonal bracing on which the planks are held. Thus, providing the basis for further research, hopefully encouraging a further knowledge of Nabataean scaffolding construction techniques of rock-cut architecture...|$|R

The first dwelling has a doorway flanked by broken windows on either side, leading to a middle room. The back room of the middle dwelling has a cell to the right and a half cell to the left. A window is located to left of door to the cell. The cell also has traces of painting. The half cell has a bench. The second dwelling has a middle room, a half cell to the left, and a cell, reached from the right of the half cell. The middle room has a bench. The half cell has a <b>recess</b> in its <b>back</b> <b>wall,</b> along with a bench. A grooved door leads from the half-cell to the cell, which also has a bench. A window in the right cell overlooks in to the middle room. In front of the doorway is a bench. The third and largest of the three dwellings consists of a middle hall. At the <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the hall there are two cells and two seat recesses. Along the right and rear walls runs a bench. The right cell as well as the left cell have grooved doorways, a window {{to the left of the}} doorway and a bench along each of their rear walls. In front of the hall door is a bench. In front of the broken veranda are holes for fixing wooden pillars. To the left of the veranda are two cisterns. Between cave 17 and cave 18, there are three other cisterns. In the recess of the first cistern, an inscription reads translated: [...] "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Saghaka a goldsmith, son of Kudira of Kalyana."

40|$|Photograph of a view {{of parts}} of Mission San Juan Capistrano in ruins, Orange County, ca. 1900. The arched recess {{appears to be a}} stage or an alter. There are about nine arched <b>recesses</b> in the <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> Fallen adobe bricks and rocks cover the ground (at right). Tall grass covers the ground at left. Caption reads: "triple arch and ruined tower, San Juan Capistrano Mission, Cal. "; "Located {{in the middle of the}} San Juan Valley, the mission sits right on the San Andreas fault! Although its {{location}} right on the fault was less dangerous than other locations, it accounted for many shaky days and nights. In October 1798 the shaking was so bad that the missionaries slept outside for the whole month. The earth shook as many as 6 times on one day, leaving many huge cracks in both the buildings and the ground. Since the mission population was growing so quickly, when an earthquake destroyed the church in 1803 plans were already underway to build a larger church. Much of the interior was painted by Thomas Doak, a sailor from Boston who jumped ship in Monterey, thereby becoming the first Anglo-American resident in California. Although he was not a great artist, he did work for just room and board, and the colors he mixed were so durable that they continue to glow today. After secularization in 1835 the church continued to serve as a parish for the local town. After sustaining some damage from a quake in 1906, it was repaired and then suffered through some attempts at modernization. Fortunately, in 1949, the Hearst Foundation financed the restoration that restored it to its original form. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
