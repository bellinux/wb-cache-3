5|$|In New River, Cooley {{sustained}} {{himself as}} a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling arrowroot. His fortune and influence grew: {{he became the first}} lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser.

When distracted, a mysterious man steals Scully's blood sample and runs. Mulder chases {{him down to the}} parking lot where he is confronted by X, who demands that he stop {{pursuing}} what happened to Scully and let her die. He then executes the man who stole her blood. When Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) calls Mulder to his office regarding the incident, Mulder denies any involvement and claims that the Cigarette Smoking Man is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> happened to Scully. Mulder demands to know where he is but Skinner refuses to tell him.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that words like {{unpleasant}} and grating are often used to explain the sound of dissonance, all music with a harmonic or tonal basiseven music perceived as generally harmoniousincorporates some degree of dissonance.

25|$|The US v. Al-Hussayen {{case has}} been {{considered}} a landmark test by civil libertarians. It {{was the first time}} that the government tried to use the material support statutes to prosecute activities that were mostly operating and maintaining websites. Supporters of Al-Hussayen said that he was not <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> linked websites published, nor for the material on the websites that he created, unless he wrote it himself. He is one of the few individuals until then to have been prosecuted under this provision of the law.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the short}} term the fiasco led Bill Cosby to end his {{advertising}} for Coke, saying his commercials that praised the superiority of the new formula had hurt his credibility, no one at Coca-Cola was fired or otherwise held <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> is still widely perceived as a misstep, {{for the simple reason that}} it ultimately wasn't. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was at a level well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo's CEO, he modified his assessment of the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that risk-taking was strongly discouraged at the company.|$|E

25|$|The Fascists {{began their}} attempt to entrench Fascism in Italy with the Acerbo Law, which {{guaranteed}} a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in an election that received 25% {{or more of the}} vote. Through considerable Fascist violence and intimidation, the list won a majority of the vote, allowing many seats to go to the Fascists. In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy Giacomo Matteotti was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist. The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in {{what became known as the}} Aventine Secession. On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> happened, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament. From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.|$|E
500|$|In 1954 Costa {{made his}} first recordings, with guitarist Sal Salvador, to whom he had been {{recommended}} by trombonist Winding. The first of these sessions, in July, featured one of Costa's compositions, [...] "Round Trip". The following year, Costa recorded a series of piano duets with John Mehegan; differences in playing style meant that several rehearsals were required to organize which pianist would be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> aspects of the performances.|$|E

In a meeting with 100students after the incident, Anthony Jones, then-president of the SAIC, assured the students that he stood behind their First Amendment rights.

500|$|The Mercury dime was {{released}} into circulation on October 30, 1916, {{the same day}} that production of the Barber dime ceased. [...] Several newspapers complained that Weinman's monogram was too prominent on the obverse; according to The New York Times, the Treasury was considering removal. [...] On November 4, Weinman enquired of Joyce whether any removal was contemplated; he received in reply compliments on his design and Joyce's statement that the Mint was not <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> appeared in print. [...] Weinman wrote again, hoping to make changes to the dime, but was told that only an act of Congress could change the design.|$|E
500|$|The Street {{scenes were}} [...] "the glue" [...] that [...] "pulled the show together", so {{producers}} knew {{they needed to}} make significant changes. The producers decided to reject the advisers' advice and reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors, specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show's most enduring characters. These test episodes were directly <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> writer Malcolm Gladwell called [...] "the essence of Sesame Street—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults". Since 2001, the full rights for the Muppets created for Sesame Street have been owned by Sesame Workshop.|$|E
500|$|On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee {{issued its}} report.

[...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they were my staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that I should have known.

500|$|The Street scenes, as Palmer {{described}} them, were [...] "the glue" [...] that [...] "pulled {{the show}} together", so producers knew {{they needed to}} make significant changes. [...] On {{the basis of their}} experience on Captain Kangaroo, Cannell, Stone, and Gibbon thought the experts' opinions were [...] "nonsense"; [...] Cooney agreed. Lesser called their decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers [...] "a turning point in the history of Sesame Street". [...] The producers reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors, specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show's most enduring characters. In addition, the producers found Saunders' role as Gordon not to be as likable by children watching the show, resulting in the character being recast by Matt Robinson, who was initially the show's filmed segments producer. These test episodes were directly <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> Gladwell called [...] "the essence of Sesame Street—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults".|$|E
500|$|During Sesame Streets {{development}} in 1968, the producers followed {{the recommendation of}} child psychologists, who advised them to not allow the direct interaction of the human actors and Muppets because the experts were concerned it would confuse and mislead young children. [...] Shortly before the show's premiere, the producers created five one-hour episodes {{so that they could}} test if children found them comprehensible and appealing. They were never intended for broadcast, but were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia in July 1969. The producers found that the results were [...] "generally very positive". [...] However, children attended to the shows during the Muppet segments, but their interest was lost during the street scenes, which featured only humans and were considered [...] "the glue" [...] that [...] "pulled the show together". [...] The appeal of the test episodes was lower than they preferred, so the producers re-shot the street segments. [...] Henson and his team created Muppets that could interact with the human actors; specifically, as the show's researchers put it, [...] "two of Sesame Streets most enduring Muppets: Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird". [...] The test episodes were <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> writer Malcolm Gladwell called [...] "the essence of Sesame Street—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults".
