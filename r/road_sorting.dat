There were three paths, one along the river, usable only in autumn when the water was low, the second along the cliffs and the third, much longer, where pack animals could be led along the mountain ridges. The modern road can become impassable beyond Basid due to rockslides. Above Basid is the large village of Roshov. Above that the Ghudara River and the Murghab Rivers join to form the Bartang. The road follows the Ghudata northeast to its junction with the Tanimas which leads west to the Fedchenko Glacier. A <b>road</b> of <b>sorts</b> continues east to lake Karakul.|$|R

The inner city districts of Vauxhall, Everton, Edge Hill, Kensington, and Toxteth mark the border with Liverpool city centre. The immediate city centre consists of the postal districts of L1, L2 and L3, although L6, L7 and L8 cover some parts of the outer city centre also. The resident population of the city centre has grown dramatically over the last decade and now stands at around 36,000 people and climbing.|$|R

25|$|With the {{exception}} of one two-lane motorway, most of the islands in the territory have no <b>roads</b> of any <b>sort.</b> Diego Garcia has a short stretch of paved road between the port and airfield; otherwise transport is mostly by bicycle. Diego Garcia's military base is home to the territory's only airport. At 3000 metres long, it is capable of supporting heavy USAF bombers such as the B-52 and {{would have been able to}} support the Space Shuttle in the event of a mission abort. It also has a major seaport.|$|R
50|$|More {{than half}} of the network has been paved, though {{maintenance}} remains a problem. There are numerous missing links in the network where tracks are impassable after rain or hazardous due to rocks, sand, and sandstorms. In a few cases, {{there has never been a}} <b>road</b> of any <b>sort,</b> such as the 200 km gap between Salo in the Central African Republic and Ouésso in the Republic of the Congo on highway 3. The missing links arise mainly because the section does not have a high national priority as opposed to a regional or transcontinental priority.|$|R
50|$|On 9 April 1918 near Bethune, France, {{owing to}} an enemy attack, {{communications}} {{were cut off}} and the wounded could not be evacuated. The road was reported impassable but Private Masters volunteered {{to try to get}} through and after great difficulty succeeded, although he had to clear the <b>road</b> of all <b>sorts</b> of debris. He made journey after journey throughout the afternoon over a road which was being shelled and swept by machine-gun fire and once he was bombed by an aeroplane. The greater number of wounded (approximately 200 men) were evacuated by him as his was the only car which got through.|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} within skyline query is {{an important}} type of location-based query, which can provide useful skyline object information for the user. Previous studies on processing the continuous within skyline query focus exclusively on a static road network, where the object attributes and the conditions of roads remain unchanged. However, in real-world applications, object attributes and road conditions inevitably vary with time, which severely limits the applicability of previous studies in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we {{address the issue of}} efficiently processing the continuous within skyline query in dynamic road networks with time-varying information. We design three elaborate data structures, the object attribute dominating matrix (OADM), the <b>road</b> distance <b>sorted</b> list (RDSL) and the skyline object expansion tree (SOET), to maintain the information of objects and the road network. Combined with OADM, RDSL and SOET, we develop an efficient algorithm, namely the within skyline object updating algorithm, to provide real-time processing of the time-varying information. Finally, a thorough experimental evaluation is conducted to show the merits of the proposed approaches...|$|R

Daniel Oss (...) tried his luck under the red kite, but was joined with about 100 meters remaining as Sagan powered his way past him to claim his second victory of the season, followed by Wouter Wippert (...) and Mark Cavendish. As he crossed the finish, Sagan banged his front wheel twice on the tarmac while still at speed. He treated the crowd to a no-footed wheelie afterward to celebrate. Although Sagan took a ten-second bonus for his victory, the overall classification remained unchanged.|$|R

60|$|The {{village is}} the place to which the <b>roads</b> tend, a <b>sort</b> of {{expansion}} of the highway, as a lake of a river. It is the body of which roads are the arms and legs,--a trivial or quadrivial place, the thoroughfare and ordinary of travellers. The word is from the Latin villa, which, together with via, a way, or more anciently ved and vella, Varro derives from veho, to carry, because the villa {{is the place}} to and from which things are carried. They who got their living by teaming were said vellaturam facere. Hence, too, apparently, the Latin word vilis and our vile; also villain. This suggests what kind of degeneracy villagers are liable to. They are wayworn by the travel that goes by and over them, without travelling themselves.|$|R
50|$|Once {{they have}} found a new nest site, the A. pallens convey this {{information}} to other workers and intermediates through glandular secretions from their antennae. They make upward runs of several centimeters long on vertical surfaces providing a <b>road</b> map of <b>sorts</b> for the adult wasps to follow. The front body of the wasp will angle slightly upward while the antennae works its way upwardly to maintain the connection with the surface. The wings perk up as they make this connection. Typically the A.pallens begin to use this trail about 3 hours after the swarm formation. This means that generally the new site is already being developed. In fact the dragging behavior seen to deposit the glandular secretion by the wasp is seen only after the deposition of building material at the new nest site.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{little more}} than a series of {{relatively}} brief interludes of military occupation, Imperial Rome was ruthless and brutal in pursuit of its ends. Genocide was a familiar part of its foreign policy and {{it is clear that the}} invasions and occupations cost thousands of lives. Alistair Moffat writes: The reality is that the Romans came to what is now Scotland, they saw, they burned, killed, stole and occasionally conquered, and then they left a tremendous mess behind them, clearing away native settlements and covering good farmland with the remains of ditches, banks, <b>roads,</b> and other <b>sorts</b> of ancient military debris. Like most imperialists they arrived to make money, to gain political advantage and to exploit the resources of their colonies at virtually any price to the conquered.

60|$|A water-tank, and stables, {{and a gray}} {{house of}} two stories, with gable ends and a verandah, are jammed hard against the hillside, just where a stream has cut for itself a narrow canyon, filled with pines. The pines go right up overhead; a little more and the stream might have played, like a fire-hose, on the Toll House roof. In front the ground drops as sharply as it rises behind. There is just room for the <b>road</b> and a <b>sort</b> of {{promontory}} of croquet ground, {{and then you can}} lean over the edge and look deep below you through the wood. I said croquet GROUND, not GREEN; for the surface was of brown, beaten earth. The toll-bar itself was the only other note of originality: a long beam, turning on a post, and kept slightly horizontal by a counterweight of stones. Regularly about sundown this rude barrier was swung, like a derrick, across the road and made fast, I think, to a tree upon the farther side.|$|R

He was not aware, indeed, of the real danger of his case, and still had hopes of surviving many years. The deacon came in at the door, just as the widow had passed through it, on her way to visit another crone, who lived hard by, and with whom she was in the constant habit of consulting. She had seen the deacon in the distance, and took that occasion to run across the <b>road,</b> having a <b>sort</b> of instinctive notion that her presence was not required when the two men conferred together. What was the subject of their frequent private communications, the Widow White did not exactly know; but what she imagined, will in part appear in her discourse with her neighbour, the Widow Stone.|$|R

While thriving residential neighborhoods, an eclectic business mix and many popular establishments mark the area, the corridor remains a seedy and undesirable locale in the collective Atlanta psyche due, in part, to the proliferation of adult businesses and the unkempt nature of the corridor." [...] In 2005 the city banned new adult businesses on Cheshire Bridge, but existing ones were allowed to stay. In 2013, councilman Alex Wan introduced legislation to remove existing adult businesses from Cheshire Bridge by 2018, {{but this was not}} passed, opposed by a mix of gays, strippers and Atlanta’s real estate interests - including Scott Selig. Some in the gay community wondered if Cheshire Bridge were [...] "sanitized", [...] "where would people go for sexual expression"? Matthew Cardinale, the editor and publisher of Atlanta Progressive News, and resident of the Road, decried [...] "the ongoing project of gentrification, homogenization, sterilization and capitalization of a historic neighborhood," [...] Atlanta's [...] "red-light district".|$|R
