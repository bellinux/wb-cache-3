The dyeing properties of the extract on silk have been studied. The colour coordinates of the dyed samples were found to be in the yellow-red quadrant of the colour space diagram and the dyed samples exhibited acceptable fastness properties. The effect of temperature and dye concentration on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>dyeing</b> has been studied. Adsorption studies revealed that the process fits well with the Langmuir isotherm model.

40|$|The color {{components}} extracted {{and isolated}} from the fruits of Lagerstroemia indica were characterized by NMR, mass, IR and UV/visible spectral techniques.

The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>dyeing</b> was higher at higher temperature. The thermodynamic parameters were evaluated using Arrhenius plot. The positive value of enthalpy change (ÎH â) indicated endothermic nature of adsorption, the high negative entropy (ÎS â) revealed that the color components adsorb more orderly on silk and the positive value of free energy (ÎG â) validated the strong affinity between adsorbent and adsorbate. Adsorption study was carried out based on the model proposed by Langmuir, Freundlich, Tempkin and Pyzhev isotherm to account for the observed results.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{optimize}} the process of dyeing polyester (PET) fabric with natural dyes. Polyester has been first treated with NaOH solution in order to study its impact on the dyeability to the natural dye. The required and used colour component was extracted from a natural plant, namely: Rhubarb; Rheum officinale. The chemical structure of the used colouring matter is observed to have all the characteristics of a typical disperse dye. The colour strength of PET fabric was noticed to increase as a result of alkali treatment which may be attributed to the alteration in the hydrophobicity of polyester fibre. The most effective parameters that may affect the dye uptake of the natural dye on alkali-treated PET fabric and the final dyeing properties including dye bath pH, dyeing temperature and time were studied in details. The behaviour of the selected and used natural dye was found to be similar to that of disperse dyes.

40|$|A woven {{pure wool}} fabric {{has been exposed}} to {{atmospheric}} pressure plasma for 30 seconds using a pilot-scale. commercial machine. X-ray photoelectron spectral data revealed large increases in oxygen and nitrogen. and a large reduction in carbon. on the surfaces of the plasma-treated fibres. A CIN ratio of 3. 55 for plasma-treated wool was consistent with removal of the covalently-bound fatty acids {{from the surface of}} the cuticle cells. resulting in exposure of the proteinaceous epicuticle. Dye staining experiments revealed that the back of the fabric had received the same, uniform level of treatment as the face, despite the fact that only the face had been directly exposed to the plasma. Dyes (1 % oww) were applied to fabric at 50 °C (liquor ratio = 40 : 1) and pH values from 3 to 6. The relatively low temperature of 50 °C was selected in order to accentuate the effects of plasma on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> uptake. Under these conditions, dye was adsOibed onto the fibre surfaces, with very little penetration into the fibres. Effects of the plasma treatment on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>dyes</b> adsorption were dyespecific. No significant effects of plasma on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> uptake were observed with relatively hydrophobic dyes, but hydrophilic dyes were adsorbed more rapidly by the plasmatreated fabric.

40|$|A typical {{insoluble}} chlorinated aromatic dye (CAD), disperse red (DR), {{was used}} to explore the reaction mechanism and kinetics of photodegradation in non-ionic surfactant solutions. The use of an additional hydrogen source and photosensitizer is also studied to improve the decay rates. The decay <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> in surfactants depends on the Km of surfactants {{and their ability to}} offering an effective hydrogen source. The photodegradation of CAD can be divided into three stages: the initial lag stage, the fast degradation stage and the final retardation stage.

However, the use of an additional hydrogen source or photosensitizer has dosage limitations in such applications.

The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>dye</b> reduction is reduced significantly {{by the presence of}} ambient O 2.

The observed kinetics are rationalised in terms of a kinetic model in which the rate determining step is the reduction of photocatalyst surface-adsorbed Rz by photo-generated surface electrons, with all photocatalyst surface sites occupied by Rz.
