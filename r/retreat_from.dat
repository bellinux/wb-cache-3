5|$|Nevertheless, major {{setbacks}} in Spain at Almanza {{and along}} the Rhine in Southern Germany, had caused Marlborough great anxiety. Prince Eugene's <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> Toulon (Marlborough's major goal for 1707) ended any lingering hopes of a war-winning blow that year.|$|E
5|$|After {{scattering}} the Americans at Kip's Bay, Howe landed 9,000 more troops, but did {{not immediately}} cut off the American <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> New York Town {{in the south of}} the island. Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the westside of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4:00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on the Heights by nightfall.|$|E

5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not help to subdue the French uprising. Instead, the German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E
5|$|Averell had {{anticipated}} resistance at the river, and had Powell's Brigade ready. Major Seymour B.

The New Yorkers circled behind the 22nd Virginia, forcing the regiment to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> the riverbank.|$|E

5|$|On the {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Dom Pedro's wife Maria in 1777, Pombal was dismissed, and Dom Pedro and Maria ruled jointly in his place, using the partially completed Rococo palace at Queluz as a <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> affairs of state {{in much the same}} way as Frederick the Great used Europe's other famed Rococo palace, Sanssouci.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{was perceived as}} a decisive Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command {{and the birth of}} heroic tales in Israel.

5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> live appearances; the few concerts he did play {{around this time}} were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.|$|E
5|$|The only ships on {{the lake}} {{following}} the American <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> Quebec were those of a small fleet of lightly armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775.

5|$|The {{regiment}} saw {{its final}} {{action at the}} Battle of P'ohang-dong, fighting unsuccessfully to take the town from U.N. troops. Racked by U.N. naval and air forces and suffering extensive losses from continuous fighting, the regiment was forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> the P'ohang-dong battlefield. It moved north, joining a concentration of other KPA units, before being disbanded and absorbed into the KPA's 12th Division.|$|E

5|$|With the Prussian <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> Ligny, Wellington's {{position}} at Quatre Bras was untenable.

5|$|A later source, Johannes Aventinus, {{writes that}} Taksony {{fought in the}} Battle of Lechfeld on August 10, 955. There, future Holy Roman Emperor Otto I routed an 8,000-strong Hungarian army. If this report is reliable, Taksony {{was one of the}} few Hungarian leaders to survive the battlefield. Modern historians, {{including}} Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó, suggest that Fajsz abdicated in favor of Taksony around that time. After that battle the Hungarians' plundering raids in Western Europe stopped, and they were forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> the lands between the Enns and Traisen rivers. However, the Hungarians continued their incursions into the Byzantine Empire until the 970s.|$|E
