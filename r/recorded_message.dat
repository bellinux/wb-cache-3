The Hunter serves {{as one of the}} most dangerous enemies within the game and as means of emotional development for Alyx Vance. The Hunter is a powerful and resilient enemy which players must often run from while seeking a means to fight back; Episode Twos environments are designed with this in mind.|$|E

It was flown on this mission to be presented to the space station crew. The flag will remain displayed on board the space station until the next crew launched from the U.S. retrieves it for return to Earth.|$|E

25|$|Alan Sugar - The {{central figure}} of the show since the {{conception}} of the British adaptation of the American original, he was the BBC's finalised choice for the programme after their initial choices rejected the offer to head the show. Outside the boardroom, he arranges the tasks the candidates undertake, including arranging the location for the briefing for it, which he may give either in person or indirectly via a <b>recorded</b> <b>message,</b> and in some circumstances may attend a task primarily to observe a team in terms of pitching. Inside the boardroom, he makes choices based on feedback, able to overturn a result if he deems it wrong, withdraw a reward he has arranged if a team does not deserve, but ultimately determines which candidates are dismissed from the process.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{approximately}} one hour after Earhart's last <b>recorded</b> <b>message,</b> the USCGC Itasca undertook an ultimately unsuccessful search {{north and west}} of Howland Island based on initial assumptions about transmissions from the aircraft. The United States Navy soon joined the search and {{over a period of}} about three days sent available resources to the search area in the vicinity of Howland Island. The initial search by the Itasca involved running up the 157/337 line of position to the NNW from Howland Island. The Itasca then searched the area to the immediate NE of the island, corresponding to the area, yet wider than the area searched to the NW. Based on bearings of several supposed Earhart radio transmissions, some of the search efforts were directed to a specific position on a line of 281 degrees (approximately northwest) from Howland Island without evidence of the flyers. Four days after Earhart's last verified radio transmission, on July 6, 1937, the captain of the battleship Colorado received orders from the Commandant, Fourteenth Naval District to take over all naval and coast guard units to coordinate search efforts.|$|E

Afterwards, the train dives back towards the ground and enters the two-inversion batwing element which crosses through a tunnel underneath the park's rear entrance.|$|E
500|$|Anticipation for {{the game}} was high in Lincoln, fueling strong demand for tickets and accommodations; the game brought celebrities {{including}} USC fans Will Ferrell (also an alumnus) and Keanu Reeves, Nebraska fans Larry the Cable Guy, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Rush Limbaugh, and Ward Connerly; past Husker Heisman-winner Mike Rozier, Trojans Heisman-winner Marcus Allen and star Trojans safety Ronnie Lott were also on hand {{for the game}}. [...] The game fell on Pete Carroll's 56thbirthday; as a surprise, Carroll was treated to a <b>recorded</b> <b>message</b> by actor Kiefer Sutherland, star of his favorite television show, 24. [...] The morning recording of College GameDay attracted 13,293fans, second to the all-time record of 15,808set by Nebraska in 2001.

500|$|Orci and Kurtzman wrote a {{scene for}} Shatner, in which old Spock gives his younger self a <b>recorded</b> <b>message</b> by Kirk from the {{previous}} timeline. [...] "It was basically a Happy Birthday wish knowing that Spock {{was going to go}} off to Romulus, and Kirk would probably be dead by the time," [...] and it would have shifted into Shatner reciting [...] "Where no man has gone before". However, Shatner wanted to share Nimoy's major role, and did not want a cameo, despite his character's death in Star Trek Generations. He suggested the film canonize his novels where Kirk is resurrected, but Abrams decided if his character was accompanying Nimoy's, it would have become a film about the resurrection of Kirk, and not about introducing the new versions of the characters. Nimoy disliked the character's death in Generations, but also felt resurrecting Kirk would be detrimental to this film, and his friendship with Shatner caused them to avoid discussing the film.|$|E

500|$|After hearing Jacobs' <b>recorded</b> <b>message,</b> two parole agents {{drove to}} the Garridos' house later that day. Upon arrival, they handcuffed him and searched the house, finding only his wife Nancy and his elderly mother at home. Then the parole agents drove {{him back to the}} parole office. En route, he said that the girls who had {{accompanied}} him to UC Berkeley [...] "were the daughters of a relative, and he had permission from their parents to take them to the university." [...] Although a month before the parole office had barred Garrido from being around minors, and although Berkeley was [...] from the Garridos' Contra Costa residence, [...] in excess of the [...] limit he was allowed to travel from his home without permission from his parole agent, the agents overlooked this violation. After reviewing his file with a supervisor, they drove him home and ordered him to report to the office again the next day to discuss further his visit to UC Berkeley, and to follow up on their concerns about the two girls.|$|E
500|$|The {{funeral was}} {{arranged}} for November 1, {{with the public}} invited to the memorial service at the Hall of Liberty, within the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Hollywood Hills. It was a secular service; Roddenberry had been cremated before the event. More than 300 Star Trek fans attended, {{and stood in the}} balcony section of the hall, while the invited guests were on the floor level. Nichols sang twice during the ceremony, first [...] "Yesterday" [...] and then a song she wrote herself titled [...] "Gene". Both songs had been requested by Barrett. Several people spoke at the memorial, including Ray Bradbury, Whoopi Goldberg, Christopher Knopf, E. Jack Newman, and Patrick Stewart. The ceremony was closed by two kilted pipers playing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as a <b>recorded</b> <b>message</b> by Roddenberry was broadcast. A four-plane flypast, in the missing man formation, followed some 30 minutes later.

In season seven, it was revealed that Carly Smithson held a prior label record deal with MCA Records. [...] Reports suggested that MCA spent over $2 million promoting Smithson's previous album which she made under the name Carly Hennessy. The album sold fewer than 400 copies. Smithson remained on the show, and placed sixth in her season. Jermaine Jones of season eleven was disqualified for having theft cases and outstanding warrants on Top 11 week.|$|E
