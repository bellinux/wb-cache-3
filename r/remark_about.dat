5|$|In February 2007, a {{controversy}} arose after Brown's appearance at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts {{as part of}} a debate on gay marriage. The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> his daughter, Ayla. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.|$|E
5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> his wife's fidelity.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond was {{compelled}} to surrender Antioch to Leo. He appointed his marshal, Bartholomew Tirel, to accompany the Armenian troops, which were {{under the command of}} Hethoum of Sason, to Antioch. The Antiochene noblemen allowed Leo's soldiers to enter the town, but the mainly Greek and Latin burgers opposed Leo's rule. An Armenian soldier's rude <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> Saint Hilary, to whom the royal chapel was dedicated, provoked a riot, forcing the Armenians to withdraw from the town. The burghers assembled in the cathedral to form a commune under the auspices of Patriarch Aimery. They declared Bohemond's eldest son, Raymond, regent for his imprisoned father. Raymond's younger brother, Bohemond, also hurried from Tripoli to Antioch, and the Armenian forces had to return to Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, Ratajkowski {{prominently}} {{defended the}} First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump, after overhearing Jacob Bernstein (son of Nora Ephron and Carl Bernstein) of The New York Times make what she considered was a derogatory <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> the president's wife {{at a party}} for Diane von Furstenberg. The following month, she became the face of DKNY intimates. She noted that by July 2017, her sex appeal, especially her cleavage, has caused her to lose jobs. The following month she became the face of DL1961 jeans. In August 2017, she also became {{the face of the}} entire DKNY brand for its fall 2017 campaign.|$|E
5|$|The episode's finale is Don's day and {{the trip}} to Howard Johnson's Restaurant and Motor Lodge in Plattsburgh. As he and Megan eat in the restaurant, Megan expresses her {{frustration}} at having her needs and desires {{take a back seat}} to Don's. The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her. Don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can't find Megan. He spends hours looking for and waiting for her, calling Peggy (the other side of the conversation from the first part of the episode) as well as Megan's mother in Montreal.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} that the change of foreign policy occurred in 1938, after the Munich Agreement, which became the final defeat of Litvinov's anti-German policy of collective security, which was marked by the reported <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> an inevitable fourth partition of Poland made by Litvinov's deputy Vladimir Potemkin in a conversation with French ambassador Robert Coulondre shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Mangeshkar {{is said to}} have imitated the {{acclaimed}} singer Noor Jehan, but later she developed her own style of singing. Lyrics of songs in Hindi movies are primarily composed by Urdu poets and contain a higher proportion of Urdu words, including the dialogue. Actor Dilip Kumar once made a mildly disapproving <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> Mangeshkar's Maharashtrian accent while singing Hindi/Urdu songs; so for a period of time, Lata took lessons in Urdu from an Urdu teacher named Shafi.|$|E

Learning of this, Pitt challenged Best and insulted him. The following morning, they met again at a coffee house and Best asked Pitt to withdraw his remarks based upon their former friendship; he refused, possibly knowing that Best's famous skill with the pistol would leave him open to accusations of cowardice.|$|E
25|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred at}} the tour's second stop at the PNE Coliseum on March 2, 1999 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After Manson made a lewd <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> Love during his band's performance, Love ran onstage, hiked her dress and jumped on Manson's back while he sang. Later in the show, Manson suffered from dizziness and fainted onstage, injuring his hand on a monitor as he fell. Initially he pretended {{it was part of}} the show, but left the stage after performing their signature song to seek medical attention. When he returned onstage, he pulled the plugs off of their instrument amplifiers and stormed offstage without performing an encore. The rest of the band left the stage afterward.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Morse opposed Eisenhower's {{appointment}} of Clare Boothe Luce as ambassador to Brazil. Morse, {{who had known}} Luce for many years, chastised Luce for her criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although the Senate confirmed Luce's appointment in a 79–11 vote, Luce retaliated against him. In her acceptance speech to the Senate, Luce commented that her troubles with Senator Morse were attributable to the injuries he sustained from being kicked by a horse in 1951. She also remarked that riots in Bolivia might {{be dealt with by}} dividing the country up among its neighbors. An immediate backlash against these remarks from Morse and other senators, and Luce's refusal to retract the <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> the horse, led to her resignation just three days after her appointment.|$|E

25|$|When Yugoslavia won {{the gold}} in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, fans rushed onto the court. One of them was holding a Croatian flag, {{one of the six}} republics that made up Yugoslavia. Divac claims that he told the man that he should not be waving that flag, since this was a win for Yugoslavia. Divac claims the man made a {{derogatory}} <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> the Yugoslav flag, at which point Divac took his flag from him. This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war. The taking of the flag made Divac a hero to Serbs, and a villain to Croatians. Divac has stated that he did not mean it as an act against Croatia and he would have taken away a Serbian flag if a Serb fan had done the same.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} created issues among getting hired {{for jobs and}} losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary {{to those of the}} employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions. Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to Silicon Republic's statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile. This shows the effects that social networks have had on people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman got fired over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement. In November 2012, a woman posted a racist <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> the President of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination. She lost her job, and was put under investigation by the Secret Service.|$|E
500|$|A {{few changes}} {{were made to the}} first few drafts of the script. Additional {{dialogue}} between George and Jerry regarding dates during the 1850s was removed for timing purposes. During his date with Donna, Jerry would mention his <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> ponies in the earlier episode [...] "The Pony Remark", but this was later changed to <b>remark</b> <b>about</b> leaving a note when committing suicide. Initially, Kramer's first name was revealed in the episode; though the information was removed from the eventual script, the idea of revealing Kramer's first name would be further exploited in the season six episode [...] "The Switch".|$|E

The Telegraph reported the <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> government, but did not publish his views on Murdoch. These views were controversial, because Cable was overseeing in a sub-judicial role the bid by Murdoch's News Corporation for all of BSkyB. The <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> Murdoch were leaked to the BBC's Business Editor, Robert Peston.

5000|$|The same obliviousness from male judges {{towards the}} {{treatment}} of their female colleagues exists {{when it comes to}} disparaging remarks toward the women judges.
