25|$|While {{traditionally}} many historians {{believed that}} the art of Chinese paper-making had been transmitted to Europe via Arab merchants who got the secret from prisoners of war taken at the Battle of Talas, some believe that Jewish merchants such as the Radhanites were instrumental in bringing paper-making west. Joseph of Spain, possibly a Radhanite, is credited by some sources with introducing the so-called Hindu-Arabic numerals from India to Europe. Historically, Jewish communities used letters of credit to transport large quantities of money without the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>theft</b> from at least classical times. This system was developed and put into force on an unprecedented scale by medieval Jewish merchants such as the Radhanites; if so, they may be counted among the precursors to the banks that arose during the late Middle Ages and early modern period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a problem-oriented policing project, extending {{over a period}} of more than two years, which was designed to reduce thefts from cars parked in the center-city of Charlotte, NC. A progressive tightening of focus led to a detailed analysis <b>of</b> the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>theft,</b> and the associated security features, in the 39 decks and 167 surface lots in the center city. This analysis showed: (1) that <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>theft</b> were much greater in lots than in decks, and (2) that higher <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>theft</b> in lots were associated with inadequate fencing, poor lighting and the absence of attendants. These data played an important part in obtaining the agreement of lot owners and operators to make security improvements. Before most of these improvements had been made, however, thefts in the lots began to decline, possibly as the result of more focused patrolling by police and security personnel. The paper concludes with a discussion of the difficulties encountered by police in undertaking problem-oriented projects, and of ways to help them meet these difficulties...|$|R

2500|$|Cats also display pica {{behavior}} {{in their natural}} environments and {{there is evidence to}} support that this behavior has a psychological aspect to it. Some breeds (such as the Siamese cat) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica. Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even cardboard and then progress into ingestion of these substances. This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common. [...] Theories explaining why this behavior becomes active during this time suggest that early weaning and stress as a consequence of separation from the mother and litter-mates and exposure to a new environment are to blame. Eating wool or other substances may be a soothing mechanism that cats develops to cope with the changes. Pica is also observed predominately during 6–8 months of a cat's life when territorial and sexual behaviors emerge. Pica may be induced by these social stressors. [...] Other theories contemplated include pica as a redirection of prey-catching/ingestion behavior as a result of indoor confinement, especially common among oriental breeds due to <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>theft.</b> [...] In natural environments pica has been observed in parrots (such as macaws) and other birds and mammals. Charles Munn has been studying Amazon macaws lick clay from riverbeds in the Amazon to detoxify the seeds they eat. Amazon macaws spend two to three hours a day licking clay. [...] Munn has found that clay helps counter the tannin and alkaloid in the seeds the macaws ingest, a strategy that is also used by native cultures in the Andes Mountains in Peru.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{building}} boom in Charlotte, NC led to sharp {{increases in the}} number of kitchen appliances stolen from houses under construction. This paper describes a problem-oriented policing project, extending over a period of more than two years, that was undertaken by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department to address the problem. A detailed analysis of security practices and the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>theft</b> was made for 25 builders operating in one of the police service districts {{in the northern part of}} the county. This produced the recommendation that installation of appliances should be delayed until the new owners had taken up residence, thus effectively removing the targets <b>of</b> <b>theft.</b> Twelve <b>of</b> the larger builders agreed to experiment with this approach for a period of six months, though systematic checks made by police throughout the period found that builder compliance was variable. Despite this, analysis showed that delayed installation was an effective policy. Appliance theft declined in the district and there was no evidence <b>of</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>thefts</b> to surrounding districts. The concluding discussion of the difficulties encountered by police in undertaking problem-oriented projects focuses on the vital role of crime analysis, Crime Prevention Studies, volume 13, pp. 89 - 130.
