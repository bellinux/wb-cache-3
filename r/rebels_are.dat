Twenty years have gone by and Ti Noel has fathered twelve children {{by one of the}} cooks. He has told these children many stories of Macandal and they await his return. A secret gathering of trusted slaves takes place: Bouckman, the Jamaican, speaks of possible freedom for the blacks emerging in France and also mentions the opposition from the plantation landowners. An uprising is planned; {{as a result of this}} meeting, conch-shell trumpets sound and slaves, armed with sticks, surround the houses of their masters. Upon hearing the conch-shells Lenormand de Mezy is frightened and manages to hide. The slaves kill the white men and drink much alcohol. Ti Noel, after drinking, rapes Mademoiselle Floridor, who is Lenormand de Mezy's latest mistress. The uprising is defeated and Bouckman is killed. The governor, Blanchelande, advocates for the complete extermination of the colony's black population, as they pose a threat with their voodoo and secret religion.

25|$|The {{most famous}} of these was the Aboke abductions of 139 female {{students}} in October 1996.

Government attempts to destroy the <b>rebels</b> <b>are</b> thus viewed as another cause for grievance by the Acholi. The moral ambiguity of this situation, in which abducted young <b>rebels</b> <b>are</b> both the victims and perpetrators of brutal acts, {{is central to the}} conflicted attitudes of many Acholi towards the rebels.|$|E

Later in July 2017, the Israeli government said it opposed the cease-fire agreement in southern Syria that the United States and Russia had reached a week prior that envisaged establishing de-escalation zones along Syria’s borders with both Jordan and Israel, as that would legalise Iran′s presence in Syria.|$|E
