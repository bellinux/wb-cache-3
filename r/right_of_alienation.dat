40|$|One of {{the major}} controversies in modern {{intellectual}} property law {{is the extent to}} which property rights conceptions, developed in connection with land or other forms of tangible property, can be carried over to different forms of property, such as rights in the spectrum or in patents and copyrights. This article defends the thesis that, once the differences in the optimal duration of patents and copyrights are taken into account, the carryover of basic property conceptions from tangible to intangible property should be much encouraged. In some instances, the property rights concepts applicable to land often work even better for intangible property because some of the difficulties in designing landbased systems disappear. The short life of patents, for example, obviates the need to create rules dealing with restraints on alienation over time. This article also critiques the recent development in eBay v.

It assesses the potential of different governance structures, including administrative hierarchies, market approaches, and efforts at local non-market co-ordination. The paper examines the management of public goods in Central and Eastern Europe through a study of open space management and urban sprawl in a semi-urban county near Warsaw, Poland. The protection of open space poses significant challenges to semi-urban land management, as its benefits cannot be captured by individual entities and accrue as much to urban residents as to local people. The concrete institutional options investigated comprehend the use of land registers for monitoring land conversion, establishment of land trusts in part financed by a development gains tax, and technical and organisational support for local environmental organisations. The evaluation of options builds on an analysis of causes underlying rapid land conversion in the past decade. The causal analysis demonstrates that privatisation and decentralisation have evoked the radical changes in land use. The demand for housing land motivated farmers to sell semi-urban land, as the state could not enforce its legal oversight over land use. Land conversion was driven by local alliances of farmers eager to "cash in" on their newly acquired <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> a broader rural society primarily interested in economic development, and local authorities lured by increasing tax revenues.

Feudal England {{was a combination of}} the Roman system and Anglo-Saxon tradition. From that very strict hierarchical structure England has experienced an evolution toward free land market. In contrast, since very early China has established a unique economic system that allowed free <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> land, but it has been trying to check the development of land market and private property rights by various means, the most important of which is the strengthening and expanding of patriarchal clan system. The different development paths of China and England show the different responses of two different cultures, which are oriented toward family and individual, respectively, to the same problems related to landownership. ...|$|R

30|$|The Colonial Nigeria {{was divided}} into colonies and protectorates where {{multiplicity}} of land tenure systems existed. The arrival of Europeans in Southern Nigeria in the later part of 19 th drastically changed the land holding system. As soon as the European traders, who were used to freehold, began to acquire land parcels in Lagos colony, they did so with the concept that the transactions conferred on them absolute ownership and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> However the Northern Protectorate was saved the experience of Southern Nigeria. Lord Lugard, who occupied Northern Nigeria {{at the turn of}} 19 th century, used the “tools” he found locally for the administration of land holdings. The Emirs who exercised “proprietorial” rights were appointed or re-appointed and given “letters of appointment” which transferred their feudal pattern of land holdings to the Crown. The Native Rights Proclamation of 1910 nationalised all land and placed it under the control and administration of the Governor {{in the interest of the}} indigenous population. In 1914, Lord Luggard amalgamated the Southern and Northern Protectorates into one centralised Nigeria ruled from Lagos, with each region retaining its land tenure system. In 1954 under regionalisation scheme, three regions emerged with the Northern Protectorate becoming the Northern Region, and the Southern Protectorate divided into West and Eastern Regions. The Regions were subsequently divided into States starting with 12 State in 1968 till the current 36 States and Federal Capital City, Abuja. Each state inherited the land tenure system from the Region it was created (Atilola 2010).|$|E
40|$|The {{reform of}} China's {{enterprise}} system increasingly reflects {{the outcome of}} China's emerging property rights market. We distinguish between a centrally-directed reform strategy, with characteristics {{similar to those of}} a Pigouvian tax, and a market-driven reform process, which captures the essential features of a Coasian approach to social cost. The Coase Theorem postulates that eliminating transaction costs and attaching well specified property rights to public goods that generate externalities will allow uncoordinated economic agents to negotiate institutional arrangements that produce socially efficient allocation of resources. Extending Coase's reasoning to the case of socialist transition ' we argue that reforms that expand competition, move toward well-specified assignment of ownership rights to public enterprises, and reduce transaction costs will motivate the "ultimate" owners, including officials of national and sub-national government agencies, to reconfigure their assets or to combine their assets with those of other jurisdictions and/or private investors to create more efficient ownership arrangements. We review the extent to which China's reforms have established the conditions for an effective market in ownership rights to industrial property. We tabulate progress from 1 980 to present along the three major analytic dimensions inherent in Coase's analysis: competition, property rights, and transaction costs. We conclude that the sheer size and diversity of China's industrial economy will motivate a continuation of decentralized reform initiatives. To support this Coasian reform process, central and provincial governments need to expand initiatives to clarify property rights, particularly the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> reduce impediments to competition, and facilitate the reduction of transaction costs.

40|$|Copyright © 2014 Cambridge University PressFollowing Wesley Hohfeld's {{pioneering}} analyses, which {{demonstrated that}} the folk concept of ownership conflated a variety of distinct legal relations, a deflationary bundle theory regarding those relations as essentially unconnected held sway {{for much of the}} subsequent century. In recent decades, this theory has been thought too diffuse; it seems counterintuitive to insist, for instance, that <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> possession and <b>alienation</b> over a property are associated only contingently. Accordingly, scholars such as James Penner and James Harris have advanced theories that revive the concept of ownership, identifying some instances of property as paradigmatic, and regarding others as conceptually subsidiary. I propose a new interpretation of the bundle theory, based on David Lewis's idea of Humean supervenience among physical particles.

Some authors claim the alienation to be the synonym {{for the state of}} mind {{the contemporary}} man. A strong interest in the problems <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as expressed by the recent ideas is accompanied by the emergence of a great variety of interpretations of this concept. Dean Dwight assessed thirteen possible correlates <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> It is not unusual, as in the new considerations <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> many influences from the near and far tradition are present, as well as the results of the new original research and thinking. Besides, as the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> is not interesting exclusively to the philosophy, from various fields new solutions and different concepts are coming. All this makes modern discussion on alienation not only more complex, but more interesting at the same time. Starting from the fact that alienation is many-faceted phenomenon, the sociologist tried to assess its main qualifications. These efforts resulted in the well known systematization of the meanings <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> given by D. Dwight, M. Seeman, J. P. Clark and others. Contemporary sociology gives other solutions too. Especially promising is the recognition of the general characteristic of the modern concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> revealed through the comparison with the traditional concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as a whole, The traditional theory is dominated by the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> which gets the meaning {{in the context of the}} global society and the history as a whole.

This {{is an important}} novel, {{not only because of}} its commercial success, but also because it depicts a specific marginalised subculture. Postmodernism and systems theory approaches, as well as changes in the social and political spheres have motivated researchers such as Geyer (1996), Kalekin-Fishman (1998) and Neal and Collas (2000) to reinterpret Seeman’s theory. This article attempts to incorporate this new theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in the analysis of contemporary fiction. Seeman identifies five aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> namely powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, social isolation and self-estrangement. Following Neal and Collas (2000), in particular, this article omits self-estrangement, but shows how the other four aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> have changed since Seeman’s formulation. It is argued that “Trainspotting” depicts a specific occurrence <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in modern western society, besides normlessness, meaninglessness, and social isolation, highlighting Seeman’s concept of powerlessness, in particular.

Stimmen. The introduction provides explanations concerning the history <b>of</b> the term <b>alienation</b> and shows that the research on Christa Wolf barely considered the crucial importance <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> for her work and neglected the autobiographical statements of the author on that topic. In the first chapter, {{some of the most important}} cultural and political events in the GDR and those occurring shortly after the reunification of Germany have been analyzed in order to understand which influence these events had on the literary work of Christa Wolf. This analysis aims at identifying which degrees <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> were present at given times and at deciphering the alienation experience in details. In this context, autobiographical and biographical relations, diaries, interviews, essays and other works of Christa Wolf were considered. Under the aspect <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> the second chapter considers the adaptation of myth by Christa Wolf, compares her dealing with the Cassandra- and Medea myth and tries to make apparent similarities and differences in her concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> The aim is to show which function the myth fulfills in this context and in which aspect the myth is used for projections <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> A comparison <b>of</b> those two myth adaptations seems necessary in order to find out if a shift took place in the perception of the author concerning alienation. The third chapter refers to the theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> by the sociologist Melvin Seeman. Seeman transferred the term <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> from the sociological context to the socio-psychological context and at the end of the 50 ties developed a scheme of five categories of subjective experience <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> According to his understanding there are five common meanings of this term: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement. Seeman’s theory led to many controversies, mainly because the choice of his five categories and their relation to each other was questioned. After a short introduction of Seeman’s theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> the importance <b>of</b> his theory for the analysis of literary figures will be discussed. The fourth chapter aims at interpreting the <b>alienation</b> features <b>of</b> the literary figures in Medea. Stimmen on the basis of the classification by Melvin Seeman. Contrary to the prevalent belief that Christa Wolf’s Medea is a non-alienated figure, that judges, decides and acts with a great degree of determination, this work defends the thesis that not only Medea but rather all figures are alienated in different degrees. The theory by Melvin Seeman serves as a basis for the analysis of the different forms <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> experience <b>of</b> the literary figures. Under consideration of two important aspects, the political and cultural alienation, feelings, emotions and behavior of the figures will be explained. The plot of the novel is told from the perspective of the six figures: Medea, Jason, Agameda, Akamas, Glauke and Leukon. This serves as a basis for the literal analysis. The conclusion serves to compare the experience <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> the author with those of her literary figures...|$|R

40|$|The extreme {{concepts}} {{in the theory}} <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> have been analysed in this paper. Such concepts can be found both in the traditional {{as well as in}} the contemporary theories. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> considered from the global and from the predominantly positive aspects, characterizes the traditional theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> In Hegel 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy such a concept becomes expressed as an extreme. Hegel is interested in the general situation, in logic, and in evolution of the historical process; the historical process itself is happening by means <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> in other words, by means of changing the passions (partial interests and activities) into idea and intellect (general, common, social contents). Hegel does not seem to be interested in the problems of an individual, such problems being of no interest at his time after all, for the liberal capitalism does not produce the problematic but self-confident and strong personalities. Hegel is not aware of the destructive, self-destructive moments in the process <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> Consequently, the alienation becomes exclusively positive process for Hegel, it becomes a specific process of the human self-creation in the history. The individual side of the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> has been worked out in more detail with Marx. With Marx as well as with Lenin the destructive side of the negativism, building not only the history but also representing a great danger for the human existence, has been rather emphasized. In this way the extreme of Hegel 2 ̆ 7 s concept has been lessened. On the other hand, in the contemporary theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> there is a collision between the extreme and complete concepts. Different from the traditional theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> the contemporary concept emphasizes, on the whole, the individual and negative aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> In the philosophy of existentialism such a concept has been expressed to an extreme. Quite different from such an extreme term, a lot of modern authors have been pointing out the drawbacks and extremes in the contemporary concepts, (e. g. L. Feuer’s criticism) and they have been trying to realize the complete approaches to the question <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> This question particularly becomes explicit in the works of E. Fromm and W. Mills. Thus some definite contours of the complete approaches as well as the criticism of the extreme concepts <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> can be traced both in the traditional and contemporary theories. From what has been said about the question <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> by now, it becomes evident that its complete research must include the global and the individual, the positive and the negative aspects of the problem at the same time. As an example of such an approach, the isolation and the lack of power have been analysed in the research. The analysis has clearly pointed out that these, as well as other forms <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> can and must be analysed as the complete social-individual and positive-negative phenomena...|$|R
