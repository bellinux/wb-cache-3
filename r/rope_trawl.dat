50|$|A {{variety of}} nets and related {{instrumentation}} has been deployed on CalCOFI cruises over the years. {{many of these}} {{have been developed for}} use by the CalCOFI program. Oblique tows using a bongo net are employed to sample for micronekton, mesozooplankton and ichthyoplankton. Vertical tows for icthyoplankton and mesozooplankton are conducted using a Pairovet and PRPOOS nets. Finally, surface tows with a Manta net are used to sample neuston. Supplementary sampling focuses on collection of juvenile and small fish via trawling techniques. This includes using a Modified Isaacs Kidd Net, a Matsuda Oozeki Hu trawl (MOHT), and the Nordic <b>rope</b> <b>trawl.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{succession}} of seasons {{is accompanied by}} predictable changes in the environment. In general, food production increases in the spring to reach a maximum during summer, and then declines in the fall before reaching minimal values during winter. Hence, fish often face food shortages during winter and must rely on the reserves accumulated during summer to fuel their metabolic functions. As the duration of winter increases with latitude in the northern hemisphere, fish living at {{the northern end of}} their distribution must accumulate higher lipid reserves during the growing season to survive over winter (Conover and Present 1990). Here, we tested the hypothesis that lipid accumulation in Pacific salmon increases with latitude during summer. Juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were collected in the Eastern Bering Sea (BS), in southeastern Alaska (SEA), and on the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) using a <b>rope</b> <b>trawl</b> in September–November 2002 – 2003 (Fig. 1). Growth rates of juvenile coho salmon were estimated assuming that WCVI, SEA, and BS coho smolts migrated to sea at an average size of 100 mm on May 1, May 15, and June 1, respectively, as coho smolt...|$|E
40|$|Genetic mixed-stock {{analysis}} {{has been used}} routinely for over two decades to estimate the origins of ocean-caught Pacific salmon. However, nearly all of these applications {{have focused on the}} study of maturing adult fish taken in fisheries. Recently, genetic stock identification efforts are also being directed at the study of juvenile mixtures (e. g., Teel et al. 2003; Brodeur et al. 2004). This shift {{is due in part to}} the recent availability of samples taken in surveys along the coast of North America in large-scale programs to study juvenile salmonids during their ocean phase (e. g., Brodeur et al. 2000). The genetic analysis of juveniles is also motivated by a lack of available information on the initial marine movements of many stocks, particularly of untagged natural spawning populations. The purpose of this paper is to use results from allozyme analyses of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) sampled in nearshore areas of the U. S. Pacific Northwest to illustrate examples of genetically distinct stocks with contrasting migration patterns. Fish were captured during the summers of 1998 – 2001 in surveys of nearshore coastal areas ranging from central Oregon to northern Washington (Emmett and Brodeur, 2000). Trawls consisted of one-half-hour long surface tows with a 264 Nordic <b>rope</b> <b>trawl</b> along nine transects perpendicular to shore ranging from La Push, Washington (47 ° 55 ’N) to Cape Perpetua, Oregon (44 ° 15 ’N). Sampling stations began 1 – 5 nautical miles offshore and continued, in about 5 nautical-mile increments, to about 30 nautical miles offshore. Cruises, of about one wee...|$|E

Today, the island is connected to Måløy by a land-filled causeway and is the site of a park featuring the remains of the German fort, two memorials of World War II and a disc golf course. The island also has a modern <b>rope</b> and <b>trawl</b> factory, a large freeze warehouse, and an ISPS port.

40|$|The deep-pelagic (incl. meso- and bathypelagic) domain {{has been}} {{historically}} sampled using relatively small research trawls (ring nets, modified otter trawls, rectangular trawls, International Young Gadoid Trawls, and MOCNESS trawls), which have shaped {{what we know}} about midwater taxa. The towing speed, effective mouth area, and mesh sizes of the gears mentioned mainly select for macroplankton and micronekton, as larger nekton can outswim or outmaneuver these nets. Researchers are increasingly using larger, commercial-sized high speed <b>rope</b> <b>trawls</b> to sample the deep-pelagial. An example is the Offshore Nekton Sampling and Analysis Program (ONSAP), a component of NOAA’s Natural Resource Damage Assessment following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The ONSAP employed two types of midwater trawls to collect deep-pelagic fauna in the northern Gulf of Mexico between 0 - 1500 meters depth; a 10 -m 2 MOCNESS (MOC 10) and a commercial-sized, high-speed Irish Herring Trawl (IHT). Data will be presented comparing the catches of the Chiasmodontidae, a top meso/bathypelagic predator family, from the two gear types. The IHT collected 1, 060 specimens in 146 of 167 trawls (87 % frequency), compared to only 87 specimens collected by the MOC 10 in 68 of 241 trawls (28 % frequency). A minimum of 15 species of chiasmodontids were collected with the IHT (currently all Chiasmodon identifications are C. niger complex, pending revision), while eight were collected with the MOC 10. Comparisons of standardized abundance and length frequencies will be presented as evidence and incentive for employing multiple trawl types to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the deep-pelagial, earth’s largest biome...|$|R

40|$|The mesopelagic {{community}} of fishes and squids are fundamental {{in the diet}} of apex predators, {{but in most cases}} their life histories and habitat requirements are poorly understood. In May 1999, a pilot study was conducted to identify mesopelagic nekton, describe dominant physical characteristics of their habitat, and compare their relative abundances over several study sites in the southeastern Bering Sea. Biological samples were collected at 250, 500, and 1000 m depths with an open pelagic <b>rope</b> <b>trawl</b> lined with 1. 2 -cm mesh in the codend. Net type, mesh size, and trawling techniques were designed to parallel those of extensive Russian research surveys in the western Bering Sea, permitting direct comparisons between study results. Forty-three species of fish and 15 species of cephalopods were identified, including a new species of gonatid squid and a range extension for Paraliparis paucidens, a snailfish never before observed in Alaskan waters. Faunal biomass was high with over 25, 000 (1400 kg) fish and squid collected in only 13 trawls. Concentrations of fish in this area surpass published records from the western Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean by an order of magnitude, driven primarily by Leuroglossus schmidti, a deep-sea smelt. Generally, specimens were of high quality, and new size records were established for several species of fish and squid. The physical environment as determined from altimetry, satellite-tracked drifters, and water properties (temperature and salinity) was typical of the last decade for this area. Spatial patterns in species distribution were observed, but {{further research is needed to}} determine whether these are a factor of mesoscale variability or of habitat characteristics.

40|$|Bear Seamount (39 ° 55 ’ N; 67 ° 30 ’ W) is the westernmost peak of extinct undersea volcanoes in the New England Seamount Chain (Moore et al., 2003). It {{is located}} on the {{continental}} slope off Georges Bank, and is governed by unique environmental factors and currents that may be unlike those of the other seamounts (Moore et al., 2003). Previous cruises to this seamount have been successful in capturing abundant fishes, cephalopods and invertebrates (Moore et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2008), but only the distribution patterns of the fishes and cephalopods have been examined, leaving a lack of information on the deep-sea crustaceans. The diversity, catch per unit effort (CPUE) and biogeography of trawl-vulnerable micronekton in the vicinity of Bear Seamount were investigated, with primary focus on baseline data collection. Sixty-six species of pelagic Crustacea (Decapoda, Lophogastrida, and Euphausiacea) were collected at 35 trawl stations in the spring of 2003 and 2004 and fall of 2014 with the International Young Gadoid Pelagic Trawl (IYGPT) and a Polytron Midwater <b>Rope</b> <b>Trawl</b> (PMRT). Depths sampled ranged from the surface to 1700 m, with most trawls sampling primarily below 1000 m. When comparing relative biogeography of the nekton in IYGPT samples, the assemblage {{on the south side of}} the seamount was the most diverse, while the summit assemblage was the most abundant and species rich. In the PMRT samples, the summit assemblage was the most diverse and species rich while the assemblage on the west side had the greatest abundance. Overall CPUE was dominated by cold temperate species, typical of mid- to higher latitudes in the North Atlantic. Eusergestes arcticus and Meganyctiphanes norvegica were particularly dominant in both the IYGPT and PMRT samples. At least two species were new records for Northwest Atlantic waters and may have traveled by means of currents and/or from nearby seamounts...|$|E

Stones, and oysters, too, come up in the nets; and the latter are the betes-noires of the fishing. Sometimes, when the fleet gets over a bed of oysters, a score of nets will be lost in a single night for, when the bag becomes full of oysters, its weight is so great that the utmost power of the fishermen's exertions, on the winch, is insufficient to lift it from the bottom; and there is nothing to be done but to cut the <b>rope,</b> and abandon <b>trawl</b> and net.

No correlations were found, however, between towing speed (2. 7 – 5. 0 knots) and the total catch of sardinella. Increasing the two duration during the day to more than 2 h also failed to yield consistently higher catches. A negative correlation at night between tow duration (15 – 60 min) and catch size arose simply because the trawl was towed for a longer time to obtain adequate samples in areas with scattered recordings. During the day, sardinella was caught both inshore and further oVshore, while horse mackerel (Trachurus trecae and Trachurus capensis) was caught further oVshore only.

40|$|A {{series of}} pelagic trawl {{sampling}} trials on pelagic species distributed near surface off Angola {{were conducted by}} R/V «Dr. Fridtjof Nansen» operating a medium sized pelagic trawl with a vertical opening of about 20 m. The results have been analysed with respect to effects such as vessel and gear avoidance, time of day, towing speed and tow duration. Numerous trawls targeting on dense sardinella shoals failed to yield large catches. Shoals that were at the trawl depth as the vessel passed over were often observed far below the foot <b>rope</b> of the <b>trawl,</b> indicating vertical avoidance. Often shoals in the net mouth were recorded by the net sonde for long periods. It was assumed that these fast swimming fish were able to swim along with the trawl, and escaped out of the trawl when slowing down the towing speed during hauling. No correlations were, however, found between towing speed in the range 2. 7 - 5. 0 knots and the total catch of sardinella. Increasing the tow duration during the day to more than 120 minutes also failed to yield consistently higher catches. At night, there was a negative correlation between tow duration in the range 15 - 60 min and the catch size, simply because the trawl was towed for a longer time to obtain proper samples in areas with scattered recordings. During the day sardinella was caught both inshore and further offshore, while horse mackerel was caught further offshore only. Both species were well represented in the catches made at night. There were substantial day and night differences in the length distributions of sardinella with small sardinella being caught only at night...|$|R
40|$|The ground ropes {{function}} {{is to keep the}} net in contact with the sea bottom, and herd fishes to the entrance of the bag net. In the case of thinking about selective fishing with a drag net, it is necessary to clarify the shape and herding function of the ground rope. But there are very few reports about it. In this paper, the author considered forces acting on the ground rope under towing conditions, and decided the shape of it analytically. The author designed a fish herding model the ground rope based on the theoretical probability of fiches entering the funnel of a net. Based on these results, the author investigated the shape and gear efficiency of the ground rope. Finally the author intended to obtain rational instructions for designing of ground rope. (1) The construction and weight distribution of three types of ground rope: Danish Seine, Bull Trawl and Trawl, (typical drag nets operated in Japan), were compared. Weight distribution of both Danich Seine and Trawl are uniform. But the mean weight of the later is much heavier than that of the former. It the case of comparison of Trawl and Bull Trawl, the former is long and increases its weight towards the middle. The latter is short and very heavy and shows little difference in its weight distribution. The difference in fishing methods are clearly influenced {{in the construction of the}} two types ground rope. (2) Three forces: hydraulic resistance of netting concentrated at the lacign line, hydraulic resistance of ground rope, and sliding frictional force between sea bottom are acting on the ground rope under towing conditions. At equilibrium those forces made a fixed ground rope shape. The author assumed the ground rope as a connection of segments, and considered an equlibrium among three components acting on them: horizontal, vertical and tangential components. In general it is impossible to express the vertical and horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope as a simple function. Assuming that the horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope is constant at any part, the length and end distances are known ahead of time, the shape of the ground rope was expressed graphically based on the distribution of vertical components of it which were obtained experimentaly. (3) The vertical component acting on each segment of the ground rope under towing conditions was expressed as the sum of hydraulic resistance, sliding frictional force and sand drag. Drag of clyinder type of bobbins at different lengths and that of sphere type of bobbins in various directions were measured both on wet concrete and in a sand tank with water. The drag of two types bobbin on a rocky bottom (F_D) had no directional qualities, and may be expressed as the product of weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μ_ 90); F_D=μ_ 90 W_B. The drag coefficient of cylinder type of bobbins and sphere type of bobbins were 0. 75 and 0. 68 respectively. The drag of cylinder type of bobbins in towed on a sandy bottom is dependent upon the on attack angle (90 °-θ), and may be expressed the product of the weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μθ) as follows; F_D=μθW_B. The drag coefficient is a function of θ　and is expressed as follows; μθ= 0. 68 (0. 72 sin^[1. 5]θ+cos^[1. 5]θ). In the case of a sphere, the drag coefficient was denoted a constant value of 0. 68. Hydraulic resistance of model ground rope composed of clyinder type of bobbins was measured in a circulating tank. Hydraulic drag coefficient (C_D) showed a constant value of about 0. 45. (4) Three types of model ground rope differing in weight distribution were made. These were examined both on wet concrete and sandy sea bottom under various conditions for the purpose of measuring shape and resistance. Close agreement was shown between experimental values of the shape and resistance of them, and those of calculated values obtained by analytically using the drag coeffieients mentioned above. When the distribution of forces acting on ground rope uder towing condition are known, the shape of it can be decided using the method proposed in this study. On the other hand the weight distribution of ground rope for making a certain ground rope shape can be decided using the method proposed in this study. (5) The author paid attention to fish reaction to the ground rope and considered a fish herding model for the ground rope. Theoretical probability of fishes entering the funnel of the bag net was calculated, and six theoretical types of ground rope: triangle, trapezoid, half ellipse, arc, parabola and catenary were compared. The fishing efficiency of trapezoid, parabola, half ellipse and catenary showed almost same values under towing condition based on the fish herding model for flat fish. The wing tips distance at maximum fishing efficiency was wider than usual towing conditions. Higher fishing efficiency would be expected under that towing condition. Fishing efficiency of two types of ground <b>rope,</b> middle-weighted Bull <b>Trawl</b> type and heavy-weighted Trawl type, were compared by towing on a sandy sea bottom using the fish herding model proposed in this study. Fishing efficiency of the former was a little higher than that of the latter. This corelates well with the results of field experiments. (6) The ratio of resistance of ground rope to the total resistance of drag net was about 30 - 35 % under towing condition. It is imposible to change a ground rope shape under towing condition by means of variation on the weight distribution of the ground rope. In the case of thinking on the ground rope shape, it is necessary to consider the hydraulic resistance of netting which were concentrated to the lacing lines and acting on the ground rope. The trapezoid shape glound rope was showed the fishing efficiency using the fish herding model proposed in this study. About 30 - 35 % of resistance of drag net should act on the points both edge of bosom of ground rope to make a trapezoid-shape ground rope. It is one method to concentrate whole drag acting on ground rope and hydraullic resistance of netting there as a results of many considerations on weight distribution of ground rope and the design of lacing lines...|$|R
