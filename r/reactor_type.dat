It has the disadvantage of forming what is called “tail flame,” which is when polymerization extends into the vacuum line.|$|E

40|$|There are <b>reactor</b> <b>types</b> that {{defy the}} {{traditional}} item accountancy safeguards approach applied to LWRs. <b>Reactors</b> <b>types</b> such as FBRs and PBMRs that prohibit traditional item counting {{fall into a}} safeguards gap between item-counting facilities and bulk facilities. At Fast Reactors and Pebble-Bed HTRs the difficulties associated with traditional item counting {{have given rise to}} safeguard approaches that rely upon maintaining Continuity of Knowledge (CoK) of containment and surveillance (C/S) data throughout the operational lifetime of the reactor. The reliance on CoK represents an inherent weakness in the safeguards approach; if CoK is lost and cannot be re-established, a facility will potentially remain out of compliance for the duration of its operational lifetime. It is evident that new safeguards approaches are required for these <b>reactor</b> <b>types</b> to mitigate the CoK vulnerability. At the present time, {{there are only a few}} reactors worldwide that cannot be readily safeguarded by item accountancy and C/S. However, future nuclear fuel cycles that are being considered around the globe all include a fast reactor component. For example, the Pebble-Bed HTR is a potentially attractive reactor design for countries with little or no existing nuclear infrastructure. It is clear that the number of reactors posing the unique safeguards challenge associated with systems that do not permit traditional item accountancy will increase in the coming years. Now is the time to consider safeguards alternatives that will remove the excessive dependence on C/S continuity of knowledge to provide the safeguards community with viable alternative safeguards approaches for these <b>reactor</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R
50|$|CANDU <b>type</b> <b>reactors</b> {{operating}} in Canada have the particularity {{of being able}} to use natural uranium as fuel because of their high neutron economy. Therefor the costly fuel enrichment step required by the more prevalent light-water <b>reactor</b> <b>types</b> can be avoided.

50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>reactor</b> <b>type</b> on {{dispersity}} depend {{largely on the}} relative timescales associated with the reactor, and with the polymerization type. In conventional bulk free radical polymerization, the dispersity is often controlled by the proportion of chains that terminate via combination or disproportionation. The rate of reaction for free radical polymerization is exceedingly quick, due to the reactivity of the radical intermediates. When these radicals react in any reactor, their lifetimes, and as a result, the time needed for reaction are much shorter than any reactor residence time. For FRPs that have a constant monomer and initiator concentration, such that the DPn is constant, the dispersity of the resulting monomer is between 1.5 and 2.0. As a result, <b>reactor</b> <b>type</b> does not affect dispersity for free radical polymerization reactions in any noticeable amount as long as conversion is low.|$|E
