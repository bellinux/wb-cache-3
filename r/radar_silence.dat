500|$|Sydneys first {{overseas}} deployment as a transport was to Southeast Asia in 1964. In late May, {{the ship}} was loaded with supplies and munitions for Malaysian forces {{in support of the}} country's defence policy against Indonesia. In total, 1,245 personnel were also embarked: engineers from the 7th Field Squadron, the Royal Australian Artillery's 111th Light Anti-aircraft Battery, and four UH-1 Iroquois helicopters plus associated air- and ground crew from No. 5 Squadron RAAF. Sydney departed Garden Island just after midnight on 24 May. After entering New Guinea waters, {{the ship was}} put on high alert; radio and <b>radar</b> <b>silence</b> was enforced, while the anti-aircraft guns of the 111th Battery were secured to the ship's deck to supplement her armament. Sydney met the destroyer escorts [...] and [...] off the Philippines on 3 June, and a day later, the ships arrived at Kota Kinabalu, where the 7th Field Squadron was offloaded with the aid of the Australian Army landing ships Vernon Sturdee and Clive Steele. Sydney and her companions left for Singapore at midnight on 5 June, and arrived three days later to offload 250 tonnes of ammunition. Sydney and Parramatta then proceeded to Penang, where the 111th Battery, No. 5 Squadron, defence stores, and more munitions were offloaded during 16â€“17 June. The return voyage to Australia was interrupted on the morning of 23 June by the detection of a suspected Indonesian submarine: the two Australian ships performed evasion tactics for eighteen hours before resuming the voyage to Fremantle. No awards were issued to Sydney for operating in support of Malaysia during her service life, but a reorganisation of RAN battle honours published in March 2010 saw the battle honour [...] "Malaysia 1964" [...] retroactively awarded to the ship.|$|E

At dusk, {{under cover of darkness}} and maintaining radio and <b>radar</b> <b>silence,</b> the force would proceed at full speed to the French coast to keep the German s bottled up in Brest. The force would return to Plymouth by daylight. By day the RAF would patrol the Channel and by night, Plymouth.|$|E

50|$|INS Sindhughosh {{collided}} with a foreign merchant vessel - MV Leeds Castle - while trying to surface in the seas north of Mumbai on 7 January 2008. The submarine was taking part in fleet level war games, when the accident occurred. The boat has reportedly suffered slight damage to the conning tower area. Naval officials said the submarine was submerged and had its radars off and periscope down when it slammed into the merchant vessel off India's Diu Island, 400 nmi km from Mumbai. The boat was apparently maintaining total radio and <b>radar</b> <b>silence</b> to escape detection, when the accident took place. It has also been reported that the indigenously developed USHUS sonar malfunctioned and played a direct role in the accident. A Navy officer, on condition of anonymity, stated that the MV Leeds Castle was in restricted waters and in that area the ocean depth is not great and thus {{the reason for the}} mishap. Other naval officials expressed surprise that how in the high seas, the submarine was cruising at only at a depth of 10 to 20 ft. The submarine has since been towed to a naval dockyard at Mumbai and a Board of Inquiry has been ordered to probe the mishap. The crew of INS Sindhughosh had a miraculous escape as the accident was caused at surface level. The reports of structural damage is a cause of concern. Normally the submarine has two hulls. But any damage to structure means checking the entire review of the whole structure. Even if one steel bar has a weakness, the submarine will face adverse conditions at 250 m below sea level.|$|E
