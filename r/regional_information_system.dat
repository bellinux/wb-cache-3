40|$|A {{mosaic of}} ERTS {{images of the}} CARETS region {{has been used to}} {{partition}} the region into zones on the basis of similarity of tones and textures visible at a regional-scale overview. The resulting patterns were compared with existing small scale maps of the region representing relief, land surface forms, geology, soils, vegetation, forest types, and land use. The ERTS-derived zones most closely resemble the patterns on the small scale land use map, suggesting that, at least in a highly developed region such as CARETS, land use is an indicator or resultant surface expression of several interacting environmental processes. These results lend support to the CARETS model of interdisciplinary regional analysis, whereby remote sensor-derived data sets on land use and land use change become the basic data entry into a <b>regional</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to serve regional planners and land managers...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the SIT-REM project is the design and the {{development}} of an interoperable web-GIS environment for the information retrieval and data editing/updating of the geobotanical and wildlife map of Marche Region. The vegetation, plant landscape and faunistic analysis allow the realization of a <b>regional</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> for wildlife-geobotanical data. A main characteristic of the SIT-REM is its flexibility and interoperability, in particular, its ability to be easily updated with the insertion of new types of environmental, faunal or socio-economic data and to generate analyses at any geographical (from regional to local) or quantitative level of detail. Different query levels obtain the latter: spatial queries, hybrid query builder and WMSs usable by means of a GIS. SIT-REM has been available online {{for more than a year}} and its use over this period has produced extensive data about users’ experiences...|$|E

40|$|The Irkutsk <b>Regional</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> for Environmental Protection (IRIS) {{assesses the}} current status and {{dynamics}} of the Irkutsk region’s forestry environment as influenced by man-made changes and anthropogenic impact. IRIS aims to efficiently share up-to-date and long-term satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) data and socio-economic information within earth science community, regional governance and nature-protecting services to identify environmental impacts that are both economic and socially responsible. IRIS is integrating methods of econometrics, a framework to estimate quantitatively the contribution of specific industrial branches, here the Lumber Industry Complex (LIC) into the economy of Irkutsk Province. Thus, for integrated environmentally-adjusted forest management, tools are necessary which refer {{to the complexity of}} the natural resource to be managed and the difficulty to predict the factors or driving forces influencing them. Advanced EO products, image processing techniques embedded in an object-oriented GIS framework, web service technology and open standards as recommended by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGCTM) help to handle the complex character of the problem. IRIS benefits and contributes to on-going European-Russian cooperation projects and is funded by the European Commission (INCO-CT 2006 - 015110) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore and {{describe}} the perceptions of registered nurses regarding the factors that influence service delivery in expansion programmes in a primary health care setting. A qualitative approach was used to conduct this study. Purposive sampling methods were used to select participants from the registered nurses who had been working in the clinics for more than two years and had been exposed to the expansion programmes in the clinics. The researcher collected data by means of focus group interviews, conducted in a neutral setting. Data were analysed,according to the Tesch method of data analysis, by the researcher and an independent co-coder. Categories, sub-categories and themes were identified. The categories that form the basis of the discussion are: disabling factors, enabling factors, client related factors, service related factors and solutions of problems. It was recommended that the integration and coordination of programmes at provincial level should be planned in conjunction with the training. The <b>regional</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> should introduce an electronic recordkeeping system, which links all clinics to one database, allowing these clinics to monitor clients who shop around and move between clinics. Training in expansion programmes should be continually conducted in the region in the form of in-service training. Dissertation (MCur) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} a {{best practice}} example for a <b>regional</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> on issues, relevant for regional development. The BodenseeClick Information System for Tourism, Environment and Soft Mobility is operating since 1998 {{in the international}} region of Bodensee (Lake Constance). The Information System is has been developed by private and non-governmental institutions {{with the help of}} European funding. BodenseeClick is an approach to soft mobility in tourism, which can be of effect for other regions. It shows an attempt, not only to realise technical solutions, but also to use and to develop a regions human capital. The paper will present some background information about tourism and mobility in the tri-national tourist destination of Bodensee, the objectives and actual state of the Information System BodenseeClick and some hints on how other regions can benefit from the experiences. The first section presents the specific situation of tourism mobility in the Bodensee region: tourists are travelling mostly with their private cars, well know problems arise: filled parkings, congested innercity roads, pollution, etc. At the same time, the public transport system has to face the problems of a cross border region: timetables are very complicated, lines end up at the border, information is hard to get, etc. The second section discusses the objectives of BodenseeClick: the intelligent interlinkage of tourist information...|$|E
