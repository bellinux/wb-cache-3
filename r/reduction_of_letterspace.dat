40|$|Background: <b>Reduction</b> <b>of</b> {{immunosuppression}} {{is considered}} a reasonable adjuvant therapeutic strategy in solid-organ transplant recipients experiencing multiple or high-risk skin cancers. However, the literature provides no guidance about what threshold of cancer development would warrant initiation <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> immunosuppression. Objectives: To develop expert consensus guidelines for initiation <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> transplant-associated immunosuppression for solid-organ transplant recipients with severe skin cancer. Methods: An expert consensus panel was convened by the International Transplant Skin Cancer Collaborative and Skin Care for Organ Transplant Patients Europe <b>Reduction</b> <b>of</b> Immunosuppression Task Force. Thirteen hypothetical patient scenarios with graduated morbidity and mortality risks were presented and mean and mode expert opinions about appropriate level <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> systemic immunosuppression (mild, moderate, severe) were generated. Results: Mild <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> transplant-associated immunosuppression was considered warranted once multiple skin cancers per year developed or with individual high-risk skin cancers. Moderate reduction was considered appropriate when patients experienced > 25 skin cancers per year or for skin cancers with a 10 % 3 -year risk <b>of</b> mortality. Severe <b>reduction</b> was considered warranted only for life-threatening skin cancers. Conclusions: <b>Reduction</b> <b>of</b> immunosuppression {{is considered a}} reasonable adjuvant management strategy for transplant recipients with numerous or life-threatening skin cancers.
