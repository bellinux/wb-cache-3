25|$|It is {{relatively}} unusual (25% {{of the total}} number of cases) for cholesterol emboli to occur spontaneously; this usually happens in people with severe atherosclerosis of the large arteries such as the aorta. In the other 75% it is a complication of medical procedures involving the blood vessels, such as vascular surgery or angiography. In coronary catheterization, for instance, the incidence is 1.4%. Furthermore, cholesterol embolism may develop after the commencement of anticoagulants or thrombolytic medication that decrease blood clotting or dissolve blood clots, respectively. They probably lead to cholesterol emboli by <b>removing</b> <b>blood</b> clots that cover up a damaged atherosclerotic plaque; cholesterol-rich debris can then enter the bloodsteam.|$|E
