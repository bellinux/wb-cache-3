25|$|NBD-Rhodamine Energy Transfer: In this method, {{membrane}} {{labeled with}} both NBD (donor) and Rhodamine (acceptor) combine with unlabeled membrane. When NBD and Rhodamine are {{within a certain}} distance, the Förster <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (FRET) happens. After fusion, <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (FRET) decreases when the average distance between probes increases, while NBD fluorescence increases.|$|E

TR-FRET combines the low background aspect of TRF with the homogeneous assay format of FRET. The resulting assay provides an increase in flexibility, reliability and sensitivity in addition to higher throughput and fewer false positive/false negative results.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} diagonal disordered one-dimensional Anderson {{models with}} an underlying periodicity. We assume the simplest periodicity, i. e., we have essentially two lattices, {{one that is}} composed of the random potentials and the other of non-random potentials. Due to the periodicity special <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> appear, which {{are related to the}} lattice constant of the non-random lattice. Further on two different types of behaviors are observed at the <b>resonance</b> <b>energies.</b> When a random site is surrounded by non-random sites, this model exhibits extended states at the <b>resonance</b> <b>energies,</b> whereas otherwise all states are localized with, however, an increase of the localization length at these <b>resonance</b> <b>energies.</b> We study these <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> and evaluate the localization length and the density of states around these energies.

40|$|The {{resonating}} block localize {{wave function}} (RBLW) method is introduced, a resonating {{modification of the}} block localized wave functions introduced by Mo et al. [Mo, Y.; Peyerimhoff, S. D. J. Chem. Phys. 1998, 109, 1687]. This approach allows the evaluation of <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> following Pauling’s recipe. The method is tested on two model molecules, hexagonal H 6 and benzene. Calculations have been done with (local) and without local restrictions (delocal). <b>Resonance</b> <b>energies</b> for both molecules have been obtained {{for each type of}} calculation, in agreement with Pauling’s concept. From a comparison of the <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> obtained from RBLW and standard valence bond calculations, the resonating block localize wave functions prove to yield <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> close to standard valence bond delocal calculations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{discussed}} the relationship between theoretical and experimentally estimated <b>resonance</b> <b>energies,</b> and in particular {{we have reviewed the}} discrepancies in the above two kinds of <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> for butadiene and benzene. Unfortunately, at present there are some difficulties in determining the resonance stabilization by using the prevailing calculation programs at the ab initio level. In contrast, experimentally estimated <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> can be well-defined and are discussed routinely. However, as we have pointed out in this paper, the pi-electronic delocalization ability is somewhat underestimated by the experimentally deduced data...|$|R
25|$|Fluorescence <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> {{transfer}} (FRET), {{also known}} as förster <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer, <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (RET) or electronic energy transfer (EET), {{is based on the}} transfer of energy from an excited (donor) chromophore or fluorophore (if the chromophores are fluorescent) to a nearby acceptor. In this method, fluorophores are chemically linked or genetically fused to two proteins hypothesised to interact. If the proteins interact, this will bring the fluorophores into close spatial proximity. If the fluorophores are oriented in a manner that exposes the fluorophores to one another, usually ensured when designing and constructing the fluorophore-protein linkage/fusion, then the energy transfer from the excited donor fluorophore will result in a change in the fluorescent intensities or lifetimes of the fluorophores.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} {{occurs in}} the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria, and algal and plant chloroplasts and requires the energy of four photons. The electrons from the oxidized water molecules replace electrons in the P680 component of photosystem II, which have been removed into an electron transport chain via light-dependent excitation and <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer onto plastoquinone. Photosytem II therefore has also {{been referred to as}} water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase.|$|E
25|$|Chemical shift (δ) is a {{relative}} measure describing {{a shift in the}} <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> of a nucleus due to the transition of electrons within its s orbital. The whole spectrum is shifted in either a positive or negative direction depending upon the s electron charge density. This change arises due to alterations in the electrostatic response between the non-zero probability s orbital electrons and the non-zero volume nucleus they orbit.|$|E

40|$|Isoscalar giant {{resonances}} in fast rotating nuclei are investigated {{within the}} framework of nuclear elasticity by solving the equation of motion of elastic nuclear medium in a rotating frame of reference. Both Coriolis and centrifugal forces are taken into account. The nuclear rotation removes completely the azimuthal degeneracy of the giant <b>resonance</b> <b>energies.</b> Realistic large values of the angular velocity, which are still small as compared to the giant resonance frequencies, are briefly reviewed in relation to allowed high angular momenta. It is shown that for the A= 150 region, the Coriolis force is dominating for small values (≲ 0. 05) of the ratio of angular velocity to resonance frequency, whereas the centrifugal force plays a prominent part in the shift of the split <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> for larger values of the ratio. Typical examples of the <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> and their fragmentation due to both rotation and deformation are given...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} transport in a three-terminal graphene quantum dot. All nine {{elements of}} the conductance matrix have been independently measured. In the Coulomb blockade regime accurate measurements of individual conductance resonances reveal slightly different <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> depending on which pair of leads is used for probing. Rapid changes in the tunneling coupling between the leads and the dot due to localized states in the constrictions has been excluded by tuning the difference in <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> using in-plane gates which couple preferentially to individual constrictions. The interpretation of the different <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> is then based {{on the presence of}} a number of levels in the dot with an energy spacing of the order of the measurement temperature. In this multi-level transport regime the three-terminal device offers the opportunity to sense if the individual levels couple with different strengths to the different leads. This in turn gives qualitative insight into the spatial profile of the corresponding quantum dot wave functions. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
25|$|Single {{molecule}} DNA assay. A DNA hairpin {{composed of}} 5 base pair stem and poly-thymidine loop that is labeled with a donor (Cy3) and an acceptor (Cy5) {{at the ends}} of the stem was encapsulated in the v-SNARE vesicle. We separately encapsulated multiple unlabeled poly-adenosine DNA strands in the t-SNARE vesicle. If the two vesicles, both ~100nm in diameter, dock and a large enough fusion pore forms between them, the two DNA molecules should hybridize, opening up the stem region of the hairpin and switching the Förster <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (FRET) efficiency (E) between Cy3 and Cy5 from a high to a low value.|$|E
25|$|The {{second of}} Hoyle's {{nucleosynthesis}} papers also introduced an interesting {{use of the}} anthropic principle, which was not then known by that name. In {{trying to work out}} the routes of stellar nucleosynthesis, Hoyle calculated that one particular nuclear reaction, the triple-alpha process, which generates carbon from helium, would require the carbon nucleus to have a very specific <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> and spin for it to work. The large amount of carbon in the universe, which makes it possible for carbon-based life-forms of any kind to exist, demonstrated to Hoyle that this nuclear reaction must work. Based on this notion, Hoyle therefore predicted the values of the energy, the nuclear spin and the parity of the compound state in the carbon nucleus formed by three alpha particles, which was later borne out by experiment.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine has a {{conjugated}} {{system of}} six π electrons that are delocalized over the ring. The molecule is planar and, thus, follows the Hückel criteria for aromatic systems. In contrast to benzene, the electron density is not evenly distributed over the ring, reflecting the negative inductive {{effect of the}} nitrogen atom. For this reason, pyridine has a dipole moment and a weaker resonant stabilization than benzene (<b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> 117kJ·mol−1 in pyridine vs. 150kJ·mol−1 in benzene). The electron localization in pyridine is also reflected in the shorter C–N ring bond (137pm for the C–N bond in pyridine vs. 139pm for C–C bond in benzene), whereas the carbon–carbon bonds in the pyridine ring have the same 139pm length as in benzene. These bond lengths lie between the values for the single and double bonds and are typical of aromatic compounds.|$|E
40|$|An exact {{expression}} of the transmission probability through a finite graphene superlattice with an arbitrary number of potential barriers n is derived in two cases of the periodic potential: rectangular electric potential and δ-function magnetic potential. Obtained transmission probabilities show two types of resonance energy: barrier-induced <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> unchanged as n varies and well-induced <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> undergone the (n - 1) -fold splitting as n increases. Supported by numerical calculations for various types of graphene superlattices, these analytical findings {{are assumed to be}} in equal applied to all of finite graphene superlattices regardless of potential natures [electric or magnetic] as well as potential barrier shapes.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of attributing energies to atomic excited states, given experimental line shapes. It is underlined that poles of the resolvant operator are not determined by peaks in cross-sections.

25|$|Nanoparticles {{can also}} be used in {{conjunction}} with DNA to perform genetic alterations. These are frequently monitored through the use of fluorescent materials, allowing scientists to judge if these tagged proteins have successfully been transmitted—for example green fluorescent protein, or GFP. Nanoparticles are significantly less cytotoxic than currently used organic methods, providing a more efficient method of monitoring genetic alternations. They also do not degrade or bleach with time, as organic dyes do. Suspensions of nanoparticles with the same size and shapes (mono-dispersed) with functional groups attached to their surfaces can also electrostatically bind to DNA, protecting them from several types of degradation. Because the fluorescence of these nanoparticles does not degrade, cellular localization can be tracked without the use of additional tagging, with GFPs or other methods. The 'unpacking' of the DNA can be detected in live cells using luminescence <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (LRET) technology.|$|E
25|$|These photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each {{consisting}} of an antenna complex that uses chlorophylls and accessory photosynthetic pigments such as carotenoids and phycobiliproteins to harvest light {{at a variety}} of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer to a specialized chlorophyll a at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll a molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. Photosystem I contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules, designated P700, at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700nm light. Photosystem II contains P680 chlorophyll that absorbs 680nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red – see the visible spectrum). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} {{based on}} an extension of Zwanzig's model of protein folding indicates that global downhill folding proteins should reveal different apparent melting temperatures (Tms) when monitored by different techniques. This was experimentally confirmed in the protein BBL mentioned above. The unfolding followed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence <b>resonance</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (FRET) and fluorescence all revealed different apparent melting temperatures. A wavelength-dependent melting temperature was also observed in the CD experiments. The data analyzed with a structure-based statistical mechanical model resulted in a unimodal population distribution at all temperatures, indicating a structurally uncoupled continuous unfolding process. The crucial issue in such experiments is to use probes that monitor {{different aspects of the}} structure. For example, DSC gives information on the heat capacity changes (and hence enthalpy) associated with unfolding, fluorescence on the immediate environment of the fluorophore, FRET on the average dimensions of the molecule and CD on the secondary structure.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{simulating}} {{the effect of}} outgoing-wave boundary conditions in the calculation of quantum resonances is presented. The Hermitian Hamiltonian operator H is multiplied on each side by a damping operator D, consisting of a real function d(R), which is unity in the resonance region and falls gradually to zero in the asymptotic region. The spectrum of the symmetrically damped Hamiltonian operator, DHD is shown to provide an excellent approximation to the <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> of the Hamiltonian with outgoing-wave boundary conditions. Applications to the calculation of <b>resonance</b> <b>energies</b> for collinear H+H scattering and for HO dissociation are presented.
