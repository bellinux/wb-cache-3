40|$|The <b>range</b> <b>gated</b> {{technique}} is a promising laser ranging method that {{is widely used}} in {{different fields such as}} surveillance, industry, and military. In a <b>range</b> <b>gated</b> system, a reflected laser pulse returned from the target scene contains key information for range reconstruction, which directly affects the system performance. Therefore, it is necessary to study the characteristics and effects of the target reflection factor. In this paper, theoretical and experimental analyses are performed to investigate the influence of target reflection on three-dimensional (3 D) <b>range</b> <b>gated</b> reconstruction.

Our theoretical and experimental study shows that the range accuracy is proportional to the target surface reflectivity, but it decreases when the angle of incidence increases to adhere to the BRDF model.

50|$|At 8:40 pm (12:40 pm EST) on 25 February 1991, {{parts of}} an Iraqi Al Hussein Scud missile {{destroyed}} the barracks housing {{members of the}} 14th Quartermaster Detachment.

The radar initially detected the incoming Scud, but lost track of the Al-Hussein when the system failed to predict its new position. In the single, most devastating attack on U.S. forces during that war, 28 soldiers died and 99 were wounded. The 14th Quartermaster Detachment lost 13 soldiers and suffered 43 wounded. Casualties were evacuated to medical facilities in Saudi Arabia and Germany.|$|E

50|$|A major {{features}} of the radar was its maximum unambiguous range of 32768 nmi km despite a pulse repetition frequency PRFof some hundreds of pulses per second.To combine these two features requires that the radar carry out nth time around tracking, that is, {{it had to be}} able to track an echo resulting from a transmitted pulse other than that sent as the start of the same PRF period in which the echo was received.In order to do so the range system employed a 2-second time base which allowed the system to determine the number of PRF periods elapsing before an echo, resulting from a particular transmit (Tx) pulse was received. The range system carried out a find process, then a verify process before entering the auto-tracking mode. All the following discussion uses ranges in yards—the radar was designed to work in those units and converting them to metric units would not add any clarity to this description.The FIND process is first carried out. In this process two successive Tx trigger pulses are delayed by a time equivalent to an RF wave go and return distance of 16,000 yd. Then the <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> triggers are delayed by an equivalent time. The delayed Tx trigger pulses are counted in an auxiliary counter, the zone counter, until target video pulses are detected in the delayed range gates. At this point the zone counter contains the number of PRF periods corresponding to the nth time around.The VERIFY process is then entered. In this mode one Tx pulse is delayed for a 16,000 yd equivalent distance. The <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> in the zone determined in the FIND mode is also delayed to match the TX delay. This sequence is repeated until four video returns, from eight attempts, are received. When the four returns are detected automatic tracking is maintained. The contents of the zone counter are added to the apparent range, that is the range reported in the current PRF period, to determine the actual range of the target.If, during the Verify process four returns are not found after eight tries the Find process is re-initiated.Take this example, in which a PRF of 142 PPS is assumed: A target at a range of 4,883,072 yd is to be acquired.At the radar console the operator initiates the FIND mode, and the system carries out that process by delaying triggers, counting zones etc., as described above, and finds that the zone counter has stored a count of four. The VERIFY mode then takes place, resulting in confirmation of the zone count. The target will appear, on the radar display to be at a range of 265,200 yd, that is the difference between, in this case, four PRF period equivalents, plus the additional range. The range reported will be the actual target range of 4,883,072 yd, the figure displayed on the range read-out. As the radar was designed to track moving objects the need arose to handle targets which, in closing or opening range, during nth time around tracking, came into coincidence with the next Tx pulse.So, in the jargon, the radar had to be capable of tracking “through the Big Bang.” This arises from the fact that the antenna serves both the Tx and Rx. To allow this to happen a device called the Transmit-Receive Switch Switchis used. The antenna is connected to the Rx until the Tx is pulsed. The T-R Switch detects the Tx pulse and transfers the antenna to the Tx for the duration of the pulse, say, 1 microsecond. period is that in which a radio wave would travel 164 yd. Remember we are talking here of radar ranges, the total go and return distance.At the instant the Rx is disconnected from the antenna the range system will lose track.In order for an Nth time around tracking system to work there has to be some arrangement to cover the loss of Rx signal for the Tx pulse period.In the radar under discussion this is achieved as follows. When the target pulse reaches an apparent range of ±16,000 yd of the Tx pulse a number of Tx pulse, the number being the zone count, are delayed by a time equivalent to 32,000 yd. Take our example above. When the range of the target reduces to 4,633,872 yd-that is 16,000 yd greater than the 4 zones, the 32,000 yd delay is introduced into the Tx system. After 4 pulses the delay is transferred into the <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> generation system, and the target continues to be tracked. After the target has reached a range of 4,601,872 yd, 4 zones minus 16,000 yd, the delay is removed from the system. At that point the range is such that the zone counter will have been decremented by 1 and the apparent range will be 1,138,468 yd, but with the target at a real range of 3 zones plus the apparent range. Obviously, for an opening target the zone counter will be incremented and the apparent range will be slightly more than 16 yd.|$|E
5000|$|Electromagnetic (radio or sound) {{waves are}} conceptually pure single {{frequency}} phenomena while pulses may be mathematically {{thought of as}} composed {{of a number of}} pure frequencies that sum and nullify in interactions that create a pulse train of the specific amplitudes, PRRs, base frequencies, phase characteristics, et cetera (See Fourier Analysis).

30|$|RGPO can {{be roughly}} {{divided into three}} stages: stop delay period, towing period, and {{termination}} period. In the first period, jammers amplify and forward signals quickly to make time delay difference between the target echo and itself short enough to enter the radar range gate; due to its higher power of interference signal, the <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> cannot lock the exact interference signal. When the stop delay period ends or when the <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> locks interference signal, {{it comes to the}} second period, towing period. In this period, time delay of a jammer’s forwarding signal is gradually extended to increase distance between the interference signal and target signal in a range dimension. Because the <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> is locked in the interference signal, the target has been dragged out of the <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> gradually. Then the change rule of time delay of the interference signal can be expressed as dτ(t)/dt[*]=[*]v(t), where τ(t) and v(t) are the towing distance and towing speed, respectively. Finally, when the target is dragged out of the <b>range</b> <b>gate,</b> it comes to the termination period, in which the jammer is turned off or stops forwarding the interference signal, and the radar returns back to the search state because there is no signal within the <b>range</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an analysis of how the <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> may contribute to transit time broadening from a pulsed Doppler perspective. Our analysis and simulation results show that the <b>range</b> <b>gate</b> can contribute to transit time broadening at small beam-flow angles. In particular, at such angles, the spectral broadening bandwidth is dependent on the effective axial length of the sample volume. On the other hand, at higher beam-flow angles, the spectral broadening bandwidth is dependent on ultrasound beam parameters such as focal length and aperture size: a finding that is consistent with previous studies. Our analysis also shows that there exists a transition beam-flow angle at which the parameters governing transit time broadening undergo a significant change. © 2004 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
