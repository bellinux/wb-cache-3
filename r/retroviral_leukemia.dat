40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that three integral membrane receptors of mammals [...] the ecotropic <b>retroviral</b> <b>leukemia</b> receptor (ERR), the human retroviral receptor (HRR), and the T-cell early activator (Tea) [...] are homologous {{to a family}} of transporters specific for amino acids, polyamines, and choline (APC), which catalyze solute uniport, solute:cation symport, or solute:solute antiport in yeast, fungi, and eubacteria. Interestingly, the ERR membrane protein was recently shown {{to function as a}} cation:amino acid cotransporter. A binary sequence similarity matrix and an evolutionary tree of the 14 members of this family, illustrating their sequence similarities and divergences, were constructed. Other proteins, including the developmentally controlled GerAII spore germination protein of Bacillus subtilis and the acetylcholine receptor of Drosophila melanogaster gave sequence comparison scores of a sufficiently large magnitude to suggest (but not to establish) a common evolutionary origin with members of the APC family. We report an extended and corrected Tea cDNA sequence and show that the mammalian Tea and ERR encoding genes are differentially expressed in tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the two mammalian cDNA sequences hybridize with other vertebrate and yeast genomic DNAs under stringent conditions. These observations support the notion that cell surface receptor proteins in mammals are transport proteins that share a common origin with transport proteins of single-celled organisms. Thus, permeases of essential metabolites may function pathologically as viral receptors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Retroviral induced {{malignancies}} {{serve as}} ideal models {{to help us}} better understand the molecular mechanisms associated with the initiation and progression of leukemogenesis. Numerous retroviruses including AEV, FLV, M-MuLV and HTLV- 1 {{have the ability to}} infect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in the deregulation of normal hematopoiesis and the development of leukemia/lymphoma. Research over the last few decades has elucidated similarities between retroviral-induced leukemogenesis, initiated by deregulation of innate hematopoietic stem cell traits, and the cancer stem cell hypothesis. Ongoing research in some of these models may provide {{a better understanding of the}} processes of normal hematopoiesis and cancer stem cells. Research on <b>retroviral</b> induced <b>leukemias</b> and lymphomas may identify the molecular events which trigger the initial cellular transformation and subsequent maintenance of hematologic malignancies, including the generation of cancer stem cells. This review focuses on the role of retroviral infection in hematopoietic stem cells and the initiation, maintenance and progression of hematological malignancies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Retroviruses are {{evolutionary}} optimized gene carriers {{that have}} naturally adapted to their hosts to efficiently deliver their nucleic acids into the target cell chromatin, thereby overcoming natural cellular barriers. Here we will review—starting with a deeper look into <b>retroviral</b> biology—how Murine <b>Leukemia</b> Virus (MLV), a simple gammaretrovirus, {{can be converted}} into an efficient vehicle of genetic therapeutics. Furthermore, we will describe how more rational vector backbones can be designed and how these so-called self-inactivating vectors can be pseudotyped and produced.

40|$|Multiple {{copies of}} {{retroviral}} sequences are stably integrated in the genomes of many higher organisms, {{and are thus}} transmitted vertically to offspring via the germline (1). Most of these heritable viral genes are not expressed, and expression, when observed, is commonly limited to envelope (env) genes {{as demonstrated by the}} presence of cell surface and serum envelope glycoprotein (gp 70) in mice. Studies of the mouse have shown that certain tissues such as the reproductive tract and lymphoid organs are common sites for the expression of endogenous env genes, suggesting that the transcription of at least some endogenous sequences is tissue specific. The transcription of endogenous viral genes is regulated by both cis and trans mechanisms (2 - 5) and their expression can be temporally linked to differentiation and development (6 - 8). The consequences to the host of endogenous retroviral genes are varied. At one extreme, expression of endogenous virus can result in the development of leukemia and death. Another potentially detrimental effect is that of insertional mutagenesis, seen when the integration of retroviral sequences interrupts the functioning of a cellular gene (9, 10). However, {{it is now clear that}} expression of endogenous retroviral genes may also have a beneficial effect for the host: namely, mediating resistance to <b>retroviral</b> <b>leukemias</b> as has been demonstrated for the Fv- 4 gene in mice (11) and some ea loci in chickens (12). This form of resistance is due to the blockage of cellular viral receptors by the expression of envelope glycoprotein on the cell surface. The Rmcf locus of the mouse is another resistance gene that may exert its effect by the expression of an endogenous env gene. A summary of our current state of knowledge concerning the Rmcf gene is shown in Table I. The Rmcf gene was originally described when it was observed that fibroblast cell cultures derived from certain strains of mice restricted the replication of recombinant mink cell focus-forming(MCF) 1 viruses (13). As detailed in Table I, DBA/ 2 mice are the prototypic strain exhibiting the Rmcf resistance (Rmcf(r)) phenotype. Cell cultures from other strains, such as C 57 BL/ 6 and IRW, are permissive for MCF viral replication and are termed Rmcf sensitive (Rmcf(s)). Previously, we described two allelic forms of an endogenous env gene, whose expression is linked to the Rmcf gene (14). Cell cultures from Rmcf(r) mice express gp 70 related to that of MCF viruses, whereas cultures derived from Rmcf(s) mice either express no gp 70 (IRW) or express an endogenous xenotropic gp 70 (C 57 BL/ 6). These two gp 70 alleles are detectable by type-specific mAbs...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{gene therapy}} {{could be used}} to treat a number of {{inherited}} blood diseases such as hemophilia or thrombophi-lia. Although liver-directed retroviral transduction can result in long-term gene expression in vivo, the low level of protein production has limited its clinical application, We reasoned that the insertion of liver-specific promoters into retroviral vectors would increase gene expression in vivo. The 347 -bp human a,-antitrypsin (hAAT), the 810 -bp murine albumin (mAlb), the 490 -bp rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (rPEPCK), and the 596 -bp rat liver fatty acid binding protein promoters were inserted into a Moloney murine <b>leukemia</b> <b>retroviral</b> backbone containing the hAAT reporter gene.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} effective vs. ineffective viral containment {{are central to}} immunoprevention and therapies of <b>retroviral</b> infections. Feline <b>leukemia</b> virus (FeLV) infection is unique as a naturally occurring, diametric example of effective vs. ineffective retroviral containment by the host. We developed a sensitive quantitative real-time DNA PCR assay specific for exogenous FeLV to further explore the FeLV–host relationship. By assaying p 27 capsid antigen in blood and FeLV DNA in blood and tissues of successfully vaccinated, unsuccessfully vaccinated, and unvaccinated pathogen-free cats, we defined four statistically separable classes of FeLV infection, provisionally designated as abortive, regressive, latent, and progressive. These host–virus relationships were established by 8 weeks post-challenge and could be maintained for years. Real-time PCR methods offer promise in gaining deeper insight into the mechanisms of FeLV infection and immunity...|$|R
40|$|Retroviral vector–mediated HSC {{gene therapy}} {{has been used}} to treat {{individuals}} with a number of life-threatening diseases. However, some patients with SCID-X 1 developed <b>retroviral</b> vector–mediated <b>leukemia</b> after treatment. The selective growth advantage of gene-modified cells in patients with SCID-X 1 suggests that the transgene may {{have played a role in}} leukemogenesis. Here we report that 2 of 2 dogs and 1 of 2 macaques developed myeloid leukemia approximately 2 years after being transplanted with cells that overexpressed homeobox B 4 (HOXB 4) and cells transduced with a control gammaretroviral vector that did not express HOXB 4. The leukemic cells had dysregulated expression of oncogenes, a block in myeloid differentiation, and overexpression of HOXB 4. HOXB 4 knockdown restored differentiation in leukemic cells, suggesting involvement of HOXB 4. In contrast, leukemia did not arise from the cells carrying the control gammaretroviral vector. In addition, leukemia did not arise in 5 animals with high-level marking and polyclonal long-term repopulation following transplantation with cells transduced with an identical gammaretrovirus vector backbone expressing methylguanine methyltransferase. These findings, combined with the absence of leukemia in many other large animals transplanted with cells transduced with gammaretroviral vectors expressing genes other than HOXB 4, show that HOXB 4 overexpression poses a significant risk of leukemogenesis. Our data thus suggest the continued need for caution in genetic manipulation of repopulating cells, particularly when the transgene might impart an intrinsic growth advantage.

HeLa monoclonal cell lines expressing either YFP-H 3 or YFP-H 3 CATD were generated by stable integration via Moloney murine <b>leukemia</b> <b>retroviral</b> delivery. The YFP-H 3 and YFP-H 3 CATD constructs (Black et al., 2004) were each sub-cloned into the retroviral plasmid, pBABE-BLAST (Shah et al., 2004), and these were subsequently co-transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) with the VSV-G pseudotyping plasmid into 293 -GP cells (which express the retroviral gag and pol genes) to generate amphotropic retrovirus (Morgenstern and Land, 1990). Virus-containing supernatant was harvested two days following transfection, passed through a 0. 45 µm filter, mixed with hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene; 8 µg/ml), and then incubated with HeLa cells overnight.

40|$|Generating lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with {{different}} viral glycoproteins (GPs) may modulate the physicochemical {{properties of the}} vectors, their interaction with the host immune system, and their host range. We have investigated the capacity of a panel of GPs of both <b>retroviral</b> (amphotropic murine <b>leukemia</b> virus [MLV-A]; gibbon ape leukemia virus [GALV]; RD 114, feline endogenous virus) and nonretroviral (fowl plague virus [FPV]; Ebola virus [EboV]; vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV]; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]) origins to pseudotype lentiviral vectors derived from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac 251). SIV vectors were efficiently pseudotyped with the FPV hemagglutinin, VSV-G, LCMV, and MLV-A GPs. In contrast, the GALV and RD 114 GPs conferred much lower infectivity to the vectors. Capitalizing on the conservation of some structural features in the transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic tails of the incorporation-competent MLV-A GP and in RD 114 and GALV GPs, we generated chimeric GPs encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of GALV or RD 114 GPs fused to the cytoplasmic tail (designated TR) of MLV-A GP. Importantly, SIV-derived vectors pseudotyped with these GALV/TR and RD 114 /TR GP chimeras had significantly higher titers than vectors coated with the parental GPs. Additionally, RD 114 /TR-pseudotyped vectors were efficiently concentrated and were resistant to inactivation induced by the complement of both human and macaque sera, indicating that modified RD 114 GP-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors may be of particular interest for in vivo gene transfer applications. Furthermore, as compared to vectors pseudotyped with other retroviral GPs or with VSV-G, RD 114 /TR-pseudotyped vectors showed augmented transduction of human and macaque primary blood lymphocytes and CD 34 + cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Enhancement of the fibrinolytic {{activity}} of vascular cells by {{tissue plasminogen activator}} (tPA) gene transfer has considerable clinical potential. However, it is unknown whether greater constitutive expression of the tPA gene might increase plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) secretion, which could negate expected increases in fibrinolytic activity that accompany greater tPA protein production. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to determine whether transduction of human endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) with a retroviral vector containing the human tPA gene would increase tPA production and what effect this would have on endogenous PAI- 1 secretion and subsequent fibrinolytic activity. Methods: Cultivated human EC and SMC either were transduced with a murine <b>leukemia</b> <b>retroviral</b> vector (MFG) containing the human tPA gene and, in the case of controls, the lacZ gene, or they were exposed to media alone. On days 14 and 28 after transduction, supernatent tPA antigen and PAI- 1 antigen levels were measured by ELISA, and supernatent tPA activity was quantitated with a spectrolyse tPA/PAI assay. Results: Southern and Northern blot analyses documented integration and transcription of the tPA gene in both EC and SMC. Greater tPA antigen production occurred in MFG-tPA–transduced EC and SMC compared with nontransduced or MFG-lac Z–transduced cells (p < 0. 05). The tPA activity increased in transduced human saphenous vein EC (up to 5. 1 -fold) and human iliac artery EC (up to 4. 7 -fold), but no increased tPA activity occurred in transduced SMC, compared with nontransduced or MFG-lac Z–transduced cells (p < 0. 05). PAI- 1 antigen was unchanged in transduced SMC but decreased in MFG-tPA–transduced EC (p < 0. 05). PAI- 1 mRNA was unchanged in the transduced EC and SMC compared with nontransduced cells, suggesting that posttranslational events may have caused the changes in EC PAI- 1. Conclusions: This investigation demonstrated that MFG-mediated tPA gene transfer into human EC resulted in a significant increase in tPA activity. Enhancement of adult human EC fibrinolytic activity by transfer of the human tPA gene has not been previously reported and represents a necessary finding in the development of this gene therapy technology for the prevention of thrombotic complications of vascular disease.
