50|$|The {{function}} of the temperature control system is to circulate enough coolant through the <b>roller</b> <b>train</b> to carry away the heat that is generated by the mechanical actions in the printing unit.|$|E
50|$|One {{factor that}} will affect {{viscosity}} is temperature. By removing {{the water from the}} offset process, there is a loss of its cooling effect {{on the surface of the}} plate. This will tend to cause a primary temperature increase at the plate cylinder due to friction. Because of the higher initial viscosities of the waterless inks there is also a secondary heat generation in the <b>roller</b> <b>train</b> caused by the friction of milling the ink through the rollers.|$|E

40|$|Designing {{roller coaster}} is very complex and difficult. The main {{difficulty}} {{lies on the}} track design.

Therefore this research will simulate and visualize the <b>roller</b> coaster <b>train</b> that is run on the user defined track.
