40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFatigue-crack growth data for 2024 -T 3 aluminum {{was used to}} evaluate the accuracy of Forman's equation. Forman's equation was found to predict from one-third to twice the observed cycles to a given crack length when applied to multiple cyclic stress ratios. An alternative approach was developed, based on the observed data, which is applicable to analog or digital fatigue-crack growth prediction. Data acquisition based on constant increment of crack length has been found to yield inadequate definition of the crack-growth curve in the low-cycle range for the successful application of the method. An expression was developed which extends the application of the crack-closure concept to the entire range of cyclic stress ratio. An effective <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>stress</b> was defined which shows indications of good correlation with the magnitude of the crack-growth curves. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Observations of {{accelerating}} {{seismic activity}} prior to large earthquakes in natural fault systems have raised hopes for intermediate-term eartquake forecasting. If this phenomena does exist, then what causes it to occur? Recent theoretical work {{suggests that the}} accelerating seismic release sequence {{is a symptom of}} increasing long-wavelength stress correlation in the fault region. A more traditional explanation, based on Reid 2 ̆ 7 s elastic rebound theory, argues that an accelerating sequence of seismic energy release could be a consequence of increasing stress in a fault system whose stress moment release is dominated by large events. Both of these theories are examined using two discrete models of seismicity: a Burridge-Knopoff block-slider model and an elastic continuum based model. Both models display an accelerating release of seismic energy prior to large simulated earthquakes. In both models there is a correlation between the rate of seismic energy release with the total <b>root-mean-squared</b> <b>stress</b> and the level of long-wavelength stress correlation. Furthermore, both models exhibit a systematic {{increase in the number of}} large events at high stress and high long-wavelength stress correlation levels. These results suggest that either explanation is plausible for the accelerating moment release in the models examined. A statistical model based on the Burridge-Knopoff block-slider is constructed which indicates that stress alone is sufficient to produce accelerating release of seismic energy with time prior to a large earthquake...|$|R
40|$|The time {{dependent}} surface {{shear stress}} has been evaluated using surface heat transfer measurements. For fully developed turbulent pipe and open channel water flows, and incompressible and compressible {{turbulent boundary layer}} air flows the measurements indicate the absolute magnitude of the surface shear stress fluctuations will be greater than two times the mean values. The <b>root-mean-square</b> shear <b>stress</b> fluctuations were {{of the order of}} 0. 2 to 0. 4 times the mean surface shear values. Due to these large surface shear stress fluctuations and the nonlinear relation between heat transfer and shear stress, a special technique has been developed to evaluate the measurements. It was found that the non-linear averaging errors for a hot film-surface shear stress gauge in a fully developed pipe flow was of the order of 10 percent at low velocities. A hot wire-surface shear stress gauge was employed for measurements of turbulent boundary layers in air...|$|R
40|$|Vortex {{behavior}} and characteristics in a confined rectangular jet with a co-flow were examined using vortex swirling strength as a defining characteristic. On {{the left side}} of the jet, the positively (counterclockwise) rotating vortices are dominant, while negatively rotating vortices are dominant on the right side of the jet. The characteristics of vortices, such as population density, average size and strength, and deviation velocity were calculated and analyzed in both the cross-stream direction and the streamwise direction. In the near-field of the jet, the population density, average size and strength of the dominant direction vortices show high values on both sides of the center stream with a small number of counter-rotating vortices produced in the small wake regions close to jet outlet. As the flow develops, the wake regions disappear, these count-rotating vortices also disappear, and the population of the dominant direction vortices increase and spread in the jet. The mean size and strength of the vortices decrease monotonically with streamwise coordinate. The signs of vortex deviation velocity indicate the vortices transfer low momentum to high velocity region and high momentum to the low velocity region. The developing trends of these characteristics were also identified by tracing vortices using time-resolved PIV data. Both the mean tracked vortex strength and size decrease with increasing downstream distance overall. At the locations of the left peak of turbulent kinetic energy, the two point spatial cross-correlation of swirling strength with velocity fluctuation and concentration fluctuation were calculated. All the correlation fields contain one positively correlated region and one negatively correlated region although the orientations of the correlation fields varied, due to the flow transitioning from wake, to jet, to channel flow. Finally, linear stochastic estimation was used to calculate conditional structures. The large-scale structures in the velocity field revealed by linear stochastic estimation are spindle-shaped with a titling stream-wise major axis. Vortex {{behavior and}} characteristics in a confined rectangular wake were also examined using swirling strength as a defining characteristic of a vortex. Instantaneous swirling strength field shows that positively (counterclockwise) rotating vortices are dominant on the right side of the wake and negatively (clockwise) rotating vortices are dominant on the left side. The population density, average size and strength of vortex cores all shows high peak values both sides of the wakes, while these peaks decrease quickly and the profiles broaden as the flow progresses downstream. The changing of vortex core maximum strength is seen relatively faster than the change of the core size. The results of mean cross-stream wise deviation velocity of vortex core shows the vortices in the wake spread from the neighborhood of wake to the centers of the free stream, and the mean streamwise deviation velocity indicates that vortices bringing high momentum fluid of the free stream into the the wake. Two point spatial cross-correlations of swirling strength with velocity fluctuations and concentration fluctuations were also calculated. All the cross correlation fields shown here exhibit a "butterfly 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 like shape, with one "wing 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 with positive correlation values and the other "wing 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 with negative values. The axises of correlation fields are oriented in the streamwise direction in R λ u 2 ̆ 7 contours, and they tile towards the wake center on the both sides of the wake,while the axises in R λ v 2 ̆ 7 are oriented in the cross-stream direction, and they tile downstream on the both sides of the wake. The R λ phi 2 ̆ 7 results show some similarity to those of R λ v 2 ̆ 7, indicating the vortices play a similar role in mass transfer as in momentum transfer. Linear stochastic estimation was used to interpret the cross correlation result and visualize the underlining large scale coherent structures. The LSE results show a clear vortex street pattern in far fields of the wake, indicating the vortices, developed independently on both sides of the splitter plates, are reorganized and coherent as the flow develops downstream. Large-eddy simulations (LES) were performed for a confined rectangular liquid jet with a co-flow and compared in detail with particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. A finite-volume CFD library, OpenFOAM, was used to discretize and solve the filtered Navier-Stokes equation. The effects of grid resolution, numerical schemes and subgrid models on the LES results were investigated. Grid independence has been shown. The second and fourth order schemes showed the nearly same performance, while the fourth order scheme costs much more computationally. Subgrid model comparison showed that the locally dynamic procedure is necessary for complex flow simulation. Model validation was performed by comparing LES data for the one-point velocity statistics such as the mean and the <b>root-mean-square</b> velocity, shear <b>stress,</b> correlation coefficient, velocity skewness and flatness with the PIV data. In addition, LES data for the two-point spatial correlations of velocity fluctuations that provide structural information were computed and compared with PIV data. Very good agreement was obtained leading to the conclusion that the LES velocity field captures the large-scale structures present in the actual flow. Experimental data of combined particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) measurements are used to analyzed the flow between the two scalar interfaces of confined turbulent jet and wake flow. The fluid of center stream of both flow cases contains a fluorescent dye, and normalized PLIF images were used to discriminate the inner and outer boundaries of the center stream. The growth of the boundaries of both flow cases are plotted and analyzed. The mean and fluctuations of the passive scalar, velocity, stain rate, and vorticity are determined relative to the locations of the two boundaries. The results show some unique perspectives of this co-flowing confined rectangular jet flow. The fluctuations of the passive scalar shows high values close to the outer boundary of jet, and the most of the properties of the velocity fields show high values on {{the left side of}} inner boundaries of the jet. The results of wake case are very symmetrical about the center of the wake, indicating the presence of the vortex street...|$|R
