5|$|The LNER did {{not want}} to take full {{responsibility}} for the line, and although they provided the services, ownership remained with the LPTB. In 1935 the LPTB, seeking to abandon steam power as much as possible, drew up a scheme to include electrification of the Amersham line as part of the New Works Programme. It was not planned to electrify the Chesham branch; instead, a diesel-powered GWR <b>railcar</b> was borrowed from the GWR for trials on the branch. Although the <b>railcar</b> performed well on the curves and slopes of the branch, the <b>railcar</b> had a capacity for only 70 passengers and was only able to haul light amounts of goods. The LPTB commissioned its own, larger, <b>railcar</b> design, {{but by the end of}} 1936, it decided instead to electrify the Chesham branch, and the <b>railcar</b> schemes were abandoned. The LPTB's plan envisaged electric trains splitting at Chalfont& Latimer, with half of each train continuing to Amersham and half to Chesham.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his injuries, Mulder {{attempts to find}} information on the <b>railcar,</b> but {{he is unable to}} do so. Scully returns the journal that he found on the car, but Mulder realizes that it is a rewritten substitute. Meanwhile, the real journal is translated in a shadowy room as the Smoking Man watches.|$|E
5|$|Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co {{provided}} a small 0-4-0 electric locomotive capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It {{is not known}} where the locomotive was manufactured, as the company has no record, but {{the design of the}} controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small <b>railcar</b> with space for 12passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the <b>railcar</b> were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the British Isles.|$|E
50|$|In February 1994 {{the first}} of 15 two-carriage Endeavour <b>railcars</b> was delivered. These {{replaced}} Class 620/720 <b>railcars,</b> Class 900 <b>railcars</b> and locomotive hauled stock.|$|R
50|$|Coaches, or {{passenger}} <b>railcars,</b> consist {{mostly of}} Nippon Sharyo <b>railcars</b> {{built in the}} early 2000s. Cab cars are Nippon Sharyo built. Budd-built <b>railcars</b> also operate on the line, but the cab cars built by Budd have not been in use since the delivery of the newer <b>railcars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vectus {{operated}} {{a total of}} 2.4 million train-km per year, using 10 Alstom Coradia LINT 27 diesel <b>railcars</b> and 18 Alstom Coradia LINT 41 <b>railcars.</b> All vehicles were built in 2004 and were identical to the class 640 and 648 <b>railcars</b> of Deutsche Bahn. After the delivery of the first <b>railcars,</b> some ran on the Limburg-Wiesbaden line and other routes {{in the summer of}} 2004. [...] In addition Vectus had three Stadler GTW diesel <b>railcars</b> that it acquired from its parent company, HLB, in compensation for three LINT 27 <b>railcars</b> it transferred to HLB.|$|R
5|$|Each NuScale {{reactor vessel}} is {{expected}} to be 9 feet diameter (2.74 meters) by 65 feet high (19.81 meters) and weigh 650 tons (590 metric tons). The modules would be pre-fabricated, delivered by <b>railcar,</b> barge or special trucks and assembled on-site. The units are designed to produce 50 megawatts of electricity each and require refueling with standard 4.95 percent enriched Uranium-235 fuel every two years.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder {{loses his}} cell phone after jumping {{on top of the}} moving train, losing contact with Dana Scully. When {{questioned}} by Scully, X tells her to analyze her implant, saying that it will give her answers about the train and her sister Melissa's murder. Meanwhile, Mulder enters the train and finds that the secret <b>railcar</b> is quarantined and protected by a security system. He searches for Zama, enlisting the train conductor for help. In Zama's compartment, they find hand-written journals in Japanese. However, elsewhere on the train, the Red-Haired Man intercepts and strangles Zama.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Connex Norge {{offered to}} {{purchase}} Timetoget from NSB, and start operations. However, by February, Connex had changed their mind, {{and no longer}} wanted to purchase the company. Terje Bulling admitted that Timetoget {{had a very good}} agreement for operating the Arendal Line, and that a fourth Y1 <b>railcar</b> had been bought from Sweden for this route. However, when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget, this agreement {{was not part of the}} estate. By April, NSB estimated that they had lost NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget. However, they had three Y1 trains, and would be able to start using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line.|$|E
50|$|The railway {{introduced}} gasoline <b>railcars</b> in 1930. The {{number of}} <b>railcars</b> increased to six by 1938. However, {{the shortage of}} gasoline soon resulted in less use of the <b>railcars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Keha (Japanese ケハ, Korean 게하) class <b>railcars</b> were a {{group of}} 3rd class {{petrol-powered}} <b>railcars</b> of the Chosen Government Railway (Sentetsu). There were five types of such <b>railcars,</b> built in Japan and Korea. The exact classification and numbering of these <b>railcars</b> is not certain; certain is only that their type designation was Keha.|$|R
25|$|Most <b>railcars</b> were {{classified}} RM (Rail Motor), and individual classes were known by alternate {{names such as}} the Vulcan <b>railcars</b> of the South Island and the Wairarapa <b>railcars</b> that ran over the Rimutaka Incline.|$|R
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, it proved to be a challenge for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a <b>railcar</b> to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the <b>railcar,</b> but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E
5|$|Motor buses {{appeared}} in the district from 1924, and passenger numbers dropped. Cheap fares and a steam <b>railcar</b> did not halt the decline, although {{in the last days}} of operation, five trains were run on Saturdays, three on Wednesdays and two on other weekdays. The last trains ran on 15 July 1933, with all passenger services suspended from Monday 17 July. In addition to timetabled services, excursions were run, with Epworth, the birthplace of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism being popular. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway published a booklet entitled Epworth: What to see and how to get there to entice people to travel there from Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Excursions from the Isle of Axholme to Blackpool were popular, with over 600 passengers on such a trip in 1913, and 750 visiting the Great Yorkshire Show at Hull in 1922. Excursions to Blackpool continued to be run even after timetabled passenger services were withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|The {{train was}} formed of CB class <b>railcars.</b> It was {{operated}} on occasions by Bluebird <b>railcars.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of Liberation, 31 of 60 <b>railcars</b> of all types (steam, diesel and both standard- and narrow-gauge petrol) were left in the South; these were {{subsequently}} operated by the Korean National Railroad. Around 1954, the KNR renumbered its standard gauge <b>railcars</b> into the 100 series. The petrol <b>railcars</b> were retired between 1957 and 1963, replaced by the DC-class diesel-hydraulic <b>railcars,</b> and all were scrapped.|$|R
50|$|The Shiki or Sigeu (Japanese シキ, Korean 시그) class <b>railcars</b> were a {{class of}} 3rd class steam <b>railcars</b> of the Chosen Government Railway (Sentetsu). There were two classes of such <b>railcars,</b> one built in Japan and one built in the United Kingdom.|$|R
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the <b>railcar,</b> seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The <b>railcar</b> used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{the company}} looked at using petrol-electric autocars for the {{passenger}} services, but were advised {{that they would}} not be economic, as conventional trains would still be required on Wednesdays and Saturdays to cope with the volume of traffic. However, in July 1926 they conducted trials with a Sentinel-Cammell steam <b>railcar,</b> which was borrowed from the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), who had absorbed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, bought 13 steam railcars in 1926 and 1927, one of which was allocated to Goole shed for work on the Axholme Joint Railway. A similar vehicle was ordered in February 1930 specifically for the railway, and entered service in December. The steam power unit was built by the Sentinel Waggon Works in Shrewsbury, and the bodywork was built at Nottingham, at the former works of Cammell Laird, by then part of the Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company. Before passenger services were withdrawn in 1933, it ran , working two return trips from Goole to Haxey Junction on weekdays, three on Wednesdays, and five on Saturdays. It was then sold to the LNER and continued in use until 1944.|$|E
50|$|While early <b>railcars</b> were {{propelled}} by steam, petrol, and diesel engines, modern <b>railcars</b> are usually {{propelled by}} a diesel engine mounted underneath {{the floor of}} the coach. Diesel <b>railcars</b> may have mechanical (fluid coupling and gearbox), hydraulic (torque converter) or diesel-electric transmission.|$|R
50|$|William Bridges Adams built steam <b>railcars</b> at Bow, London in the 1840s.

25|$|At {{least one}} member {{of all of the}} main <b>railcar</b> classes has been saved for preservation. For many years, it was feared that no 88 seater would be preserved, but the Pahiatua <b>Railcar</b> Society has {{successfully}} recovered one and is actively seeking to return it to operational condition. The same society is in possession of the sole surviving Wairarapa <b>railcar</b> and is restoring it to operational condition. Four of the nine Vulcan railcars are preserved, one by the Plains Vintage Railway and three by the Ferrymead Railway. Four of the six Standard railcars are also preserved, two by the Silver Stream Railway, one by the Pahiatua <b>Railcar</b> Society (their active <b>railcar),</b> and one by private interests in the Waikato stored at the Glenbrook Vintage Railway.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{the only known}} 'twin-set' <b>railcar</b> surviour was RM 133 in its grassgrub form as AC 8140, used for fire {{training}} at Auckland Airport. Fortunately in 2001 the RM 133 Trust Board was able to obtain this car, which was later {{found to be the}} No 1 end of RM 133 and the No 2 end of RM 115. Unfortunately, before the car could be removed a fire broke out in the No 2 half of the <b>railcar,</b> damaging the body. The RM 133 Trust decided to look for any other extant <b>railcar</b> halves to pair with the No 1 end of RM 133, which had been moved to the Pahiatua <b>Railcar</b> Society's site.|$|E
50|$|The Bernina Railway (BB), {{which opened}} in 1908, {{originally}} procured a total of 17 electric <b>railcars</b> in two series from the manufacturers Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) und Elektrizitätsgesellschaft Alioth.
