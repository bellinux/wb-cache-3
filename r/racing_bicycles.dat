25|$|The {{down tube}} connects the head tube {{to the bottom}} bracket shell. On <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles</b> and some {{mountain}} and hybrid bikes, the derailleur cables run along the down tube, or inside the down tube. On older <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles,</b> the shift levers were mounted on the down tube. On newer ones, they are mounted with the brake levers on the handlebars.|$|E
25|$|By 1972, a {{new wave}} of {{lightweight}} derailleur-equipped bicycles led a wave of new consumer interest in recreational bicycling, resulting in the bike boom. Derailleur-equipped sport bikes or ten speeds inspired by European <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles</b> soon dominated the adult market.|$|E

25|$|Bicycles can be {{categorized}} in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include utility bicycles, mountain bicycles, <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles,</b> touring bicycles, hybrid bicycles, cruiser bicycles, and BMX bikes. Less common are tandems, low riders, tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious bicycles, cargo bikes, recumbents and electric bicycles.|$|E

25|$|Ducati Meccanica (as {{the company}} was {{previously}} known) has its marque on non-motorcycle products as well. In the 1930s and 1940s, Ducati manufactured radios, cameras, and electrical products such as a razor. Ducati made a marine binocular called the BIMAR for the Kriegsmarine during World War II, {{some of which were}} sold on the civilian market after the war. The Ducati Sogno was a half-frame Leica-like camera which is now a collector's item. Ducati and Bianchi have developed and launched a new line of <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles</b> with two chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four times}} the relative step on the cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the gear ratio to maintain a constant pedalling speed, but any change of chainring must be accompanied by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset if the goal is to switch to the next higher or lower gear ratio.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes are inexpensive, light, {{mechanically}} simple, easy to maintain, and powerful. However, {{they perform}} relatively poorly when the rims are wet, and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped. Because rims can carry {{debris from the}} ground to the brake pads, rim brakes {{are more prone to}} clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes (where braking surfaces are higher from the ground), particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces. The low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes, where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions. The light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractA three {{dimensional}} multibody dynamic {{numerical model}} using LifeMOD and ADAMS {{is presented to}} simulate and analyze the load of wrists, shoulders, leg muscles, knees, and ankles of bicycle riding. Applications of ADAMS/LifeMOD are widely used, for example, rifle shot stress to the human body, golf swing, Tae Kwon Do side kick simulation, rowers paddle boat. Applications are even in the medical research including dynamic stability of human spine simulation, and thoracic and lumbar dynamic simulation. Vertical (height) and horizontal position of bicycle saddle are adjusted in the three dimensional multibody model to simulate muscles force for city <b>bicycle</b> riding and <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> riding. Besides, loads of shoulders, wrists, knees, and ankles are analyzed between postures of city <b>bicycle</b> riding and <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> riding. The objective {{of this research is}} to obtain a suitable posture either for city <b>bicycle</b> riding or <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> riding to prevent sports injuries. ADAMS/LifeMOD simulation of riding city <b>bicycle</b> and <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> with different riding postures is presented in this paper. Several main findings include: (1) If the bicycle saddle is too high, soleus force would be increased. (2) If the bicycle saddle is too low, biceps femoris and iliacus forces would be increased. (3) The influence on muscles force caused by a little adjustment of distance between saddle and handlebars may be ignored. (4) Posture of riding <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> bends upper body more and increases iliacus forces but decreases soleus force. (5) Because <b>race</b> <b>bicycle</b> riding posture bends upper body, the joints loads on lumbar, shoulders and elbows are greatly increased...|$|R

25|$|Little 500 {{bikes are}} rather distinctive. They are single gear, coaster brake <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles.</b> There are two {{different}} versions of the bike: the men's and the women's. The only difference between the men's and women's bikes is the frame size; the men race on a 56 cm frame, the women's bikes are built on 54 cm frames. Men and women race on the same 46x18 gearing. Every year {{a new version of the}} bike is made and then two are given to each team. The cost of the bikes are, for the most part, covered in the team registration fees and race sponsorship money. At the end of the season, team's are given the option to keep their bikes or to sell them back to IUSF. The used bikes are then kept at the track and are rented out by those teams that do not have old bikes.|$|E

500|$|The more trail a {{traditional}} bike has, the more stable it feels, although too much trail {{can make a}} bike feel difficult to steer. Bikes with negative trail (where the contact patch {{is in front of}} where the steering axis intersects the ground), while still [...] rideable, are reported to feel very unstable. Normally, road <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles</b> have more trail than touring bikes but less than mountain bikes. [...] Mountain bikes are designed with reduced head angles than road bikes to improve stability for descents, and therefore have greater trail. [...] Touring bikes are built with small trail to allow the rider to control a bike weighed down with baggage. [...] As a consequence, an unloaded touring bike can feel unstable. [...] In bicycles, fork rake, often a curve in the fork blades forward of the steering axis, is used to diminish trail. Bikes with negative trail exist, such as the Python Lowracer, and are [...] rideable, and an experimental bike with negative trail {{has been shown to be}} self-stable.|$|E

2500|$|Many <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles</b> {{built for}} {{individual}} time trial races and triathlons employ composite construction because the frame can be shaped with an aerodynamic profile not possible with cylindrical tubes, or would be excessively heavy in other materials. [...] While {{this type of}} frame {{may in fact be}} heavier than others, its aerodynamic efficiency may help the [...] cyclist to attain a higher overall speed.|$|E
2500|$|Most hybrid, touring, mountain, and <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles</b> are {{equipped}} with both front and rear derailleurs. [...] There are a few gear ratios which have a straight chain path, {{but most of the}} gear ratios will have the chain running at an angle. [...] The use of two derailleurs generally results in some duplicate or near duplicate gear ratios, so that the number of distinct gear ratios is typically around two-thirds of the number of advertised gear ratios. The more common configurations have specific names [...] which are usually related to the relative step sizes between the front chainrings and the rear cogset.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{materials}} used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels {{have been used for}} frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind. More expensive bikes use carbon fibre due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles</b> now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best strength to weight ratio.

2500|$|BSA {{manufactured}} a {{range of}} bicycles from utility roadsters through to <b>racing</b> <b>bicycles.</b> The BSA range of Sports bicycles expanded in the 1930s following the granting of a patent for a new lighter design of seat lug in 1929 and tandems were introduced into the BSA bicycle range as well. BSA {{had a reputation for}} quality and durability and their components were more expensive that either Chater-Lea or Brampton. [...] BSA launched a high end club cyclists machine in the early 1930s initially branded as the [...] "Super-eeze". Never slow to avail of publicity BSA sponsored the great Australian cyclist Hubert Opperman [...] and re-branded the top of the range machine the [...] "Opperman" [...] model. [...] A less expensive range of clubman lightweight machines was introduced from 1936 with the [...] "Cyclo" [...] 3 speed derailleur equipped [...] "Clubman". Subtle changes were made to the range, most models being equipped with [...] "Russ" [...] patent forks [...] and some models were made for only two seasons. This all stopped around September 1939 with the outbreak of war.
