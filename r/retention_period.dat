Senators introduced two different reform proposals. One, the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 3361/ S. 1599), would effectively halt “bulk” records collection under the USA Patriot Act, while it also would require a warrant to deliberately search for the e-mail and phone call content of Americans that is collected {{as part of a}} surveillance program targeting foreigners located overseas. Another proposal is the FISA Improvements Act that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections.

The subjects were told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A control group was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake <b>retention</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

50|$|Another major {{criticism}} of the data retention regime was the two-year data <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> specified in s 187C.

40|$|Maintenance of {{specialized}} skills {{during periods of}} nonuse presents a significant challenge across multiple domains, and is most relevant within applications in which skill degradation is common and has significant negative consequences, {{as is the case}} in the domain of military medicine. For example, laparoscopic surgery (LS) skills often are subject to decay during deployments in which military surgeons primarily practice open surgical procedures; however, empirical research is needed to characterize the nature of such specialized skill decay. Specifically, needs exist for 1) objective and sensitive metrics to support assessment of LS skill loss based on the underlying cognitive, psychomotor, and perceptual skill components, and 2) validated pedagogical approaches to retraining these perishable skills. The results of two experiments are presented here. Experiment 1 investigated the use of task decomposition- and instrumented glove-based metrics to objectively and reliably assess acquisition and retention of a psychomotor skill relevant to LS following short-term (< 6 weeks) and long-term (7 months) <b>retention</b> <b>periods.</b> In addition to detecting significant skill acquisition, as well as significant decay for both <b>retention</b> <b>periods,</b> these metrics demonstrated significant differences in psychomotor skill acquisition for the dominant and non-dominant hands and a significan...|$|R
