40|$|Commutators and anticommutators of gamma {{matrices}} with arbitrary {{numbers of}} (antisymmetrized) indices are derived. Gamma matrix algebra is ubiquitous in many calculations in high energy physics. Whereas it {{is a fairly}} simple business in four dimensions, in higher-dimensional applications such as supergravity or M-theory, it becomes quite involved, {{because the number of}} independent matrices grows quickly with the number of space-time dimensions. To ease such calculations, on the one hand, one can <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of computer algebra packages [1, and references therein]. On the other hand, one can look in the literature for reference tables, such as the appendix of [2], where the commutators and anti-commutators of gamma matrices with up to four indices are listed. The table in [2] is, <b>to</b> my knowledge, <b>the</b> most complete such list, but it contains typographical errors, as has been noticed in [3]. The purpose of this short note is to derive general formulae for the commutators and anti-commutators of gamma matrices with any number of indices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this book is to provide such a {{platform}} or framework that will describe the Cyprus problem as a major issue affecting the relations between Greece and Turkey and the arms race between the two countries. It {{is very important to}} point out, however, that solving the Cyprus issue is not exactly a prerequisite for settling all disputes between Greece and Turkey. The Greek-Turkish relations and the Cyprus problem must be regarded as being two very important, however entirely distinct issues. It goes without saying, however, that a mutually acceptable solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latter will contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> improvement of <b>the</b> former <b>to</b> a large extent. Going back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of our platform, what we have decided to do is <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of mathematics, always bearing in mind that they can be a useful servant, however a very bad master. In other words we have applied a number of mathematical techniques that have contributed just <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point at which the key determinants in this conflict are underlined thus offering a clear description of the relations between the two sides with emphasis on the issue of Cyprus. The picture thus obtained is then used for suggesting answers on a number of key questions, much more effectively, we believe, compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> results of any panel discussion. In any case, however, the responsibility of the final decision concerning policies employed on such complicated issues certainly burdens the politicians’ shoulders. As far as we are concerned, we will be happy <b>to</b> know that <b>the</b> conclusions reached in this book are taken in consideration during the decision-making process in the interest of peace. After all, it is only natural to expect that it will require all the “intelligence” of our defence information systems in order to provide plausible answers to such crucial political and strategic issues. ...|$|R
3000|$|Kazakhstan’s {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> EU can be {{probably best}} summarised {{by the word}} “instrumentality” which for the Kazakhstani regime is apparent in two aspects. The first {{of them is the}} bloc’s perceived competence, that is, the available knowledge, technologies and investment which Nazarbayev needs for Kazakhstan’s economic development and modernisation. Importantly, the EU’s competence manifests itself both against the absolute standard as well as compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other regional powers: Koch (2013 : p. 112), for instance, notes that “the strategy of encouraging Western involvement in the resource economy [was] a response to concrete economic conditions in the early 1990 s, and the fact that Russia lacked sufficient financial capacity and technology to develop Kazakhstan’s immense oil resources”. 6 Indeed, the idea of the EU being advanced and competent is pronounced in Kazakhstan’s official discourse with Nazarbayev elsewhere citing <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> utilise European experience in various areas, such as judicial system (Vremya, 2017), education (Tengri News, 2014), EAEU integration (Forum, 2014) etc. Perhaps the most vivid example in this regard is the 2009 – 2011 “Path to Europe” national program which Nazarbayev personally initiated to enhance all-round cooperation between the EU and Kazakhstan and use “positive European experience” across multiple spheres (President of Kazakhstan, 2008). Europe and the West top the list of the regions which Nazarbayev mentions in his addresses, with the majority of those references dealing with the economic sphere and being dedicated to such international organisations as the EU, the OSCE and the EBRD (Ambrosio and Lange, 2014 : p. 543). Also, Astana <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of Western consultants to conduct economics reforms: since 2011, for example, one of them has been “Tony Blair Associates”, a company owned by former British Prime Minister. 7 [...]...|$|R

One night, Sundara Rao suddenly develops chest pain and Raja rushes him to a city hospital. Moti’s parents, Khaderao (K.V.

Meanwhile, Raja returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village, and, on knowing that Moti’s marriage is being performed with Parasuram, is dejected and leaves for the city. Moti, who is now in the city with the hope of meeting Raja, sees him with Latha (Sriranjani), daughter of Sundara Rao, and assumes they are married. Crestfallen, she runs madly in the streets and meets with a car accident. Sivaswamy (CSR), a beggar, saves her and takes her to his house. A drama contractor Raoji (Relangi) and his assistant (Sivarao) take Moti into their troupe and train her for the title role of Sakunthala in their drama. Raja and Latha attend the drama. The two lovers, Moti and Raja exchange notes about their single status and their love blossoms again. Latha and Sundara Rao plot to separate them and succeed in their attempt.

6000|$|Of {{course when}} one of these grand {{mountain}} ranges goes stretching across the printed page, it adorns and ennobles that literary landscape--but {{at the same time}} it is a great distress <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new student, for it blocks up his way; he cannot crawl under it, or climb over it, or tunnel through it. So he <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dictionary for <b>help,</b> but there is no <b>help</b> there. <b>The</b> dictionary must draw the line somewhere--so it leaves this sort of words out. And it is right, because these long things are hardly legitimate words, but are rather combinations of words, and the inventor of them ought to have been killed. They are compound words with the hyphens left out. The various words used in building them are in the dictionary, but in a very scattered condition; so you can hunt the materials out, one by one, and get at the meaning at last, but it is a tedious and harassing business. I have tried this process upon some of the above examples. [...] "Freundshaftsbezeigungen" [...] seems to be [...] "Friendship demonstrations," [...] which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying [...] "demonstrations of friendship." [...] "Unabhängigkeitserklärungen" [...] seems to be [...] "Independencedeclarations," [...] which is no improvement upon [...] "Declarations of Independence," [...] so far as I can see. [...] "Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen" [...] seems to be [...] "General-statesrepresentativesmeetings," [...] as nearly as I can get at it--a mere rhythmical, gushy euphemism for [...] "meetings of the legislature," [...] I judge. We used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our literature, but it has gone out now. We used to speak of a thing as a [...] "never-to-be-forgotten" [...] circumstance, instead of cramping it into the simple and sufficient word [...] "memorable" [...] and then going calmly about our business as if nothing had happened. In those days we were not content <b>to</b> embalm <b>the</b> thing and bury it decently, we wanted to build a monument over it.|$|R
60|$|Here was {{a sudden}} and a most {{unexpected}} change for the worse in the situation of Mark Woolston! Not only had he lost the means of getting off the island, but {{he had lost his}} friend and companion. It was true, Bob was a rough and an uncultivated associate; but he was honest as human frailty could leave a human being, true as steel in his attachments, strong in body, and of great professional skill. So great, indeed, was the last, that our young man was not without the hope he would be able <b>to</b> keep under <b>the</b> lee of the shoals until the gale broke, and then beat up through them, and still come to his rescue. There was one point, in particular, on which Mark felt unusual concern. Bob knew nothing whatever of navigation. It was impossible to teach him anything on that subject. He knew the points of the compass, but had no notion of the variations, of latitude or longitude, or of anything belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> purely mathematical part of the business. Twenty times had he asked Mark <b>to</b> give him <b>the</b> latitude and longitude of the crater; twenty times had he been told what they were, and just as often had he forgotten them. When questioned by his young friend, twenty-four hours after a lesson of this sort, if he remembered the figures at all, he was apt <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> latitude for the longitude, or the longitude for the latitude, the degrees for the minutes, or the minutes for the degrees. Ordinarily, however, he forgot all about the numbers themselves. Mark had in vain endeavoured to impress on his mind the single fact that any number which exceeded ninety must necessarily refer to longitude, and not to latitude; for Bob could not be made to remember even this simple distinction. He was just as likely <b>to</b> believe <b>the</b> Reef lay in the hundred and twentieth degree of latitude, as he was to fancy it lay in the twentieth. With such a head, therefore, it was but little to be expected Bob could give <b>the</b> information <b>to</b> others necessary <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> reef, even in the almost hopeless event of his ever being placed in circumstances to do so. Still, while so completely ignorant of mathematics and arithmetic, in all their details, few mariners could find their way better than Bob Betts by the simple signs of the ocean. He understood the compass perfectly, the variations excepted; and his eye was as true as that of the most experienced artist could be, when it became necessary <b>to</b> judge of <b>the</b> colour of the water. On many occasions had Mark known him intimate that the ship was in a current, and had a weatherly or a lee set, when the fact had escaped not only the officers, but the manufacturers of the charts. He judged by ripples, and sea-weed, and the other familiar signs of the seas, and these seldom failed him. While, therefore, there was not a seaman living less likely <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Reef again, when driven off from its vicinity, by means of observations and the charts, there was not a seaman living more likely to find it, by <b>resorting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other <b>helps</b> of <b>the</b> navigator. On this last peculiarity Mark hung all his hopes of seeing his friend again, when the gale should abate.|$|R

5000|$|Holden Radcliffe {{appears in}} the {{television}} series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. portrayed by John Hannah. This iteration is more sympathetic than his comic book counterpart and takes {{a keen interest in}} Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons as he feels that they respect his work. Holden makes his first appearances in season three's [...] "The Singularity" [...] when Fitz and Simmons come to him for help in battling Hive, but gets kidnapped and is forced to create Inhumans. For the rest of the season, Hive keeps him confined threatening his life if he does not comply. With some captive Watchdogs, Holden creates the Inhuman Primitives using Terrigen Crystals, the blood of Daisy Johnson and a Kree Reaper, and Hive's physiology. Eventually he is rescued by S.H.I.E.L.D. and is inspired to create Life Model Decoys starting with his A.I. AIDA. Radcliffe has a prominent role in season four. In the episode [...] "The Ghost", Radcliffe shows AIDA to Fitz, who is skeptical, as it goes against Radcliffe's court restraint. Radcliffe is nevertheless confident that it would benefit mankind, and convinces Fitz <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> project a secret. In the episode [...] "Uprising", Radcliffe helps Simmons in getting Melinda May out of psychosis by killing and reviving, effectively resetting May's brain. Radcliffe proceeds <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> team by having AIDA read the Darkhold when Phil Coulson, Fitz and Robbie Reyes are trapped in another dimension. In the episode [...] "Broken Promises", Radcliffe is revealed <b>to</b> be after <b>the</b> Darkhold. He programs AIDA to act as if going haywire, and has also created an LMD Melinda May who is unaware of her true nature until [...] "The Patriot". In the episode [...] "Wake Up", Radcliffe is confronted by LMD May and reveals that despite knowing her origin she cannot harm him. The S.H.I.E.L.D. team discover that Radcliffe is working with Anti-Inhuman Senator Ellen Nadeer. They capture him, but Fitz discovers that they had only taken custody of his LMD clone/copy. In the episode [...] "Hot Potato Soup", Radcliffe's LMD reveals that Radcliffe knew Fitz's father. Radcliffe then creates the Framework, a virtual reality which he had actually designed so that Agnes Kitsworth, his former lover and AIDA's inspiration, could live out the rest of her own life in bliss due to having a brain tumor. In the episode [...] "The Man Behind the Shield", Radcliffe is revealed to have kidnapped Coulson, Fitz, Mack and Mace and replaced them with LMDs in an effort to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. He is later killed by AIDA when realizing that his belief is contradictory with his creation's programming, though AIDA downloads his consciousness into the Framework. In the episode [...] "Identity and Change", Radcliffe's conscious is living out the rest of his existence with Agnes in the Framework island of Ogygia, but their peaceful existence is disrupted by the arrival of Phil Coulson, Jemma Simmons and Grant Ward. AIDA's Framework counterpart arrives with a sinister Fitz, deleting Agnes and taking Radcliffe away to be tortured. With nothing left <b>to</b> lose, Radcliffe <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> team escape the Framework through a 'back door' that he created. He redeems himself in the episode [...] "Farewell, Cruel World!" [...] by forcing Fitz through the portal while everyone except Mack leave. In the episode [...] "World's End", Radcliffe meets up with Yo-Yo Rodriguez who entered <b>the</b> Framework <b>to</b> retrieve Mack when <b>the</b> world begins <b>to</b> slowly disappear. After Yo-Yo rescues Mack, Radcliffe sits on a beach with a bottle of alcohol resigned to his final moments. He quotes the final stanza in T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men. Before he can finish it, he is deleted along with the Framework.|$|R
