40|$|Nicotine {{dependence}} is a progressive, chronic, relapsing disorder. Nicotine is {{the principal}} and most potent psychopharmacologically active component of tobacco smoke. Through activation of nicotine receptors in the central nervous system, nicotine can lead to tolerance and dependence. Cessation of smoking is followed by severe pathophysiologic withdrawal and by long-term craving. TCD measurement of cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) and nicotine dependence degree measured by Fragestrom questionnaire was analyzed in relation to smoking relapse. This study includes 47 participants (25 females and 22 males) included in Breathe Free Plan To Stop Smoking in Non Smoking School in Zagreb. 12 month {{following the end of}} treatment participants were divided in three groups: continued abstinence, interrupted abstinence and non abstinence.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{economic}} motives for and personnel-management consequences {{of reducing the}} number of hierarchical levels {{from the point of view}} of fairness aspects. A transition to flat hierarchies can, under certain circumstances, have serious consequences for employees who are directly or indirectly affected; these consequences include a loss of status and/or income, reduced chances of promotion and thus diminished career prospects. In particular well-qualified employees could respond to this by moving to other firms, whilst repercussions can be expected regarding the motivation and work effort of the remaining employees. It can therefore be crucial for the success of a firm that the employees accept their treatment in the course of reorganisation measures and assess it to be fair. A written survey conducted among students is to provide first information as to the acceptance of hierarchical levels being eliminated and the associated consequences for the employees. Special emphasis is placed here on the significance of various motives for delayering and different personnel-management measures for the assessment of fairness. One key finding is that reciprocity norms have a decisive influence on the perceived fairness of a <b>restructuring</b> <b>measure.</b> In particular, disadvantages resulting from a delayering of the hierarchy are apparently more likely to be accepted if they are associated with adequate compensation from the viewpoint of the employees affected.

40|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} is {{one aspect of}} executive functioning that encompasses the ability to produce diverse ideas, consider response alternatives, and modify behaviors to manage changing circumstances. These processes {{are likely to be}} important for implementing cognitive restructuring. The present study investigated the impact of cognitive flexibility on older adults' ability to learn cognitive <b>restructuring.</b> Neuropsychological <b>measures</b> of cognitive flexibility were administered to 40 normal community-dwelling older adult volunteers and their ability to implement cognitive restructuring was coded and analyzed. Results indicated that the majority of participants showed good cognitive restructuring skill acquisition with brief training. The multiple regression analysis suggested that those with poorer cognitive flexibility on neuropsychological testing demonstrated poorer quality cognitive restructuring. In particular, perseverative thinking styles appear to negatively impact the ability to learn cognitive restructuring. Further research is needed to clarify whether older adults with poor cognitive flexibility can improve their cognitive restructuring skills with repetition over treatment or whether alternative skills should be considered. 9 page(s...|$|R
