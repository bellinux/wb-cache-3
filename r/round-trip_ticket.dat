5|$|Concorde was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Sud Aviation (later Aérospatiale) and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. Twenty aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development aircraft. Air France (AF) and British Airways (BA) {{were the only}} airlines to purchase and fly Concorde. The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for Concorde's speed and luxury service. For example, in 1997, the <b>round-trip</b> <b>ticket</b> price from New York to London was $7995, more than 30 times {{the cost of the}} cheapest option to fly this route.|$|E

After opening in December 2006, the tram carried its one millionth passenger on October 17, 2007 and its ten millionth rider on January 8, 2014. A <b>round-trip</b> <b>ticket</b> costs $4.70 but are free for OHSU patients and certain visitors; OHSU employees and students ride free by showing their ID badges.|$|E

25|$|Peninsula Airways (PenAir) offers daily {{flights from}} Anchorage to Sand Point at a hefty price to the people. Often it is {{difficult}} for people to find themselves a plane ticket off of the island.

25|$|Advertised fares {{to all of}} {{the former}} target cities began at US$10 one-way; the price {{increased}} as more tickets were sold for that flight. Advertisements suggest that ten seats on each flight were sold at the promotional $10 fare. Other fares promoted by Skybus included a $20.08 fare sale (plus fees and taxes) to some of the airline's less popular destinations, to celebrate the New Year. Ticket prices for the remaining fares were expected to be around half the price of other airlines. These fares did not include taxes and other airport fees, however, which add about $10 to a one-way ticket. All fees included, the cheapest <b>round-trip</b> <b>ticket</b> for one adult would have cost approximately $40.|$|E

25|$|Within {{one week}} of the crash, cash {{payments}} ranging from $1,000 to $3,700 (all figures in this article in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated) were given to passengers for interim emergency use. These funds were given to passengers through an emergency centre {{set up in the}} Novotel Hotel in Mississauga, near the airport. These payments were independent of the claims process, which has been started for passengers who have not retained counsel. It is expected that the insurers of Air France will pay for all damages as well as extra compensation for having passengers go through the ordeal; however, only amounts of €6,000 to €9,000 have been offered, prompting passengers to turn to the lawsuit to seek legal action. The insurance is handled by the Societé de Gestion & D'Expertises D'Assurances in France. All passengers have also been offered a free <b>round-trip</b> <b>ticket</b> to any Air France destination in the world in the same fare class in which they were originally booked on AF358.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, {{claiming}} {{disillusionment with}} her home country, Sánchez {{decided to leave}} Cuba and emigrated to Switzerland. She was eventually joined by her son and husband. Two years later she {{decided to return to}} Cuba citing “family reasons" [...] However, since she had been out of the country for more than eleven months without special permission, Sánchez had lost the right to return. [...] Sánchez states that she then flew home to Cuba [...] "for a two-week family visit" [...] on a <b>round-trip</b> <b>ticket,</b> and by destroying her passport was able to avoid being forced on a plane back to Switzerland. The Cuban government says that she was granted a waiver allowing her to recover her permanent resident status in Cuba. She finally [...] resettled in Havana. [...] During this time, Sánchez discovered her current profession, computer science. In 2004, she founded, together with a group of Cubans– all based on the island– a magazine, Consenso, based on reflection and debate. She also helped establish the web portal Desde Cuba (From Cuba), an on-line magazine and collection of individual blogs, of which Sánchez's was the first. [...] Sánchez began to sign her posts in 2008, abandoning anonymous blogging.
