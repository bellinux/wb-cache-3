50|$|The {{three most}} common types of {{incandescent}} lamps are standard incandescent lamps, tungsten halogen <b>lamps,</b> and <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps.</b> Standard incandescent lamps have an efficacy of 10-17 lumens per watts and {{a lifetime of}} 750-2500 hours. Tungsten halogen lamps have an efficacy of 12-22 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-4000 hours.

50|$|Halogen {{multifaceted}} reflector bulbs {{are widely}} available.

For example, these lamps can be used in tanning beds or in backlighting electronic displays. An internal reflector is more efficient than standard external reflectors. Another example is color matched aperture lights (with about 30° of opening) used in the food industry for robotic quality control inspection of cooked goods.|$|R

5000|$|Some lamps have an {{internal}} opaque reflector. Coverage of the reflector ranges from 120° to 310° of the lamp's circumference.

50|$|There {{have been}} many lights at Brant Point, dating to well before the American Revolution. The history of range lights is a bit murky, and {{different}} sources give different dates. A researcher for the Coast Guard historical office dates a separate range beacon to 1794, but congressional records show this beacon established in 1820. Correspondence from 1838 describes the original beacon as an 11 ft tall building with a two oil lanterns hung in it; in 1856 this was replaced with a pyramidal tower housing a 21 in <b>reflector</b> <b>lamp,</b> as pictured. This structure was relocated many times, and in 1869 was positioned on Brant Point itself as the front light of the range; this proved unsatisfactory, and the light was moved back across the harbor the following year. Land was acquired around 1872 to relocate the light again and to provide for a keeper's house.|$|E

In preparation for a potential exterior demonstration installation, an additional focal point of the research was the design and testing of a weatherproof case that provides protection to the laser and the ballast.

40|$|DE 19834734 A UPAB: 20000330 NOVELTY - The {{composite}} comprises {{a transparent}} substrate (2) {{with a sheet}} for decorative effect (3) and a layer of metallic melt which is coated-on. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the method of manufacture. The composite is formed by coating the transparent substrate with the effect layer (3), then the melt layer (4). This is carried out in a vacuum chamber at 10 - 4 - 1 bar and 20 deg. C - 200 deg. C, being the maximum temperature at which the sheet is used. Preferred features: The melt layer is a metal or metal alloy with a melting point close to the softly-resilient, thermally-deformable temperature range of the substrate plastic. Sheet thickness is 50 - 500 nm. The effect layer, a succession of transparent dielectric sheets and part-transparent metallic layers, forms interference layers in the composite. In a further variant, it comprises two transparent layers with intervening part-transparent metallic layer. The latter is a metal oxide and is 10 - 1000 nm thick. Effect layer and melt layer comprise the same material, forming a unity (3, 4). The sheet is hot-pressed onto surfaces to be coated. Radiative heating or glow discharge is employed to perform the application, in a vacuum chamber. Before application, the surfaces to be joined are made extremely clean by glow discharge in an inert gas. Composite sheet manufacture and application to a surface {{take place in the}} same vacuum chamber, without intermediate cooling. Application of the melt layer, and metal coating of the component surface take place simultaneously, using the same metal and in the same vacuum chamber. A stamp complementary in shape to the surface being coated, applies the intervening sheet composite. USE - To cover component surfaces, which may include surfaces to be made reflective, to be painted or to be given interference effects. Surfaces may be metallic or non-metallic, on e. g. a <b>reflector,</b> <b>lamp</b> or vehicle. (All preceding, are claimed uses). ADVANTAGE - The method is considered low cost, and environmentally -friendly. High quality results. It is carried out rapidly in comparison to e. g. metallic deposition and subsequent lacquering to make a reflector. No drying time is involved. The result is e. g. reflective, gleaming, colored or shows interference effects. Thickness is uniform and curved surfaces can be coated. Further valuable features include toughness, closed surface, mechanical and chemical resistance. Surface elasticity improves greatly on clear lacquers...|$|E
