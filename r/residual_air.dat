25|$|X-rays {{were found}} emanating from Crookes tubes, {{experimental}} discharge tubes invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the cathode rays, that is energetic electron beams, that were first {{created in the}} tubes. Crookes tubes created free electrons by ionization of the <b>residual</b> <b>air</b> in the tube by a high DC voltage of anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the cathode to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the anode or the glass wall of the tube. Many of the early Crookes tubes undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below. Wilhelm Röntgen {{was the first to}} systematically study them, in 1895.|$|E
500|$|During heavy {{breathing}} as, for instance, during exercise, {{a large number}} of accessory muscles in the neck and abdomen are recruited. Exhalation, instead of being passive, is now caused by the rib cage being actively pulled downwards at the front and sides by the abdominal muscles. This has the effect of decreasing the size of the rib cage, and of pushing the abdominal organs up against the diaphragm which bulges into the thorax. The lung volume of air at the end of exhalation is now less than the resting FRC. However, the lungs cannot be emptied completely and in an adult human there is always still at least one litre of <b>residual</b> <b>air</b> left in the lungs after maximum exhalation. The FRC always remains in the alveoli after a normal out-breath. With each breath only about 350ml (i.e. less than 15%) of this alveolar air is expelled into the ambient air (with about 150ml [...] remaining behind in the airways, as [...] "dead space" [...] ventilation, as it is the first air to re-enter the alveoli on inhalation). This is immediately replaced with the same volume of fresh, but moistened, atmospheric air. It is therefore obvious that the 350ml inhaled fresh air is highly diluted by the 3litres of functional residual capacity air (i.e. the air that remains in the lungs after a normal exhalation), and that the composition of the alveolar air therefore changes very little under normal circumstances: the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen remains very close to 14kPa (105mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide varies minimally around 5.3kPa (40mmHg) throughout the respiratory cycle (of inhalation and exhalation).|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "official" [...] {{version of}} Lavoisier's Easter Memoir {{appeared}} in 1778. In the intervening period Lavoisier had {{ample time to}} repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the <b>residual</b> <b>air</b> after metals had been calcined. He showed that this <b>residual</b> <b>air</b> supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but [...] "nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air" [...] or the [...] "eminently respirable part of the air". The same year he coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning [...] "acid former". He {{was struck by the}} fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle.|$|E
2500|$|During heavy breathing, {{exhalation}} {{is caused}} by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation. But now, the abdominal muscles, instead of remaining relaxed (as they do at rest), contract forcibly pulling the lower edges of the rib cage downwards (front and sides) (Fig.8). This not only drastically decreases {{the size of the}} rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax (Fig.8). The end-exhalatory lung volume is now well below the resting mid-position and contains far less air than the resting [...] "functional residual capacity". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human there is always still at least 1 liter of <b>residual</b> <b>air</b> left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.|$|E
30|$|Since Terzaghi in 1936 {{explained}} {{the behavior of}} saturated soils and helped to underline {{the principles of the}} soil mechanics, different authors (Fredlund 1997) have tried to explain the behavior of the “problematic” unsaturated soils (Fredlund et al. 2012) that didn’t fit the behavior explained by the Terzaghi’s equation. These types of soils comprise soils above the water table (sands, silts and clays and even gravels) including man-made fills, colluvium, <b>residual</b> soils, <b>air</b> transported soils and gas generating soils (Fredlund et al. 2012).|$|R

No levels of phosphine exceeding the legal permissible exposure limits (PEL) was detected and although residues were detected on clothing, the levels were usually quite low and dissipated in open air to undetectable levels within 12 to 17 hours in all but a few cases.

2500|$|During {{exhalation}} {{the diaphragm}} and intercostal muscles relax. This returns {{the chest and}} abdomen to a position determined by their anatomical elasticity. This is the [...] "resting mid-position" [...] of the thorax and abdomen (Fig.7) when the lungs contain their functional <b>residual</b> capacity of <b>air</b> (the light blue area in the right hand illustration of Fig.7), which in the adult human has a volume of about 2.5–3.0liters (Fig.3).

40|$|In a German case study, {{environmental}} input-output analyses (eIOA) {{combined with}} NAMEA-type tables were conducted for eleven selected environmental pressure variables.

The methodology permits identification and preliminary ranking of 10 product chains along which about two-thirds of German production-born environmental pressures arise. The most relevant product groups are construction work, food, motor vehicles, basic metals, and electricity. The ten product groups are characterized by both high resource requirements and high <b>residual</b> outputs (<b>air</b> emissions, wastes).

40|$|Two hundred seventy two {{patients}} who underwent endo-scopic sinus surgery defined by Kennedy, between November 2000 and June 2002 were evaluated retrospectively.

Differences in scatter contamination between camera models have recently been reported in a multi-centric study [29].

The start of injection is usually taken as the time when the injector needle lifts off its seal. The start of combustion is more difficult to determine precisely. Both physical and chemical processes must take place before a significant fraction of the chemical energy of the injected liquid fuel is released. The physical processes are: the atomization of the liquid fuel jet, the vaporization of the fuel droplets, the mixing of fuel vapor with air.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the surface chemistry, including surface contaminations, of SnO 2 nanowires deposited on Ag-covered Si substrate by vapor phase deposition (VPD), thanks to x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{in combination with}} thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). Air-exposed SnO 2 nanowires are slightly non-stoichiometric, and {{a huge amount of}} C contaminations is observed at their surface. After the thermal physical desorption (TPD) process, SnO 2 nanowires become almost stoichiometric without any surface C contaminations. This is probably related to the fact that C contaminations, as well as <b>residual</b> gases from <b>air,</b> are weakly bounded to the crystalline SnO 2 nanowires and can be easily removed from their surface. The obtained results gave us insight on the interpretation of the aging effect of SnO 2 nanowires that is of great importance for their potential application in the development of novel chemical nanosensor devices.|$|R
