25|$|Almost all historians {{regard the}} siege as a German {{operation}} {{and do not}} consider that the Finns effectively participated in the siege. Russian historian Nikolai Baryshnikov argues that active Finnish participation did occur, but other historians have been mostly silent about it, most likely due to the friendly nature of post-war Soviet–Finnish relations. The main issues which count {{in favor of the}} former view are: (a) the Finns mostly stayed at the pre-Winter War border at the Karelian Isthmus (with small exceptions to straighten the frontline), despite German wishes and requests, and (b) they did not bombard the city from planes or with artillery and did not allow the Germans to bring their own land forces to Finnish lines. Baryshnikov explains that the Finnish military in the region was strategically dependent on the Germans, and lacked the <b>required</b> <b>means</b> and will to press the attack against Leningrad any further.|$|E

2500|$|Shortages {{of water}} between 1949 and 1986 {{led to the}} costly {{temporary}} expedient of importing water from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands or Morocco.

Such an approach was unaffordable and since 1953, Gibraltar has come to rely on the desalination of sea water, which now accounts for over 90% of the potable water supply. The running costs are high, however, as the energy <b>required</b> <b>means</b> that the cost of acquiring water through desalination is about three times higher than getting it from wells.

50|$|For {{the average}} person car {{collecting}} is a hobby. A person can have a fascination with a certain vehicle, make or a history with one so seeks a particular make or model.

50|$|Inductive FCLs come in many variants, but {{the basic}} concept is a {{transformer}} with a resistive FCL as the secondary. In un-faulted operation, there is no resistance in the secondary and so the inductance of the device is low. A fault current quenches the superconductor, the secondary becomes resistive and the inductance of the whole device rises. The advantage of this design {{is that there is}} no heat ingress through current leads into the superconductor, and so the cryogenic power load may be lower. However, the large amount of iron <b>required</b> <b>means</b> that inductive FCLs are much bigger and heavier than resistive FCLs.|$|E

The fighting in the early months of the Allied campaign in Italy proved very costly for the 36th Division, due to determined German resistance, the mountainous terrain, and the worsening winter weather. Walker was critical of the leadership in Italy, writing, [...] "The Italian campaign will not be finished this week, nor next.
