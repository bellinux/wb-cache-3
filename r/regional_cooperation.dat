5|$|The airlines' only {{aircraft}} was requisitioned by King Jigme Singye on 9 November 1990, {{in order to}} allow the king and his party to travel to Tokyo for the coronation of Akihito as Emperor of Japan. From Japan, the King then travelled to Malé in the Maldives for the South Asian Association for <b>Regional</b> <b>Cooperation</b> summit between 21–23 November, and returned to Bhutan in order for the aircraft to re-enter service with the airline on 25 November. Due to a requirement stipulated by the Bhutanese government that all foreign tourists, with the exception of Indian nationals, enter and leave Bhutan by air, the country's tourism industry was brought to a halt, which saw the airline paying hefty penalties to disgruntled tour operators. This problem was somewhat alleviated when a second BAe 146 entered service in 1992, and on 11 November 1993, the airline introduced a 10 Executive Class on the aircraft. On 13 May 1991, Drukair was registered under the Companies Act of Bhutan. Service to Yangon, the capital of Myanmar, began on 6 January 1997.|$|E

40|$|This thesis’ central aim is {{to rethink}} <b>regional</b> {{security}} <b>cooperation</b> in southern Africa by transcending the geopolitics that has been characteristic to the region. The constructivist inspired regional security complex theory is thus preferred as an analytic device through which a non-statist understanding of security within the region could be conceived. Furthermore {{to understand how the}} Southern African Development Community (SADC) is involved in the (re) construction of the region, the region building approach is adopted although the thesis is mindful of the fact that this approach is relevant to regions that have high levels of regionality. Comprehension of the <b>regional</b> security <b>cooperation</b> could not be possible without deconstructing the taken-for-granted understanding of <b>regional</b> security <b>cooperation.</b> To this end, post-modern and post-structuralists traditions become sites in which the altered and reformulations of <b>regional</b> security <b>cooperation</b> can be imagined with the hope of re-imagining new interpretations of regional security politics. Thus, linguistically inspired methodology and methods are embraced in order to unmask the taken for granted understandings and transform them into objects of discussion and criticism. Therefore, SADC’s critical and ironic security dynamics are considered within the post-modern tradition without necessarily engaging in the aesthetics of this tradition. Zimbabwe as a case illuminates the limits of modernistic understanding of <b>regional</b> security <b>cooperation.</b> The thesis concludes by proposing regionalist understanding of security alternatives that are based on integrated analysis of security threats and preventative approach to responses...|$|R
