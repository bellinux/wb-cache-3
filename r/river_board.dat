5|$|The <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> Act of 1950 {{sought to}} replace the Catchment Boards with larger organisations, and from 1950 the East Sussex <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> took over the {{responsibilities}} {{of most of the}} catchments in East Sussex, but the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board became part of the Kent <b>River</b> <b>Board.</b> Further changes followed the Water Resources Act 1963, and responsibility passed to the Kent and Sussex River Authorities in 1964. Ten years later, these structures were replaced by unitary authorities, who had responsibility for the supply of drinking water and for the drainage function of rivers. This lasted until the passing of the Water Act 1989, which split apart the two functions, and management of the river became the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority, Southern Region. Finally in April 1996, the National Rivers Authority was abolished with the formation of the Environment Agency. The agency has responsibility for drainage and water quality, {{and in the case of}} some rivers, it holds the navigation rights. The Rother is unusual, in that while it is under the jurisdiction of the Environment Agency, it is a free river, and so a licence is not required to use it. The Environment Agency also acts as the harbour authority for Rye Harbour, another unique situation, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs acts as a signatory to the Harbour of Rye Bylaws.|$|E
5|$|A {{catchment}} {{board for}} the Avon {{was created by the}} Land Drainage Act 1930 and became the Bristol Avon <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> under the River Boards Act 1948; the Board was in turn replaced by the Bristol Avon River Authority under the Water Resources Act 1963. Twenty-five minor watercourses were added to the Authority's jurisdiction in 1973. Reorganisation in 1974 under the Water Act 1973 brought the Avon catchment into a new regional body, the Wessex Water Authority.|$|E
5|$|The river {{has been}} managed {{by a number}} of bodies, {{including}} the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, the Rye Harbour Commissioners, and the Board of Conservators for the River Rother. After the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, it was managed by the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board, the Kent <b>River</b> <b>Board,</b> the Kent and Sussex River Authorities, the National Rivers Authority and finally the Environment Agency. It is unusual, in that while it is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Environment Agency, it has been a free river since 1826, and so no licence is required to use it. Management of the levels adjacent to the river is undertaken by the Romney Marshes Area Internal Drainage Board. The Rother passes by or near the villages of Etchingham, Robertsbridge, Bodiam, Northiam, and Wittersham.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> Act 1948 {{sought to}} {{establish}} <b>river</b> <b>boards</b> {{throughout the whole}} of England and Wales, with overall responsibility for land drainage, fisheries and river pollution. Thirty-two <b>river</b> <b>boards</b> inherited {{the functions of the}} existing catchment boards, or took over the flood prevention functions on main rivers from local authorities where no catchment board existed. The exceptions were the <b>River</b> Thames Catchment <b>Board</b> and the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board, which continued to exist under the powers of the 1930 Act.|$|R
50|$|The {{powers of}} <b>river</b> <b>boards</b> were {{extended}} by the Land Drainage Act 1961, which {{allowed them to}} raise additional finance and {{to act as an}} internal drainage board (IDB) where land drainage was necessary for the improvement of agricultural land, but no IDB existed. The <b>river</b> <b>boards</b> were replaced by twenty-seven river authorities on 1 April 1965, under the Water Resources Act 1963. The new authorities comprised the area of one or two <b>river</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Land Drainage Act 1961 was an Act of Parliament {{passed by}} the United Kingdom Government which {{provided}} mechanisms for <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> to raise additional finance to fund their obligations. It built upon {{the provisions of the}} Land Drainage Act 1930 and the <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> Act 1948.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, Yeomans was {{appointed}} by the Quebec government to an advisory committee on English language public schools. As of 2013, he serves on the International St. Lawrence <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> of Control, a board of Canadian and American representatives that monitors water levels on the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} {{of monitoring}} also extended to taking biological samples, {{and one of}} the first biotic indices used for assessing the ecological rather than the chemical quality of rivers was developed by the local <b>river</b> <b>board</b> in the 1960s. Using invertebrates as an indicator of pollution levels, it was appropriately named the Trent Biotic index.|$|E
25|$|Lower Hutt {{occupies}} the lower {{regions of the}} flood plain of the river, {{one of the most}} significant features of the city. In the 20th century the Hutt <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> built stopbanks to contain the river, but the threat of flooding from heavy rainfall persists. In 1985 the river burst its banks, and since then floods have been on a smaller scale. Smaller streams and storm-water drains have also caused occasional problems when rainfall exceeds average levels.|$|E
50|$|The 10th {{and final}} report, {{published}} in 1915, summarised {{the findings of}} the previous reports and made proposals for the establishment of <b>river</b> <b>boards</b> across England and Wales to complement the three (the West Riding of Yorkshire <b>Rivers</b> <b>Board,</b> the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee, and the Ribble Joint Committee) already in existence.|$|R
50|$|Toplis's far-sighted {{ideas were}} not {{implemented}} immediately, {{but the first}} moves towards more widespread management of river basins in England and Wales were enshrined in the Land Drainage Act 1930. Although this was primarily concerned with flood prevention and land drainage, it created Catchment Boards with responsibility {{for the management of}} main rivers, and each was based around a river basin or group of river basins. The Catchment Boards only covered parts of England and Wales, but this changed in 1948, when the <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> Act 1948 created 32 <b>River</b> <b>Boards.</b> Where Catchment Boards existed, their powers were inherited by the <b>River</b> <b>Boards,</b> and where they did not, they took over responsibility for flood prevention from local authorities. The <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> had additional responsibilities concerning fisheries, the prevention of pollution and the gauging of rivers. They were in turn replaced by 27 River Authorities following the passing of the Water Resources Act 1963, each with additional duties to monitor water quality and protect water resources.|$|R
5000|$|The Land Drainage Act 1961 {{addressed}} {{a number of}} issues that arose from the change from catchment <b>boards</b> to <b>river</b> <b>boards,</b> particularly in the area of finance. It became an Act of Parliament on 27 July 1961, with the full title [...] "An Act to enable <b>river</b> <b>boards</b> and catchment boards to raise drainage charges for the purpose of meeting part of their expenses; and to make further provision relating to the drainage of land and to drainage boards." [...] It consisted of 54 section, organised into four parts, and two schedules, the first containing minor amendments to the Land Drainage Act 1930 and the <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> Act 1948, with the second listing parts of previous legislation which had been repealed.|$|R
25|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} changed again {{with the passing of}} the Water Resources Act 1963: the <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> was {{replaced}} by the Lincolnshire River Authority, although the geographical area which it managed was similar. This in turn became part of Anglian Water following the passing of the Water Act 1973. When the regional water authorities were privatised {{under the terms of the}} Water Act 1989, management of rivers, including the Ancholme, passed to the National Rivers Authority (NRA). Finally, the NRA was subsumed into the Environment Agency in 1996.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of industry and the Dearne and Dove Canal, the river became grossly polluted {{in the early nineteenth}} century, and fish populations died. The West Riding <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> tried to address the problems as early as 1896, with limited success, and much of the river remained dead until the 1980s, when concerted attempts were made to clean industrial effluents before they were discharged, and to improve sewage treatment processes. Despite some setbacks, fish populations had been partially reinstated by the early 1990s. Channel engineering was carried out at Denaby in the 1990s, to re-introduce bends, deep pools and shallow gravel riffles, to assist fish spawning. In June 2015, salmon were reported in the river {{for the first time in}} 150 years.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 1958, Dr. Otto Holden, chief {{engineer}} of Hydroelectric Power Commusssion, and J. Burch McMorron, Chief Engineer of The New York Power Authority, detonated 27 metric tonnes of explosives to demolish the cofferdam that had diverted St. Lawrence River water {{away from the}} powerhouse construction site. It took four days for the plant to become fully operational. The last generators were commissioned in 1959. Previously, in 1956, the IJC established the International St. Lawrence <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> of Control as a mechanism to regulate the river {{above and below the}} dam. Competing interests for power and navigation had to be controlled in order to maintain good function of the dam. Those interested in power and flood control desired moderate water levels and the shipping industry and power station operators wanted levels to be higher.|$|E
50|$|The {{provisions}} of this Act were short-lived, since <b>River</b> <b>Boards,</b> which were its primary focus, were {{swept away by}} the Water Resources Act 1963, which replaced the thirty two <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> with twenty seven River Authorities. The anomaly of the Conservators of the River Thames and the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board was resolved by effectively making them into River Authorities. Although it became law on 31 July 1963, the change from boards to authorities did not actually occur until 1 April 1965.|$|R
50|$|The first {{moves towards}} more {{widespread}} management of river basins in England and Wales were {{enshrined in the}} Land Drainage Act 1930, which although primarily concerned with land drainage to prevent flooding, created catchment boards. These {{were responsible for the}} management of main rivers, and each was based around a river basin or group of river basins. Because of the emphasis on land drainage, they did not cover the whole of England and Wales, but this changed in 1948, when the <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> Act 1948 created 32 <b>river</b> <b>boards.</b> They inherited the powers of the catchment boards where they existed, and took over responsibility for flood prevention from local authorities where they did not.

50|$|<b>River</b> <b>boards</b> were {{authorities}} who controlled land drainage, fisheries and river pollution and had other functions relating to rivers, streams and inland waters in England and Wales between 1950 and 1965.|$|R
25|$|The Land Drainage Act 1930 {{changed the}} {{administrative}} bodies responsible for drainage, and the Corporation effectively became an Internal Drainage Board. In 1941, the Corporation ceased to be, and its powers and responsibilities were {{split between the}} Trent River Catchment Board and the River Ouse (Yorkshire) Catchment Board. Despite this change, {{the management of the}} area continued much as before, with official records stating that the Catchment Board acted as the Corporation of the Level of Hatfield Chase, even though it no longer existed legally. This continued with the renaming of the Trent River Catchment Board to the Trent <b>River</b> <b>Board,</b> and then the Trent River Authority, which finally became part of the Severn Trent Water Authority in 1974. In an unusual move, the Corporation of the Level of Hatfield Chase was re-constituted in 1987, by an order of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The order cited the powers of the 1813 and 1862 Acts, and transferred the property and responsibilities for drainage of the area from Severn Trent to the Corporation.|$|E
500|$|In 1939, the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was {{superseded}} by the Lancashire Rivers Board, but wartime conditions brought about further {{deterioration of the}} river. In 1951, the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act was passed and this board disappeared {{to be replaced by}} the Mersey <b>River</b> <b>Board,</b> which was replaced in turn by the Mersey and Weaver River Authority in 1965. During a 1950s television documentary entitled River of Irwell, the watercourse was described as [...] "The hardest worked river in the world".|$|E
500|$|Paraffin and oil engines {{gave way}} to {{electrically}} powered pumping stations in the 1950s, with the Board constructing six electric and one diesel pumping station to improve drainage to an extra [...] of land. In 1960, the decision was taken to further improve drainage of an area of , {{as part of a}} £1.4 million scheme which included the addition of two extra pumps at the Black Sluice, replacement of existing pumps elsewhere, and the widening of [...] of the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington Bridge to Rippingale Running Dyke. Jurisdiction for the Drain and the sluice passed to the Lincolnshire <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> at this time. The work, which began in 1962 and was completed in 1968, proved successful in preventing flooding during severe wet weather in the winter of 1968/9. With three [...] and two [...] diesel engines, the upgraded pumping station can pump 800 thousand gallons per minute (60m3/s). Responsibility for the drain and the sluice passed to the National Rivers Authority in 1990, and to the Environment Agency in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Despite legislation, board effects {{decreased}} until, in 1948, the <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> Act gave {{authority of}} all freshwater {{fish and the}} prevention of pollution to one <b>board</b> per <b>river.</b> In total, it created 32 boards.|$|R

500|$|Legislation {{to authorize}} the dam was {{introduced}} repeatedly by two California Republicans, Representative Phil Swing and Senator Hiram Johnson, but representatives {{from other parts of}} the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit California. The 1927 Mississippi flood made Midwestern and Southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project. On March 12, 1928, the failure of the St. Francis Dam, constructed by the city of Los Angeles, caused a disastrous flood that killed up to 600 people. As that dam was a curved-gravity type, similar in design to the arch-gravity as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam, opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam's safety could not be guaranteed. Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam. The Colorado <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> found the project feasible, but warned that should the dam fail, every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed, and that the river might change course and empty into the Salton Sea. The Board cautioned: [...] "To avoid such possibilities, the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra-conservative lines." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960, {{there was}} {{extensive}} flooding of the Rother Valley, with some [...] inundated, {{and in some}} areas the water did not recede for several months. In 1962 the Kent <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> introduced a bill to Parliament, which would authorise improvements to the river banks, {{with the construction of}} a sluice and associated lock below Rye, to prevent tidal flooding. At the time, the river was used by a fishing fleet of at least ten trawlers, and a freighter of 250 tons used the river for a trade in timber. There was some concern in the House of Lords that the lock would not be large enough to accommodate the freighter, although {{it would be possible to}} open both sets of lock gates when the tide level was suitable. The bill did not become an Act of Parliament, due to lack of parliamentary time, and so the sluice was not constructed. However, the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme began in 1966, and was completed in 1980. This involved raising the level of the floodbanks along much of the river. Those in the Wet Level, an area of [...] between the junction with the Maytham Sewer and Blackwall Bridge, were not raised as much, so that during periods of high flow when the river is tide-locked, the levels can be used for flood storage. The scheme included the installation of 20 pumping stations, which raise water from the low-lying marshes into the embanked river using Archimedes' screw pumps. Some of the drainage ditches in the marshland had to be reconfigured to deliver the water to the pumping stations.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, the Commissioners {{looked into}} the {{drainage}} of several areas {{on the fringe of}} Burnt Fen, as a result of requests by landowners in Sedge Fen. A report suggested that the best solution would be the incorporation of those areas into an Internal Drainage Board, and the Commissioners therefore applied to the <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> to enlarge their District by the addition of [...] which included parts of Sedge Fen, Decoy Fen and Redmere. The expansion was ratified by the Great Ouse <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> (Burnt Fen Internal Drainage District) Order, which was passed in 1962. It revoked all of the Burnt Fen Acts, and after 203 years, the Commissioners ceased to exist, being replaced by an elected board of 20 members.|$|E

2500|$|Holderness Drainage were {{responsible}} for the management of the system until 1930, when the Land Drainage Act 1930 became law. This organised the low-lying areas of England and Wales into Catchement Areas, each with its own Catchment Board. These boards {{were responsible}} for the main rivers within a catchment basin. [...] For the Holderness region, responsibility for the River Hull and the Holderness main drain passed to the Hull Catchment Board. Holderness Drainage then became an Internal Drainage Board (IDB), with responsibility for the smaller drains. Responsibility changed again with the passing of the River Boards Act 1948, which created the Hull and East Yorkshire <b>River</b> <b>Board.</b> The next change occurred {{as a result of the}} Water Resources Act 1963, when the Hull <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> was joined to the Yorkshire Ouse <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> to become the Yorkshire Ouse and Hull River Authority. Further amalgamation and reorganisation took place following the passing of the Water Act 1973, when the River Authority became part of the much larger Yorkshire Water Authority. Yorkshire Water Authority was privatised as a result of the Water Act 1989, and responsibility for main rivers including the Holderness Drain passed to the National Rivers Authority, which subsequently became part of the Environment Agency in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Responsibility for {{the scheme}} rested with the Trustees of Holderness Drainage from its {{inception}} in 1764 until 1930, when a major overhaul of land drainage legislation took place. Since then it has been managed by a Catchment Board, a <b>River</b> <b>Board,</b> a River Authority, a Water Authority, the National Rivers Authority and the Environment Agency. Since 1930, the smaller drainage ditches that feed into the Holderness Drain have been the responsibility of an Internal Drainage Board. In order to improve {{the efficiency of the}} system, pumping stations were built at Tickton, Great Culvert and East Hull in 1972. However, attitudes to land drainage have changed and the Tickton station is now deemed to be uneconomic, and will be closed down unless alternative sources of income to fund its operation can be found.|$|E
2500|$|Bull Hassocks {{pumping station}} was {{designed}} to handle water from the South Idle drains, but prior to 1970 also had to handle water from the Folly Drain. This was altered in that year, by building a new pumping station at Greenholme, which pumped the Folly Drain into the South Level Engine Drain. The station was built by the Trent <b>River</b> <b>Board</b> for the West Axholme IDB, and contained three pumps, two of [...] diameter, capable of pumping 109 Mld, and one of [...] rated at 29 Mld. The area was affected by the motorway construction programme of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which saw the M18 motorway running along {{the western edge of}} the Chase and the M180 motorway crossing it, broadly parallel to the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, but a little further south. The roads produced large volumes of run-off water, which entered the drainage system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{legislation}} made {{provision for}} a [...] "first appointed day", {{on which the}} River Authorities would come into existence, and this was set on 15 October 1964, {{as a result of}} the River Authorities (First Appointed Day) Order 1964. A River Authorities (Second Appointed Day) Order 1964 established 1 April 1965 as the day on which the new authorities would take over the responsibilities of the previous <b>River</b> <b>Boards,</b> which would then cease to exist. The <b>River</b> <b>Boards</b> Act 1948, under which they had been established, was also repealed on that day. Under the new legislation, twenty-seven River Authorities replaced the 32 existing <b>River</b> <b>Boards.</b> As well as inheriting land drainage, fisheries and the prevention of pollution functions, the new authorities were given additional duties to monitor water quality and protect water resources. They thus became responsible for inland waters and the underground strata which existed within their area. The Act made special provision for the River Thames and Lee Conservancy Catchment Boards, enabling them to act as if they were River Authorities and their catchment areas were river authority areas. There was also special provision for parts of London, defined as the London excluded area under section 125 of the Act.|$|R
