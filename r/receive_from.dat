5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can <b>receive</b> <b>from</b> one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of a demise of the Crown, the Privy Council—together with the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London as well as representatives of Commonwealth realms—makes a {{proclamation}} declaring the accession of the new sovereign and receives an oath from the new monarch relating to the security of the Church of Scotland, as required by law. It is also customary for the new sovereign to make an allocution to the Privy Council on that occasion, and this Sovereign's Speech is formally published in The London Gazette. Any such Special Assembly of the Privy Council, convened to proclaim the accession of a new sovereign and witness the monarch's statutory oath, is known as an Accession Council. The last such meetings were held on 6 and 8 February 1952: as Elizabeth II was abroad when the last demise of the Crown took place, the Accession Council met twice, once to proclaim the sovereign (meeting of 6 February 1952), and then again after the new queen had returned to Britain, to <b>receive</b> <b>from</b> her the oath required by statute (meeting of 8 February 1952).|$|E
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to decide how many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could <b>receive</b> <b>from</b> the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 38 - 42). vi, 42 leaves, bound 29 cmUsing an expectancy violation theoretical framework, {{this investigation}} provides {{an examination of}} the association between workplace social support and job satisfaction. In particular, this study explores the relationship between the appropriateness of emotional social support and job satisfaction. To assess these relationships, employees (N = 206) reported on the social support they <b>received</b> <b>from</b> their coworkers and supervisors. Results indicated that emotional support <b>received</b> <b>from</b> coworkers was not viewed to be more appropriate than emotional support <b>received</b> <b>from</b> supervisors. Emotional support <b>received</b> <b>from</b> supervisors was not found to have a stronger association with job satisfaction than emotional support <b>received</b> <b>from</b> coworkers.
