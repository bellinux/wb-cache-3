All OSI application layer standards use ASN. 1 in order to specify data structures such as mail messages or directory entries that are exchanged in distributed applications. ASN. 1 allows to define complex data types, which are encoded in a standardized exchange format, the so-called transfersyntax. To automate the tedious task to program the encoding and decoding routines by hand, socalled ASN. 1 compilers can be used (e. g. MAVROS [Huit 91], Pepsy [Onio 89], [Neuf 90], [Harv 91] and [Koiv 92]). Today, ASN. 1 is a well-established language {{that has been used}} not only in all OSI application layer standards, but also for non-OSI standards such as the Internet Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Open Document Interchange Format (ODIF). The performance and expressiveness of ASN. 1 is equal to or even better than that of s [...] ...|$|R

Several automation tools {{in term of}} hardware and software are necessary for successfully <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of a machine. This paper presents a prototype of workpiece holding attachment for <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of milling process by self configuration the workpiece setup. The prototype is designed with mechanism to reorient the work surface into machining spindle direction with high positioning accuracy. Variety of parts geometry is hold by attachment to perform single setup machining. Pin type with array pattern additionally clamps the workpiece surface from two opposite directions for increasing the machining rigidity. Optimum pins configuration for conforming the workpiece geometry with minimum deformation is determined through hybrid algorithms, Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Prototype with intelligent optimization technique enables to hold several variety of workpiece geometry which is suitable for machining low of repetitive production in <b>remote</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Increasing {{the demand}} for {{effectively}} use of the production facility requires the tools for sharing the manufacturing facility through <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of the machining process. This research introduces the methodology of machining technology for direct <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of networked milling machine. The integrated tools with virtual simulation, remote desktop protocol and Setup Free Attachment for <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of milling process are proposed. Accessing and monitoring of machining operation is performed by remote desktop interface and 3 D virtual simulations. Capability of <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> is supported by an auto setup attachment with a reconfigurable pin type setup free technology installed on the table of CNC milling machine to perform unattended machining process. The system is designed using a computer server and connected to a PC based controlled CNC machine for real time monitoring. A client will access the server through internet communication and virtually simulate the machine activity. The result has been presented that combination between real time virtual simulation and remote desktop tool is enabling to operate all machine tool functions and as well as workpiece setup. ...|$|R
