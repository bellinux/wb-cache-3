50|$|Salvesen took {{advantage}} of his position as a Tariff Reformer to consolidate his support among the Unionist voters. A significant number of Buteshire electors were middle-class merchants and others doing business in Glasgow but who had villa residences in towns in the constituency like Rothesay and Millport and good number were Unionist supporters who were generally favourable to tariff reform. Conservative efforts {{to win the election}} was particularly focused on these voters as it was felt that apathy in this key part of the electorate had been responsible for the narrowness of Graham’s win over Lamont at the 1900 general election. Lamont campaigned as a traditional Liberal free trader, although he was challenged on his previous support for a form of <b>retaliatory</b> <b>duty</b> to protect West Indian sugar producers from unfair foreign competition, which policy he now renounced.|$|E

S. <b>retaliatory</b> <b>duty.</b> This study determines the appropriate level of U. S. countervailing duty (CVD) by employing a vertically interrelated log–lumber model. The theoretical {{results show that}} the U. S. CVD can be greater (will be less) than the Canadian subsidy for a vertically related log–lumbermarket (for lumber market only). Empirical results support the theoretical findings in that the U. S. CVD for the log–lumber market (lumber market alone) is 1. 55 (0. 91) times the Canadian subsidy. countervailing duty, dispute, log, lumber, subsidy, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade, Political Economy, F 13,...|$|E
50|$|On April 4, 2005, {{now with}} the {{permission}} of the WTO, the EU announced plans to implement limited sanctions on a selection of US goods, charging a 15% levy on U.S. paper, farm goods, textiles and machinery from May 1, 2005. This was in light of the continuing failure of the United States to bring its legislation in conformity with its international obligations. Also, on May 1, Canada imposed a 15% surtax sanction on US imports of cigarettes, oysters and live swine. On September 1, 2005, the Japanese government introduced 15% <b>retaliatory</b> <b>duties</b> on U.S. steel imports.|$|R

40|$|The {{stringent}} {{guidelines for}} producing, harvesting, and shipping certified non-hormone treated beef for the European Union create additional costs that greatly reduce {{the competitiveness of}} U. S. beef. What {{had once been a}} large market for beef variety meats and then a niche market for non-treated beef has all but vanished because the E. U. hormone ban and regulations for producing and certifying non-treated beef have made U. S. product too expensive to export. Some producers continue to obtain U. S. Department of Agriculture certification for their non-hormone treated beef, but most are selling their fully traceable, certified cattle into the domestic natural beef market at no additional premium compared with cattle verified as non-treated via a producer-signed affidavit. As an international trade issue, the beef hormone ban (and U. S. retaliation) continues {{to play a role in}} policy decisions and trade negotiations. As more countries negotiate accession to the European Union, for example, the United States stands to lose additional trade potential. In addition, although retaliation appears to be blocking trade at about the appropriate level, some E. U. countries may actually be benefiting from the <b>retaliatory</b> <b>duties</b> applied to some agricultural products based on country of origin. beef hormone ban, E.

60|$|Of Mr. Gladstone as orator and improvisatore, enough {{has been}} said and seen. Besides being orator and statesman he was scholar and critic. Perhaps scholar in his interests, not in abiding contribution. The most copious of his {{productions}} in this delightful but arduous field was the three large volumes on Homer and the Homeric Age, given {{to the world in}} 1858. Into what has been well called the whirlpool of Homeric controversies, the reader shall not here be dragged. Mr. Gladstone himself gave them the go-by, with an indifference and disdain such as might have been well enough in the economic field if exhibited towards a protectionist farmer, or a partisan of <b>retaliatory</b> <b>duties</b> on manufactured goods, but that were hardly to the point in dealing with profound and original critics. What he too contemptuously dismissed as Homeric “bubble-schemes,” were in truth centres of scientific illumination. At {{the end of the eighteenth}} century Wolf’s famous Prolegomena appeared, in which he advanced the theory that Homer was no single poet, nor a name for two poets, nor an individual at all; the Iliad and Odyssey were collections of independent lays, folk-lore and folk-songs connected by a common set of themes, and edited, redacted, or compacted about the middle of the sixth century before Christ. A learned man of our own day has said that F. A. Wolf ought to be counted one of the half dozen writers that within the last three centuries have most influenced thought. This would bring Wolf into line with Descartes, Newton, Locke, Kant, Rousseau, or whatever other five master-spirits of thought from then to now the judicious reader may select. The present writer has assuredly no competence to assign Wolf’s place in the history of modern criticism, but straying aside for a season from the green pastures of Hansard, and turning over again the slim volume of a hundred and fifty pages in which Wolf discusses his theme, one may easily discern a fountain of broad streams of modern thought (apart from the particular thesis) that to Mr. Gladstone, by the force of all his education and his deepest prepossessions, were in the highest degree chimerical and dangerous.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{trade between}} the U. S. and Mexico has become {{progressively}} liberalized over the past 20 years, with significant increases in bilateral trade in many sectors. The rice sector in both nations, however, continues to be highly protected, with producers and millers {{on both sides of}} the border continuing to protest the other nation's protectionist policies. This paper examines market efficiency and spatial price integration in ten U. S. and Mexican rice markets over the 1998 - 2002 period, during which a <b>retaliatory</b> antidumping <b>duty</b> was imposed by Mexico. The paper uses a multiple step analytical process, including analysis of market price differentials, stationarity tests, bivariate and multivariate cointegration tests, and impulse response analysis. Based on the cointegration results, long-run equilibrating relationships are shown to bind most Mexican markets to U. S. markets, and the U. S. markets are shown to be integrated with continuity. Smaller and more remote Mexican markets located far from transport hubs and milling centers tend not to be integrated with other regions, suffer from information asymmetries, and are characterized by relatively high price levels. In large markets where tariffs tend to be binding, trade policy plays a key role in determining equilibrium market relationships. For example, the tariff structure largely determines whether rice consumed in Mexico will primarily be milled domestically or in the U. S. in the long run. Overall, the results suggest that while consumers in major urban centers have benefited from freer trade, those in remote rural markets have yet to realize significant gains from liberalized rice markets.
