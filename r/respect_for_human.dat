25|$|Abul Ala Maududi, {{the founder}} of Jamaat-e-Islami, {{wrote a book called}} Human Rights in Islam, in which he argues that <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> rights has always been {{enshrined}} in Sharia law (indeed that the roots of these rights {{are to be found in}} Islamic doctrine) and criticizes Western notions that there is an inherent contradiction between the two.

25|$|Some of {{the motivations}} for Equatorial Guinea's {{membership}} pursuit into the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) included access to several professional and academic exchange {{programs and the}} facilitate cross-border circulation of citizens. The adoption of Portuguese as an official language was the primary requirement to apply for CPLP acceptance. In addition, the country was told it has to adopt political reforms allowing for effective democracy and the <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> rights.

25|$|In a {{counterinsurgency}} situation, {{the perception}} of the government (i.e., McCormick's CF) violating the human rights of the population causes Eisenstat's legitimacy gap to widen. The Phoenix program in South Vietnam was criticized for a lack of precision in its targeting, and caused a further loss in legitimacy of the government, regardless of the damage done to the Viet Cong infrastructure. Marighella recommended that urban guerillas deliberately provoke the government into overreaction, as a means of reducing its legitimacy; the doctrine of having FID trainers counsel <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> rights has pure military, not just humanitarian, justification.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greeks {{perceived}} {{order in}} the universe, and in turn, applied order and reason to their creations. Their humanist philosophy put mankind at the centre of things, and promoted well-ordered societies {{and the development of}} democracy. At the same time, the <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> intellect demanded reason, and promoted a passion for enquiry, logic, challenge, and problem solving. The architecture of the ancient Greeks, and in particular, temple architecture, responds to these challenges with a passion for beauty, and for order and symmetry which {{is the product of a}} continual search for perfection, rather than a simple application of a set of working rules.|$|E

25|$|The law prohibits {{arbitrary}} arrest and detention, {{and the government}} generally observes these prohibitions; however, police reportedly arrests and detains citizens arbitrarily on occasion. The federal police have jurisdiction for maintaining {{law and order in}} the federal capital and for federal crimes in the provinces.

25|$|Colombia–United States {{relations}} are the bilateral {{relations between the}} Republic of Colombia and the United States of America. The {{relationship between the two}} states evolved from mutual cordiality during most of the 19th and early 20th centuries to a recent partnership that links the governments of both nations around several key issues; this includes fighting communism, the War on Drugs, and the threat of terrorism due to the September 11 attacks in 2001. During the last fifty years, different American governments and their representatives have become involved in Colombian affairs through the implementation of policies concerned with the issues already stated. Some critics of current US policies in Colombia, such as Law Professor John Barry, claim that US influences have catalyzed internal conflicts and substantially expanded the scope and nature of human rights abuses in Colombia. Supporters, such as Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman, defend the idea that the United States has promoted <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> rights {{and the rule of law}} in Colombia; in addition, adding to the fight against drugs and terrorism.|$|E
