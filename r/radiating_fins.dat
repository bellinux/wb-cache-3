40|$|A {{literature}} review shows {{that much of}} work on <b>radiating</b> <b>fins</b> {{has been carried out}} analytically and numerically. Presently, a radiating pin fin with grooves and threads on its outside surface is investigated experimentally. A test facility with a vacuum chamber and instrumentation is fabricated. The heat input to the fin is varied such that the base temperature is maintained constant under steady state. Based on a study of effect of vacuum, using available resources, the chamber is designed for a vacuum of 80 mm Hg such that the contribution of convection to the total heat transfer could be ignored. The study shows that there exist optimum angle of grooves and number of threads per inch for which the heat loss per unit mass is a maximum. The grooved / threaded radiating fin loses 1. 4 and 1. 2 times greater heat per unit mass, respectively, compared to the bare pin fin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â”€ An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} provide information about the effect of pressure reduction on heat loss from cylindrical fins of three different geometries. A literature review shows that much of work on <b>radiating</b> <b>fins</b> has been carried out analytically and numerically. In this research, a solid cylindrical fin and two other cylindrical fins with circular grooves and threads on their outside surface are investigated experimentally. A test facility with a pressure reduction chamber and instrumentation is fabricated. The heat input to the fin is varied such that the base temperature is maintained constant under steady state. Based on a study of effect of pressure reduction, using available resources, the chamber is designed for a vacuum of 680 mm Hg. The experimental result shows that for cylindrical fin with circular grooves (depth 3. 5 mm) heat loss is a maximum. The grooved cylindrical fin loses approximately 1. 23 times greater heat per unit area, compared to the threaded cylindrical fin, and 2. 17 times greater heat per unit area, respectively compared to the solid pin fin at a pressure lower than atmospheric pressure. As pressure decreases heat loss reduces and contribution of radiation heat transfer on total heat loss increases...|$|E

An electronic analog solution of a fin of nonuniform thickess with one- dimensional steadystate radiant heat transfer is presented. The specific example is concerned with a constant rate of variation of thickness; however, any general configuration could be used. (auth...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a hybrid honeycomb panel heat rejection system concept for future high-power spacecraft is described. Performance evaluation of this heat pipe-based hybrid radiator is based on data and prediction models from a developmental component hardware testing program. The concept integrates three high-performance components into an optimized radiator system. These components are the sideflow heat pipe transport leg, honeycomb panel evaporator, and light-weight high-efficiency heat pipe fins. A 3. 05 m (10 ft.) long hybrid radiator was designed considering remnant hardware available from other Hughes programs. The key performance objective for the hybrid radiator was to demonstrate high thermal transport capacity, increased <b>radiating</b> <b>fin</b> lengths, improved thermal efficiency across structural boundaries, and reduced weight. Analysis showed that 9000 W can be transported over a 3. 05 m radiator and that finlengths of up to 1 m are possible...|$|R
40|$|JAn {{analysis}} of the two-dimensional heat transfer in a <b>radiating</b> composite <b>fin</b> is presented together with details of the numerical method of solution. A Several stainless-steet-cld copper fins typical of finned-tube space radiators are analyzed over a range (0 to 1) of stainless-steel to copper thickness ratio. Items discussed are temperature profiles along the fin length, temperature drop across fin thickness, effective conductivity, fin efficiency, heat rejection rate per unit weight, and ratio of effective conductivity to effective density. It was found for the particular geometries analyzed that the two-dimensional temperature distribution in the fin cross section is essentially one-dimensional. The use of the thickness-averaged conductivity in one-dimensional calculations yields essentially the same results as the two-dimensional calcu-lations. ...|$|R

The contestant must walk across a fin {{to reach the}} center of the carousel, and across another fin to reach the opposite side before jumping to safety. Contestants who fall off the fin onto the carousel rarely can avoid sliding down the sloped sides and into the water below. In the 1st Competition, the obstacle was composed of three small windmills rather than the one big windmill used in later competitions.|$|R

The {{objective of this}} thesis is to develop an interactive computer program that will analyze and synthesize radiative heat transfer in longitudinal fins. The analysis procedure determines the amount of heat transferred from the fin given the fin base temperature, fin dimensions and thermal properties. The synthesis procedure is the converse problems: it determines {{the size of the}} fin required to dissipate a specified amount of heat given the thermal characteristics of the fin. In addition, the program is capable of performing the analysissynthesis of three fin profiles (rectangular, trapezoidal and triangular) in two environments (free space and non-free space). Free space is considered as the absence of external heat sources or interception of the heat dissipated by the fin whereas non-free space includes the effect of external heat sources and neighboring structures. A theoretical analysis of heat transfer from <b>radiating</b> longitudinal <b>fins</b> will be presented along with a user oriented computer program. Finally, detailed examples will be provided to illustrate the different types of problems, profiles and environments. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
