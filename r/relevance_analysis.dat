The helpful actions pruning (HAP) strategy and relaxed-plan-based heuristics are two representatives among those methods and are still popular in the state-of-the-art planners. Here, we present new analyses on the properties of HAP. Specifically, we show new reasons for which HAP can cause incompleteness of a search procedure. We prove that, in general, HAP is incomplete for planning with conditional effects if factored expansions of actions are used. To preserve completeness, we propose a pruning strategy {{that is based on}} <b>relevance</b> <b>analysis</b> and confrontation. We will show that both <b>relevance</b> <b>analysis</b> and confrontation are necessary. We call it the confrontation and goal relevant actions pruning (CGRAP) strategy.

40|$|Abstract — In machine {{learning}} and statistics, feature selection, {{also known as}} variable selection, feature reduction, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the technique of selecting a subset of relevant features for building robust learning models. Feature selection also helps people to acquire better understanding about their data by telling them which are the important features {{and how they are}} related with each other. Attribute subset selection on the basis of <b>relevance</b> <b>analysis</b> is one way to reduce the dimensionality. <b>Relevance</b> <b>analysis</b> of attribute is done by means of correlation analysis, which detects the attributes (redundant) that do not have significant contribution in the characteristics of whole data of concern. Feature selection is one of the important and frequently used techniques in data preprocessing for data mining. It reduces the number of features, removes irrelevant, redundant, or noisy data, and brings the immediate effects for applications. This paper shows various feature selection techniques for various dataset. We have taken Intrusion Detection Problem Dataset and Gas Consumption Dataset for testing. The comparison of variou...|$|E
