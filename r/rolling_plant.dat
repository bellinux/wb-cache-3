25|$|The {{iron and}} steel {{industries}} occupied important roles {{in the development of}} the city, both before and after federation. Especially notable were those mills located in the valley at Goldendale and Shelton below the hill towns of Tunstall, Burslem and Hanley. Shelton Steelworks' production of steel ended in 1978—instead of producing crude steel, they concentrated on rolling steel billet which was transported from Scunthorpe by rail. The <b>rolling</b> <b>plant</b> finally closed in 2002. From 1864 to 1927 Stoke housed the repair shops of the North Staffordshire Railway and was the home of independent railway locomotive manufacturers Kerr Stuart & Co. Ltd. from 1881 to 1930.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{critically}} assess the potential of mathematical modelling which uses finite element method software for solving operation problems in the hot rolling of flat and long products. We focused on concrete issues faced by <b>rolling</b> <b>plants</b> in the Moravian-Silesian region (Czech Republic). The investigation was always combined with field or pilot measurements or laboratory experiments...|$|R
40|$|Currently hot <b>rolling</b> <b>plants</b> are {{entering}} the market segment for thick gauges and high strength steel grades where the elastic bending property of the strip leads to internal forces in the coil during coiling operation. The strip tends to open. Primetals is investigating several possibilities to facilitate safe coil evacuation and coil handling under spring-back conditions. The contribution includes finite element models of such mechanical solutions. Results of parameter variation and stability limits of case studies are presented in the paper...|$|R

40|$|A {{wheel-rail contact}} {{formulation}} for analyzing the train-structure nonlinear interaction {{that takes into}} account the wheel and rail geometry is proposed. Most of the existing methods treat the contact forces as external forces, whereas the present formulation uses a finite element to model the behavior in the contact interface, based on Hertz's theory and Kalker's laws. The equations of motion are complemented with constraint equations that relate the displacements of the vehicle and structure, being the complete system solved directly using an optimized algorithm. The formulation is validated with experimental data from a test performed on a <b>rolling</b> stock <b>plant...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract：In {{order to}} solve the continual bolt {{fracture}} fault for gearbox of rolling mill in one cold strip <b>rolling</b> mill <b>plant,</b> vibration signals of gearbox {{in the process of}} rolling were collected by experimental research. Based on the signal analysis, combined with the results of statics and modal analysis of bolt, abnormal vibration of gearbox is confirmed the main cause for bolt fracture. Moreover, by further signals analysis of gearbox and vibration intensity analysis of bearing pedestal, finally found deflection of input shaft is the direct cause for gearbox abnormal vibration. Through the maintenance, it was found that eccentricity ring of bearing of input shaft had been worn down. The results of maintenance proved effectiveness of this paper...|$|R
