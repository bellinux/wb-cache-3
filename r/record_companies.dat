5|$|The American music {{industry}} includes {{a number of}} fields, ranging from <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> to radio stations and community orchestras. Total industry revenue is about $40 billion worldwide, and about $12 billion in the United States. Most of the world's major <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> are based in the United States; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The major <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> produce material by artists that have signed {{to one of their}} record labels, a brand name often associated with a particular genre or record producer. <b>Record</b> <b>companies</b> may also promote and market their artists, through advertising, public performances and concerts, and television appearances. <b>Record</b> <b>companies</b> may be affiliated with other music media companies, which produce a product related to popular recorded music. These include television channels like MTV, magazines like Rolling Stone and radio stations. In recent years the {{music industry}} has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the Internet downloading of copyrighted music; many musicians and the RIAA have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music.|$|E

5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E

After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E

5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971.

For shock value, the group was photographed in exaggerated drag on the album cover.|$|E
5|$|Business tycoon Louis Benjamin was {{involved}} with Lew Grade as {{part of one of}} the four major <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> in the UK at the time.
