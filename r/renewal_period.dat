2500|$|Despite {{the good}} faith shown by King, the Rangers board {{proceeded}} with the season ticket renewal campaign {{at the beginning}} of April, before the business review was concluded. This soured the relationship between the Rangers board and King and ended negotiations, with the latter accusing the club of deliberately delayed the publishing of the review until after the <b>renewal</b> <b>period</b> and the Union of Fans remained aligned with King. Indeed, the fans group demanded the board reveal details of the executive bonus entitlements, which it refused to do. Around the same time, Rangers announced a three-year agreement with online casino company 32Red to be the club's new shirt sponsor. On the eve of the business review's publication it was reported that Rangers second highest appearance maker Sandy Jardine had died aged just 65 after a long battle with throat cancer. There was a high degree of anticipation surrounding the review with journalists noting an eight-day delay and the fans hopes for detail and clarity regarding the boards future plans while Rangers director Sandy Easdale acknowledged that the club financial situation was fragile. Upon its publication the review stated the club needed to raise £30m by 2017, including a new share issue, for it to compete in the top league and the board aimed to make the business sustainable by season 2015/16 but required savings to be made including staff redundancies. Issues regarding financial mismanagement by the board came to light from the review including £2m which was spent on stadium Wi-Fi, LED displays and jumbo screens that were deemed [...] "non-essential" [...] and that players were signed during the summer which executives should have known the club could not afford.|$|E

These risks, which may exceed the firm’s financial capacity post-loss, can be hedged using financial instruments in the insurance markets. Many firms design insurance programs to share the loss exposure; however characterization of the loss distributions and determination of the optimal coverage limits is more challenging. Few applied simulation models have been published in the open literature to address optimal insurance policies, despite the importance and value provided to shareholders. Consequently, corporate risk managers often rely on heuristics or past decisions to structure insurance programs during <b>renewal</b> <b>periods.</b> This simulation model considers the benefit of risk management given loss distributions specific to contract manufacturers and establishes a scientific approach for making optimal insurance policy decisions. 1...|$|R

In order to justify an initial license extension for the 40 – 60 yr period, new nondestructive examina-tion (NDE) approaches have been developed and deployed by NPP operators in their aging management programs.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{analysis}} of queueing output processes that is based on an embedding of the output process in a renewal-reward process in which the <b>renewal</b> <b>periods</b> are busy cycles and the rewards represent the numbers of customers served during busy cycles. Our method yields an approximation for the variance curve that is asymptotically exact as time grows to infinity. For illustration, we consider the stable M/G/ 1 queue with an arbitrary, finite variance, distri-bution for the initial state. We show that under the assumption of a finite third moment for the service time distribution, this curve converges to a linear asymptote with a slope equal to the arrival rate and further show that the y-intercept of this asymptote depends only on the variance of the initial queue level, σ 20, and the traffic intensity, ρ, and is equal to σ 2 0 − ρ/(1 − ρ) 2. Our result immediately yields an expression for the y-intercept of the stationary case that depends on the first 3 moments of the service time distribution. This stimulates consideration of a 35 year old conjecture of D. J. Daley: Among the stationary M/G/ 1 queues, the M/M/ 1 is characterized by having a variance curve of λt, where λ is the arrival rate. While we leave this conjecture unproved, we narrow down the class of candidate service time distributions to those whose y-intercept of the linear asymptote is 0...|$|R

These cover the freshwater flux stabilizing the near-surface layer, additional heat flux established due to rain versus surface temperature differences, modification of physical parameters by temperature and salinity changes, enhancement of the surface roughness, damping of short gravity waves, surface mixing by rain, and transfer of additional momentum from air to sea. They are separately described and included in our surface renewal model to investigate the rain 2 ̆ 7 s influence on the cool skin of the ocean {{and the creation of a}} haline molecular diffusion layer. Simulations with the upgraded model show that the most important effect on the conductive layer is that of reduced <b>renewal</b> <b>periods</b> followed by additional surface cooling due to rain on the order of 0. 1 K. At rain rates below 50 mm h- 1 rainfall is not able to completely destroy the mean temperature difference across the cool skin. A freshwater skin is created that exhibits a salinity difference exceeding 4 ‰ under strong rainfall. Comparisons with field data of the cool skin taken during the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment confirm the upgraded renewal model. Surface salinity measurements taken during the same field campaign are consistent with the calculated salinity differences across the freshwater skin. The enhancement of surface roughness by natural rain is less pronounced than described in earlier laboratory studies of rain with large drop sizes only...|$|R
