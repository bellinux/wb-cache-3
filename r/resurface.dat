40|$|Patellar <b>resurfacing</b> during total knee {{replacement}} (TKR) {{has been}} a controversial subject for many years. In 1990 a randomised prospective study was started to compare policies of <b>resurfacing,</b> not <b>resurfacing</b> and selectively <b>resurfacing</b> the patella. One hundred and twenty-five cases (suitable for a cruciate sparing TKR) were randomised. At the 5 -year review, the group in which the patella had not been <b>resurfaced</b> had needed significantly more secondary surgery than the other groups. Global knee scoring systems showed little difference between the groups but a scoring system which focused on the patella revealed differences and demonstrated worse results when the patella was not <b>resurfaced.</b> A minor degree, of maltracking was tolerated in <b>resurfaced</b> knees but tended to cause pain and articular cartilage wear in unresurfaced patellae. Four knees with good patellar articular cartilage at surgery did poorly when not <b>resurfaced,</b> suggesting that a selective policy is not totally reliable. Routine patellar <b>resurfacing</b> gave the most reliable results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Two {{models have}} been {{proposed}} for the <b>resurfacing</b> history of Venus: (1) equilibrium <b>resurfacing</b> and (2) global <b>resurfacing.</b> The equilibrium model consists of two cases: in case 1, areas {{less than or equal}} to 0. 03 percent of the planet are spatially randomly <b>resurfaced</b> at intervals of less than or greater than 150, 000 yr to produce the observed spatially random distribution of impact craters and average surface age of about 500 m. y.; and in case 2, areas greater than or equal to 10 percent of the planet are <b>resurfaced</b> at intervals of greater than or equal to 50 m. y. The global <b>resurfacing</b> model proposes that the entire planet was <b>resurfaced</b> about 500 m. y. ago, destroying the preexisting crater population and followed by significantly reduced volcanism and tectonism. The present crater population has accumulated since then with only 4 percent of the observed craters having been embayed by more recent lavas. To test the equilibrium <b>resurfacing</b> model we have run several Monte Carlo computer simulations for the two proposed cases. It is shown that the equilibrium <b>resurfacing</b> model is not a valid model for an explanation of the observed crater population characteristics or Venus' <b>resurfacing</b> history. The global <b>resurfacing</b> model is the most likely explanation for the characteristics of Venus' cratering record. The amount of <b>resurfacing</b> since that event, some 500 m. y. ago, can be estimated by a different type of Monte Carolo simulation.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} — Knee pain after total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is not uncommon. Patellar retention in TKA is one cause of postoperative knee pain, and {{may lead to}} secondary addition of a patellar component. Patellar <b>resurfacing</b> in TKA is controversial. Its use ranges from 2 % to 90 % worldwide. In this randomized study, we compared the outcome after patellar <b>resurfacing</b> and after no <b>resurfacing.</b> Patients and methods — We performed a prospective, randomized study of 74 patients with primary osteoarthritis who underwent a Triathlon CR TKA. The patients were randomized to either patellar <b>resurfacing</b> or no <b>resurfacing.</b> They filled out the VAS pain score and KOOS questionnaires preoperatively, and VAS pain, KOOS, and patient satisfaction 3, 12, and 72 months postoperatively. Physical performance tests were performed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Results — We found similar scores for VAS pain, patient satisfaction, and KOOS 5 subscales at 3, 12, and 72 months postoperatively in the 2 groups. Physical performance tests 3 months postoperatively were also similar in the 2 groups. No secondary <b>resurfacing</b> was performed in the group with no <b>resurfacing</b> during the first 72 months Interpretation — Patellar <b>resurfacing</b> in primary Triathlon CR TKA is of no advantage regarding pain, physical performance, KOOS 5 subscales, or patient satisfaction compared to no <b>resurfacing.</b> None of the patients were reoperated with secondary addition of a patellar component within 6 years. According to these results, routine patellar <b>resurfacing</b> in primary Triathlon TKA appears to be unnecessary...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there is}} a limited {{understanding}} of the factors influencing range of motion by comparing patellar <b>resurfacing</b> vs non-resurfacing in total knee arthroplasty during activities of daily living. A recent meta-analysis of patellar replacement confirms better outcome with patella resurfacing; however, {{the result can be}} influenced by many other factors, such as: component design, surgeon experience, and technical aspects of the surgery. This study compares the biomechanics of the knee in patients after total knee arthroplasty with and without patellar <b>resurfacing</b> during stair climbing. Forty-seven patients with total knee arthroplasty were assessed at the mean follow-up of 24 months. In all of them a posterior stabilised fixed bearing prosthesis (Optetrak PS, Exactech) was implanted. Twenty-six patients were treated without patellar <b>resurfacing</b> and 21 with patellar <b>resurfacing.</b> Clinical evaluations were performed using the International Knee Society and the Hospital for Special Surgery scores. Ten patients with patellar <b>resurfacing</b> and 10 patients without patellar <b>resurfacing</b> were also studied with motion analysis during stair climbing; 10 healthy subjects were studied for statistical comparison. Clinical passive knee flexion, International Knee Society Function and Hospital for Special Surgery scores were significantly higher in the patellar <b>resurfacing</b> group. During stair climbing, active knee joint range of motion during the stance phase was greater in patients with patellar <b>resurfacing.</b> The maximum adduction moment was significantly higher in the group without patellar <b>resurfacing.</b> Patients with patellar <b>resurfacing</b> demonstrated better clinical scores, and kinematic and kinetic data while ascending stairs...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{clinical}} outcomes between patellar <b>resurfacing</b> and nonresurfacing in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Data from osteoarthritis patients who underwent TKA and were followed up for ≥ 9 years were analysed retrospectively. Patients {{were divided into}} two groups: patellar nonresurfacing group and patellar <b>resurfacing</b> group. In the nonresurfacing group, the partial lateral facet of the patella was removed, the patella was reshaped to match the trochlea of the femoral prosthesis and circumpatellar denervation was performed. In the <b>resurfacing</b> group, the patella was <b>resurfaced</b> with a cemented component. Clinical outcomes included incidence of anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score, patient satisfaction, revision rate and radiographic findings. RESULTS: Of the 130 patients included, 71 were assigned to the nonresurfacing group and 59 to the <b>resurfacing</b> group. No significant between-group differences were observed for any {{clinical outcomes}} measured. The incidence of anterior knee pain was 14. 1 % (nonresurfacing group) and 5. 1 % (<b>resurfacing</b> group).
