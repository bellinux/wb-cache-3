500|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and {{relatively}} low pay, Barham's 1841 {{investigation into the}} Cornish mining industry found that bal maidens generally enjoyed their work, and that {{those who had been}} in other jobs tended to prefer work at the mines. Mining had shorter hours than domestic service and was less affected by seasonal variations than farm working, the other two jobs employing significant numbers of women, and it was far easier for workers to live at home and travel to work each day, rather than lodging in their master's house or on a remote farm. Outdoor work was considered healthier than work in enclosed and smoky mines and factories, and it was sometimes believed that women who had worked as bal maidens from a young age were healthier than they would otherwise have been. From the 1780s onwards Cornwall suffered severe unemployment and poverty, and there were always large numbers of women and girls volunteering for work at the mines. The practice of giving preference to the wives, widows and children of dead or invalid miners allowed families to remain in their local area and to avoid destitution following the loss of the family's main breadwinner; work as a bal maiden also provided an opportunity for girls and young women to escape workhouses and gain financial independence. (As well as the benefits to the community of giving work to the families of invalid or dead miners, <b>recruitment</b> <b>from</b> <b>within</b> mining families benefited the mine owners also. The wives and children of miners could be expected to understand mining terminology and techniques, and would generally have been regular visitors to the mines delivering food to their husbands and thus be familiar with the mine's layout.) ...|$|E
40|$|THELIBRARY PROFESSION AS PRACTICED IN THE UNITED STA 4 TES {{has evolved}} into two primary {{divisions}} of employees: librarians and library technicians. A historical survey of the education of both groups reveals a number of per-sistent themes and some currently urgent issues. The schooling of library practitioners is heavily influenced by two environments-i. e., academia and the profession itself. The academic setting for each group is different as are the roles of each within the pro-fession. With current changes in economics and technologies, within both academia and the library profession, {{it is reasonable to}} expect that the differences between education for library technicians and education for librarians will continue to evolve. The “support staff movement ” offers an opportunity for inclusive lead-ership to create a setting that is responsive to the career and developmen-tal needs of all library staff as well as to create a positive vision of the future of libraries. Distance education, enlightened personnel policies, <b>recruitment</b> <b>from</b> <b>within,</b> and the updating of policy statements on library education and library personnel are recommended areas of attention...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} detailed {{findings from the}} qualitative or interpretive phase of a mixed-methods case study focusing on the professional identities and lived experiences of research among six lecturers working in different capacities across {{the field of education}} in a ‘teaching-led’ higher education institution. Building upon the quantitative phase published earlier in this journal, factors both facilitating (e. g. research infrastructure, support for doctoral study) and constraining (e. g. time, space, workload, critical mass, ‘practitioner bond professionalism’, ‘organisational socialisation’, networks, roles and responsibilities, power relationships) research activity are identified. These are considered {{in the context of an}} institution often recruiting staff with ‘non-traditional’ backgrounds from within ‘the professions’ (e. g. from schools and colleges without doctorates) looking to become more ‘research-informed’ and establish a more vibrant and sustainable research culture. Recommendations for further development focus on ‘identity transitions’ and ‘cultural transformation’, emphasising the importance of research leadership and its distribution throughout the organisation. With current trends towards the apparent intensification and prioritisation of research activity over teaching, findings are considered particularly important for institutions of a similar nature to the one described here, for education departments in larger institutions also on similar journeys, and in light of an anticipated increase in demand for research activity arising from the expansion of higher education provision in further education and the private sector, where <b>recruitment</b> <b>from</b> <b>within</b> ‘the professions’ to teach across ‘vocational’ programmes is common...|$|E
40|$|The {{intertidal}} dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltii is {{a dominant}} {{species in the}} Dutch and German Wadden Sea. Although numerous studies of its reproductive ecology have been conducted, few have examined the importance of seeds and seed banks for meadow maintenance. We investigated the contribution of a seed bank (size, genetic potential and persistence) to annual recruitment of dwarf eelgrass in the German Wadden Sea using temporal sampling of seeds from the sediment and genetic assignment tests of seedlings to populations of adult shoots from previous years. Annual sediment seed density (SD) was 487. 5 m(- 2) (269. 4) and 367. 3 m(- 2) (95. 5) in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and distribution of seeds in the sediment was highly aggregated. The proportion of over-wintering seeds that germinated under laboratory conditions was 16 to 25 %, and field-germination revealed a 12 % survival to the seedling stage. Nearly 20 % of all shoots present in May 2004 were seedlings. Using 9 microsatellite loci, seedlings sampled in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were compared with adults sampled in 2002, 2003 and 2004; results revealed that 7 to 33 % of seedlings could be assigned to the local adult population in Current or previous years. Although new recruitment {{plays an important role}} in the maintenance of these meadows, considerable new <b>recruitment</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>within</b> the meadow., itself.

40|$|The larval {{ecology of}} a {{population}} of the tropical tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata was studied in a semi-enclosed lagoon {{on the island of}} Formentera (Mediterranean Sea). Due to the lagoon's isolation and processes of extinction/regeneration of the population, research was carried out to evaluate some aspects of the species' ecology which permit it to survive in this habitat. Settlement and recruitment were found to be intimately related to the period of sexual reproduction, and determined by the local production of larvae. In this sense, the population's spawning potential (larvae m(- 2)) matched a perfect linear relationship (R- 2 = 0. 9496, p < 0. 05) with the settlement and recruitment registered on experimental settlement surfaces. Of the larvae produced by the population 29 % settled locally, contributing to the consolidation of populations already established. Only 1. 3 % of the larval production theoretically calculated developed into colonies at a local level. To determine how Settlement site might contribute to the colonies' survival and thus to population distribution, zooids were transplanted from an appropriate zone to a stressful zone, which showed that there is a risk of inappropriate habitat selection for settlement. The behaviour of the larvae (philopatry) and gregarious settlement in unpredictable environments (spatio-temporally variable) seems advantageous to prevent advection to inappropriate sites. E. turbinata ensures local recruitment and renewal of the established population, but it seems that there is partial dispersal of larvae beyond the parent population. The study shows that there is sufficient <b>recruitment</b> <b>from</b> <b>within</b> the population to maintain it and the timing of larval production and recruitment strongly suggest that recruits are from the population itself...|$|E

We recorded emerged seedlings biweekly for 120 days and found a total of 124 species for the two treatments, the most abundant species were annual herbs (e. g., Richardia grandiflora and Euploca procumbens) and annual graminoids (e. g., Digitaria ciliaris and Cyperus haspan). Flooding positively influenced seedling richness and abundance, while seedling emergence from the non-flooded soil was slower, but continued during all periods. The different temporal patterns between treatments showed that flooding increases the abundance of emerged seedlings and acts as a trigger for explosive recruitment shortly after water depletion...|$|R
