40|$|Experiments have {{verified}} {{the observations}} of Corbett and White that people are more sensitive to flicker on <b>raster-scanned</b> <b>displays</b> (e. g., television and visual dis-play terminals) if the field scan direction is changed from the conventional top-to-bottom direction to bottom to top, left to right, or right to left. When measured {{by means of the}} flicker fusion frequency (FFF), this effect is present only when normal eye movements are permitted. With fixation, the FFF is similar for all scan direc-tions. The effect is demonstrated by the different frequencies at which a directional component is detected in the flicker (which we have called the rolling flicker thresh-old frequency, or RFTF); the RFTF is lower for top-to-bottom scanning. The effect {{does not appear to be}} associated with any asymmetry in eye movements or with eccentricity of the retinal image. The hypothesis that this difference is a conse-quence of adaptation to televisions and VDTs is supported by the observation that the effect's magnitude correlates with daily exposure time to televisions and VDTs and by a pilot study showing that the effect is reduced when one views a television scanned from bottom to top for 1 h...|$|R

C. system at the Architecture Machine Group in MIT's Department of Architecture. This research is involved with the development of a Spatial Data Management System. The programs are designed to allow a user to study and perform transformations from photographic to graphic images utilizing interactive, digital computer-based image processing techniques. The user is able to generate a photographic image on to a Ramtek RM- 9300 <b>raster-scan</b> <b>display</b> and then filter, infill, reduce, enlarge, change gray-scale values and operate a determinant function on the image in any desired order and/or combination to achieve the required transform. With reference to the Architecture Machine Group's Spatial Data Management System's requirements, particular emphasis is placed on the effect of miniaturization of images and the simulation of changing the image to 1 -bit per pixel resolution. The report initially gives an introduction to the field of image processing, explains the hardware configuration used, the software usage and concludes with a discussion of the programs and possible future developments.

5000|$|Peter B. Denes, a {{researcher}} at Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., installed a DDP-224 system around 1965 for use in speech research. It and a DDP-24 were used by Max Mathews, {{considered by many to}} be the founding father of computer music, to develop his GROOVE music system, as related by Professor Barry Vercoe in a 1999 MIT Media Lab interview. When asked to describe the first MIT experimental music studio, Prof. Vercoe replied, [...] "We began that work when I first arrived in 1971. The first studio we had was in the basement of Building 26, where we had a computer given to MIT by Max Mathews-the Honeywell DDP-24. Max initially developed his GROOVE system on this machine and was kind enough to give it to MIT when I joined the faculty." [...] The 3C DDP-24 used modules or cards called S-Pac’s. These S-Pac cards could be Flip-Flops, NAND gates, Bit Registers etc. and were housed in a DDP-24 S-Bloc card rack. An early <b>raster-scan</b> graphics <b>display</b> was developed for the computer system.|$|R
40|$|A dual axis, <b>raster-scanning</b> laser <b>display</b> {{based on}} a {{monolithic}} micromachined scanning mirror is presented. The scanner consists of a micromirror located {{at the end of}} a thermally actuated bimorph beam. The novelty of the device is that an "L"-shape cantilever, which is simultaneously excited at non-resonance (frame scanning) and at resonance (raster scanning), gives the two orthogonal angular motions. The high sensitivity of the thermal bimorph actuator allows a low frequency (nonresonant) movement of the scanner in one direction. The second orthogonal scanning direction is a resonance torsion motion. The micro-device has a raster scanning frequency varying from 1000 Hz to 5000 Hz depending on the geometry, and if combined with a 50 Hz frame signal, has a definition of up to 100 lines. Mechanical scan amplitudes over 15 degrees in two orthogonal directions have been achieved. The typical power consumption is 5 mW. In this paper, the resolution of the scanner is discussed which is limited by the diffraction from the 500 mum to 300 mum mirror and its flatness. The performance of the new device is demonstrated by projecting a two- dimensional image using a modulated laser diode and the two orthogonal mirror deflections...|$|R
40|$|In <b>raster-scan</b> CRT <b>display</b> systems, the {{luminous}} flux {{of a given}} pixel {{is affected by the}} preceding pixel along the raster direction. This spatial or adjacent pixel nonlinearity can adversely affect image quality. High contrast, high spatial frequency regions of an image will have wrong luminances. A simple lookup table (standard gamma correction) can not correct this nonlinearity. We measured the spatial nonlinearity under a variety of luminance conditions in two CRT displays. A model proposed by Mulligan and Stone 1 was used in a 5 parameter nonlinear regression to fit the data. Results show that the model fit our data very well. We employed a two-dimensional lookup table to compensate for the spatial nonlinearity. The new lookup table has two entries: the intended luminance of the current pixel and the actual voltage of the previous pixel. The output of the new lookup table is the adjusted voltage which compensates for the pixel interaction and gives the correct average luminance for that pixel. Psychophysical experiments show that at small pixel sizes (less than 0. 8 mm), the compensation results in a sharp accurate image. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{portable}} computers become more widespread, {{there is increasing}} need for lightweight, low-power, inexpensive video displays with high information content. Many established display technologies are useful for large-format displays, but do not satisfy the weight and power requirements of demanding portable display applications. Micromachined rasterscanning displays, however, look attractive for portable computing applications. We describe the operation of a <b>raster-scanning</b> full-motion video <b>display</b> constructed using surface micromachined mirrors. The 41 x 52 pixel display is interfaced directly to a computer video card. Display resolution is limited by dynamic deformation of the mirror surface. Mirror-scan irregularity is shown to be negligible compared to diffraction from the mirror aperture and dynamic deformation of the mirror surface. The linescan micromirror has been operated for more than 45 billion cycles with less than 1 % change in the mirror resonant frequency...|$|R

Baer, had initially had the idea in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set. Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the time, he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the [...] "Brown Box", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it went on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a <b>raster-scan</b> video <b>display,</b> or television set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial. It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including [...] "Table tennis", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on. The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of Pong. Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity.|$|R
