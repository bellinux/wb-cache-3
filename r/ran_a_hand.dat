5000|$|Known as {{a master}} of collography, Ayón perfected the {{technique}} by painstakingly attaching materials of widely differing textures (e.g.vegetable peelings, bits of paper, acrylic and abrasives) to a cardboard substrate. The resulting elaborate collage was then <b>run</b> through <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> cranked printing press She often painted or carved the resulting prints, creating intricate patterns and embossments that added even more depth and texture and relief. An example of her exceptional detail is (Untitled, (Sikan With Goat)) for which she cut and placed hundreds of pieces paper on cardboard to represent individual scales on a figure of Sikan. Her later work was very often large, almost human in scale. To create these prints she joined as many as 18 sheets together.|$|R

5000|$|The Panicky Guy [...] (April 1984-June 1984): Elliott {{would again}} {{pretend to be}} an {{audience}} member, who panics and runs from the studio at the slightest threat of danger (similar to doomed characters in disaster movies).

50|$|On Oct. 29, 1885, {{the first}} issue of the forerunner to the Medicine Hat News, the Times, was <b>run</b> off <b>a</b> tiny <b>hand</b> press. It’s not conclusive, but {{there are a number of}} people who are pretty sure that a boxcar {{embedded}} in a building at 525 North Railway St. is the site of the first building. Thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of two Ontarions, teacher Thomas Braden and printer Andrew Armour, Medicine Hat was home to a newspaper, a community booster, a voice for southeastern Alberta and a publication that residents of the area still turn to 125 years later to find out what’s happening in their backyard, their province, country and around the world.|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} years of the 1980s the Muslim Brotherhood and various other Islamist factions staged {{hit-and-run}} and bomb attacks against the government and its officials, including a nearly successful attempt to assassinate President Hafez al-Assad on 26 June 1980, during an official state reception for the president of Mali. When a machine-gun salvo missed him, al-Assad allegedly <b>ran</b> to kick <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> grenade aside, and his bodyguard (who survived and was later promoted to a much higher position) smothered the explosion of another one. Surviving with only light injuries, al-Assad's revenge was swift and merciless: only hours later a large number of imprisoned Islamists (reports say more than 1200) were executed in their cells in Tadmor Prison (near Palmyra), by units loyal to the President's brother Rifaat al-Assad.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1977, fully {{automatic}} timing (FAT) - which is accurate to 1/100 {{of a second}} and shows hand timing to be approximately {{a quarter of a}} second too generous to a sprinter over 100m - was not required for IAAF official timings. Official conversion of hand times to FAT as per IAAF protocol adds 0.24s to the official hand time for 100m. Therefore, an athlete would be required to <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> time of 9.75 or better to be credited with a sub-10 seconds run; something which was never achieved. [...] Rather, times were recorded manually to one tenth of a second; three official timers with stopwatches noted when the starting gun flashed and when the runner crossed the finish line, and their median recorded time was the official mark. Some races also had an unofficial FAT, or semi-automatic time, often in conjunction with photo finish equipment. The first person timed at under ten seconds was Bob Hayes, who ran 9.9 s in April 1963 at the Mt. SAC Relays with an illegal following wind of 11 mph. Hayes clocked another illegal 9.9 s (wind 5.3 m/s) in the semi-final of the 1964 Olympic 100 m, with the first sub-10 FAT of 9.91 s. In the final, Hayes' official tenths time of 10.0 s was calculated by rounding down the FAT of 10.06 s; the backup hand-timers recorded 9.8, 9.9, and 9.9, which would have given 9.9 s as the official time if the FAT had malfunctioned.At the 1968 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships at Charles C. Hughes Stadium in Sacramento, California, United States, three men ran legal hand-timed 9.9 seconds: Jim Hines first and Ronnie Ray Smith second in the first semi-final, and Charlie Greene first in the second semi-final. This was dubbed the [...] "Night of Speed", and all three were recognised as world records by the IAAF. The IAAF lists their FATs as: Hines 10.03, Smith 10.14 and Greene 10.10; although Time magazine reported at the time that [...] "an automatic Bulova Accutron Phototimer confirmed that all three had indeed broken 10.0s". [...] Hines also had a wind-assisted 9.8 s in the heats. Hines {{went on to win the}} 1968 Olympic 100m in 9.9 s, rounded down from his FAT of 9.95, making it the first non-wind-assisted electronic sub-10-second performance. By 1976, six other men had equalled the 9.9 s hand-timed record, though none of their performances had an FAT mark.|$|R
6000|$|Presently the {{strained}} {{vacuum of}} Jean's ears vibrated {{to a low}} roar of many hoofs. It came from the open valley, along the slope to the south.

Then hauling on his boots and slipping into his coat Jean took his rifle and stole out into the open. Shepp appeared to be well trained, for it was evident that he had a strong natural tendency to run off and hunt for whatever had roused him. Jean thought it more than likely that the dog scented an animal of some kind. If there were men prowling around the ranch Shepp, might have been just as vigilant, but it seemed to Jean that the dog would have shown less eagerness to leave him, or none at all.|$|R
