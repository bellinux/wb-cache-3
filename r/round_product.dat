40|$|Reducing {{the power}} {{dissipation}} of parallel multipliers {{is important in}} the design of digital signal processing systems.

Certain ‘difficult to machine’ materials like titanium, stainless steels, and exotic high-nickel alloys can be challenging to process when high stock removal is the goal, due to local heat generation at the cutting edge and the difficulty in removing it. These challenges can be mitigated, however, by strategies such as high-volume flood coolant, specialized cutting tool geometries, optimized speed and feed settings, and tool coatings like AlTiCN which tend to divert heat into the chip, away from the cutting tool.|$|R

Journal of Animal Science, 94 (11), 4943 - 4958. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2016 - 0894 The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of brand and product identification on consumer palatability ratings of ground beef patties. Six treatments were used in the study: 90 / 10 Certified Angus Beef (CAB) ground sirloin, 90 / 10 ground beef, 80 / 20 CAB ground chuck, 80 / 20 ground chuck, 80 / 20 ground beef, and 73 / 27 CAB ground beef. Ground beef was processed into 151. 2 -g patties using a patty former with 2 consecutively formed patties assigned to blind consumer testing and the following 2 assigned to informed testing. Following cooking to 74 degrees C, patties were cut into quarters and served to consumers. Consumers (n = 112) evaluated samples in 2 rounds for tenderness, juiciness, flavor liking, texture liking, and overall liking. Each trait was also rated as either acceptable or unacceptable. In the first round of testing, samples were blind evaluated, with no information about the treatments provided to consumers, but in the second <b>round,</b> <b>product</b> type and brand were disclosed prior to sample evaluation. Additionally, texture profile and shear force analyses were performed on patties from each treatment. Few differences were observed for palatability traits during blind consumer testing; however, during informed testing, 90 / 10 CAB ground sirloin was rated greatest (P < 0. 05) for all palatability traits other than juiciness. Also, 90 / 10 CAB ground sirloin had increased (P < 0. 05; (consumer informed score -consumer blind score) /consumer blind score) ratings for tenderness (17. 4 %), juiciness (36. 5 %), flavor liking (23. 3 %), texture liking (18. 2 %), and overall liking (24. 7 %) due to brand disclosure. Increased (P < 0. 05) ratings were found for CAB products for multiple traits due to treatment disclosure, whereas the only non-CAB-branded product that received increased (P < 0. 05) ratings during informed testing was 90 / 10 ground beef for tenderness and juiciness. Texture results indicated that decreased fat level increased hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness. These results indicate that when sampling ground beef without brand and product information, few consumers find differences in eating quality among ground beef treatments; however, when consumers are aware of the brand, fat level, and subprimal blend prior to sampling, these factors have a large impact on consumer eating satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Our {{objective}} is to explore and demonstrate the critical link between innovation and employment for firms {{before and during the}} recession. We investigate different types of innovation and their associated impact on regional employment growth rates in the UK using panel data of regions during the period 2004 - 2009. Prior Work: Recent research at the regional level, suggests a clear positive impact of new firm formation on employment growth rates (Reynolds, 1994, 1999; Acs and Armington, 2004) and self-employment rates (Foelster, 2000; Brixy and Grotz, 2004). Our research extends the scope of such work on two fronts. We first examine the innovative dimensions of entrepreneurial activities (i. e. product innovation, process innovation, organisational innovation and geographic extent of innovation collaborations) in firms and their association with high employment growth rates at the regional level. Second, we compare the differential impact of various types of innovation on employment before and during the current economic recession. Approach: We use three sources of data. We use the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for the six year period 2004 to 2009 with the sample used in this study being stratified by UK regions (9 Government Office Regions in England). Our second source of data is NOMIS, from which we derive employment creation and VAT registration data. The employment rate data for UK regions was taken from the official Eurostat database. Following the methodology developed by Acs and Armington (2004), the regional growth differences are analysed by taking into account the employment in the specific region and this analysis employs two different measures of employment the employment rate and employment compound annual growth rate. Entrepreneurial activity is proxied by two measures, total employees and VAT registrations as the official guide to the pattern of business start-ups in the UK. To account for high growth potential of specific regions, the effect of human capital is included {{in the form of the}} number of residents with NVQ level 4 or above in total population. We distinguish our model by including different types of firm innovation as explanatory factors. Results: We find that there are wide variations across regions for different types of innovation. Our results show that product innovation was the dominant innovation strategy both prior and during the economic crisis, while significantly fewer firms invested in process and wider (management) innovations Implications: Our findings have critical implications for policy especially in inclement economic conditions. The importance of product innovation suggests that firms are keen to distinguish their goods and services rather than rely solely on incremental forms of innovation. The downturn acts as an impetus for change. Innovation policy can be effective if it takes into account demand side behaviour and practice. For firms, good practice in a recessionary climate centred <b>round</b> <b>product</b> innovation can yield better prospects for the up turn when that occurs Value: Our work adds value to the existing literature on entrepreneurship development at the regional level through its specific focus on innovation. It enhances existing methodological devices to measure the impact of innovation on employment by introducing new variables. Finally, the findings should assist policy makers in determining effective regional policy for both employment and innovation...|$|E

Meanwhile producer prices have failed {{to keep pace with}} increases in the price of beef received by wholesalers and retailers, resulting in concerns being raised about market power being exercised in the beef industry by stakeholders. ^ This study uses marketing margins to determine what factors affect margins, test for differences among different procurement methods of purchasing cattle, and test for differences among different cuts of beef. This paper extends previous research providing more detail regarding the factors that may effect margins and differentiating by not just looking at aggregate margins between producers and wholesalers, and wholesalers and retailers. ^ The results suggest that for margins between wholesalers and retailers industry concentration measures do appear to have statistically significant effect on margins for some products. While an increase in wholesaler concentration does not appear to contribute to increases in producer wholesaler margins. Likewise due to this insignificance, cost efficiencies achieved from this strategy may be exhausted. Evidence indicates that cost variables do have an effect on margins between wholesalers and retailers although, the magnitude of their effect on margins may be linked to the value US consumers place on different cuts. For instance, low value cuts such as ground beef were more sensitive to a change in diesel prices compared to higher value cuts such as steak rounds. While four-firm concentration ratios were significant for products such as ground beef and steak, they are not significant for round roast or steak <b>round</b> <b>products.</b> ...|$|R
