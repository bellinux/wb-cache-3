40|$|Abstract. Silvicultural {{treatments}} alter fuel {{dynamics in}} forested systems, which may alter fire regime. Effects of thinning and prescribed fire on forest-floor fuels were studied in mixed-oak forests of south-eastern Ohio to examine fuel dynamics over time. Fuel characteristics were measured before, immediately after, and 3 years following fire and thinning treatments along 20 -m transects (n = 432) following Brown’s planar intersect method. Measurements {{were taken to}} determine litter, duff, 1 -h, 10 -h, 100 -h, and 1000 -h sound (1000 S) or rotten (1000 <b>R)</b> <b>fuel</b> mass. Coarse woody debris (CWD) was sampled on 432 additional 80 -m 2 belt-transects. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with post-hoc Bonferonni comparisons was used to analyse {{the change in the}} fuels over time. The specific effects of silvicultural treatments varied over time with changes in larger, sound fuels (1000 S and CWD) persisting longer than changes to finer (litter, duff, 1 -h, 10 -h, and 100 -h) or less-sound (1000 <b>R)</b> <b>fuels,</b> which appear to be more transient. Unlike in western North America where fuels accumulate over time, decomposition and productivity appear comparable in eastern mixed-oak forests.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the chemical reactions that may occur at the fuel- clad interfaces of fuel elements used in advanced gas-coooled reactors (A. G. R.) The initial investigation involved {{a study of the}} inner surfaces of irradiated stainless steel clad and evidence was obtained to show that fission products, in particular tellerium, were associated with reaction products on these surfaces. An accelerated rate of oxidation was observed on the inner surfaces of a failed A. G. <b>R.</b> <b>fuel</b> pin. It is believed that fission product caesium was responsible for this enhancement. A fundamental study of the reaction between 20 %Cr/ 25 %Ni/niobium stabilised stainless steel and tellerium was then undertaken over the range 350 - 850 degrees C. Reaction occurred with increasing rapidity over this range and long term exposure at ≤ 750 degrees resulted in intergranular attack of the stainless steel and chromium depletion. The reaction on unoxidised steel surfaces involved the formation of an initial iron-nickel-tellerium layer which subsequently transformed to a chromium telluride product during continued exposure. The thermodynamic stabilities of the steel tellurides were determined to be chromium telluride > nickel telluride > iron telluride. Oxidation of the stainless steel surface prior to tellerium exposure inhibited the reaction. However reaction did occur in regions where the oxide layer had either cracked or spalled...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} a 12 -cylinder V-type liquid-cooled aircraft engine of 1710 -cubic-inch displacement to determine the minimum specific fuel consumption at constant cruising engine speed and compression ratios of 6. 65, 7. 93, and 9. 68. At each compression ratio, the effect. of the following variables was investigated at manifold pressures of 28, 34, 40, and 50 inches of mercury absolute: temperature of the inlet-air to the auxiliary-stage supercharger, fuel-air ratio, and spark advance. Standard sea-level atmospheric pressure was maintained at the auxiliary-stage supercharger inlet and the exhaust pressure was atmospheric. Advancing the spark timing from 34 deg and 28 deg B. T. C.

Further decreases in brake specific fuel consumption of 10. 5 to 14. 1 percent (depending on power level) were observed as the compression ratio was increased from 6. 65 to 9. 68, maintaining at each compression ratio the spark advance required for maximum torque at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 06.

40|$|Complement and the kallikrein–kinin cascade {{system are}} both {{activated}} in injured tissues. Little {{is known about}} their partnership in the immunopathogenesis of Chagas disease, the chronic infection caused by the intracellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, we show that pharmacological targeting of the C 5 a receptor (C 5 aR) or the bradykinin B 2 receptor (B 2 R) inhibited plasma leakage in hamster cheek pouch topically exposed to tissue culture trypomastigotes (TCTs). Further, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors potentiated TCT-evoked paw edema in BALB/c, C 57 BL/ 6, and C 5 -deficient A/J mice through activation of joint pathways between C 5 aR/B 2 R or C 3 aR/B 2 R. In addition to generation of C 5 a and kinins via parasite-derived cruzipain, we demonstrate that macrophages internalize TCTs more efficiently through joint activation of C 5 aR/B 2 R. Furthermore, we found that C 5 aR targeting markedly reduces NO production and intracellular parasitism in macrophages. We then studied the impact of C 5 aR/B 2 R cross-talk in TCT infection {{on the development of}} adaptive immunity. We found that IL- 12 p 40 / 70 expression was blunted in splenic dendritic cells by blocking either C 5 aR or B 2 R, suggesting that codominant signaling via C 5 aR and B 2 <b>R</b> <b>fuels</b> production of the Th 1 -polarizing cytokine. Finally, we assessed the impact of kinins and C 5 a liberated in parasite-laden tissues on Th cell differentiation. As predicted, BALB/c mice pretreated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors potentiated IFN-γ production by Ag-specific T cells via C 5 aR/B 2 R cross-talk. Interestingly, we found that B 2 R targeting upregulated IL- 10 secretion, whereas C 5 aR blockade vigorously stimulated IL- 4 production. In summary, we describe a novel pathway by which C 5 aR/B 2 R cross-talk couples transendothelial leakage of plasma proteins to the cytokine circuitry that coordinates antiparasite immunity...|$|R

In September 2010, 32 of the fuel assemblies in the core of reactor R 3 were mixed-oxide (UO 2 + PuO 2) MOX fuel (IAEA 2011) totaling about 5. 5 tons. The other assemblies were uranium oxide fuels, UO 2 (named UOX fuels). The spent fuel storage tank...|$|R
40|$|Olive mill {{wastewater}} sludge (OMWS) is {{the solid}} residue that {{remains in the}} evaporation ponds after evaporation {{of the majority of}} water in the olive mill wastewater (OMW). OMWS is a major environmental pollutant in the olive oil producing regions. Approximately 41. 16 wt. % of the OMWS was soluble in hexanes (HSF). The fatty acids in this fraction consist mainly of oleic and palmitic acid. Catalytic pyrolysis of the OMWS over red mud and HZSM- 5 has been demonstrated to be an effective technology for converting this waste material into <b>fuel.</b> <b>Red</b> mud-catalyzed pyrolysis gave higher organics yields than the HZSM- 5 catalysis. The viscosity as well as the oxygen content of the catalytic pyrolysis oils were significantly lower than those of the non-catalytic oil. The reaction pathways of red mud and HZSM- 5 were different. The catalytic pyrolysis of the HSF gave an acidic oil with low viscosity and high energy content, and was nitrogen and sulfur free, whereas the catalytic pyrolysis of the solid residue after hexanes extraction (SR) gave an oil with higher viscosity, close to neutral pH, lower energy content, and had high nitrogen content and traces of sulfur...|$|R
40|$|One {{of several}} options being {{considered}} by the United States and the Russian Federation for the disposition of excess plutonium from dismantled weapons is to convert it to mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel for use in Canadian uranium-deuterium (CANDU) reactors. This report describes an irradiation test demonstrating the feasibility of this concept with laboratory quantities of MOX fuel placed in the pressurized loops of the National Research Universal test reactor at the Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Chalk River Laboratories. The objective of the Parallex (for parallel experiment) test is to simultaneously test laboratory-produced quantities of US and <b>R.</b> F. MOX <b>fuel</b> in a test reactor under heat generation rates representing those expected in the CANDU reactors. The MOX fuel will be produced with plutonium from disassembled weapons at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States and at the Bochvar Institute in the Russian Federation. Thus, the test will serve to demonstrate the accomplishment of {{many parts of the}} disposition mission: disassembly of weapons, conversion of the plutonium to oxide, fabrication of MOX fuel, assembly of fuel elements and bundles, shipment to a reactor, irradiation, and finally, storage of the spent fuel elements awaiting eventual disposition in a geologic repository in Canada...|$|R
