The Product Library is responsible for the management and long-term preservation of digital earth observation products. It encapsulates all details of storing product data and offers standard client functionality to search, insert, update and delete products as well as advanced features for storage administration such as <b>relocating</b> <b>products</b> within the archive and related preservation management tasks...|$|R
40|$|We study {{innovation}} in a dynamic stochastic discrete-time duopoly with endogenous horizontal differentiation. Innovation {{takes the form}} of a quality ladder; horizontal differentiation is Hotelling competition. We compute Markov-perfect equilibria and study the effects on long-run innovation of changes in taste heterogeneity (transport costs) and firms' costs of <b>relocating</b> <b>products.</b> Innovation rises as the industry's long-run position moves toward products that are permanently co-located in the space of horizontal tastes. A large enough fall in taste heterogeneity will raise long-run innovation, while more costly product relocation lowers innovation if taste heterogeneity is high, and raises it otherwise. Dynamic duopoly Markov-perfect equilibrium Innovation Horizontal differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Existing theory poorly {{describes}} the product diversity {{in a modern}} market economy largely because such theory is founded on an inadequate concept of equilibrium. Standard analysis regards decision makers as naive in their anticipations of the response of rivals to their decisions and neglects the substantial costs of <b>relocating</b> in the <b>product</b> characteristic space. In this paper, we construct an equilibrium model of firms in which each firm locates in sequence with correct expectations of the way its decisions influence the decisions of firms yet to locate. The nature of the equilibrium is explored {{in a series of}} familiar examples taken from the literature. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Chinese garment export sector. The Chinese garment {{industry has been}} an economic pillar ever since the open-door policy and economic reforms of the country took effect in 1979. Earnings from apparel exports {{have been a major}} source of foreign revenue. The industry has thus developed and played a vital role in the growth of China?s foreign trade and economic development although some signs of slackened vigour have been revealed recently. To assess the threats and opportunities China?s export clothing industry is facing, this paper identifies and {{analyzes the}} drivers of demand, key sources of advantage for exporting apparel manufacturers, and the strength of key industry forces. Based on this analysis, the paper offers several recommendations for Chinese exporting enterprises to enhance their competitive position against not only international competitors, but also domestic competitors. Specifically, these recommendations include increasing the added-value of the <b>products,</b> <b>relocating</b> the production base and exploring domestic and new markets...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{industries}} in the United States either began or were influenced by the city. After beginning the tire and rubber industry during the 20th century with the founding of Goodrich, Firestone, General Tire, also the Goodyear merger with The Kelly-Springfield Tire Company gained the status of, [...] "Rubber Capital of the World". Akron has won economic awards such as for City Livability and All-American City, and deemed a high tech haven greatly contributing to the Information Age. Current Fortune 500 companies headquartered in the city include the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and FirstEnergy. In addition, the city is the headquarters {{to a number of}} other notable companies such as GOJO, Advanced Elastomer Systems, Huntington Bank (formerly known as FirstMerit Corporation), Myers Industries, Acme Fresh Market and Sterling Jewelers. Goodyear, America's biggest tire manufacturer and the fifth-largest private employer in Summit County, recently built a new world headquarters in the city. The project, Akron Riverwalk, will feature a large retail and commercial development area. The project began in 2007, but was put on hold because of the financial crisis of 2007-2010, and is now continuing. Bridgestone built a new technical center with state-of-the-art R&D labs, and <b>relocated</b> its <b>product</b> development operations to the new facility in early 2012. The Eastern Ohio Division of KeyBank, which has six branches in the city, built a regional headquarters downtown. The city has a free WiFi corridor centered in downtown. Neighborhoods in range include Goodyear Heights, East Akron, North Hill, Firestone Park, Kenmore, and West Akron.|$|R
40|$|Processes of {{intensification}} {{lead to some}} unforeseen consequences. One such unplanned {{consequence is}} the rearrangement of existing buildings in new or revised spatial patterns. In pursuit of higher densities, large lot suburban development inherited from previous generations – the quarter-acre section - is “intensified” by cross-leasing rear gardens. The site frequently has greater commercial value than the existing buildings. Where the existing house is below the value expected by the market a house mover can be contracted to saw the building into sections, and truck it away to another, lower value site. In larger developments several houses may be shifted off a site to clear space for higher density new housing. Houses subjected to this rearrangement are known as “re-locatables”. They are displayed in “relocatables yards”, from which they can be purchased for re-use elsewhere. The practice is known in other countries where timber frame construction is a standard house-building method, but {{is thought to be}} a more popular habit in New Zealand, where up to 10 % of the annual housing supply is affected by moving buildings. There are casualties in this process including historical reliability of the urban landscape; but there is also an argument in favour, since analysis shows that the practice of re-cycling has merit as a sustainable building supply methodology. This paper explores the increasingly temporary nature of the built environment in New Zealand’s cities: the temporary reality of suburbia as a phenomenon of, on one hand, a socio-cultural disinterest in permanence of place, and on the other, a building culture of light-weight construction that can readily <b>relocate</b> its <b>products...</b>|$|R
30|$|The ketone {{group of}} the {{substrates}} has a trigonal planar configuration, with C-C-O and C-C-C bond angles of about 120 ˚. Therefore, the superimposition of the ketone group (C-CO-C) of 3 -quinuclidinone to that of tropinone can be limited to two patterns, which are related by a 180 ° rotation about the carbonyl C-O bond axis (Figure  4 a and b). The reaction is achieved through the proton transfer to the carbonyl group of a substrate from the catalytic residue tyrosine, and through the nucleophilic attack of the hydride of NADPH on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate. Thereby, the hydroxyl {{group of the}} <b>product</b> <b>relocates</b> to the side opposite that of the nicotinamide ring. The geometry presented in Figure  4 a agrees with the catalytic reaction of RrQR, producing (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol from 3 -quinuclidinone. On the other hand, the geometry in Figure  4 b results {{in the production of}} another stereoisomer, (S)- 3 -quinuclidinol, which does not agree with the catalytic reaction of RrQR. The enzyme RrQR produces only (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol. Thus we describe the geometry in Figure  4 a as a catalytic model and that in Figure  4 b as a noncatalytic model.|$|R
