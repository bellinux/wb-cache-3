40|$|The {{custom of}} voluntarily tipping for {{services}} rendered has gone {{in and out}} of fashion in America since its introduction in the 19 th century. <b>Restaurant</b> <b>owners</b> that ban tipping in their establishments often claim that social justice drives their decisions, but we show that rational profit-maximization may also justify the decisions. Here, we propose a conceptual model of restaurant competition for staff and customers, and we show that there exists a critical conventional tip rate at which <b>restaurant</b> <b>owners</b> should eliminate tipping to maximize profit. Because the conventional tip rate has been increasing steadily for the last several decades, our model suggests that <b>restaurant</b> <b>owners</b> may abandon tipping en masse when that critical tip rate is reached.

40|$|Alamar and Glantz {{interpret}} {{smoking in}} restaurants as a market failure, and {{they claim that}} restaurants should welcome government laws that disallow smoking in all restaurants. Contrary to their claims, <b>restaurant</b> <b>owners</b> do {{have an incentive to}} eliminate smoking if doing so raises the value of their restaurants. In restaurants, smokers do not impose negative externalities on non-smokers because <b>restaurant</b> <b>owners</b> have well-defined property rights that cause them to internalize {{the costs and benefits of}} smoking. Alamar and Glantz claim to show that non-smoking ordinances increase the capital value of restaurants, but their own data do not, in fact, show that.
