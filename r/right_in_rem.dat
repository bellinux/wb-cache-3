2500|$|Property law governs {{ownership}} and possession. Real property, sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership {{of land and}} things attached to it. Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> is {{a right to a}} specific piece of property, contrasting to a right in personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [...] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of possession in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.|$|E

50|$|Ius in re, or jus in re, under civil law, more {{commonly}} referred to as a real right or <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem,</b> is a right in property, known as an interest under common law. A real right vests in a person with respect to property, inherent in his relation to it, and is good against the world (erga omnes). The primary real right is ownership (dominium) (freehold, leasehold, commonhold). Whether possession (possessio) is recognized as a real right, or merely as a source of certain powers and actions, depends on the legal system at hand. Subordinate or limited real rights generally refer to encumbrances, rights of use and security interests. The term <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> is derived from the action given to its holder, an actio in rem. In Latin grammar the action against the thing demands a fourth case. The underlying right itself, Ius in re, has a fifth case, as the right rests on, or burdens, the thing. By mistake the common law terminology now uses the fourth case for describing the right itself. Compare jus ad rem.|$|E

50|$|The {{differences}} between the two forms of medieval ownership - the fief and the allod - diminished over time. Firstly, vassals were no longer required to render services from the 17th century at the latest, and vassals’ rights of inheritance became much stronger in the early modern period, and, secondly, the territorial princes were able to force freemen in the 16th century to make regular tax payments. In the 19th century, feudal law was finally gradually abolished in most European countries largely due to the Napoleonic wars and the influence of the Napoleonic Code. It fully integrated the ius commune system of ownership as a full <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem.</b> While in France the régime féodal was ended in 1789 by the stroke of the pen under the Revolutionary legislature, in Germany {{it was not until the}} mid-20th century that feudal law was formally abolished in 1947 by Allied Control Council law. In most of Scotland, the feudal system was abolished in the early 21st century; allodial tenure still exists in Shetland and Orkney.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, Unidroit {{has chosen}} to {{harmonise}} {{only a part of}} the [...] "substantive law" [...] on securities. Indeed, certain proprietary aspects concerning securities are governed in too different ways by the negotiating states.

Such distinction, academic based more than case law-based, is not so important in usual times, but becomes crucial when an insolvency procedure is open against the intermediary. In countries where the first interpretation prevails, the investor shall dispose of a right to [...] "rivindicate" [...] (claim as one's own) which will allow him a speedy recover of the securities. In countries where the second interpretation prevails (the US and, to a certain extent the recourse to trust deposits in common law countries), the investor would only dispose of a right of claim, that will oblige him, except when the contrary is specified, to share with other creditors of the insolvent intermediary the product of the winding up of the intermediary in prorate {{of the value of the}} security.|$|E

5000|$|Land law is {{also known}} as the law of real property. It relates to the acquisition, {{protection}} and conflicts of people's rights, legal and equitable, in land. This means three main things. First, [...] "property rights" [...] (in Latin, a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem)</b> are generally said to bind third parties, whereas personal rights (a right in personam) are exercisable only against the person who owes an obligation. English law acknowledges a fixed number, or numerus clausus of property rights, which create various privileges. The main situations where this distinction matters are if a debtor to two or more creditors has gone insolvent (i.e. bankrupt), or if there is a dispute over possession of a specific thing. If a person or a business has gone insolvent, and has things in their possession which are the property of others', then those people can usually take back their property free of anyone else's claims. But if an insolvent person's creditors are merely owed personal debts, they cannot take back their money freely: any losses have to be divided among all creditors. Often, creditors can contract for a proprietary right (known as a security interest) to secure repayment of debts. This gives the same result as having another proprietary right, so the secured creditor takes priority in the insolvency queue. Secured creditors, most usually, are banks and for most people the most familiar kind of security interest is a mortgage. In this way, property rights area always [...] "stronger" [...] than personal rights, even though they may be acquired by the same means: a contract. Most of the time, property rights are also stronger than personal because English courts have been historically more willing to order specific performance as a remedy for interference with property rights. People with personal rights, such as to the performance of a contract, are presumptively entitled to money in compensation, unless damages would be an inadequate remedy. In its second main feature, English land law differs from civil law systems in the European Union, because it allows the separation of the [...] "beneficial" [...] ownership of property from legal title to property. If there is a [...] "trust" [...] of land, then trustees hold legal title, while the benefit, use and [...] "equitable" [...] title might belong to many other people. Legal title to real property can only be acquired in a limited number of formal ways, while equitable title can be recognised because of a person's contribution, or the parties' true intentions, or some other reason, if the law deems that it is fair and just (i.e. equitable) to recognise that someone else has a stake in the land.|$|E

The uncertain legal nature of dead human body and separated body parts hinders accurate regulation of the matter in civil law. While living human body is generally seen as an integral part of the personality, there are two ways in which dead human body is looked upon. One considers it as an integral part of personality, which cannot be separated even after death. The other connects the personality strictly to the ability of thinking and acting. Thus the body becomes a subject upon the death. Synthesis of these approaches finds the regime of dead human body depending on the sort of disposal.

If we compare {{the relationship between the}} builder and the owner of the land before and after the end of 2013, that is, if we compare the two opposing principles of superficies non solo cedit and superficies solo cedit, we can clearly see the primacy of the latter approach to land ownership. The scholastic debate about the stage at which building becomes a thing in a legal sense is irrelevant, because from the beginning it is either part of the land, or part of the superficiary right of building conceived here as an immovable thing.

40|$|The fact of {{possession}} {{has been so}} correlated with the theory of property {{that it is difficult}} to dissociate ownership from the possibility of physical possession. One finds that the average lawyer, even though he may defind a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> as a right enforcible against any person, is extremely apt, unless after especial thought, to explain that it is enforcible against anyone because it pertains to a thing capable of physical possession and control, a thing that could be actually sequestered, from all other persons. Not at all infrequently the term property has been judicially stripped even of its significance of a right, and confined to the objective material thing to which the right might apply. As a matter of fact, comparatively few things have ever been legally recognized as the object of property which have not been tangible. The right to one 2 ̆ 7 s reputation, and, more lately recognized, the right to privacy, for instance, are rights in rem, although incapable of tangible possession. The right to have a contract performed without interference by a third party and, it has been said, the right created by assignment of a chose in action, are equally rights in rem. These, and other res, are mere concepts, in no sense whatever corporeal, although the rights concerning them so appertain to the particular person in whose favor they exist as to be truly property rights, and correctly said to be owned by him. But the whole number of these is small compared to the quantity of tangible things which are the subject of property, and even these rights are not usually spoken of, even judicially, in terms of property, as are those pertaining to tangible things...|$|E
40|$|Rules in English law {{regarding}} {{transfer of}} rights {{with respect to}} land and movables can generally fit into {{the framework of the}} abstract system. As a default rule throughout English property law, a separate stage of conveyance is necessary to complete the transfer of title, although in cases of unconditional sale of ascertained goods, it is possible to transfer title by the transferor’s intent alone. A study of the Sale of Goods Acts and detinue demonstrates that the contract of sale itself has never been a means of conveyance throughout English legal history. No matter whether a conveyance is made by solo consensu or by additional means, a separate intent to convey remains distinct from the intent to bargain. So long as the conveyance is valid according to its own rules, invalidating factors in the underlying basis of that conveyance in principle do not infect the validity of the conveyance itself. Revesting of title by rescinding the contract of sale induced by fraudulent misrepresentation is an exception, but the underlying rationale in those cases is flawed. From a normative perspective, the alleged ‘unfairness’ to the transferor under extreme circumstances is not self-evident. Arguments such as ‘initial impaired consent subtraction’ or ‘assumption of insolvency risk plus swollen assets’ might serve as possible ways to determine such ‘unfairness’. Nonetheless, these arguments remain problematic if employed to justify the need for causality. A unique characteristic of English law is that in certain impaired consent transfer cases, although title transferred cannot revest at law, equity may grant a right under a constructive trust with numerous proprietary attributes. However, this is nevertheless consistent with the operation of the English abstract system, for such an equitable interest acquired by the transferor, unlike what he could acquire under a causal system, is by its nature not a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem.</b> With these observations, English law could provide at least three lessons for the ongoing debate in Chinese academia about whether Chinese law should adopt the principles of separation and abstraction.

40|$|In this Essay, {{we offer}} an {{integrated}} theory {{of intellectual property}} defenses. We demonstrate that all intellectual property defenses can be fitted into three conceptual categories: general, individualized and class defenses. A general defense is the inverse of a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem.</b> It goes to {{the validity of the}} intellectual property right asserted by the plaintiff, and when raised successfully it relieves not only the actual defendant, but also the public at large, of the duty to comply with the plaintiff’s intellectual property right. An individualized defense, as we define it, is the inverse of an in personam right: it helps a defendant who raises it to fend off the infringement claim against her, but leaves the plaintiff’s right intact, and hence allows the plaintiff to assert it against other defendants. Class defenses form an in-between category. They can be analogized to inverse quasi-property rights in that they create an immunity zone for a certain group of users. However, group defenses do not act to invalidate the right of the plaintiff and thus the benefit to the public from a successful showing of a class defense is more limited than that arising from the vindication of general defenses. Based on this taxonomy, we show that society has a special interest in the successful raising of class and especially general defenses, as those defenses help clear the path of invalid intellectual property rights and thereby facilitate future innovation, creativity and competition. Yet, because defendants do not capture the full social benefit associated with class and general defenses, they will not invest the socially optimal level of resources in raising and litigating such defenses. As a result, some defendants will be defeated in court, while others will agree to a settlement that will keep general and class defenses unrealized to society’s detriment. As we show, this problem is exacerbated by the fact that intellectual property owners will tend to target defendants who have no wherewithal to litigate. To remedy this problem, we propose a procedural solution designed to achieve a better alignment between the private interest of intellectual property defendants and that of society at large: voluntary joinder of defendants. Specifically, we would allow defendants who raise class or general defenses to implead other potential defendants. Impleaded parties would be at liberty to decline the invitation to join. However, declining the invitation would subject the impleaded parties to one of two mechanisms. We dub the first the “preclusion mechanism” and the second the “restitution mechanism. ” Under the “preclusion mechanism,” impleaded defendants would be able to opt out instead of joining in, but if the class or general defense asserted by the actual defendant failed, they would be precluded from asserting a general or class defense in their future litigation against the same plaintiff. The impleaded defendants would thus be incentivized to form an alliance that would face the infringement suit together. Under the “restitution mechanism”—which we ultimately endorse—impleaded parties who chose to opt out would not partake of the litigation, but should the actual defendant(s) successfully raise a class or general defense, they have to pay their fair share of the cost of raising the defense as they, too, benefit from the effort...|$|E

In this case, there must be a reasonable connection between the jurisdiction chosen and the controversy. The scope of the application of the international jurisdiction guidelines over contractual matters excludes the following: legal relationships between bankrupt entities/individuals and their creditors and any other analogous proceedings (especially concordatas composition with creditors); matters under agreements involving family and succession law; social security contracts; administrative contracts; employment contracts; consumer sales contracts; transport contracts; insurance policies; and <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem.</b>|$|R
40|$|Potestative {{rights are}} still {{representing}} an exotic category of subjective civil rights. We {{are saying that}} it represents an exotic category because, although in practice they are frequently encountered, the theoretical approaches regarding their general legal regime are extremely limited. Therefore, {{in the present study}} we will focus on identifying the characteristic features of potestative rights, as well as highlighting the similarities and differences between these rights and other categories of civil subjective rights. From this point of view, we will focus on the similarities and differences between potestive rights and debt and <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>rights,</b> concluding that potestative rights are a category of intermediate rights, as it lends specific features from both, debt and <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem.</b> Also, starting from the potestative rights definition provided by the schoolars, we will analyze, one at a time, their defining elements and explain how these characteristic elements should be understood. Therefore, we will focus on the defining elements of potestative rights, namely: (i) the power of the potentior to change a legal situation involving the interests of another person; (ii) the bond of obedience; and (iii) the specific object...|$|R
