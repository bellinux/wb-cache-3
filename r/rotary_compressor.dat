50|$|Most {{compressors}} {{are either}} positive displacement compressors or radial compressors. Positive displacement compressors are currently {{the most efficient}} type of compressor, and have the largest refrigerating effect per single unit (400-2500 RT). They have a large range of possible power supplies, and can be 380 V, 1000 V, or even higher. The principle behind positive displacement compressors utilizes a turbine to compress refrigerant into high-pressure vapor. Positive displacement compressors are of four main types: screw compressor, rolling piston compressor, reciprocating compressor, and <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor.</b>|$|E

Lately, new researches were carried out by four researchers led by Dr. Gilles Saint-Hilaire, a thermonuclear physicist, consisting of members of his immediate family. The original objective was to make a turbo-shaft turbine engine where the compressor portion and the power portion would be in the same plane. In order to achieve this, they had to disconnect the blades from the main shaft, and chain them around {{in such a way that}} a single rotor acts as a compressor for a quarter turn, and as an engine the following quarter of a turn.|$|E

50|$|A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} unit designed to produce cool (chilled) water for space cooling purposes.The chilled water is then circulated {{to one or}} more cooling coils located in air handling units, fan-coils, or induction units. Chilled water distribution is not constrained by the 100 foot separation limit that applies to DX systems, thus chilled water-based cooling systems are typically used in larger buildings. Capacity control in a chilled water system is usually achieved through modulation of water flow through the coils; thus, multiple coils may be served from a single chiller without compromising control of any individual unit.Chillers may operate on either the vapor compression principle or the absorption principle. Vapor compression chillers may utilize reciprocating, centrifugal, screw, or <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> configurations. Reciprocating chillers are commonly used for capacities below 200 tons; centrifugal chillers are normally used to provide higher capacities; rotary and screw chillers are less commonly used, but are not rare. Heat rejection from a chiller may be by way of an air-cooled condenser or a cooling tower (both discussed below). Vapor compression chillers may be bundled with an air-cooled condenser to provide a packaged chiller, which would be installed outside of the building envelope. Vapor compression chillers may also be designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit; normally such a chiller would be installed in an enclosed central plant space. Absorption chillers are designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit.|$|E

40|$|Rotary {{compressors}} {{are widely}} utilized in air conditionders and heat pumps. However, when rotary compressors were applied in room air conditioners, VRFs and domestic water heaters, the systems will experience heavily {{degradation of the}} heating capacity and COP as the ambient temperature goes low. Aimed at these problems, considerable research {{has been carried out}} to raise a series of solutions, such as economizer technology, cascade-type vapor compression heat pump system and two stage coupling heat pump system. At present, economizer technology has become a critical method to improve the performance of air source heat pumps with rotary compressors in low ambient temperature. A novel vapor injection structure on a blade for a <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> has been proposed in previous paper to overcome the drawback of the traditional cylinder injection structure. Based on a verified numerical model, the performance of air source heat pumps with rotary compressors with different economizer technology including a two-stage <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor,</b> a single-stage <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> with traditional injection structure and a single <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> with the novel injection structure has been investigated. The results indicate that: compared to rotary compressors with traditional injection structure, air source heat pump with a <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> with proposed injection structure can enhance the heating capacity and COP by 13 %~ 15 % and 4. 8 %~ 9. 6 %, respectively; and compared to the twin-cylinder <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor,</b> the performance of air source heat pump with a <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> with proposed injection structure is almost the same, so the <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> with the novel injection structure could be considered to replace the two-stage <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor...</b>|$|E
40|$|With the aim {{of energy}} saving of room air conditioners, we are {{addressing}} higher efficiency of the <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> that is used most in the world. We focused on a new <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> equipped with a mechanism to restrict the rolling motion of the piston, and performed the dynamics analysis. The new <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> has a small pillar {{at the tip of}} the vane and constitutes a turning pair of vane and piston, and it limits the rolling motion of the piston. By means of limiting the piston rotation, the heat transfer to the suction process from the compression chamber will be suppressed, and we can expect higher compression efficiency. Before examining the compression efficiency, we performed the dynamics analysis of this new <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> and examined the forces and dynamic behavior of the components, and the mechanical efficiency of the compressor. Then we have following results. (1) We can clarify the contact point between the vane tip and piston in the turning pair by considering the equilibrium of forces and moments acting on the vane. (2) By reducing the diameter of the pillar at the vane tip, the vane tip friction loss is reduced, and the mechanical efficiency is improved. (3) The new <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> has less vane tip friction loss and on the other hand greater friction loss between the vane side and the cylinder in comparison to the rolling piston rotary compressors. As a result, both compressors have almost the same mechanical efficiency...|$|E

The characteristics of the compressor design and compression concept in such that of this compressor is supposed to be better than others <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> in term of leakage and friction. The operation of the compressor mechanism is directly from the shaft to the mechanism compression components. This mean that when the shaft start to rotate, the mechanism compression components will be rotate together in the same direction and this mechanism is able to compress the refrigerant at all speed of rotation. This is because the design of the vane tip is embedded in the swing slot at the rotating sleeve and the other end side of vane is embedded into the rotor slot. The fabrication of prototype of the compressor needs the concentration because it is involving the high precision of machining and mostly of the tolerance was applied in this design is around 5 m to 20 m.
