The preferential alignment of crystal grains in the <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> depends {{not only on}} the composition, but also on the spinning velocity.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of silver as a modifying constituent on structure formation in Ni-P based glass forming matrix and to characterize mechanical properties of the alloys. Design/methodology/approach: Nickel-silver-phosphorus Ni 78 Ag 2 P 20 alloy was produced using arc melting in argon protective atmosphere from commercial powders. The alloy was melt spun. The microstructure of the arc melted droplet is investigated in scanning electron microscope with EDS and micro-hardness tester and the melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbon</b> is investigated using light microscope and transmission electron microscope. Then the mechanical properties are evaluated with use of micro-hardness measurements. Findings: A strong tendency for demixing of Ni-P-rich and Ag-rich liquids is observed leading to formation of the primary structure consisting of slightly hypo-eutectic Ni-P-rich regions and Ag rich regions. The melt spinning process produced the amorphous Ni-P and Ag-rich crystalline structure. The alloys hardness and elasticity modulus were characterized. The melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> are slightly softer than the crystalline Ni-P regions. In case of the melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons,</b> a softening influence of silver was observed giving the lower hardness for Ni 78 Ag 2 P 20 than Ni 80 P 20. The alloy constituents in a bulk crystalline state present the higher values of elasticity modulus when compared to the melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons.</b> Research limitations/implications: It has been shown that the criterion of a high positive values of mixing enthalpies can be applied to design the materials that should separate before the solidification to form a hard glassy matrix / soft crystalline composite. The amorphization of the crystalline Ni-P-based alloys can lead to formation of more flexible materials with a lower elasticity modulus and lower hardness. Practical implications: The main limits for application of the glassy alloys are the high prices of the materials used for alloying and the low plasticity of the amorphous metals. Therefore, the work provides the alloy produced from a low-cost commercial purity precursors that are able to form a glassy matrix composite with a crystalline soft particles included. The future works {{on the development of the}} idea can lead to a successful manufacturing of a hard and ductile metallic composite parts. Originality/value: The work delivers a new information on possibility of amorphous/crystalline composite formation starting from Ni Ag P system. This includes the original microstructural and mechanical characteristics of the arc melt and melt spun alloy. The information could be used by researchers for future works on development of Ni-P based composites complementary to the electroless coatings...|$|R
30|$|We have {{analyzed}} freestanding β 12 -BNRs {{using the}} density functional theory. The structural, electrical, and magnetic {{properties of the}} ribbons are studied in detail. It {{was found that the}} magnetization of ribbon is strongly dependent on its structural properties. The results show that all the ribbons considered here are metals, and some of them can be magnetic. Magnetization is solely observed in the ribbons prepared by cutting the borophene sheet along the y-direction YBNR and in some widths. Generally, YBNRs are more interesting in a sense that some ribbons can be magnetic at one or two edges in specific widths. In addition, spin anisotropy is observed in YBNRs, making one edge more magnetic than the other. The spin anisotropy arises from the asymmetry {{at the edge of the}} <b>ribbon.</b> The <b>spin</b> anisotropy makes the β 12 -BNRs a potential candidate for spintronic applications.|$|R

The samples consist of hexagonal SmCo 5 grains whose c axes are preferentially aligned along the long {{direction of the}} ribbon. The lattice parameter a and the cell volume (V) increase with increasing Sm content δ, whereas c decreases. Sm addition appears to improve the degree of the preferred orientation of the c-axis and to increase the mean grain size, which weakens the effective intergranular exchange coupling. Therefore, the remanence ratio, coercivity, and squareness of the hysteresis loops are significantly enhanced. The remanence ratio of 0. 91 and the maximum energy product of 21. 2 MGOe, which is the highest value reported so far for Sm–Co ribbons, are achieved for δ = 0. 06.

On the other hand, the recent experimental results showed that the synthesized ribbons are metals, and they are flat. Therefore, we expect that the spin anisotropy reported in the article is a robust feature of some width of the ribbon, and it will exist in the presence of the substrate.

Knot theory {{is one of the most}} active research fields in modern mathematics. Knots and links are closed curves (one-dimensional manifolds) in Euclidean 3 -space, and they are related to braids and 3 -manifolds. These notions are generalized into higher dimensions. Surface-knots or surface-links are closed surfaces (two-dimensional manifolds) in Euclidean 4 -space, which are related to two-dimensional braids and 4 -manifolds. Surface-knot theory treats not only closed surfaces but also surfaces with boundaries in 4 -manifolds. For example, knot concordance and knot cobordism, which are also important objects in knot theory, are surfaces in the product space of the 3 -sphere and the interval.

40|$|The Sicarid spider Loxosceles laeta spins broad {{but very}} thin ribbons of elastic silk that it uses {{to form a}} retreat and to capture prey. A {{structural}} investigation into this spider's silk and spinning apparatus shows that these <b>ribbons</b> are <b>spun</b> from a gland homologous to the major ampullate gland of orb web spiders. The Loxosceles gland is constructed from the same basic parts (separate transverse zones in the gland, a duct and spigot) as other spider silk glands but construction details are highly specialized.

Loxosceles uses conventional die extrusion, feeding a liquid dope (spinning solution) to the slit-like die to form a flat ribbon, while orb web spiders use an extrusion process in which the silk dope is processed in an elongated duct to produce a cylindrical thread. This is achieved by the combination of an initial internal draw down, well inside the duct, and a final draw down, after the silk has left the spigot.

40|$|The Sm 2 Co 17 -based magnets {{are known}} for their large maximum energy product (BH) max and high {{temperature}} operation. A series of recent studies has been focused on the composition adjustment of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr) 7. 5 - 8. 5 magnets to optimize them for high temperature applications. In these magnets the desired magnetic properties are obtained after a long and complicated heat treatment which is required to develop the proper microstructure with the well known cellular/lamellar feature. The microstructure consists of Th 2 Zn 17 -type structure (S. G. R- 3 m) cells rich in Fe, cell boundaries of CaCu 5 -type structure (S. G. P 6 /mmm) rich in Cu and the Zr-rich "Zphase" lamellae, superimposed on the cellular structure perpendicularly to the hexagonal c-axis. The coercivity is generally attributed to a pinning type mechanism: due to the difference in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the domain wall energy of the 2 : 17 and 1 : 5 phases, the domain walls are pinned at the 1 : 5 phase cell boundaries. In this thesis there have been prepared and studied new magnetic materials, based on Sm-Co compositions with boron, which are characterized by very high coercive field at room and higher temperatures without the need of a long heat treatment. New compounds have been produced mainly as melt <b>spun</b> nanostructured <b>ribbons,</b> by using the melt-spinning technique, and as bulks, by using the arc-melting technique. A bulk precipitation hardened sample has been also studied. Crystal structure analysis revealed new aspects about the structure of Z-phase. On the same sample a viscosity analysis has been performed at room temperature and the domain wall width has been calculated. In detail, nanostructured/nanocomposite melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> with Sm(CobalFe 0. 1 Zr 0. 04 Bx) 7. 5, με x= 0. 005, 0. 01, 0. 015 and Sm(CobalFe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04 Bx) 7. 5, με x= 0. 005, 0. 01, 0. 015, 0. 025, 0. 03, 0. 04, 0. 05 stoichiometries have been prepared by the melt-spinning technique in the range of wheel velocity 5 to 70 m/sec. The bulk samples have been produced by arc-melting of Sm, Co, Fe, Cu, Zr and Fe 3 B metals. The nanostructured magnetic melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> with boron, are characterized by very high coercive fields while their microstructure is completely different than the well known cellular/lamellar microstructure. The coercive field is associated with the ultrafine microstructure and strong exchange coupling between the “hard-hard” and “hard-soft” nanograins. Structural and magnetic properties have been studied on melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> as a function of cooling rate, stoichiometry and annealing conditions. Rietveld analysis revealed that the main phase of as <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> is 1 : 7 while after annealing above 750 οC transforms to 2 : 17 and 1 : 5. In most of the cases a small amount of fcc-Co has been found mostly {{on the surface of the}} <b>ribbons.</b> As <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> have very high coercive field iHc with the greatest value to be 38 kOe at room temperature while the reduced remanence mr is over 0. 7. The annealed ribbons Sm(CobalFe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04 B 0. 04) 7. 5 at 39 m/sec have coercive field of about 5 kOe at 400 οC. The temperature variation does not deteriorate the coercive field. The ribbons Sm(Co 0. 69 Fe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04 B 0. 05) 7. 5 at 40 m/sec after annealing at 850 οC for 10 min have high coercive field (16 kOe) and maximum energy product of 7. 9 MGOe at room temperature. The as <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> Sm(Co 0. 725 Fe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04 B 0. 015) 7. 5 at 70 m/sec at 327 οC has (ΒΗ) max = 4. 4 MGOe at reversed field of 1. 4 kOe while Br is 5. 6 kG. After demagnetization factor correction, by using Νd~ 0. 555, the (ΒΗ) max is ~ 9. 1 MGOe at 2. 4 kOe, which is very high. Magnetic induction Br, at the same temperature, is 6. 8 kG. At 377 οC, the (ΒΗ) max is 3. 2 MGOe at 1. 4 kOe and Br is 5. 1 kG. After demagnetization factor correction, Νd~ 0. 555, (ΒΗ) max is ~ 8. 8 MGOe at 2. 4 kOe while Br is 7. 4 kG. These unique values are for the first time observed on not annealed or short time annealed nanostructured ribbons or powders. The precipitation hardened bulk sample with boron Sm(CobalFe 0. 1 Cu 0. 12 Zr 0. 04) 7. 5 has the well known celluler/lamellar microstructure with cell size of about 70 nm and lamella density of 0. 06 nm- 1. By analyzing the x-ray diffraction patterns by using the Rietveld method, the thermomagnetic curves and the selected area diffraction by using TEM, the 1 : 5, 2 : 17 R and 6 : 23 phases were found Σ. Σ. Μακρίδης – Διδακτορική διατριβή vi to be the characteristic crystal structures. The 6 : 23 structure has been proposed for the first time to be the structure type of the lamellar phase. Hysteresis loops have been traced in the range of 4. 2 K to 850 K. The magnetization fluctuations have also been studied as a function of time at room temperature under constant reversed field while recoil loops have been traced at the same fields. As a result, magnetic viscosity constants, fluctuation fields and thermal activation volumes have been calculated on the reversed field values. On the coercive field, the activation volume is V*= 4 ? 10 - 19 cm 3 at 300 Κ. The domain wall width at the coercive field is close to 8 nm. As the temperature decreases from 250 Κ (Ηc~ 20 kOe) to 4. 2 Κ (Ηc~ 50 kOe), the demagnetization curve has a characteristic small step due to the weaker exchange coupling between the phases. The coercive field has normal temperature dependence with Hc= 8 kOe at 700 K. The magnetic viscosity study on the isotropic sample in parallel with the Rietveld analysis on the diffraction pattern is an original investigation. For the first time phase percentages of 1 : 5, 2 : 27 and 6 : 23 have been calculated while 6 : 23 has been identified as the structure of lamellar phase. ...|$|R

By folding a graphene ribbon to a ring and threading it by a magnetic flux, we study the persistent charge and spin currents in the tight-binding limit. It is found that, for a broad <b>ribbon,</b> the edge <b>spin</b> current approaches a finite value independent of the radius of the ring. For a narrow ribbon, inter-edge coupling between the edge states could open the Dirac gap and reduce the overall persistent currents. Furthermore, by enhancing the Rashba coupling, we find that the persistent spin current gradually reduces to zero at a critical value, beyond which the graphene is no longer a QSH insulator...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of amorphous and crystalline {{state of the}} Nd 2 Fe 23 B 3 alloy from melt-spun ribbon is presented. The synthesis conditions are investigated combining DSC, X-ray diffraction and thermomagnetic analysis. The thermomagnetic analysis {{is found to be}} very useful to optimize the synthesis process. Comparison of these results enables to discuss the thermal stability of both the amorphous and crystalline phases. It is found that the onset temperature of the α-iron formation is significantly smaller than the Nd 2 Fe 23 B 3 crystallization temperature. Magnetization measurements have also been carried out on the as <b>spun</b> <b>ribbon</b> and the crystalline Nd 2 Fe 23 B 3 sample. The crystalline phase is found to exhibit a much larger Curie temperature than the amorphous one as well as a larger saturation magnetization...|$|R
40|$|Twinning of the ordered {{icosahedral}} quasicrystal {{has been}} studied by transmission electron microscopy in a melt-spun Al_ 75 Cu_ 12. 5 Fe_ 12. 5 alloy. Dendrites of about 10 μ m of the icosahedral phase, formed near the wheel side of the melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons,</b> have been observed to twin extensively so that a multiple twinning of the grains is observed. Regions of about 1 μ m size are twin related through a common five-fold axis to several neighbouring regions. The possibility of different orientations of the twins formed by repeated twinning is infinite. Thus the multiple twinning {{gives rise to a}} random symmetry for the whole grain. Depending on the undercooling achieved across the melt-spun ribbons, several related phases like the decagonal quasicrystal and crystalline monoclinic Al_ 3 Fe phase in ten-fold multiply twinned form were also observed...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum alloys {{containing}} 10 to 11. 5 wt. pct. of {{iron and}} 1. 5 to 3 wt. pct. of chromium using the technique of rapid solidification powder metallurgy were studied. Alloys were prepared as thin ribbons (. 002 inch thick) rapidly solidified at uniform rate of 10 (6) C/second by the melt spinning process. The melt <b>spun</b> <b>ribbons</b> were pulverized into powders (- 60 to 400 mesh) by a rotating hammer mill. The powders were consolidated by hot extrusion at a high reduction ratio of 50 : 1. The powder extrusion temperature was varied to determine the range of desirable processing conditions necessary to yield useful properties. Powders and consolidated alloys were characterized by SEM and optical metallography. The consolidated alloys were evaluated for (1) thermal stability, (2) tensile properties in the range, room temperature to 450 F, and (3) notch toughness in the range, room temperature to 450 F...|$|R
