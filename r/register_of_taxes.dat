Based on a <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> collected from the pilgrims, Hardwicke estimated the scale of the mela at 2-2.5 million people. According to Hardwicke, the Shaivite Gosains were the most dominant, [...] "in point of numbers and power". The next most powerful sect were the Vaishnavite Bairagis. The Gosains carried swords and shields, and managed the entire Mela. Their mahants held daily councils to hear and decide on all the complaints. The Gosains levied and collected the taxes, and did not remit any money to the Maratha treasury.|$|E
50|$|In the 6th century {{it was one}} of the strongholds of the Byzantine Pentapolis. A free commune {{was founded}} in Cagli at the end of the 12th century, and it quickly subdued more than 52 {{surrounding}} castles, overthrowing the rural lords and threatening the feudal powers of the abbots. Its expansion established the borders of the diocese of Cagli. When the city was partially destroyed by fire, started by Ghibelline factions in 1287, the settlement was moved down from the slopes of Monte Petrano and rebuilt anew on flatter land, incorporating the pre-existing suburb. The rebuilding of the city, under the patronage of Pope Nicholas IV, followed Arnolfo di Cambio's grid-pattern town plan. Cagli soon returned to being a prosperous centre. A <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> paid to the Church in 1312, revised after a heavy fall in population due to famine, shows that Cagli then numbered around 7,200 inhabitants. Shortly afterwards, in the Constitutiones Aegidianae of 1357, Cagli appeared among the nine major cities in the Marca (along with Pesaro, Fano and Fossombrone). The economic development of the city centred mainly on the manufacture of woollen cloth (later also silk) and the tanning of hides, industries that grew considerably under the dukes of Urbino.|$|E

The matching process is based on string comparison via bigrams of enterprise names and addresses, and a quality class approach assigning pairs <b>of</b> <b>register</b> units into classes of different compliance (i. e., matching quality) based on bigram similarity values and the comparison of other matching variables, like the NACE code or the year of foundation. Based on methodological research concerning matching techniques carried out in the DIECOFIS project, an empirical comparison of the bigram method and other string matching techniques was conducted: the edit distance, the Jaro algorithm and the Jaro-Winkler algorithm, the longest common subsequence and the maximal match were selected as appropriate alternatives and evaluated in the study.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>registering</b> for <b>taxes</b> on firm profits in Bolivia, {{the country with}} the highest levels of informality in Latin America. A new survey of micro and small firms enables the authors to control for a rich set of measures of owner ability and business motivations that can affect both profits and the decision to formalize. The paper identifies the impact <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> registration on business profitability using the distance of a firm from the tax office where registration occurs, conditional on the distance to the city center, as an instrument for registration. Proximity to the tax office provides firms with more information about registration, but is argued to not directly affect profits. The findings show that tax registration leads to significantly higher profits for the firms that the instrument affects. However, there is also evidence of heterogeneous effects <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> formality on profits. Tax registration is found to increase profits for the mid-size firms in the sample, but to lower profits for both the smaller and larger firms, in contrast to the standard view that formality increases profits. The analysis shows that owners of large firms who have managed to stay informal have higher entrepreneurial ability than formal firm owners, in contrast to the standard view (correct among smaller firms) that informal firm owners have low ability.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to define types <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition under conditions of globalization of world economy. Definition of forms and types <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition is debatable in economics literature; therefore today general approach is absent. Besides in most cases scientists lack unified approach when selecting and examining descriptions <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition classifications. Often researchers make no difference between such concepts as "type" and "form" <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition. Authors offer logical communication chart for such categories as "maintenance", "form", "type", and on this basis necessity to examine tax competition as form of economic competition is grounded and it is proposed to identify certain displays <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition that have general signs as well as its types but not as forms.
