5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> {{in a ring}} around the edge, which grow up to 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell <b>root</b> <b>hairs.</b> These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|The Liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in {{the case}} of Medeoleae) {{flowering}} plants with simple trichomes (<b>root</b> <b>hairs)</b> and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of 'petals', that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Arabidopsis roots, some {{epidermal}} cells differentiate into <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells. Auxin regulates <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> positioning, while ethylene controls cell elongation. Phyllobacterium brassicacearum STM 196, {{a beneficial}} strain of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) {{isolated from the}} roots of field-grown oilseed rape, stimulates <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. We investigated the role of ethylene in the response of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells to STM 196 inoculation. While we could not detect {{a significant increase in}} ethylene biosynthesis, we could detect a slight activation of the ethylene signalling pathway. Consistent with this, an exhaustive survey of the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation response of mutants and transgenic lines affected in the ethylene pathway showed contrasting <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> sensitivities to STM 196.

40|$|The <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> {{development}} {{is controlled by}} diverse factors such as fate-determining developmental cues, auxin-related environmental factors, and hormones. In particular, the soil environmental factors are important as they maximize their absorption by modulating <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development. These environmental factors affect the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> developmental process by making use of diverse hormones. These hormonal factors {{interact with each other}} to modulate <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development in which auxin appears to form the most intensive networks with the pathways from environmental factors and hormones. Moreover, auxin action for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> {{development is}} genetically located immediately upstream of the root hair-morphogenetic genes. These observations suggest that auxin plays as an organizing node for environmental/hormonal pathways to modulate <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> growth...|$|R

This way, the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> coverage stays the same. When a new <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cell grows, it excretes a poison so that the other cells in close proximity to it are unable to grow one of these hairs.

25|$|Extraradical hyphae extend {{outward from}} the mantle into the soil, {{fulfilling}} {{the role of the}} suppressed <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> by increasing the surface area of the colonized root. These hyphae can spread out singly, or in an aggregate arrangement known collectively as a rhizomorph. Much as the Hartig net and mantle, composite hyphal organs can display a wide range of structural difference. Some rhizomorphs are simply parallel, linear collections of hyphae. Others yield more complex organization such as aggregates where the central hyphae possess enlarged diameters, or exhibiting apically extending hyphae that superficially resemble meristematic activity.|$|E
40|$|It was {{reported}} in soybean that the content of Fe and Co microelements of the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> invaded by rhizobium {{during the process of}} nodule formation was higher than that of the root. To confirm this point, a supplementary experiment was carried out using several applicable plants, soybeans, lupine, pea, corn and pumpkin. <b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> was separated in liquid nitrogen from the roots of those seedlings. The separated <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> of 20 mg, or the residual root of 200 mg was digested in a microwave wet digestion device of closed system by using hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid. After wet-digestion, the content of micronutrients (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) was measured by using a furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. This result indicates that micronutrients except for Co could be measured in a small amount of about 20 mg. Fe content was higher in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> than in <b>root</b> irrespective of a monocotyledonous, a dicotyledonous, a leguminous or a non-leguminous plant. In seedlings, it became clear that most of the Fe storage in seed was accumulated in the <b>root</b> <b>hair.</b> Mo was similarly accumulated in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> and <b>root</b> of soybeans and pumpkin. In corn, Mo content in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> was low in comparison with that of root. In other words, the Mo content in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> of dicotyledonous plants was higher than that of monocotyledonous plants. There was no great difference in the content of Mn, Zn and Cu between <b>root</b> and <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> and among plant species. From these results, it appeared that the micronutrients stocked in seed of leguminous plants might be transferred to the <b>root</b> <b>hair.</b> Moreover, the accumulation of some peculiar element (Ca, Co and Fe) known in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> could be guessed to be related to an active absorption from nutrient solution during germination...|$|R
40|$|<b>ROOT</b> <b>HAIR</b> DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE 4 (RSL 4) is {{necessary}} and sufficient for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana. <b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> length {{is determined by the}} duration for which RSL 4 protein is present in the developing <b>root</b> <b>hair.</b> The aim of this research was to identify genes regulated by RSL 4 that affect <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> growth. To identify genes regulated by RSL 4, we identified genes whose expression was elevated by induction of RSL 4 activity in the presence of an inhibitor of translation. Thirty-four genes were identified as putative targets of RSL transcriptional regulation, and the results suggest that the activities of SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN (SAC 1), EXOCSYT SUBUNIT 70 A 1 (EXO 70 A 1), PEROXIDASE 7 (PRX 7) and CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 11 (CPK 11) are required for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation. These data indicate that RSL 4 controls cell growth by controlling the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cell signalling, cell wall modification and secretion...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of two Arabidopsis expansin genes (AtEXP 7 and AtEXP 18) is tightly linked to <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> initiation; thus, {{the regulation of}} these genes was studied to elucidate how developmental, hormonal, and environmental factors orchestrate <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation. Exogenous ethylene and auxin, as well as separation of the root from the medium, stimulated <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation and the {{expression of}} these expansin genes. The effects of exogenous auxin and root separation on <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation required the ethylene signaling pathway. By contrast, blocking the endogenous ethylene pathway, either by genetic mutations or by a chemical inhibitor, did not affect normal <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation and expansin gene expression. These {{results indicate that the}} normal developmental pathway for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation (i. e., not induced by external stimuli) is independent of the ethylene pathway. Promoter analyses of the expansin genes show that the same promoter elements that determine cell specificity also determine inducibility by ethylene, auxin, and root separation. Our study suggests that two distinctive signaling pathways, one developmental and the other environmental/hormonal, converge to modulate the initiation of the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> and the expression of its specific expansin gene set...|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include some that are physical and some that are chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or root hair, and thus can explore soil material that roots and <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi {{differs from that of}} plants. For example, they may secrete organic acid that dissolve or chelate many ions, or release them from minerals by ion exchange. Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.|$|E
25|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} mutualistic association {{provides the}} fungus with relatively constant and {{direct access to}} carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose. The carbohydrates are translocated from their source (usually leaves) to root tissue {{and on to the}} plant's fungal partners. In return, the plant gains the benefits of the mycelium's higher absorptive capacity for water and mineral nutrients, partly because of the large surface area of fungal hyphae, which are much longer and finer than plant <b>root</b> <b>hairs,</b> and partly because some such fungi can mobilize soil minerals unavailable to the plants' roots. The effect is thus to improve the plant's mineral absorption capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Plants uptake {{essential}} elements {{from the soil}} through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the {{carbon dioxide in the}} air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|ATP binding {{cassette}} (ABC) transporters transport diverse substrates across membranes {{in various}} organisms. However, plant ABC transporters {{have only been}} scantily characterized. By {{taking advantage of the}} auxin-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cell and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) suspension cell systems, we show here that Arabidopsis P-glycoprotein 4 (PGP 4) displays auxin efflux activity in plant cells. <b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> cell–specific overexpression of PGP 4 (PGP 4 ox) and known auxin efflux transporters, such as PGP 1, PGP 19, and PIN-FORMEDs, decreased <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation, whereas overexpression of the influx transporter AUXIN-RESISTANT 1 enhanced <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> length. PGP 4 ox-mediated <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> shortening was rescued by the application of auxin or an auxin efflux inhibitor. These results indicate that the increased auxin efflux activity conferred by PGP 4 reduces auxin levels in the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cell and consequently inhibits <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation. PGP 4 ox in tobacco suspension cells also increased auxin efflux. PGP 4 proteins were targeted to the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells and tobacco cells without any clear subcellular polarity. Brefeldin A partially interfered with the trafficking of PGP 4 reversibly, and this was rescued by pretreatment with auxin. These results suggest that PGP 4 is an auxin efflux transporter in plants and that its trafficking to the plasma membrane involves both BFA-sensitive and -insensitive pathways...|$|R
40|$|<b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> {{morphogenesis}} {{is driven}} by an amalgam of interacting processes controlled by complex signaling events. Redox processes and transcriptional control are critical for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development. However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate redox state and transcription are largely unknown. To elucidate a possible role of transcriptional Mediators in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation, we analyzed the Arabidopsis <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> phenotype of T-DNA insertion lines that harbor homozygous mutations in genes encoding Mediator subunits. Genetic evidence indicates that the Mediator subunits PFT 1 /MED 25 and MED 8 are critical for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> differentiation, but act via separate mechanisms. Transcriptional profiling of pft 1 roots revealed that PFT 1 activates a subset of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -producing class III peroxidases. pft 1 mutants showed perturbed H 2 O 2 and superoxide () distribution, suggesting that PFT 1 is essential to maintain redox homeostasis in the root. Chemical treatments rescued the pft 1 mutant phenotype, indicating that correct reactive oxygen species (ROS) distribution is an essential prerequisite for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> differentiation. In addition, PFT 1 positively regulates cell wall remodeling genes that are essential for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation. Our results demonstrate that PFT 1 maintains ROS distribution which, in turn, controls <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> differentiation. Thus, our findings reveal a novel mechanism in which the Mediator controls ROS homeostasis by regulating the transcriptional machinery...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} we {{integrate}} {{the information available}} on the cell biology of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation with recent findings from the analysis of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. The mature Arabidopsis root epidermis consists of root-hair-producing cells and non-root-hair-producing cells. <b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> growth begins with a swelling of the outer epidermal wall. It has been postulated that {{this is due to}} a pH-mediated localised cell wall loosening. From the bulge a single <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> emerges which grows by tip growth. The <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> tip consists of a vesicle-rich zone and an organelle-rich subapical zone. The vesicles supply new plasma membrane and cell wall material for elongation.

25|$|The main {{benefit of}} mycorrhizas to plants has been {{attributed}} to increased uptake of nutrients, especially phosphorus. This may be due to increased surface area in contact with soil, increased movement of nutrients into mycorrhizae, a modified root environment, and increased storage. Mycorrhizas can be much more efficient than plant roots at taking up phosphorus. Phosphorus travels to the root or via diffusion and hyphae reduce the distance required for diffusion, thus increasing uptake. The rate of phosphorus flowing into mycorrhizae can be up to six times that of the <b>root</b> <b>hairs.</b> In some cases, the role of phosphorus uptake can be completely taken over by the mycorrhizal network, and all of the plant’s phosphorus may be of hyphal origin. Less is known about the role of nitrogen nutrition in the arbuscular mycorrhizal system {{and its impact on the}} symbiosis and community. While significant advances have been made in elucidating the mechanisms of this complex interaction, much investigation remains to be done.|$|E
25|$|Philodendrons {{have both}} aerial and {{subterranean}} roots. The aerial roots occur in many {{shapes and sizes}} and originate {{from most of the}} plant's nodes or occasionally from an internode. The size and number of aerial roots per node depends on the presence of a suitable substrate for the roots to attach themselves. Aerial roots serve two primary purposes. They allow the philodendron to attach itself to a tree or other plant, and they allow it to collect water and nutrients. As such, the roots are divided morphologically into these two categories. Aerial roots used for attaching to trees tend to be shorter, more numerous, and sometimes have a layer of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> attached; those used for collecting water and nutrients tend to be thicker and longer. These feeder roots tend to attach flush with the substrate to which the philodendron is attached, and make their way directly downwards in search of soil. In general, feeder roots tend to show both positive hydrotropic and negative heliotropic behaviors. Characteristic of roots in philodendrons is the presence of a sclerotic hypodermis, which are cylindrical tubes inside the epidermis that can be one to five cells long. The cells that line the sclerotic hypodermis are elongated and tend to be hardened. Underneath the epidermis is a unique layer of cells in a pattern of long cells followed by short cells.|$|E

The DNA sequence of this region has been determined and three open reading frames were identified: genes corresponding to these open reading frames have been called nodA, nodB and nodC and are transcribed in that order. Mutations within the nodC gene completely blocked <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> curling. However, a subcloned fragment containing only the nodC gene did not induce normal <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> curling (although some branching was observed), indicating that the nodA and B genes may also be required for normal <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> curling. From an analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of the nodAB and C genes it appeared unlikely that their products are secreted; therefore it is concluded that the induction of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> curling could be due to a secreted metabolite...|$|R

Here, using the auxin-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cell system and the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) suspension cell system, we demonstrate that the protein kinase PINOID (PID) positively regulates auxin efflux. Overexpression of PID (PIDox) or the auxin efflux carrier component PINFORMED 3 (PIN 3, PIN 3 ox), specifically in the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cell, greatly suppressed <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> growth.
