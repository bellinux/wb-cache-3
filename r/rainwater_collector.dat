40|$|Summary The {{collection}} of rainwater from roofs, its storage and subsequent use {{make a significant}} saving {{in the use of}} potable water. The capacity of the rainwater store is important because it affects both system and initial costs. This paper describes the development of a behavioural model that simulates the performance of rainwater collectors located within the United Kingdom. The input data in time series form are used to simulate mass flows through the model based on a daily time interval. Rainfall time series from 11 different UK locations are used to simulate the performance of rainwater collectors for a range of roof areas, storage capacities and demands. A set of <b>rainwater</b> <b>collector</b> performance curves for each of the geographic locations is developed. From the location-specific curves a set of average curves is determined that is shown to be sufficiently accurate for estimating rainwater collection performance within the United Kingdom. Finally, the average performance curves are shown to be adequately represented by an exponential association type equation, resulting in a computationally efficient method of determining <b>rainwater</b> <b>collector</b> performance...|$|E

Tests performed at the IAEA have proven that water stored in the sampler for nearly 1 year did not suffer significantly from any evaporation effect. Further comparisons performed at sampling stations of the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) show excellent performance of the new collector with advantages over some conventional precipitation samplers.

40|$|The {{chloride}} {{mass balance}} method {{was used to}} estimate the average diffuse groundwater recharge on northeastern Gran Canaria (Canary Islands), where the largest recharge to the volcanic island aquifer occurs. Rainwater was sampled monthly in ten <b>rainwater</b> <b>collectors</b> to determine the bulk deposition rate of chloride for the 2008 - 2014 period. Average chloride deposition decreases inwardly from more than 10 g center dot m(- 2) center dot year(- 1) to about 4 g center dot m(- 2) center dot year(- 1). The application of the chloride mass balance method resulted in an estimated average recharge of about 28 hm(3) /year or 92 mm/year (24 % of precipitation) {{in the study area}} after subtracting chloride loss with surface runoff. The average storm runoff was estimated to be 12 hm(3) /year (9 % of precipitation) for the 1980 - 2014 period. Runoff was sampled during scarce rainy periods, which produce surface water flow. Average recharge varies from less than a few mm/year near the coast up to 270 mm/year in the highlands (about 33 % of average rainfall), with a close-to-linear increase inwardly of about 18 mm center dot year(- 1) center dot km(- 1).

40|$|This article explores {{through a}} basic model the {{determinants}} of the relative social advantages of franchising versus the privatization of a public service with monopolist characteristics. The main results of this work are twofold. First, the franchise option is, in general socially preferable when the government can credibly commit to not expropriate the sunk investments that the private party must carry out before providing the service (highways, ports, airports, and electricity lines, for example). Secondly, this work finds that the option of privatizing the monopoly appears more desirable, although not strictly superior, to the franchising of the service when investments are not verifiable (water, sewage, <b>rainwater</b> <b>collectors,</b> and natural gas distribution, for example). We show that this last result is influenced by a pro-franchise effect in industries with unverifiable investments because of the power that the auction has to introduce competition and to generate incentives in the investor {{to fight for the}} right to remain as a monopoly. This effect, that is new in the literature, goes beyond the willful arguments that are typically given to favor the franchise of public firms. This article also shows that the optimal level of investments under complete contractability is greater under privatization than under franchising of the service. However, when investments are non-contractible, {{it is not clear what}} alternative of private sector participation induces higher/lower investments in equilibrium. We present in the paper the conditions that answer this question...|$|R

Trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pt and V) were used to carry out this comparison. TAD was collected with two open polyethylene containers (72 × 54 × 21 cm), while WAD was collected by means of an automated <b>rainwater</b> <b>collector</b> and DAD was determined from both air measurements (recorded by an air sampler) and 7 Be deposition velocities. This comparison showed a significant difference between the two methods. Dry and wet fluxes varied widely from one month to the next. Zn and Cu were the most abundant elements in both dry and wet depositions. The mean contribution of DAD to the total atmospheric deposition during this 9 -month study was significant for Zn, Cu and V (about 25 %) as well as for Pb (approx. 60 %). For this relatively unpolluted urban residential catchment, the contribution of atmospheric deposition to global load at the catchment outlet was low, between 10 % and 20 % for Zn, Cu, V and Pb, 25 % for Cr and about 30 % for Ni. For other urban sites exhibiting high atmospheric pollution however, the atmospheric contribution to the global pollution load could be much greater.

The study runs its own story from its initial military use, through the use of civil equipment until the final cultural and Museum Center. First, the project of Italian origin is examined and its use as barracks for troops for a duration of three centuries (1557 – 1850), pointing out the architectural constants of war machinery in a defense position and its origin as a <b>rainwater</b> <b>collector</b> and cistern: a perfect square with two bastions in which a plan of the uprising is preserved (1778). Secondly, we study the changes in the mentioned architecture throughout {{a century and a half}} (1850 – 1990) after its change of ownership (from the state to the municipality), and as a result of the new use as a city hall and public endowment: a market and health and leisure centre, which meant the demolition of defensive elements and the opening up to the outside of the inner parade ground. And thirdly, the new transfer of the municipal offices brings in the beginning of a project of transformations (1990 – 2015) that retrieves the demolished elements at the same time as it assigns the entire fort for a cultural centre: exhibition, research and history museum, promoting the identity between the citizens and the building which stands in the foundations of their city. The conclusions take us through an interesting route that goes from the approach of defensive tactics, its use as administrative headquarters to the current cultural policy of preservation.

40|$|If {{we look at}} {{the energy}} {{consumption}} of a household we see transport is number one. Open areas in a downtown area are not easy to find, which explains the long travel distance people make. Old harbors are located {{in the center of a}} city on the other hand are mostly wasteland. The rea- son is that the area has a high flood risk because it is located outside the dike. To develop housing in such areas they need to be built in a climate adaptive way that overcomes the problem of flooding. Urban The urban plan had a few criteria that were taken into account. Minimizing the size of jetties, maximizing the number of houses, creating parking places and making the plan fire proof were the main points. Fitting as many houses as possible in the plan would make the financial aspects more convincing. Ensuring the fire safety of the plan means there are always two ways to escape, hence the circular infrastruc- ture. This plan brings all aspects together to provide a stable and realistic base for the architectural design at the meso scale. Climate The house is using the sun and the water to regulate the indoor climate during all seasons. There are active and passive en- ergy systems integrated in the design. The active energy system are PV cells integrat- ed in glass, PVT panels, heat recover y units, floor heating/cooling, <b>rainwater</b> <b>collectors</b> and in the bottom of the concrete box is a system of pipes positioned to transfer heat and cold with the ambient water. The passive energy systems contributed to the shape and orientation of the design. Thermal mass on the North side for cool- ing during summer, thermal mass on the South side for absorbing deep penetrat- ing sunlight during winter, wind cowls, thick insulation and good crack sealing are the main passive aspects. The green roofs lead to a gradual discharge of rainwater, provide better isolation, increase rooftop protec- tion durability, provide compensation for lack of green in cities and help purify from fine dust. Another great passive aspect is the incoming light which is reflected from the water to the ceiling what gives a beau- tiful visual experience. Construction The homes are composed of 3 elements: - The concrete box functions as the float- ing part -The timber frame lowers the center of gravity - The glasshouse is used for regulating the climate These three elements together lead to an architecturally, technically and aesthetically interesting design. The elaboration of the details proved that the design could be constructed flawlessly. The homes are designed as two-under- one-roofs. After being transported independently to their location they will be connected to increase the stability and decrease the obliquity. The main goal “Designing a climate adaptive, energy efficient and sustainable house” has been achieved because of the good integration between the macro, meso and micro scale in this design. S. W. A.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{presented}} {{the calculation of}} mass balance of the materials in suspension, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, COD and BOD 5 within sewage collector A 6 {{in the area of}} Hajdrihova street No. 28 and behind the outfall from the stormwater overflow under the bridge at Riharjeva street in Ljubljana. The pollutant concentration was acquired on the basis of measurements which were carried out during the time period between the years 2004 and 2009, and it presents the basic data for conversion of mass balance at the above mentioned sample sites. The catchment area of sewage collector A 6 is expressly urbanised. During precipitation events, on the urbanised areas, due to impervious areas the precipitation waters are drained through the secondary sewage systems which are connected to the main <b>collector.</b> <b>Rainwater</b> run-off from the road surfaces, which is heavily polluted with hard particles and other pollutants due to tire wear, vehicle breaking, road surface wear and other sorts of dirt caused by the drivers, represents a considerable burden to the sewage system. This is valid mostly for the rainwater run-off after a longer period of drought. Due to high rates of discharge during the precipitations, and owing to economic reasons, the stormwater overflows have been installed. These stormwater overflows disburden the surplus of waste waters and rainfall waters into the water drainage system, which can destroy natural ecosystem and increase its eutrophication. This thesis presents a more detailed description of the first flush of precipitation event, sewage collector A 6, riverbasin of the river Gradaščica and the German standard ATV-A 128 E. In the calculation part of this thesis there follows the calculation of hydraulic burdening of sewage collector A 6 with the SWMM 5 model, and the calculation of mass balance for particular pollutants, both in sewage collector and river. The fact is that stormwater overflows protect the river insuficiently. Therefore, the Municipality of Ljubljana made the strategic spatial plan, where one of the targets is to make the river of Ljubljanica a river suitable for bathing again. So, we have envisaged the installation of five stormwater tanks and made the calculation of the necessary basin volumes based on the German standard ATV-A 128 E...|$|R
