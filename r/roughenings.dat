40|$|The {{static and}} dynamic <b>roughenings</b> {{of a growing}} {{crystalline}} facet is studied where the growth mechanism is controlled by a restricted-curvature (RC) geometry. A continuum equation, in analogy with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is considered for the purpose. It is shown here that although the growth process begins with a RC geometry, a structural phase transition occurs from the restricted-curvature phase to the KPZ phase. An estimation of the corresponding critical temperature is given here. Calculations on the static phase transition give results along the same line as existing predictions, apart fromm minor numerical adjustments. Comment: 4 pages, revtex, no figur...|$|E
40|$|In bilayer systems electron-hole (e-h) pairs with {{spatially}} separated components (i. e., with {{electrons in}} one layer and {{holes in the}} other) can be condensed to a superfluid state when the temperature is lowered. This article deals with the influence of randomly distributed inhomogeneities on the superfluid properties of such bilayer systems in a strong perpendicular magnetic field. Ionized impurities and <b>roughenings</b> of the conducting layers are shown to decrease the superfluid current density of the e-h pairs. When the interlayer distance is smaller than or close to the magnetic length, the fluctuations of the interlayer distance considerably reduce the superfluid transition temperature.
