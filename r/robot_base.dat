After that, the transformation matrix between the two robots ’ base frames will be calculated by the relationship between them. Then we simulate this algorithm in MATLAB to verify this method. After the simulation, we can find the validity of this calibration method...|$|E

30|$|The rail {{consists}} of the two rails (running and transverse) and a <b>robot</b> <b>base.</b> In the actual assembly process, the length of rail is approximately 4 m in the running direction and approximately 1 m in the transverse direction. Movement along the running rail {{is parallel to the}} production line direction. It serves to deliver the bumper and synchronize with the movement of the production line. Movement along the transverse rail runs perpendicular to the production line. This facilitates motion to the AGV and approach to the worker on the production line. We use a rack and pinion mechanism for driving on the rails. The <b>robot</b> <b>base</b> moves along each rail by meshing the rack with the driven part, which connects to a servo motor, a reducer, and a pinion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new line-based calibration method for automatically computing the transformation relationship between industrial robots and workcell. The calibration method mainly {{depends on the}} position-sensitive detector (PSD) servo control of the robots. The developed servo controller allows precisely positioning the laser beam (line) from a single laser pointer attached at the end-effector of robot onto {{the center of the}} PSD in a well-designed lateral-effect PSDs fixture. The selected PSD in the fixture has high performance with the resolution of 0. 5 μ. Once the precision localizations/positioning in the centers of multiple PSDs are achieved, the group of points in the <b>robot</b> <b>base</b> frame and workcell frame can be generated by using the intersection of laser beams (lines) and by using the predefined fixture-workcell information, respectively. A quaternion algorithm and the least square method are then employed to determine the transformation relationship between <b>robot</b> <b>base</b> frame and workcell frame. The experiments have been implemented on an ABB industrial robot IRB 1600, the results verify the effectiveness of both the PSD servoing and the line-based calibration method as well as demonstrate the performance of the whole system.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>robots</b> <b>based</b> on highly coupled mechanical structures can give rise to redundancy in control. Highly coupled mechanical structures have the property that actuation at one location can translate into movement at multiple locations, and conversely, movement at one location {{can be caused by}} multiple actuators. Due to this property, multiple control strategies may exist for a single behavior. Tensegrity structures which have recently been shown to form the basis for successful locomotor robots [8], have highly coupled mechanical structures. Thus, as a case study, it was of interest to investigate whether these new tensegrity <b>based</b> <b>robots</b> could offer a high degree of redundancy of control. This was investigated on two <b>robots,</b> <b>based</b> on three and four strut tensegrity prisms. Control strategies for locomotion were evolved using a genetic algorithm in simulation, and the evolved behaviors were compared. It was found that multiple control strategies existed for forward locomotion in both structures, and that qualitatively similar behavior could be obtained with significantly different control strategies. This indicated that a considerable degree of redundancy could exist in the control of <b>robots</b> <b>based</b> on highly coupled mechanical structures. I...|$|R
