6000|$|And {{when they}} came to the open land [...] They wheeled, {{deployed}} and stood; [...] Midmost were Marcus and the King, [...] And Eldred on the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing,</b> [...] And leftwards Colan darkling, [...] In the last shade of the wood.|$|R
50|$|If {{viewed from}} {{the tail of the}} airplane, looking forward in the {{direction}} of flight, there is one wingtip vortex trailing from the left-hand wing and circulating clockwise, and another one trailing from the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> and circulating anti-clockwise. The result is a region of downwash behind the aircraft, between the two vortices.|$|R
50|$|Efforts {{to locate}} the missing panels {{continue}} even if only {{for the sake of}} historical record. Nothing is known about the left-hand side of the triptych including subject matter. Part of the outside panel of the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> (cut in half) is in the Moscow Pushkin Museum, while the inside of the same right wing panel is in the Museum of the City of Brussels.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} TBYs were radar-equipped, with a radome {{under the}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing.</b> The first aircraft flew on 20 August 1944. By this time though, the Avenger equipped every torpedo squadron in the Navy, {{and there was}} no need for the Sea Wolf; in addition, numerous small problems delayed entry into service. Orders were cancelled after production started, and the 180 built were used for training.|$|R
5000|$|The house {{a mixture}} of 16th century timber framing and 18th century brickwork. The <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing,</b> built in the early 16th century, {{features}} black and white timber framing decorated with lozenge panels and balustrading. This older wing contains both two and three light mullioned windows and a two-storey gabled porch. On a beam above the inner door of the porch is the inscription [...] ""Ralph Sutton, Carpenter".|$|R
5000|$|The {{upgraded}} {{cars for}} September 1967 also featured fuels tanks enlarged from 38 litres to 45 litres, which will presumably have marginally reduced luggage capacity, since {{the fuel tank}} was positioned {{on the right side}} of the boot/trunk, under the rear <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing.</b> The increase in fuel tank size applied to the saloons/sedans and the coupés but was not extended to the “Turnier” station wagon versions of the cars, ...|$|R

[...] "As the [...] cleared the second hill, it rolled over. The fuselage broke up as the [...] rolled. The outboard right wing impacted on the left side of the wreckage, the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> broke off and the rotodome section impacted on its back, breaking up the rest of the aircraft." ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{models of}} Bristol cars - {{those from the}} 404 of 1953 to the Fighter of 2004 carried a {{full-size}} spare wheel and tire in a pannier compartment built into the left-hand wing. This not only increased luggage space and allowed {{easy access to the}} spare without having to unload the trunk but improved weight distribution by keeping as much mass as possible within the wheelbase and balancing the weight of the battery, mounted in a similar compartment in the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{portrait}} {{was commissioned}} by the art loving Tommaso as the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> of a triptych. She was placed opposite her husband, with a now lost central Madonna and Child. [...] Their small size and intimacy suggests that the portraits were commissioned for private prayer, some art historians believe given that Tommaso's cultural acumen and preoccupation with his social standing, they were partially accessible to the public. The triptych may have been intended for the Portinari Chapel, located behind the apse of the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio, Milan, and constructed between 1462 and 1468.|$|R
50|$|The Porch House is a large, L-shaped {{house of}} three storeys in red brick under a slate roof, which {{is built around}} a courtyard. It is set well back from the street behind The Gateway, {{formerly}} its stable entrance, through which it is accessed. The Porch House is currently divided into two houses. The original entrance is to the left-hand wing, and has an arched fanlight with a pediment above. The <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> is a single bay wide and projects forwards; it has a modern entrance matching the original one.|$|R

5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing,</b> above the Adoration.|$|R
50|$|The two wings {{contained}} the servants rooms: sleeping quarters, stables, and greenhouses, placed {{where they could}} be watched by the master of the house. Where the wings join {{the main body of the}} house are the kitchens on the right and on the left the chapel, the altar still displaying its original retable. From the centre of the wings arched passages arched lead out: on the right to the gardens and on the left to the farmyard. The two entrances provide both convenience and break the monotony of the formal lines. A gallery runs along the first floor of the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An early {{example of}} a type of devotional image showing Jesus alone is a small panel by Barna da Siena of 1330-1350 in the Frick Collection. These {{continued}} through the Renaissance and Baroque period, with a [...] "close-up" [...] half length composition first appearing in Northern Italy around 1490. Somewhat in contrast to most andachtsbilder, the suffering of Christ is often less graphically depicted in these than in larger scenes where he is mobbed by a hostile crowd. [...] As triptychs became popular, the scene often occurs as the left-hand wing to a central Crucifixion, with an Entombment or Resurrection on the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{national}} laminar low research program, flight tests with a glove on the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> of the DLR research aircraft VFW 614 /ATTAS were carried out. The glove was especially designed to obtain three types of boundary layer instability: Tollmien-Schlichting instability (TSI), crossflow instability (CFI) and attachment line transition (ALT). In all tests, covering the Mach number range from 0. 35 to 0. 7, the complete transition line has been made visible by infrared image technique. Pressure distributions were measured and and used in stability analyses. Thus prediction by stability calculations at large Reynolds numbers has been obtained. Initial disturbance investigations provided information on the influence of engine noise and geometric steps on transition location...|$|R
5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing.</b> The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|R
5|$|The {{left-hand}} wing {{depicts the}} Crucifixion. It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling {{about in the}} mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure sky {{with a view of}} Jerusalem in the distance. The <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis of saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.|$|R

2500|$|No more {{has been}} {{heard of the}} rest of the {{triptych}} since the mentions below in the Provenance. [...] It would presumably have been an altarpiece, for a side-altar or small chapel. [...] The subjects of the other missing panels remain uncertain; a Nativity or Adoration of the Magi are considered most likely for the central panel, at least twice as wide as this one, with a Visitation of Mary or Presentation of Jesus on the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> matching this one. [...] The outer sides of the wings would probably have been painted in some fashion, but if there was a full scene, or even a figure in grisaille on the back of this, it is unlikely it would have been discarded when the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century. [...] No doubt the themes of this wing would originally have related to those in the other wings in ways we cannot now guess.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chromium-plated}} radiator shell was {{succeeded in}} August 1934 by a radiator cowl painted in body colour {{and the body}} given more modern <b>wings</b> with <b>valances</b> for better protection. The Harley was dropped for 1935.Sports variants were added in August 1933 with a lowered chassis and higher compression engine. A 4-seater sports tourer and a saloon named Greyhound. In 1936 another body named Kempton was available on the same chassis. These cars carry a distinctive radiator shell. The sports models shared the new illuminated semaphore direction indicators and synchromesh gears.|$|R
500|$|In {{a letter}} dated 1824 or 1825 Gustav Waagen, later Director of the Berlin Museums, gave his {{interpretation}} of Latin inscriptions he had seen on the original frame of the portrait, which was subsequently lost. [...] As well as a Christus signature, he found an identification of the sitter as [...] "a niece of the famous Talbots" [...] (eine Nichte des berühmten Talbots). His research led to a consensus that the sitter {{was a member of}} the leading English family, the Talbots, then headed by the Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1863 George Scharf suggested the panel was intended as the <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> to a diptych with the 1446 Portrait of Edward Grimston (or [...] "Grymston") in the National Gallery, London, leading to speculation that the girl might be Grimston's first wife, Alice. This was rejected by Grete Ring in 1913, on the basis that neither the dimensions nor background of the panels match, and that the Berlin panel was most probably completed some 20–30 years after the Grimston portrait.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{constructed}} in red brick with stone dressings and a slate roof. The entrance front is symmetrical in nine bays, with asymmetrical wings on each side. The central three bays project forward and have two storeys. In the middle bay is a round-arched doorway, now blocked but containing a sash window. At {{the sides of}} the doorway are Doric half-columns, and over the door is a Doric entablature and a segmental pediment. Above this is a tall round-arched window surround containing a sash window, above which is another pediment. In the bay on each side is a round-headed window in the lower storey and a smaller flat-headed window in the storey above. The lateral three bays on each side have 2½ storeys, with larger sash windows in the lower two storeys, and smaller windows above. The exception is the middle bay {{to the right of the}} central section that contains a single-storey porch with Doric columns. The <b>right-hand</b> <b>wing</b> has four bays plus a projecting pavilion containing a Venetian window in the lower storey and a diocletian window above. The left-hand wing has two bays, with a recessed three-bay billiard room beyond. The garden front is also symmetrical and in nine bays. At the centre is a two-storey semi-octagonal bay window. In its lower storey is a Venetian window that has been converted into a French window. On each side of it are Ionic pilasters, and above it are roundels. Over all this is an arched window.|$|R

50|$|Davis {{perceived}} {{that all was}} not {{as it should be}} - even tens of metres back up the road its surface was strewn with debris - and so entered the corner slower than would normally have been the case. Even so, his speed was such that, by the time he spotted the wreckage blocking the road in front of him, he did not have sufficient time to brake to a halt. Rather than also hit the stationary cars head-on Davis provoked the big Bentley into a slide. Because of this Davis hit the stricken cars sideways, striking first with the <b>right-hand</b> front <b>wing.</b> In spite of Daviss prompt action the impact was substantial, but unlike the other unfortunates he was able to restart his car and (once he had assured himself that his teammates and the Frenchmen were all accounted for and only slightly hurt) drive gently back to the pits.|$|R
5000|$|Tyres were Pirelli 225/40/16 P7000 directional, their 225 {{width and}} 40 profile made these the most {{aggressive}} standard-fit tyre supplied with any RD (or RD2) Hyundai Coupe. The [...] "F2" [...] also featured a deeper and more aggressive front spoiler, incorporating an oval chrome mesh grille insert. There was also [...] "F2" [...] badging on the front <b>wings</b> and rear <b>valance,</b> an uprated CD/tuner stereo by Sony (CDX C5000R with RDS), [...] "Coupe F2" [...] monogrammed aluminium kick plates, a unique leather-and-aluminium gearstick and a discreet [...] "Coupe F2" [...] badge on the ashtray fascia.

According to the Hyundai Coupe F2 brochure, total on-the-road price was £17,999 (as of July 1998).|$|R
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, handing it to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's <b>right-hand</b> rear <b>wing</b> endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him from taking the first position and he emerged in second place.|$|R

In his diary, the then Tsarevich Alexander recorded the momentous event {{of the birth of}} his first child, Around 12.30 my wife came to the bedroom and lay down on a couch where everything was prepared. The pains became stronger and stronger, and Minny suffered very much. Papa ... helped me hold my darling the whole time. Finally, at 2.30, the last minute came and suddenly all her suffering stopped. God sent us a son whom we named Nicholas. What a joy it was! It is impossible to imagine. I sprang to embrace my darling wife, and she instantly became cheerful and was terribly happy. I had been weeping like a child but suddenly my heart became light and cheerful.|$|R
5000|$|Standard 2.0 SE Coupes were {{delivered}} to MSD for mechanical and cosmetic modification. These modifications included a bigger front bumper/spoiler, a modified (larger and higher) rear spoiler with end-plates (these spoilers {{were designed by}} Stevens to create zero lift rather than ultimate downforce), a high-lift inlet camshaft (taken from the 1997 1.8-litre Lantra engine) and a 6"x4" [...] freeflow exhaust by Magnex (suppliers to Aston Martin). Wheels were 16" [...] diameter x 7.0J 5-spoke alloys manufactured by TSW (with Yokohama 205/45/16 tyres). There were [...] "F2 Evolution" [...] badges on the front <b>wings</b> and rear <b>valance.</b> Vehicle security was provided by a Thatcham-approved Category 1 alarm/immobiliser system. Inside, there was an uprated Sony stereo, [...] "Coupe F2 Evolution" [...] monogrammed aluminium kick plates, thicker lambswool carpets and cream instrument dials incorporating [...] "F2 Evolution" [...] logos. The front carpet mats were inlaid with silver-coloured circular [...] "Coupe F2 Evolution" [...] badges. The armrest lid between the front seats was covered in stitched leather (rather than the molded plastic found on lesser models). The gear leaver gaiter was of smooth leather, with a chrome trim surround at the base, manufactured by Richbrook. The gear-knob was of a unique design and had a chrome finish. Additionally, new brake pads were co-developed for the F2 Evolution by MSD and AP Racing, these new pads provided better [...] "bite" [...] and improved fade resistance.|$|R
