5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or <b>rhizomes</b> were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or <b>rhizomes</b> were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or <b>rhizomes</b> would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{typically}} {{includes a}} large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, {{as well as}} birds. The olive baboon eats leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, mushrooms, corms, and <b>rhizomes.</b> Corms and <b>rhizomes</b> are especially important in times of drought, because grass loses {{a great deal of}} its nutritional value. In dry, arid regions, such as the northeastern deserts, small invertebrates like insects, spiders, and scorpions fill out its diet.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the <b>rhizomes.</b> This is particularly important for young plants because their small <b>rhizomes,</b> with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this study, the {{antioxidant}} {{activities of}} {{different parts of}} lotus (Nelumbo nuficera Gaertn) <b>rhizome</b> were compared. The total phenolic content of lotus <b>rhizome</b> was determined, and Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) radical-scavenging assay and &# 946;-carotene-linoleic acid assay were performed to assess the antioxidant activity of lotus <b>rhizome.</b> Results showed {{that there was a}} significant difference in total phenolic content and antioxidant activity between any two of four parts of lotus <b>rhizome.</b> The order of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in different parts of lotus <b>rhizome</b> was as follows: peel of old lotus <b>rhizome</b> > peel of young lotus <b>rhizome</b> > flesh of old lotus <b>rhizome</b> > flesh of young lotus <b>rhizome.</b> The total phenol content is significantly positive correlated with the antioxidant activity in different parts of lotus <b>rhizome.</b> This study has provided a basis for further exploring the antioxidant components in lotus <b>rhizome...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Liliaceae {{probably}} arose as shade plants, {{with subsequent}} evolution to open areas including deciduous {{forest in the}} more open autumnal period. This {{was accompanied by a}} shift from <b>rhizomes</b> to bulbs, to more showy flowers, the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel-veined leaves.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) and sun loving genera. Shade-dwelling genera {{usually have}} broader leaves with smooth edges and net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, <b>rhizomes,</b> and small, {{inconspicuous}} flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, visually conspicuous flowers.

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} flower heads and growth from <b>rhizomes</b> {{distinguish it from}} E.vaginatum, which has a single flower head and grows from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2–12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E
5|$|In the North Island, Māori {{cultivated}} selected {{forms of}} C.australis for food. One of these, called tī para or tī tāwhiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple ﬂeshy <b>rhizomes.</b> A dwarf non-flowering selection of C.australis, {{it has a}} rubbery, pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar Cordyline 'Thomas Kirk'. Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from C.australis of the central North Island.|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} the underground organs in Ophiopogon japonicus（sensu lato）growing at the Kakuma hills, east of Kanazawa city. This species is a rhizomatous plant growing widely in Japan. Two types of <b>rhizome</b> were iden-tified : a vertical <b>rhizome</b> and an underground stolon. They are sometimes very similar in appearance and diffi-cult to identify. We {{found that the}} vertical <b>rhizome</b> had only foliage leaves and the underground stolon scale leaves. Thus the vertical <b>rhizome</b> and the underground stolon can be identified whether they have the remains of foliage leaves or not. The vertical <b>rhizome</b> and the underground stolon also differed in the growth pattern. These results lead {{to the conclusion that}} two types of plant grew side by side with each other at the Kakuma hills; one has only the vertical <b>rhizome</b> and the other develops the underground stolon as well as the vertical <b>rhizome...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>rhizome</b> of L. obscurum {{typically}} produces {{only one}} upright shoot {{per year and}} grows in a single direction. In {{the beginning of a}} growing season, the <b>rhizome</b> grows a few centimeters and then forms one branch at a 90° angle, alternating sides each year, which remains only millimeters in length. It then grows another couple of centimeters and then again branches off to the same side to form an aerial shoot. The <b>rhizome</b> branch produced each year is usually very weak and dies the next, but serves as a reserve <b>rhizome</b> apex, with the potential to become a new main <b>rhizome.</b> This happens if the plant is especially productive, or more frequently if the tip of the main <b>rhizome</b> is damaged so that it cannot grow. When a new main <b>rhizome</b> is formed, it makes a second 90° turn so that it is growing {{in the same direction as}} the <b>rhizome</b> from which it came. All underground branching occurs parallel to the ground, so upright shoots must then orient themselves appropriately in order to emerge from the soil.|$|R

5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred <b>rhizomes</b> from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E
5|$|Many tall palms are {{herbaceous}} monocots; {{these do}} not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood. In many tall palms, the terminal bud {{on the main}} stem {{is the only one}} to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to , but these are composed not of wood but of <b>rhizomes</b> which grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{stems and}} fleshy <b>rhizomes</b> of C.australis {{are high in}} natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (umu tī, a large type of hāngi) to produce kāuru, a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were {{stripped}} of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called kōuka—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around C.australis. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} <b>rhizomes</b> under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{altitude}} {{site where}} D.regia is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of a gravel bench formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a peaty quartzite sand, {{often with a}} gravel cover. <b>Rhizomes</b> of mature plants grow above ground and among associated grasses and sedges when gravel is absent and below ground {{when there is a}} gravel cover present. Associated vegetation included species of Leucadendron and members of the families Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, and Restionaceae. The habitat of D.regia depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from choking out D.regia. Frost occurs infrequently in the valley.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular trilliums in cultivation, {{primarily}} because of the size of its flowers and its relative ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is a slow and rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and <b>rhizomes</b> in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) is a delicate process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, T. grandiflorum may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions rather than the rule. One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so well out of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, T. grandiflorum can continue flowering every year after it has begun.|$|E

This study was designed to characterize the transcriptome profiling of the <b>rhizome</b> and leaf of Atractylodes lancea in an attempt to uncover the molecular mechanisms regulating <b>rhizome</b> formation and growth. Over 270 million clean reads were assembled into 92, 366 unigenes, 58 % of which are homologous with sequences in public protein databases (NR, Swiss-Prot, GO, and KEGG). Analysis of expression levels showed that genes involved in photosynthesis, stress response, and translation were the most abundant transcripts in the leaf, while transcripts involved in stress response, transcription regulation, translation, and metabolism were dominant in the <b>rhizome.</b> Tissue-specific gene analysis identified distinct gene families active in the leaf and <b>rhizome.</b> Differential gene expression analysis revealed a clear difference in gene expression pattern, identifying 1, 518 up-regulated genes and 3, 464 down-regulated genes in the <b>rhizome</b> compared with the leaf,, including a series of genes related to signal transduction, primary and secondary metabolism. Transcription factor (TF) analysis identified 42 TF families, with 67 and 60 TFs up-regulated in the <b>rhizome</b> and leaf, respectively.

40|$|Bamboo (Phyllostachys praecox) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} members of the grass family Poaceae, and {{is one of the}} most {{economically}} important crops in Asia. However, complete knowledge of bamboo development and its molecular mechanisms is still lacking. In the present study, the differences in anatomical structure among <b>rhizome</b> buds, <b>rhizome</b> shoots, and bamboo shoots were compared, and several genes related to the development of the bamboo <b>rhizome</b> bud were identified. The rice cross-species microarray hybridization showed a total of 318 up-regulated and 339 down-regulated genes, including those involved in regulation and signalling, metabolism, and stress, and also cell wall-related genes, in the bamboo <b>rhizome</b> buds versus the leaves. By referring to the functional dissection of the homologous genes from Arabidopsis and rice, the putative functions of the 52 up-regulated genes in the bamboo <b>rhizome</b> bud were described. Six genes related to the development of the bamboo <b>rhizome</b> bud were further cloned and sequenced. These show 66 – 90 % nucleotide identity and 68 – 98 % amino acid identity with the homologous rice genes. The expression patterns of these genes revealed significant differences in <b>rhizome</b> shoots, <b>rhizome</b> buds, bamboo shoots, leaves, and young florets. Furthermore, in situ hybridization showed that the PpRLK 1 gene is expressed in the procambium and is closely related to meristem development of bamboo shoots. The PpHB 1 gene is expressed at the tips of bamboo shoots and procambium, and is closely related to <b>rhizome</b> bud formation and procambial development. To our knowledge, this is the first report that uses rice cross-species hybridization to identify genes related to bamboo <b>rhizome</b> bud development, and thereby contributes to the further understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in bamboo <b>rhizome</b> bud development...|$|R
