50|$|One <b>radiotracking</b> {{study focused}} on {{dispersal}} of Washington ground squirrels. It found that 72% percent of juvenile males dispersed in April. Dispersal distances ranged from 40-3521 meters and the median dispersal distance was 880 meters. Twenty to 56% of radio-collared juvenile squirrels survived to estivation. Raptors and badgers were the primary causes of mortality. Survival rates of dispersers were higher than non-dispersers, mostly due to badger predation on natal sites.|$|E

40|$|This study {{measured}} {{the accuracy of}} two <b>radiotracking</b> techniques: (1) triangulation using a Yagi antenna and (2) a form of direct location, the extended-reach technique, which uses a small loop antenna attached to a lightweight 9 -m telescopic pole. The {{study was conducted in}} the Cotter River, an upland stream in the Australian Capital Territory. Radio tags were positioned instream to determine whether depth, substrate, or local bank profile affected <b>radiotracking</b> accuracy. The extended-reach technique was more accurate (mean error 6 SE 젱. 00 6 0. 21 m) than triangulation (2. 57 6 0. 21 m). Decreased accuracy resulted from the triangulation of radio tags positioned close to boulders or in water more than 1 m deep. These variables had no effect on the accuracy of the extended-reach technique. The presence or absence of a steep rocky bank did not affect the accuracy of either radio-tracking method. The increased accuracy of the extended-reach technique provides an improvement over traditional methods for studying the small-scale movement and microhabitat use of crayfishes (e. g., Eustacus spp.) and benthic fishes in upland streams.

We used <b>radiotracking</b> data from 3 male and 3 female pandas to study their movement patterns between 1991 and 1995 in Foping NR.

The pandas climbed from the winter to the summer habitats within a period of 8 days from 7 to 15 June, and descended to the winter habitat between 1 September and 6 October. Therefore, the pandas spent about three-fourths of the year (average 243 days) in their winter activity range and an average of 78 days in the summer activity range.

The study {{took place in}} plantation forest, inhabited by the New Zealand long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus), in which trees are harvested between the ages 26 - 32 years. We determined home ranges by <b>radiotracking</b> different bats in areas that had and had not been recently clear-fell harvested. Home ranges were smaller in areas that had been harvested. Adult male bats selected 20 - 25 year old stands within home ranges before and after harvest. Males selected edges with open unplanted areas when harvest had not occurred but no longer selected these at proportions greater than their availability post harvest, probably because they were then readily available. This is the first <b>radiotracking</b> study to demonstrate a change in home range size and selection concomitant with felling of large areas of plantation forest, and thus quantify negative effects of forestry operations on this speciose group.

Dispersal was a rare event and is probably confused with wandering in the existing literature. A total of 17 weather variables were analyzed for correlations with vole movement. Male voles showed a distinct tendency to move more widely during periods of dry weather. The latter was attributed to the negative effects of dry weather on the ability of male voles to detect the odors of male competitors.

40|$|Many bat species live in groups, {{some of them}} {{in highly}} complex social systems, but the reasons for sociality in bats remain largely unresolved.

Our results confirmed that simultaneously <b>radiotracked</b> individuals from the same colony foraged together significantly more than expected by chance. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that many bats are social because of information transfer between foraging group members.

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} present major challenges for wildlife conservation since connectivity between suitable habitat patches {{is needed for}} dispersal, allowing for genetic exchange between populations.

Home range estimates for these were larger than those documented for pacas inhabiting broadleaf forests of Panama and Costa Rica.
