25|$|These are {{required}} to produce white light by U.S. and international UN Regulations. However, some countries have at various times permitted amber <b>reversing</b> <b>lights.</b> In Australia and New Zealand, for example, vehicle manufacturers were faced {{with the task of}} localising American cars originally equipped with combination red brake/turn signal lamps and white <b>reversing</b> <b>lights.</b> Those countries' regulations permitted the amber rear turn signals to burn steadily as <b>reversing</b> <b>lights,</b> so automakers and importers were able to combine the (mandatorily amber) rear turn signal and (optionally amber) reversing light function, and so comply with the regulations without the need for additional lighting devices. Both countries presently require white <b>reversing</b> <b>lights,</b> so the combination amber turn/reverse light is no longer permitted on new vehicles. The U.S. state of Washington presently permits reversing lamps to emit white or amber light.|$|E
25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, radial tyres, <b>reversing</b> <b>lights,</b> heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|E
2500|$|This {{facelift}} incorporated smaller headlights, a new grille {{and rear}} light clusters that included <b>reversing</b> <b>lights.</b> The amount of chrome trim was reduced and generally replaced by black plastic. At {{the end of}} summer, the ZS coupé variant was given an [...] 1,360cc engine to improve its performance. The existing 72PS version remained on sale {{at a lower price}} until the 1984 model year was introduced. The power gain was achieved by using two carburetors rather than one double-barrel unit.|$|E
50|$|The XT {{received}} a minor update in 1987 {{for the second}} half of the 1987 model year, roughly corresponding to the 1988 launch of the XT6. Early XTs are easily distinguished from later models by inspecting the taillight and <b>reverse</b> <b>light</b> configuration - early models had <b>reverse</b> <b>lights</b> in the rear bumper, while 1987-up models had the <b>reverse</b> <b>lights</b> in the center taillight panel. All wheel drive turbo and six-cylinder models can be distinguished by the shape of the headrests; base models had solid headrests, whereas the turbo AWD and six-cylinder models had a large rectangular hole through the center.|$|R

2500|$|The coupé {{gained a}} third (cheaper) {{commercial}} variant {{with only two}} seats, the ZA, and all coupé variants were given larger rear light clusters with integral <b>reversing</b> <b>lights.</b> Higher specification five-door models gained the larger headlights and grille introduced for the coupé. The more powerful engine from the ZS was briefly available in the five-door hatchback [...] "Sundgau" [...] special edition, of which 1,200 examples were built in March and April 1978. For 1979 the ZL Coupé was upgraded to a [...] version of the 1,124cc engine.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark III, {{introduced}} in March 1967, {{was the first}} major facelift to the Spitfire. The front bumper was raised in response to new crash regulations, as well as the front coil springs being slightly raised, which made the car sometimes look a little out of proportion. Although much of the bonnet pressing was carried over, the front end looked quite different. The rear lost the overriders from the bumper but gained <b>reversing</b> <b>lights</b> as standard (initially as two separate lights {{on either side of the}} number plate, latterly as a single light in a new unit above the number plate); the interior was improved again with a wood-veneer instrument surround and a smaller 15-inch wire spoked steering wheel. A folding hood replaced the earlier [...] "build it yourself" [...] arrangement. For most of the Mark III range, the instrument cluster was still centre-mounted (as in the Mark I and Mark II) so as to reduce parts bin counts (and thereby production costs) for right-hand and left-hand drive versions.|$|E
5000|$|... 1969 - The other R16 models get {{the same}} wheels and brakes as the TS. The TS gets <b>reversing</b> <b>lights</b> (mounted beneath the taillights). The other models are {{available}} with <b>reversing</b> <b>lights</b> as an optional extra.|$|E

50|$|A Vynide-covered bench {{front seat}} was {{standard}} {{on the base}} model and Super Victor but individual seats were standard on the De Luxe and optional on the lower-priced cars. Other options included a heater, fog lamps, radio, screen washers, <b>reversing</b> <b>light</b> and seat belts.|$|R
50|$|The {{previously}} stand-alone {{fog lamps}} were {{built into the}} front of the car, recessed in the middle of new circular air intakes, one for the heater, the other for the carburettors. The rear number plate and the various lamps and <b>reversing</b> <b>lights</b> were re-arranged.|$|E
50|$|Show room {{appeal was}} {{enhanced}} by the inclusion {{in the price of}} reclining seats with built-in head restraints, radio, clock, <b>reversing</b> <b>lights</b> and servo-assistance on the brakes: these were features which, where available on competitor models, tended to be offered only as options at extra cost.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, larger {{taillights}} integrated the <b>reversing</b> <b>lights</b> {{and larger}} wrap-around turn signals. Still larger and wider taillights increased side visibility. In 1972, large square-section bumpers replaced the smooth round originals. For the USA model only, 1973 modifications {{mandated by the}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) included energy-absorbing bumpers. A carpeted package shelf replaced the rear seat.|$|E
50|$|The C4 was {{designed}} to be the successor to the Citroën Xsara. It is mechanically similar to the Peugeot 308, which was launched in 2007. A revised version, with a new front end, <b>reverse</b> <b>lights,</b> and dashboard revisions, was launched for the 2008/2009 model year.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} years saw the radiator grille painted black (rather than grey). In 1976, the 101L replaced the De Luxe model, featuring new bumpers with rubber trim, flat-folding seat backs, chrome-trimmed radiator grille, <b>reverse</b> <b>light,</b> electric windshield-washer pump, coolant-temperature gauge, cigarette lighter and servo brakes.|$|R

50|$|The Interceptor {{may have}} taken some styling cues from the Brasinca Uirapuru, with a {{distinctive}} large, curving wrap-around rear window that doubled as a tailgate. The original specification included electric windows, reclining front seats, a wood rimmed steering wheel, radio with twin speakers, <b>reversing</b> <b>lights</b> and an electric clock. Power steering was included as standard from September 1968.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the 404 Super Luxe and 404 (8 CV) Comfort are dis{{continue}}d, {{leaving the}} Grand Touring, Break and Family models {{to continue in}} petrol and diesel forms.

New XC7 engine fitted (de-tuned to 73 hp), but with torque equivalent to XC6.|$|E
25|$|The Mark IV, {{launched}} in 1976, introduced a front rubber mounted subframe with single tower bolts and larger bushes {{in the rear}} frame. In addition twin stalk indicators were introduced with larger foot pedals, and from 1977 onwards the rear indicator lamps had the <b>reverse</b> <b>lights</b> incorporated in them.|$|R

It is akin to a quiet nocturnal walk along a starlit jungle path, watching birds in their nocturnal surroundings and hearing them beckon each other.|$|R
5000|$|The play {{is written}} to be staged under a <b>reversed</b> <b>lighting</b> scheme: the play opens on a darkened stage.
