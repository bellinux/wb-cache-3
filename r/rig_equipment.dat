40|$|AbstractEarly kick {{detection}} is {{of great}} concern while drilling wells. The late kick detection can lead to uncontrolled blowout which increases the possibility of injury and potential lose of life and equipment. Causes of kick {{and the importance of}} early kick detection are introduced. Kick detection from mud logging real time data and kick detection in the offshore Nile Delta are discussed. Limitation of the conventional well control procedure in low permeable formation is introduced. A comparison between gas parameters warning sign and drilling parameters warning sign was carried out. A new advanced early kick detection method is proposed based on more than 10 years of experience in monitoring real time mud logging data while drilling and analyzing flow and kick reports. The proposed advanced early kick detection method uses additional accurate flow check using trip tank and recommends adding two additional accurate pressure sensors while shut-in well. The proposed method has a great advantage using gas parameters which can detect near-balance state before kick occur. The advanced kick detection method does not require any <b>rig</b> <b>equipment</b> modification nor interfere with any drilling operation. Case studies in the offshore Nile Delta wells illustrate the limitation of the conventional well control procedure and the advantage of the proposed method...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith the {{increasing}} number of deep offshore drilling operations, operators and service companies are confronted by technical challenges ever growing in complexity. Extreme conditions encountered at these depths require an adaptation of the drilling muds. In particular, the range of temperatures and pressures encountered (as low as - 1 °C and up to 400 bar) is favorable for the formation of gas hydrates. Gas hydrates are solid structures formed from water and gas; water contained in drilling muds under certain temperature and pressure conditions will form solid cages that entrap the gas molecules. Formation of these solid gas hydrates is liable to plug kill and chokelines as well as the annular and may cause interruption of the drilling operation and even destruction of <b>rig</b> <b>equipment.</b> Deep offshore drilling operators are aware of this problem, and some operational solutions and drilling mud formulations have been proposed and utilized, but when extreme water depths are attained, classical inhibitor solutions alone may be ineffective. The usual way to determine the thermodynamic conditions of the formation of gas hydrates in drilling mud formulations is to use a pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) cell. This technique requires heavy instrumentation and often does not permit work with a whole formulation (especially in the presence of solids). Moreover, PVT cells do not give a quantitative evaluation of the kinetic properties of gas hydrate formation. In this work, we present experiments using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of methane hydrate in calcium chloride solutions. Additionally, thermograms of an emulsion and a complete drilling mud are presented that show the possibility of characterizing hydrate thermodynamics in complex systems as synthetic mud formulations. This technique is easy to use, and, when correctly interpreted, it enables the dangerous zones for hydrate formation to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of rotating machinery {{is crucial in}} industry. It can prevent long term outages that can prove costly, prevent injury to machine operators, and lower product quality. Induction motors, often described as the workhorse of industry, are popular in industry because of their robustness, efficiency {{and the need for}} low maintenance. They are, however, prone to faults when used improperly or under strenuous conditions. Gearboxes are also an important component in industry, used to transmit motion and force by means of successively engaging teeth. They too are prone to damage and can disrupt industrial processes if failure is unplanned for. Reciprocating compressors are widely used in the petroleum and the petrochemical industry. Their complex structure, and operation under poor conditions makes them prone to faults, making condition monitoring necessary to prevent accidents, and for maintenance decision-making and cost minimization. Various techniques have been extensively investigated and found to be reliable tools for the identification of faults in these machines. This thesis, however, sets out to establish a single non-invasive tool {{that can be used to}} identify the faults on all these machines. Literature on condition {{monitoring of}} induction motors, gearboxes, and reciprocating compressors is extensively reviewed. The time, frequency, and time-frequency domain techniques that are used in this thesis are also discussed. Statistical indicators were used in the time domain, the Fourier Transform in the frequency domain, and Wavelet Transforms in the time-frequency domain. Vibration and current, which are two of the most popular parameters for fault detection, were considered. The test <b>rig</b> <b>equipment</b> that is used to carry to the experiments, which comprised a modified Machine Fault Simulator -Magnum (MFS-MG), is presented and discussed. The fault detection strategies rely on the presence of a fault signature. The test rig that was used allows for the simulation of individual or multiple concurrent faults to the test machinery. The experiments were carried out under steady-state and transient conditions with the faults in the machines isolated, and then with multiple faults implemented concurrently. The results of the fault detection strategies are analysed, and conclusions are drawn based on the performances of these tools in the detection of the faults in the machinery...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring the {{drilling}} operation, a viscous fluid called drilling mud is injected inside the tubing and lifts the solids cuttings {{to the surface}} through the annular space between the tubing and the formation. Drilling muds may be water based (brine solutions of clays and polymers) or oil based (invert emulsion of brine in oil). With {{the increasing number of}} deep offshore drilling operations, operators and service companies are confronted to more and more complex technical challenges. Extreme conditions encountered at these depths require an adaptation of {{the drilling}} muds. In particular, range of temperature and pressure (up to – 1 °C and 400 Bars) are favorable conditions to the formation of gas hydrates. Hydrates are solid structures formed from water and gas: water contained in drilling muds will form, under certain temperature and pressure conditions, a solid cage which entraps the gas molecules coming from the reservoir.

This technique requires heavy instrumentation and often does not permit to work with a whole formulation (specially in the presence of solids).

An innovative methodology was elaborated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to determine the thermodynamic equilibrium properties and kinetics of hydrate formation in mud formulations, particularly in the presence of large amounts of mineral. This technique allows the measurement of heat transfers as a function of time, temperature and pressure and thus detects phase transitions. Using DSC, hydrate appearance in several drilling muds formulations (WBM or OBM) is shown and quantified. Validation with PVT cell measurement and investigation of the influence of several additives (salts, solids) are performed. The influence of hydrocarbon composition i. e. methane or natural gas on hydrate formation is studied for different mud continuous phases. A methodology using isothermal experiments to quantify kinetics of hydrate formation is proposed. The effectiveness of several inhibitors is also measured. Through this work, DSC has proven to be an efficient and easy to use technique for characterizing hydrate formation in drilling muds...|$|E
