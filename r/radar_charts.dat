5000|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>charts</b> are {{a useful}} way to display multivariate {{observations}} with an arbitrary number of variables. [...] Each star represents a single observation. Typically, <b>radar</b> <b>charts</b> are generated in a multi-plot format with many stars on each page and each star representing one observation. The star plot {{was first used}} by Georg von Mayr in 1877. <b>Radar</b> <b>charts</b> differ from glyph plots in that all variables are used to construct the plotted star figure. There is no separation into foreground and background variables. Instead, the star-shaped figures are usually arranged in a rectangular array on the page. It is somewhat easier to see patterns in the data if the observations are arranged in some non-arbitrary order (if the variables are assigned to the rays of the star in some meaningful order).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Tea {{garden tiller}} {{is one of}} the most widely used in China, which is {{indispensable}} equipment for soil tilling in tea garden. The performance of tea garden tiller is always focused on when being used. Meanwhile, researches on evaluating the performance of tea garden tiller have been rarely reported. So it is of importance to find a methodology to evaluate tiller’s performance. In this paper, the important indexes of tiller performances are presented firstly, including fuel consumption, cultivation time, cultivation depth, cultivation width and soil crushing ratio. Then these indexes for eight different types of cultivation machineries from home and abroad are experimented and detected. Thirdly, rough sets and <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> are utilized for performance evaluation of cultivation machineries, where rough set theory is to determine the weight of performance index and <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> for performance analysis. Finally, performance of cultivation machinery is analyzed based on <b>radar</b> <b>chart,</b> which can provide the convenience and proof of optimal cultivation machinery selection for farmers. The results of <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> analysis show that operational performance of KAMA B is the best and Little White Dragon B stand the second place. In addition, from the performance analysis, the deficiencies of service cultivation machinery can be found and the improvements can be suggested...|$|R

5000|$|An {{illustration}} of the conceptual framework of a predictive manufacturing system is shown in Figure 1. [...] The system starts out with a data acquisition system that can either be built-in by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or a third party provider. Using appropriate sensor assemblies, various signals such as vibration, pressure, temperature, etc. can be recorded. The types of signals and data acquisition parameters {{are determined by the}} application and the failure modes of the asset being monitored. Communication protocols, such as MTConnect and OLE-DB Process Control or OPC, can help users to acquire process or controller signals. Such data can provide context as to the type of action/function the machine was performing when sensor data was being collected. Imagine when all data are gathered and combined with all the assets in a facility. When all the data are aggregated, this phenomenon is called “Big Data” because of the volume of data collected, velocity by which data is being received and variety of data that are being collated. Such phenomenon requires new paradigms and approaches for analysis instead of statistical process control or other traditional statistical analysis techniques. The new transforming agent then consists of several components: an integrated platform, predictive analytics and visualization tools. The deployment platform is naturally selected based on several factors such as speed of computation, investment cost, ease of deployment for scaling purposes and update, etc. The actual processing or transformation of big data into useful information is performed by utilizing predictive analytics such as the tools found in the Watchdog Agent® toolbox that has been developed by researchers at the National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Research Cooperative Center (I/UCRC) for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) since 2001. There are also other predictive analytic providers such as IBM, Hadoop, SAS, SAP, etc. The algorithms found in the Watchdog Agent® can be categorized into four sections namely, signal processing and feature extraction, health assessment, performance prediction and fault diagnosis. By utilizing visualization tools, health information such as current condition, remaining useful life estimation, root cause, etc., can be effectively conveyed using <b>radar</b> <b>charts,</b> fault maps, risk charts and even health degradation curves. The calculated health information can then be forwarded or made available to existing company management systems such as enterprise resource planning system (ERP), manufacturing execution system (MES), supply chain management system (SCM), customer relation management system (CRM), product lifecycle management system (PLM) to achieve overall enterprise control and optimization. With manufacturing transparency, management then has the appropriate information (such as actual condition and state of machines, not just cycle times) to determine factory-wide overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). By knowing when assets will fail, equipment can then be managed more effectively with just-in-time maintenance. Finally, if historical health and failure modes can be compiled, such information can then be fed back to the equipment designer for closed loop lifecycle redesign ...|$|E

The current medical treatment system in Japan lacks the holistic concepts of traditional oriental medicine of which the meridian system is an important component. In the present study, we developed a new meridian diagnosis instrument to determine the quantitative and qualitative balance of the human body, based on traditional oriental medical theory. A newly devised three point system equipment with a constant current (10 μA) generation circuit (INA 126) was used to clinically measure the electrical resistance value of the 12 true meridian routes. Furthermore, the electro-physiological background was also investigated. The measured value of the meridian flow resistance of the 12 true meridians was displayed on a meridian flow <b>radar</b> <b>chart,</b> and a traditional oriental medical diagnosis was conducted based on the changes in values on the <b>radar</b> <b>chart.</b> In addition, we also investigated the clinical effect of treatment with acupuncture and oriental herbal medicine of a chronic pain patient diagnosed using <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> values...|$|R
