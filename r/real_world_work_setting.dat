This paper presents a solution to providing students practical work experience that will aid them in obtaining future employment in Forensics. Currently under development at Leeds Beckett University is a student led data recovery service, which will be provided to all staff and students, using mixed level groupings of students. This service is designed to provide a rich, interactive environment that enables students to gain hands-on experience in an unknown and dynamically changing environment. Plans have received positive support from both Faculty Leadership and students. The service is due to start in September 2016.

In this paper we describe and elaborate around the usage of different work analysis methods in a complex, <b>real</b> <b>world</b> <b>work</b> domain: collaborative review of large-scale 3 D engineering models. The analysis is based on (i) input from experts in the oil platform engineering field, (ii) previous and related work and (iii) application of different methods considering the recent advances in technology. We conclude that hierarchical task analysis was not effective in obtaining a clear, common vision about the work domain.

This study aims to describe and evaluate the design and implementation of an authentic assessment in a pharmacy undergraduate course. A five-dimensional model for authentic instruction was utilized in the design of the learning experience. This was complemented with an eight-element framework that contributed to create an authentic assessment. Two surveys explored subjective authenticity as perceived by students and stakeholders. The results revealed that students find it hard to value their performance at the higher level that stakeholders do. While the use of models and frameworks in the design of authentic assessment is valuable, academics’ efforts need to be concentrated on further developing student’s metacognitive skills in order to provide relevancy and value to the knowledge, skills and attitudes developed in undergraduate tertiary education...|$|R
