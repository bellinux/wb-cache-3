5|$|The {{sequence}} at Miami International Airport {{was partly}} {{shot at the}} Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show Top Gear, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports. In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> of the vehicle to move it up and backwards {{at the moment of}} full extension away from the plane.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{collaborated with}} other {{companies}} to produce Halo-themed merchandise and promotions at retailers and vendors. PepsiCo created {{a variant of}} Mountain Dew called Game Fuel. 7-Eleven sold a Slurpee version of the drink. Burger King announced a special promotion starting September 24, 2007 featuring Halo designs and characters on food wrappings. Microsoft sponsored the #40 car driven by David Stremme for Chip Ganassi Racing in the Dover 400 Nextel Cup Series. The racecar featured a Halo 3 inspired paintjob featuring the title for the game printed prominently on the hood and <b>rear</b> <b>bumper,</b> as well as large pictures of Master Chief {{on each of the}} rear fenders.|$|E
5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> with fixed tailpipes.|$|E

5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the <b>rear</b> <b>bumper,</b> to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E
5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger. This substantially reduces engine noise while bringing gains to power and torque.|$|E
5|$|By the 84th lap, Kyle Busch's {{lead was}} {{half a second}} from Kurt Busch. Two laps later, Sam Hornish, Jr. {{collided}} with the wall and suffered three flat tires, prompting the second caution. During the caution, most of the leaders made pit stops. Kyle Busch remained the leader after the pit stops and maintained it at the lap 91 restart. Montoya moved into ninth, as Stewart passed Reutimann for third on the same. Two laps later, Jeff Gordon had moved up into ninth. Sunlight came off the track surface by lap 99, causing track temperatures to cool and drivers were reminded by their crew chiefs to drive cautiously in the turns. Martin moved into the thirteenth position by lap 102. Ambrose had moved into third nine laps later. On lap 113, Johnson rejoined the track, albeit without his car's <b>rear</b> <b>bumper.</b> Kyle Busch had built up a {{one and a half}} second lead over Kurt Busch by lap 116. Johnson drove to pit road to resolve tire rubbing problems two laps later.|$|E

5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E

25|$|All four {{versions}} of the Hornet were mostly carryovers in 1974, with minimal trim changes. The car's front bumper lost its full-width vinyl rub strip but gained two rubber-faced bumper guards. A larger <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> was added to meet new 5mph legislation, and the license plate was moved up to a position between the taillights.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{differences}} from a standard V70 AWD include a unique front and <b>rear</b> <b>bumper,</b> unpainted sidetrim and sills, a squarer {{version of the}} roof rails, a unique front grille and a big Cross Country decal across the tailgate.

The <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> from 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors will interchange, {{as well as the}} dashboard, seats, and other inside trim pieces. Windshields and the doors with their side glass are interchangeable with all two-door Classic and Ambassador models.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet honored California beach resorts {{once again}} by naming the top Chevelle series Laguna with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply Deluxe. In {{addition}} to the standard 350 2 barrel V8, Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling including a body-colored urethane front end concealing the new 5mph bumper system. On minor impact the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock- absorbing cylinders, deflects and rebounds; Laguna models also featured a specific diecast chrome grille with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) <b>rear</b> <b>bumper,</b> front and <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna Estate. Laguna interiors were pattern cloth and vinyl or optional breathable all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.|$|E
25|$|For 1974, a new <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> system {{replaced}} the squared tail and chrome <b>rear</b> <b>bumper</b> blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license plate holder and recesses for the trademark round taillights. Underneath sat a box-section aluminum impact bar on two Omark-bolt slider brackets {{similar to the}} system used in the nose which allowed the Corvette to pass federal five-mph impact tests at the rear {{as well as the}} front. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-date than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. For the 1974 model only, casting limitations mandated left and right bumper covers with a vertical center seam. The anti-theft alarm key activator was moved from the rear panel to the front left fender. Tailpipes were now turned down as the new bumper cover eliminated the tailpipe extensions.|$|E
50|$|Based on the Mercedes-Benz GLA 250, it {{includes}} redesigned front and <b>rear</b> <b>bumpers,</b> grained side sills, {{as well as}} bodywork finished with satin chrome-plated inserts with metallic finish along with an increased ride height.|$|R
