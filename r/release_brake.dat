50|$|This type of {{retarder}} {{is known}} as Jake brake or compression <b>release</b> <b>brake.</b> A disadvantage of this system is that it becomes very noisy in operation, particularly if the exhaust muffler is faulty; its use is therefore banned in some locales.|$|E
50|$|The {{automatic}} {{vacuum brake}} as described represented a considerable technical advance in train braking. In practice steam locomotives had two ejectors, a small ejector for running purposes (to exhaust air that had leaked into the train pipe) {{and a large}} ejector to <b>release</b> <b>brake</b> applications. Later Great Western Railway practice was to use a vacuum pump instead of the small ejector.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compression}} <b>release</b> <b>brake</b> (also {{known as}} a Jacobs brake or [...] "jake brake"), {{is the type of}} brake most commonly confused with real engine braking; it is used mainly in large diesel trucks and works by opening the exhaust valves {{at the top of the}} compression stroke, so the large amount of energy stored in that compressed air is not returned to the crankshaft, but is released into the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|When a skid developed, {{the wheel}} would stop, {{stopping}} the drum along with it. The flywheel, {{driven by the}} one-way clutch, continued to spin. If the relative angle between the drum and flywheel reached 60 degrees, the drum would be driven forward to press on a valve. This <b>released</b> <b>brake</b> fluid into a reservoir, lowering hydraulic pressure, and <b>releasing</b> the <b>brakes.</b> As soon as the drum started spinning again and reached the (slowing) speed of the flywheel, the valve was <b>released</b> and the <b>brakes</b> re-applied. The system could cycle about ten times a second, and could hold the brakes off for up to four seconds in total before the reservoir filled.|$|R
50|$|Božić's {{invention}} resolved then unsolvable problems, such as solutions distributor (main braking device). Three working pressures increased {{air velocity}} stab {{in the main}} air pipe (along the train) from 80 to 150 m/s He invented {{solutions to the problem}} of gradual <b>release</b> <b>brake,</b> non-exhaustion during braking, an overfull working chamber, load-adaptive braking. He first proposed braking of passenger trains as a function of speed (brakes with two working pressure). He also constructed an efficient brake controller for locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the train}} ever starts on its journey, the {{locomotives}} and {{the cars are}} checked. This is done by mechanical department workers, sometimes cameras and scanners are also used. Some of the items certified good to go are things like the braking system including hand-brake <b>release,</b> <b>brake</b> application, condition of the air valves, piping and hoses, communication equipment, and many more. Very much like the checklist an airline might use. When the pretrip work is done, the train is considered safe to move.|$|E
50|$|Diesel {{compression}} <b>release</b> <b>brake</b> controls {{consist of}} an on/off switch and, often, a multi-position switch {{that controls the}} number of cylinders on which the brake is active. Throttle and clutch switches are integral with the system. Activation occurs when both the clutch is released with transmission in gear and the throttle is released. It is the driver's job to ascertain the correct transmission gear to use depending on, for example, the steepness of the grade and whether the truck is loaded or empty.|$|E

50|$|More {{sophisticated}} {{technologies in}} use nowadays generally employ couplings {{that have no}} loose slack, although there is elastic movement at the couplings; continuous braking is provided, so that every vehicle on the train has brakes controlled by the driver. Generally this uses compressed air as a control medium, {{and there is a}} measurable time lag as the signal (to apply or <b>release</b> <b>brakes)</b> propagates along the train.|$|R
30|$|Perplexing is {{the fact}} that PD- 1 and CTLA- 4 {{checkpoint}} inhibitors, even when helped by cancer vaccines, are not effective against all cancer types, nor do they work in every patient with the same cancer. Perhaps other immune cell types are negatively affecting cancer immunotherapy? The explanation we put forward to explain this dilemma is that in some cancers we have the machinery (the car) on a downhill slope, so if we <b>release</b> the <b>brake</b> (immune checkpoint inhibitors) the car can move. In contrast, when we are on an uphill slope or on a plain field, <b>releasing</b> the <b>brake</b> simply does not move the car. For such scenarios, we have to <b>release</b> the <b>brake</b> and push the accelerator.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} to the late-1970s, engine compression-releases {{were also used}} to {{supplement}} rear-wheel braking on many two-stroke engine powered motorcycles, primarily those used off-road or for various types of dirt-track racing, such as motocross and flat-tracking. Since two-stroke engines normally lack the compression braking effect of four-stroke engines when the throttle is shut off, {{the addition of a}} compression <b>release</b> <b>brake</b> on two-strokes essentially mimicked the four-stroke compression braking effect. Using throttle-off engine compression for at least some braking on both two-stroke and four stroke motorcycles was especially important during that era, since most motorcycles used drum-brakes, which would wear-out much more quickly than modern disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|A “Jake Brake” is {{an engine}} {{compression}} <b>release</b> <b>brake</b> used especially for steep hill downgrades. The Jake Brake opens the exhaust valves when the piston is near {{top dead center}} (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses {{the air in the}} cylinder to 1/15th its original volume, which creates drag on the engine. The Jacobs Engine Brake then releases the compressed air and the energy stored in it before it can push back on the piston during the down stroke. The Jake Brake turns a power producing engine into a power absorbing air compressor and in turn, causes the truck to slow down.Inside of the truck, the driver can choose how many cylinders to activate; the more cylinders activated, the more slowing of the truck.|$|E
50|$|Proper braking {{technique}} is essential. The brakes {{should be applied}} firmly until reaching a point just short of a skid. At {{the first sign of}} a skid, the pilot should <b>release</b> <b>brake</b> pressure and allow the wheels to spin up. Directional control should be maintained as far as possible with the rudder. Remember that in a crosswind, if aquaplaning should occur, the crosswind will cause the aircraft to simultaneously weathervane into the wind (i.e. the nose will turn toward the wind) as well as slide downwind (the plane will tend to slide in the direction the air is moving). For small aircraft, holding the nose up as if performing a soft field landing and using the rudder to aerodynamically maintain directional control while holding the upwind aileron {{in the best position to}} prevent lifting the wing should help. However, avoid landing in heavy rain where the crosswind component of the wind is higher than the maximum demonstrated crosswind listed in the Pilot Operations Handbook.|$|E

The focus is on the prediction of engine brake torque, exhaust gas temperatures and mass flow rates. The implemented models are tuned on the basis of steady-state engine data. Transient simulation results, i. e. for the activation of the engine brake, show good agreement with measurements. The developed model has been used to analyze the possibility to use the engine brake to facilitate automatic gear switching. This has been verified by measurements on an actual vehicle and resulted in much smoother and faster gear shift...|$|E

50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>release</b> {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} {{at the start of}} a runway, just prior to <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> for take-off. This is the ramp weight minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving take-off clearance, the pilot throttles up the engines and <b>releases</b> the <b>brakes</b> to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off.|$|R

25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve, the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder.

50|$|American and {{continental}} European practice {{had long}} favoured compressed air brake systems, the leading pattern being a proprietary Westinghouse system. This {{has a number}} of advantages, including smaller brake cylinders (because higher air pressure could be used) and a somewhat more responsive braking effort. However, the system requires an air pump. On steam engines this was usually a reciprocating steam pump, which was quite bulky. Its distinctive shape and the characteristic puffing sound when the <b>brake</b> is <b>released</b> (as the train pipe has to be recharged with air) make steam locomotives fitted with the Westinghouse brake unmistakable.
