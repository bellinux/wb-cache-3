5000|$|As {{early as}} 1911, the present site of Norris Dam - [...] {{initially}} called the [...] "Cove Creek site" [...] - [...] {{was identified as}} a prime location for a sizeable dam. Several government and private entities believed that a dam in the upper Tennessee Valley, working in conjunction with dams at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, could provide badly needed flood control to East Tennessee and help keep the Tennessee River consistently navigable year-round. In the early 1920s, several entities - [...] including the Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCo), the Knoxville Power & Light Company, and Union Carbide - [...] applied for permits to build a dam at the Cove Creek site, although all were eventually withdrawn or <b>rejected.</b> <b>Part</b> of the opposition was from Senator Norris, who advocated a government-sponsored dam at the site, arguing that a private entity would be almost wholly concerned with power generation rather than flood control and coordination with projects elsewhere in the valley. Norris proposed constructing a network of dams throughout the valley to help regulate its outflow into the lower Mississippi River. Throughout the late 1920s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made several proposals to build a dam at the site, but all were rejected by Congress or vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge.|$|E
50|$|It {{could be}} {{said that in the}} first two decades of the 19th century, the nascent Liberation Army and Navy, {{was in the midst of}} the {{intellectual}} training of their military cadres, in various attempts to unleash the revolutionary war, and trying to build a modern army and navy. In the midst of that task came the generalissimo Francisco de Miranda, and the Liberator Simón Bolívar, who called for immediate action to, once and for all, ensure the independence of the nation, achieved through the aformationed April 19 coup of 1810 and later through the formal enactment of the 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Bolívar surprised his military colleagues, when he <b>rejected</b> <b>part</b> of the Napoleonic military assumptions, habits and behaviors, took more British soldiers and those from other nations, and even through third parties requested the assistance of the British Crown for the formation of the regular army and navy for the growing republic. And he did made no mistake indeed: the 19th century, ultimately, was dominated by British and Prussian military influences. Once in battle, Bolívar began to develop his own tactics, military strategies and practices, whose legacy remains till this day in the National Armed Forces, and led to victory after victory and the full liberation of not just Venezuela, but of northern South America, through battles in both land and sea until the wars ended in 1824.|$|E

But Giraud had written the script as a novel. The page division was still lacking, as were the dialogs. Furthermore {{he had planned to}} spread the story over two books. I suggested to expand that to three books. After I had finished the first Marshal Blueberry, I did not want to do all the work alone anymore. I did not have the time, nor did I want to do the work, others should have rightfully done. Thierry Smolderensubsequently worked out the script. But then I procrastinated. Dargaud had bought back Blueberry, Giraud had <b>rejected</b> <b>part</b> of Smolderen's script, altered the page divisions, etcetera. In the end I became fed up with the third book, and threw in the towel." [...] —Vance, 1996, on his experiences working on Marshal Blueberry. This spin-off series was the second attempt, this time by Alpen Publishers, to further capitalize on the huge popularity both the main, and Wilson's Blueberry series enjoyed at the time. Written by co-creator Giraud, the series was set around the events depicted in The Lost Dutchman's Mine and dealt with scrupulous gun runners arming Apaches, thereby instigating an uprising. Chosen by the publisher for the art work was William Vance, an accomplished Belgian comic artist in his own right and renowned for his XIII comic series. Vance, with whom Giraud had virtually no dealings in person, drew the first two outings in the series, but declined afterwards to continue, partly because he was required to finish an album in only four months (in Europe, one year was the typical mean to complete a comic book of 48 pages, but not rarely exceeds this time span in recent decades) and that he was unaccustomed to Giraud's style as script writer. Additionally, even though the first book sold 100.000 copies (while respectable, relatively modest compared to the contemporary print runs of the two other series, they being printed in numbers at the very least double that), fans received the book with mixed feelings as Vance's style was a too radical departure to their tastes from that of Giraud. This actually was part of the reasons why Wilson's work for Young Blueberry was so favorably received and partly the reason why Blanc-Dumont's was not. While conceding that he found Vance's particular style [...] "seductive but sometimes artificial" [...] - [...] having been pleased with the first album, but less so with the second [...] - [...] , Giraud himself was disappointed and hurt by the defection of a professional like the established Vance for reasons of aesthetics and integrity, as he wanted the series to be executed by only one artist, deeming the defection [...] "disastrous" [...] for the series. The unresolved story cycle lingered in limbo for seven years, before Giraud in person found :fr:Michel Rouge [...] - [...] whose style was closer to his [...] - [...] willing to finish the cycle.|$|E

40|$|Polishing {{process is}} one of the {{manufacturing}} issues that are essential in the production flow, but it generates the major amount of defects on parts. Finishing tasks in which polishing is included are performed in the final steps of the manufacturing sequence. Any defect in these steps impliesrejection of the part, generating a big amount of scrap and generating a huge amount of energy consumption, emission, and time to manufacture and replace the <b>rejected</b> <b>part.</b> Traditionally polishing process has not evolved during the last 30 years, while other manufacturing processes have been automated and technologically improved. Finishing processes (grinding and polishing), are still manually performed, especially in freeform surface parts, but to be sustainable some development and automation have to be introduced. This research proposes a novel polishing system based on robotics and artificial vision. The application of this novel system has allowed reducing the failed parts due to finishing process down to zero percent from 28 % of rejected parts with manual polishing process. The reduction in process time consumption, and amount of scrapped parts, has reduced the energy consumption up to 30 % in finishing process and 20 % in whole manufacturing process for an injection moulded aluminium part for automotive industry with high production volumes...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of L. serrata in mesenteric lymph nodes, livers and lungs of camels slaughtered in Tabriz area, Iran. Methods: Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), livers and lungs of 140 one-humped camels slaughtered in Tabriz, north-west of Iran were investigated for nymphs of L. serrata from July 2007 to June 2008. The organs were examined macroscopically and then a tissue digestion method was also done for investigation of liver and lung of the camels that had infected MLN.

40|$|An {{objective}} {{method for}} inductively modelling {{the distribution of}} mountain land units using GIS managed topographic variables is presented. The landscape of a small high mountain catchment in the Spanish Pyre- nees, covered with grassland, was classified in ten land units by hierarchical agglomerative clustering, using a sample of 194 random plots, in which classes of vegetation, soils and landforms were defined. Addi- tionally, seven layers of topographic variables (altitude, slope angle, aspect, solar radiation, topographic wetness index, specific catchment area, and regolith thickness) were created from a Digital Elevation Mod- el. The affinity of each land unit to the topographic variables was calculated using Binary Discriminant Analysis (BDA), after dichotomising the latter around their mean values. Then, the distribution of each land unit was predicted by boolean operations combining step by step distributions for the seven topo- graphic variables ordered, for each unit, after the absolute values of the Haberman's residuals in BDA. The predicted distributions were tested against that of the observed sampling plots. From the original ten land units, the distributions of eight of them were successfully predicted (four {{are related to the}} slope sequence, two reflect the water accumulation in the soil, and two respond to geomorphic processes) while the remaining two had to be <b>rejected.</b> <b>Part</b> of the catchment (39 %) was not assigned to any land unit, prob- ably because more distributed variables accounting for snow distribution are necessary. 1...|$|E
