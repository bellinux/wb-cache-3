30|$|In this study, <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> in Scots pine {{was found}} to result in distinctively wider annual rings at breast height (Fig.  2). For site Gollin, where <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> {{took place in the}} early 1960 s, it could be {{observed}} that the growth-stimulating effect of <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> levels off after about 30  years (Fig.  2 b), whereas no such effects were observed for Kratzeburg (Fig.  2 a) likely {{as a result of the}} more recent <b>resin</b> <b>tapping.</b> Similar to our results, Tomusiak and Magnuszewski (2009) observed increased growth at breast height after resin extraction in Scots pine in Poland. Above the tapping face (at a stem height of 3  m), however, they did not observe growth stimulation. This difference in growth response is likely caused by the fact that wood formation is concentrated on the living part of the bole at breast height (i.e. after <b>resin</b> <b>tapping,</b> growth cannot take place anymore on the tapping face due to the mechanical damage done to the cambium), whereas tree rings are formed around the full stem circumference above the tapping face.|$|E

40|$|Aim of the study: In {{this work}} {{potential}} resin yield {{in a region}} of high forest ability where maritime pine is the main species was estimated {{in order to understand}} the viability of promoting resin exploitation. Area of study: This study was conducted in Castro Daire County in central region of Portugal. Material and methods: To quantify the resin yield of trees tapped for the first time two plots were installed in a maritime pine stand with average tree age 65 years. Before the beginning of the <b>resin</b> <b>tapping,</b> dendrometric tree variables were measured. Also, in a neighbouring stand, 25 trees were selected to check the relation between tree dbh and resin yield. Gum resin from every tree was weighted during the season. Estimates of potential resin yield in Castro Daire County were made based on data from National Forest Inventory plots, <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> legislation and resin yield values obtained in the field. Two scenarios were considered: high and low resin yield. To understand the intentions of forest owners towards restarting <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> activity 16 maritime pine forest owners were interviewed.

30|$|The {{mechanical}} damage inflicted by <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> likely affects tree growth. However, only {{few studies have}} analyzed effects of resin extraction on tree growth, while reporting contrasting findings. A study in Poland, for example, reports that <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> positively affects radial growth of Scots pine trees at breast height, but does not affect growth above the tapping face (Tomusiak and Magnuszewski 2009). Studies in Greece, Spain and China, on the other hand, indicate that pine growth is negatively impacted by resin extraction (Papadopoulos 2013; Génova et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015) likely {{as a result of}} carbohydrates not being invested in tree growth but in excess resin production. Such differences may (partially) relate to differences in the autecology of the investigated pine species, as well as to differences in the applied resin extraction methods (Chen et al. 2015). Though studies on the effect of resin extraction on pine growth are already scarce, possible effects of <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> on the climate sensitivity of tree growth are even less studied (Génova et al. 2014).

40|$|Abstract Background Originating from Africa, India, and the Middle East, {{frankincense}} oil {{has been}} important both socially and economically as an ingredient in incense and perfumes {{for thousands of}} years. Frankincense oil is prepared from aromatic hardened gum <b>resins</b> obtained by <b>tapping</b> Boswellia trees. One of {{the main components of}} frankincense oil is boswellic acid, a component known to have anti-neoplastic properties. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate frankincense oil for its anti-tumor activity and signaling pathways in bladder cancer cells. Methods Frankincense oil-induced cell viability was investigated in human bladder cancer J 82 cells and immortalized normal bladder urothelial UROtsa cells. Temporal regulation of frankincense oil-activated gene expression in bladder cancer cells was identified by microarray and bioinformatics analysis. Results Within a range of concentration, frankincense oil suppressed cell viability in bladder transitional carcinoma J 82 cells but not in UROtsa cells. Comprehensive gene expression analysis confirmed that frankincense oil activates genes that are responsible for cell cycle arrest, cell growth suppression, and apoptosis in J 82 cells. However, frankincense oil-induced cell death in J 82 cells did not result in DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. Conclusion Frankincense oil appears to distinguish cancerous from normal bladder cells and suppress cancer cell viability. Microarray and bioinformatics analysis proposed multiple pathways that can be activated by frankincense oil to induce bladder cancer cell death. Frankincense oil might represent an alternative intravesical agent for bladder cancer treatment. </p...|$|R

The 30 -year periods before and after resin extraction were defined using the increment cores collected from the tapping face. Thereby, the post-periods started right after resin collection has stopped (i.e. 1984 at Kratzeburg and 1963 at Gollin), whereas the pre-periods ended 5  years earlier to account for the time lapse imposed by the applied resin extraction method.|$|E
30|$|The lesions {{caused by}} <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> lead to several {{physiological}} {{reactions of the}} tree.

Therefore, interest conflicts with wood production are inevitable. They are reported for Austria by Mazek-Fialla [5]. Gayer [6] described the negative impact on plant growth and wood quality. Thus, material utilization of the tapped trees is, therefore, limited and incineration has dominated.

40|$|Carbohydrates {{fixed by}} {{photosynthesis}} {{are stored in}} plant organs {{in the form of}} starch or sugars. Starch and sugars sum to the total non-structural carbohydrate pool (TNC) and may serve as intermediate pools between assimilation and utilization. We examined the impact of tapping on TNC concentrations in stem-wood, bark and root tissues of the frankincense tree (Boswellia papyrifera (Del.) Hochst) in two natural woodlands of Ethiopia. Two tapping treatments, one without tapping (control) and the other with tapping at 12 incisions, are applied on experimental trees. Trees are tapped in the leafless dry period, diminishing their carbon storage pools. If storage pools are not refilled by assimilation during the wet season, when crowns are in full leaf, tapping may deplete the carbon pool and weaken Boswellia trees. The highest soluble sugar concentrations were in the bark and the highest starch concentrations in the stem-wood. The stem-wood contains 12 times higher starch than soluble sugar concentrations. Hence, the highest TNC concentrations occurred in the stem-wood. Moreover, wood volume was larger than root or bark volumes and, as a result, more TNC was stored in the stem-wood. As predicted, tapping reduced the TNC concentrations and pool sizes in frankincense trees during the dry season. During the wet season, these carbon pools were gradually filled in tapped trees, but never to the size of non-tapped trees. We conclude that TNC is dynamic on a seasonal time scale and offers resilience against stress, highlighting its importance for tree carbon balance.

Despite its wide economic and ecological importance, its area coverage is dwindling from time to time, and its natural regeneration is hampered. Hence, long-term prospect for a sustained supply of the goods and services from the species is becoming questionable. The objectives of this study were to investigate: (i) the effect of <b>resin</b> <b>tapping</b> and tree size (DBH) on seed susceptibility to insect attack and the production of viable seeds; and (ii) seed longevity and germination ecology of the seeds of B. papyrifera. We collected seeds from tapped and untapped B. papyrifera stands at Lemlem Terara in Metema District, northwestern Ethiopia. The result showed that both tapped and untapped stands produced comparable insect attacked seeds (tapped stands = 16. 6 %; untapped stands = 15. 8 %). Untapped trees yielded significantly (P < 0. 0001) higher viable seeds (59 %) than continuously tapped trees (49. 3 %), and trees with medium size (20 cm DBH) provided more viable seeds than bigger (30 cm DBH) and younger trees (10 cm DBH). Longevity of B. papyrifera seeds indicated significant difference in viability under three different temperature regimes (5, 15 and 21 °C), three storage periods (6, 9 and 12 months) and two tapping regimes (tapped and untapped populations). Fire that produced temperatures above 100 °C was lethal to the seeds as it caused complete loss of germinability regardless of exposure time. However, heat with temperatures less than 100 °C did not cause loss of germinability even after an hour of exposure.

40|$|Boswellia papyrifera (Del.) Hochst is a {{multipurpose}} deciduous {{tree species}} with high economic, cultural and environmental values. Frankincense from this tree species is a traded commodity {{used in the}} pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and chemical industries, for clerical services in different religions, and as a fragrance during coffee ceremonies in Ethiopia. However, the resource has been declining due to unsustainable management, which includes shifting to crop cultivation, free grazing and indiscriminate cutting of leaves for livestock feeding, and overtapping for frankincense. This study aims at: a) assessing the effects of leaf lopping for fodder, tapping for frankincense, and free grazing on the biophysical state of Boswellia papyrifera forests of Ethiopia, b) assessing the stocks of biomass and soil organic carbon in Boswellia papyrifera forests, c) evaluating the trade-offs between conservation, production forestry, and shifting to crop cultivation, d) assessing rural households demand for conserving the forest, and e) identifying the role of frankincense forests on rural livelihood and poverty reduction. The dissertation is a multidisciplinary piece of work based mainly on primary data from plot level experiments and a household survey conducted in five villages with Boswellia papyrifera forests in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. For analysing these biophysical and socio-economic data, a number of statistical and econometric models are applied, which include: multilevel linear mixed model, the standard allometric model, the model of environmental cost benefit analysis, the double-bound dichotomous contingent valuation method, and standard impact assessment parametric and non-parametric econometric models. We found that leaf cutting caused significant declines in frankincense yield, and production of inflorescence and fruits. Tapping showed a significant positive impact on frankincense yield, {{but there was no}} evidence of a significant difference between tapped and untapped trees in terms of flowering and fruiting. Some environmental variables like altitude, soil depth and nutrient content also significantly affect tree productivity. Interestingly frankincense yield, flower and fruit production significantly differ in relation to the bark colour that would be used as an indicator of tree fitness. The allometric model AGB = 0. 061 (DBH) 2. 353 predicts the above ground biomass carbon in Boswellia papyrifera forest with an average bias of less than 2 %. The stored carbon in Boswellia papyrifera forests was about 44 Mg ha- 1 of which nearly 78 % was accounted by soil organic carbon and fenced plots had more concentrations of carbon and nutrients in the soil than unfenced plots. Given the economic and ecological importance of this species and the limited data on biomass and carbon stock especially in dry forests of Africa, the findings are useful for biomass and carbon stock estimation, and for assessing the implications of land use change on carbon emissions. Moreover, it is also important for validating existing generalized allometric models, which mostly lack evidence from Africas dry forest. The cost benefit analysis assesses the economic benefits and costs of six frankincense forest management options that range from conservation in the form of exclosure to the business as usual scenario that involves free grazing, leaf lopping and intensive frankincense tapping. The Net Present Values of almost all the forestry options are negative if the benefits from carbon and nutrient storage services are excluded indicating that direct benefits from frankincense forests are less than the benefits from the competing land use. Moreover, as shifting cultivation is the competing land use in the study area, estimates of the opportunity costs of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) specific to the forest were also provided. Accordingly, pure conservation of the forest could result in emission reduction of about 142 tons of CO 2 per hectare at an opportunity cost of about 33 USD per ton of CO 2 emission reduction. About 80 % of this opportunity cost is incurred by rural people in the form of forgone net benefits from not converting the forest to cropland through shifting cultivation. The contingent valuation study aims at assessing local evidence on whether any conservation intervention will be welcomed by rural people in the Boswellia forest areas. Accordingly, the study assessed the rural households willingness to pay and willingness to contribute labour for Boswellia papyrifera forest conservation. We found that next to the bid level, willingness to pay is influenced most by income and education, and willingness to contribute labour is significantly affected by size of family labour and gender of the household head. A household is willing to pay at least about 5 USD per year or contribute almost one week of free labour per year, which amounts to close to 7 USD valued at per capita daily income of the households. The potential local demand for conservation of Boswellia papyrifera forest could be mobilized effectively with complementary policy interventions aimed at sustainable use and poverty reduction. Recently there is a considerable debate on the role of non-timber forest products on poverty alleviation. The study on the impact of frankincense membership on rural income and poverty contributes to the empirical literature on the role of organized access to a traded non-timber forest product on rural livelihood and poverty reduction. In the past, rural households in northern Ethiopia had no access to frankincense production and trading. With recent developments in the region, rural households are getting access to the harvesting of frankincense through organizing cooperatives. We analysed the income and poverty effects of rural frankincense cooperative firms and the results indicate that both membership as a binary variable and amount of households investment on shares in the cooperative firms have significant positive welfare impacts in terms of increasing householdincome and reducing rural poverty. The negative impact of leaf looping on the trees capacity to produce frankincense, fruits and flowers as well as the negative net present values of all the forestry alternative management options indicate that the forest is in a very high risk of continuous degradation and perpetuation of what is called a tragedy of the commons. Thus, conservation and sustainable management practices should be in place to increase the resources competitiveness and hence avoid its degradation. This could be possible through interventions that can make developments in alternative livestock feed productions, through creating favorable conditions for the development of businesses that can add value to the frankincense, which is now exported as a raw material, and with the introduction of the other ecosystem service benefits of the resource like development of bee keeping and ecotourism. Moreover, the participation of rural communities both in the conservation and sharing of benefits from the resource are very crucial in future conservation and management interventions as it has been confirmed from the results of the contingent valuation on rural households demand for conservation as well as the results from the impact evaluation. However, further research is required on assessing the resource base at a wider spatial scale, on whether bark color of the tree is a genetic or phenotypic phenomenon affecting tree productivity, and also on the problems associated with legal and institutional frameworks in the use and management of Boswellia papyrifera forests in Ethiopia.
