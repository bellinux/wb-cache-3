40|$|The <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> (Ailurus fulgens) has {{a similar}} diet, {{primarily}} bamboo, and shares the same habitat as the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca. There are considerable efforts underway to understand {{the ecology of the}} <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> and to increase its populations in natural reserves. Yet it is difficult to design an effective strategy for <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> reintroduction if we do not understand its basic biology. Here we report the resting metabolic rate of the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> and find that it is higher than previously measured on animals from a zoo. The resting metabolic rate was 0. 290 ml/g/h (range 0. 204 - 0. 342) in summer and 0. 361 ml/g/h in winter (range 0. 331 - 0. 406), with a statistically significant difference due to season and test temperature. Temperatures in summer were probably within the thermal neutral zone for metabolism but winter temperatures were below the thermal neutral zone. There was no difference in metabolic rate between male and female <b>red</b> <b>pandas</b> and no difference due to mass. Our values for metabolic rate were much higher than those measured by McNab for 2 <b>red</b> <b>pandas</b> from a zoo. The larger sample size (17), more natural conditions at the Panda Base and improved accuracy of the metabolic instruments provided more accurate metabolism measurements.

40|$|The “false thumb” of pandas is a carpal bone, the radial sesamoid, {{which has}} been {{enlarged}} and functions as an opposable thumb. If the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> (Ailurus fulgens) are not closely related, their sharing of this adaptation implies a remarkable convergence. The discovery of previously unknown postcranial remains of a Miocene <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> relative, Simocyon batalleri, from the Spanish site of Batallones- 1 (Madrid), now shows that this animal had a false thumb. The radial sesamoid of S. batalleri shows similarities {{with that of the}} <b>red</b> <b>panda,</b> which supports a sister-group relationship and indicates independent evolution in both pandas. The fossils from Batallones- 1 reveal S. batalleri as a puma-sized, semiarboreal carnivore with a moderately hypercarnivore diet. These data suggest that the false thumbs of S. batalleri and Ailurus fulgens were probably inherited from a primitive member of the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> family (Ailuridae), which lacked the <b>red</b> <b>panda's</b> specializations for herbivory but shared its arboreal adaptations. Thus, it seems that, whereas the false thumb of the giant panda probably evolved for manipulating bamboo, the false thumbs of the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> and of S. batalleri more likely evolved as an aid for arboreal locomotion, with the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> secondarily developing its ability for item manipulation and thus producing {{one of the most dramatic}} cases of convergence among vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Bamboo is {{a staple}} for the <b>red</b> <b>panda,</b> Ailurusfulgens, {{in the wild}} and has been used {{successfully}} as a mainstay in their diets while in captivity (Glats'ton, 1980; Roberts, 1982). Due {{to the fact that}} bamboo is not plentiful in many geograph-ic regions, it remains a limiting factor in the propagation of <b>red</b> <b>pandas</b> in cap-tivity.

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the normal radiographic thoracic anatomy, radiographic and ultrasonographic abdominal anatomy as well as the normal morphology of the pelvis, thoracic and hind limb in captive <b>red</b> <b>pandas</b> and ring-tailed lemurs as a reference for clinical use. Radiography and ultrasonography were performed in adult captive <b>red</b> <b>pandas</b> and ring-tailed lemurs during annual health examinations. Bone specimens of adult <b>red</b> <b>pandas</b> and ring-tailed lemurs were used for gross osteological study. The morphology of the pelvis, thoracic and hind limb of the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> and ring-tailed lemur supported the presence of strong flexor and supinator muscles and flexibility of limb joints, which are important in arboreal quadrupedal locomotion. However, the scapula of the ring-tailed lemur is modified for both arboreal and terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion. Additionally, the morphology of the pelvis and hind limb of the ring-tailed lemur showed locomotor adaptation for jumping. Normal radiographic and ultrasonographic reference ranges for thoracic structures and abdominal organs were established and ratios were calculated. Knowledge of the normal morphology, radiographic and ultrasonographic anatomy of the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> and ring-tailed lemur should prove useful in the diagnosis of diseases and for routine health examinations.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} issues of {{conservation}} threats to the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> (Ailurus fulgens), specifically regarding foraging resources and anthropogenic activities i. e. livestock grazing. I studied the diet components of <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons of this herbivorous carnivore. I evaluated the diet of <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> through micro-histological study of fecal matters to determine the composition of diets. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> feeds primarily on bamboo (Thamnocalamus sp.) species, which comprised 90. 6 % and 77. 8 % of the volume of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon scats respectively, followed by minute consumption of Abis spectabilis, Rhododendron arboreum, Quercus semecarpifolia, Betula utilis, Tsuga dumosa, Acer acuminatum and Texus wallichiana. Seasonal fruits of Aconogonum sp., Juniperus indica, Sorbus cuspidata and mushrooms were found only in the post-monsoon season and comprised 13. 8 % of the volume of scats. This result indicated that the <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> is a bamboo specialist, explaining why it selects forest habitat with bamboo-dominated understory. I conducted a literature review to determine the degree to which bamboo {{was a part of the}} species’ diet throughout its range. I found that different species of bamboo were always of major importance, which suggests that factors negatively affecting the availability of bamboo can be an important threat for the species. Such factors include livestock grazing and other human-related factors and potentially bamboo die-off after mass flowering, as found with giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in the mid- 1970 s. Based on this, I investigated the effects of illegal grazing inside Rara National Park on the occurrence of <b>red</b> <b>pandas.</b> I found that livestock grazing had a small but significant adverse effect on <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> presence and that bamboo availability within a certain elevational range with water sources determined <b>red</b> <b>panda</b> occurrence. 2014 - 12 - 1...|$|R
