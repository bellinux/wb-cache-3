40|$|Objective: <b>Roquinimex</b> is a {{modulator}} of {{the immune}} system and has been shown to attenuate induction of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the efficacy of <b>roquinimex</b> in a model of murine colitis. Materials and methods: For this purpose, Balb/c mice were exposed to 5 % dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water for five to six days. <b>Roquinimex</b> (300 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1)) was administered by subcutaneous (s. c.) injection 3 days prior to and throughout the treatment period with DSS. In separate experiments, 300 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) of <b>roquinimex</b> was given therapeutically after initiation of DSS challenge. Results: DSS provoked clinical signs of colitis, reduced crypt height (CH) and increased mucosal damage score (MDS) as analyzed by histology. In addition, challenge with DSS increased the colonic content of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Prophylactic administration of DSS-treated mice with <b>roquinimex</b> significantly reduced clinical signs of colitis, MDS and the CH-reduction. Moreover, in <b>roquinimex</b> treated animals, the MPO activity was significantly reduced by more than 50 % compared to DSS control mice. Notably, therapeutic administration of <b>roquinimex</b> in DSS-treated mice also significantly inhibited the MDS, CH-reduction and MPO activity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that <b>roquinimex</b> strongly inhibits murine colitis and may provide a novel pharmacological approach to treat inflammatory bowel disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Roquinimex</b> {{is a drug}} with {{effects on}} {{inflammation}} and tumors. The pharmacological effect is not fully understood, and the molecular mechanism most characterized in vitro is an increase of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI- 2) in human peripheral blood monocytes. The aims were to investigate peripheral pharmacological effects of <b>roquinimex</b> on peripheral blood monocytes and dog gingival fluid (GCF). DESIGN: Six dogs were used in a cross-over study. The amount of GCF was determined with a Periotron. The PAI- 2 concentration in GCF was determined with ELISA. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood. RESULTS: Dogs treated with the drug had significantly lower GCF flow values and the PAI- 2 concentration in GCF was higher, but no effect was seen on peripheral monocytes. CONCLUSION: <b>Roquinimex</b> treatment led to a consistently decreased flow rate of GCF and a higher local concentration of PAI- 2 in GCF...|$|E
40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is {{a common}} {{neurotropic}} virus which infects epithelial cells and subsequently the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and brain tissue. We studied how immunomodulation with <b>roquinimex</b> (Linomide®) affects the course of corneal HSV infection in BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice have also been used in a model for HSV-based vectors in treating an autoimmune disease of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). We addressed the questions of how immunomodulation affects the local as well as the systemic immune response and whether <b>roquinimex</b> could facilitate the spread of HSV to the CNS. The cytokine response in the brain and TG was studied using a quantitative rapid real-time RT-PCR method. We were interested in whether immunomodulation affects the expression of the recently described Th 1 -cytokine IL- 23 p 19 in the brain and TG. The expression of IL- 23 mRNA was decreased in brains of roquinimex-treated BALB/c mice. Also the expression of IL- 12 p 35 and IFN-γ mRNAs decreased. No significant changes were seen in IL- 4 and IL- 10 mRNA expression.

40|$|Summary <b>Roquinimex</b> (Roq) is an {{immunomodulator}} {{known to}} stimulate cellular immune responses. It is currently used for immunotherapy after {{bone marrow transplantation}} (BMT). One of the major features of this compound is an enhancement of natural killer (NK) cell activity and numbers. We studied the in vitro effect of Roq on human peripheral blood NK and adherent lymphokine-activated killer cell (ALAK) activities. In cultures supplemented with recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL- 2) (1000 U ml-') and Roq {{a significant increase in}} NK and LAK function was observed without a parallel increase in cell numbers. We also examined the generation of NK cells from human bone marrow (BM) immature progenitors, obtained by purging with 4 -hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4 HC). NK cell numbers and activity were both increased when cultures with rIL- 2 (10 U ml- ') were supplemented with Roq. These results confirm findings obtained in vivo and in vitro in the murine system and suggest that Roq is an active agent on these lymphoid populations. These properties and good tolerability make Roq an attractive tool for immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the objective tumour response rate and duration of response and toxicity of linomide (<b>Roquinimex)</b> treatment in patients with disseminated renal cell carcinoma, pretreated or not pretreated with immunotherapy, From March 1991 to July 1992, 72 patients with metastatic and progressive renal cell cancer were entered of whom 9 (12 %) were not evaluable for response. Linomide was given orally, twice weekly, 5 mg during the first week with dose escalation to 10 mg during the second week and 15 mg thereafter. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. No haematological toxicity but slight anaemia was observed. A significant WBC (white blood cell count) increase (P < 0. 0001, paired T-test) was found during treatment. The most often reported non-haematological side-effects were: flu-like syndrome (54 %, grade III-IV 7 %), nausea/vomiting (41 % and 3 %, respectively) and neurotoxicity (34 % and 2 %). Most side-effects were of mild or moderate intensity (WHO grade 1 or 2). The objective overall response rate was 4 %: 1 CR and 2 PRs. Stable disease was reported for 28 patients (40 %). The duration of response was 17, 22 and 30 (CR) months. Median time to progression was 5 months. Linomide at the given dose and schedule is well tolerated, but has limited antitumour activity in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Neha Gupta, Omar Al Ustwani, Li Shen, Roberto Pili Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA Abstract: Castrate-resistant {{prostate}} cancer (CRPC) {{is a disease}} where survival is poor and treatment is challenging. Over the past 3 years, significant advances in the field have been made with US Food and Drug Administration approval of new drugs for patients with CRPC. However, {{despite the presence of}} new approved drugs such as enzalutamide, abiraterone, sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, and alpharadin, there is still an unmet need for novel agents with different mechanisms of action to target CRPC. Based on earlier studies demonstrating therapeutic potential of a quinoline- 3 -carboxamide agent <b>roquinimex</b> as an anticancer drug, efforts were directed to identify other useful members in this class. Tasquinimod is a second-generation quinoline- 3 -carboxamide agent that is currently in final stages of clinical development as a treatment for CRPC. The preclinical studies of tasquinimod have formed the basis for its success as an antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory agent in this disease. Tasquinimod is an orally available agent that has shown efficacy and favorable safety profile as deduced by the results of Phase I and II clinical trials of this drug in {{prostate cancer}}. The place of tasquinimod in the treatment of CRPC patients is currently under examination in an ongoing Phase III clinical trial. In this review, we will discuss tasquinimod, starting from its discovery and current knowledge on potential mechanisms of action to its clinical potential in CRPC.

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{process of}} tumour invasion and generation of metastases {{is the primary}} cause of death for most patients with cancer. Some of the regulatory components of this progressive process are adhesion, migration, and proteolysis. Urokinase -type plasminogen activator (u-PA) is a serine protease associated with tissue remodelling, cellular invasiveness, matrix degradation, angiogenesis, and cell migration. It was therefore deemed important, from both a physiological and a therapeutic point of view, to investigate whether the inhibition of u-PA could suppress tumour growth. The human prostate cancer cell line DU 145 expresses high levels of u-PA in cell culture, and when the cells were inoculated subcutaneously (sc) into immunodeficient mice they grew easily as xenograft and retained their ability to produce and secrete u-PA with no detectable levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) or of the plasminogen activator inhibitors PAI- 1 and PAI- 2. It is thus a suitable in vivo model for investigating the role of u-PA in cancer. The synthetic u-PA inhibitor, p-aminobenzamidine, was found to suppress the growth of DU 145 tumours in this in vivo model as did daily sc. injections of recombinant PAI- 2 (rPAI- 2), the endogenous inhibitor of u-PA. Therapeutic administration of rPAI- 2 over longer periods of time, however, is hardly feasible; one possible approach was therefore the upregulation of the endogenous PAI- 2 production. Linomide (<b>roquinimex),</b> a compound previously shown to have therapeutic effects in tumour models as well as in models of autoimmunity, was found to upregulate PAI- 2 in cultured human peripheral blood monocytes, both at the protein and the mRNA levels. In a study with healthy volunteers, it was shown that PAI- 2 levels in monocytes were also enhanced in vivo by Linomide. Thus, in this thesis it is shown that u-PA is a significant factor for tumour growth and that the production of the u-PA’s inhibitor PAI- 2 in humans can be upregulated by drugs. One strategy for anti-tumour treatment might therefore be to stimulate the endogenous production of PAI- 2 in monocytes/ macrophages...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapy for}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) {{has changed dramatically}} over the past decade. Recent immunobiological findings and current pathophysiological concepts together with advances in biotechnology, improvements in clinical trial design and development of magnetic resonance imaging {{have led to a}} variety of evaluable therapeutic approaches in MS. However, in contrast to the successfully introduced and established immunomodulatory therapies (e. g. interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate), there have been a remarkable number of therapeutic failures as well. Despite convincing immunological concepts, impressive data from animal models and promising results from phase I/II studies, the drugs and strategies investigated showed no benefit or even turned out to have unexpectedly severe adverse effects. Although to date there is no uniformly accepted model for MS, there is agreement on the significance of inflammatory events mediated by autoreactive T cells in the CNS. These can be modified therapeutically at the individual steps of a hypothetical pathogenetic cascade. Crucial corners like: (i) the prevalence and peripheral activation of CNS-autoreactive T cells in the periphery; (ii) adhesion and penetration of T cells into the CNS; (iii) local activation and proliferation and; (iv) de- and remyelination processes can be targeted through their putative mediators. Like a 'specificity pyramid', therapeutic approaches therefore cover from general immunosuppression up to specific targeting of T-cell receptor peptide major histocompatibility (MHC) complex. We discuss in detail clinical MS trials that failed or were discontinued for other reasons. These trials include cytokine modulators [tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha antagonists, interleukin- 10, interleukin- 4, transforming growth factor-beta 2], immunosuppressive agents (roquininex, gusperimus, sulfasalazine, cladribine), inducers of remyelination [intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) ], antigen- derived therapies [oral tolerance, altered peptide ligands (APL), MHC-Peptide blockade], T cell and T-cell receptor directed therapies (T cell vaccination, T-cell receptor peptide vaccination), monoclonal antibodies against leucocyte differentiation molecules (anti-CD 3, anti-CD 4), and inactivation of circulating T cells (extracorporeal photopheresis). The main conclusions that can be drawn from these 'negative' experiences Lire as follows. Theoretically promising agents may paradoxically increase disease activity (lenercept, inflixiniab), be associated with unforeseen adverse effects (e. g. <b>roquinimex)</b> or short-term favourable trends may reverse with prolonged follow-up (e. g. sulfasalzine). One should not be too enthusiastic about successful trials in animal models (TNFalpha blockers; oral tolerance; remyelinating effect of IVIg) nor be irritated by non-scientific media hype (deoxyspergualine; bone marrow transplantation). More selectivity can imply less efficacy (APL, superselective interventions like T-cell receptor vaccination) and antigen- related therapies can stimulate rather than inhibit encephalitogenic cells. Failed strategies are of high importance for a critical revision of assumed immunopathological mechanisms, their neuroimaging correlates, and for future trial design. Since failed trials add to our growing understanding of multiple sclerosis, 'misses' are nearly as important to the scientific process as the 'hits'...|$|E
