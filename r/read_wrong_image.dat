Problems associated with initialization and poor convergence to boundary concavities, however, has limited their usefulness. As {{result of that}} they tend to be attracted towards <b>wrong</b> <b>image</b> features. In this paper, we propose a method that combine region based fuzzy clustering and deformable model for segmenting tumor region on MRI images. Region based fuzzy clustering is used for initial segmentation of tumor then result of this is used to provide initial contour for deformable model, which then determines the final contour for exact tumor boundary for final segmentation using gradient vector field as a external force field. The evaluation result with tumor MRI images shows that our method is more accurate and robust for brain tumor segmentation...|$|R

In this paper, we present a disambiguation algorithm that attempts to select the correct sense of nouns in textual descriptions of art objects, with respect to a rich domain-specific thesaurus, the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). We performed a series of intrinsic evaluations using a data set of 600 subject terms extracted from an online National Gallery of Art (NGA) collection of images and text. Our results showed that the use of external knowledge sources shows an improvement over a baseline. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of some {{agricultural}} investments, often net cash flow changes its sign from positive to negative, many times during the project. It causes the problem of {{internal rate of return}} calculation, which is an important indicator of economic effectiveness of investments. That is, in such situations, internal rate of return cannot be used. To solve this problem, modified rate of return is applied. This paper aimed to describe this method in detail, and to show its calculation for investments in pigs fattening. By application of modified internal rate of return it is determined that pigs fattening, under assumed conditions, is economically justified. Also, authors calculated the upper limit of discount rate (cost of capital), to which investment in pigs fattening is economically justified. It is concluded that, in {{the case of}} specific agricultural investments (such as pigs fattening), the use of traditional internal rate of return could give the <b>wrong</b> <b>image</b> on actual rate of return on investments...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} preservice elementary teachers' images for some special quadrilaterals. The case study was conducted with 6 preservice elementary teachers. The data were collected by clinical interviews to evaluate preservice teachers’ images for quadrilaterals. Hence, initially, the questionnaire consisting of two parts was given to preservice teachers. In the first part, preservice teachers were asked to draw 3 different squares, rectangles, trapezoids and parallegroms; they were asked to identify these quadrilaterals in the second part. Clinical interviews were conducted by preservice teachers about the questionnaire; thus, preservice teachers’ concept images and own definitions for some special quadrilaterals were defined. The data were analyzed by descriptive analysis. It was revealed that preservice teachers drew quadrilaterals incorrectly not to show notation, know the properties, and classify the relationship between them. Furthermore, it was identified that they had <b>wrong</b> <b>images</b> for especially trapezoid about their individual definitions. Key Words: Quadrilaterals, concept image, concept definition, preservice teachers</p...|$|R
50|$|It {{seems that}} in Aşıklı Höyük, {{as in the}} rest of the Anatolian and Levantine area, the burial and any other post mortem {{treatment}} was arguably an “upper class” phenomenon. This interpretation has been opposed; referring to the diverseness of individuals in both sex and age in the graves. The burials including such a wide range of individuals do not directly coherent with the image of an “upper class” phenomenon. Burials could have been removed or replaced over time, giving a <b>wrong</b> <b>image</b> of the burials as belonging to the elite. An alternative perspective has been suggested: “(...) the Neolithic dead are not under-represented: rather, it is the architecture in settlements that are over-represented”, meaning that in many cases archaeologists have drastically overestimated the extent to which all areas of Neolithic sites were occupied simultaneously. As for Aşıklı Höyük and other sites in the area: low numbers of burials in comparison with occupation span does not directly indicate a cult of the elite.|$|R
