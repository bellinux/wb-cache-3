40|$|Organic {{chemistry}} applications on digital microfluidic devices often involve reagents {{that are}} volatile or sensitive {{and must be}} introduced to the chip immediately before use. We present a new technique for automated, on-demand loading of ∼ 1 μL droplets from large (∼ 1 mL), sealed, off-chip reservoirs to a digital microfluidic chip {{in order to address}} this challenge. Unlike aqueous liquids which generally are non-wetting to the hydrophobic surface and must be actively drawn into the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chip by electrode activation, organic liquids tend to be wetting and can spontaneously flood the chip, and hence require a retracting force for controlled liquid delivery. Using a combination of compressed inert gas and gravity to exert driving and <b>retracting</b> <b>forces</b> on the liquid, the simple loading technique enables precise loading of droplets of both wetting and non-wetting liquids in a reliable manner. A key feature from a practical point of view is that all of the wetted parts are inexpensive and potentially disposable, thus avoiding cross-contamination in chemical and biochemical applications. We provide a theoretical treatment of the underlying physics, discuss the effect of geometry and liquid properties on its performance, and show repeatable reagent loading using the technique. Its versatility is demonstrated with the loading of several aqueous and non-Aqueous liquids on an EWOD digital microfluidic device. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013...|$|E
40|$|A {{silicone}} retractor {{that can}} be attached to suction pipes was developed {{in order to enhance}} the usability [1]. The measurement of the <b>retracting</b> <b>force</b> is desired in order to avoid damage to brain tissue due to an unexpected large force. This paper presents a force-sensing embedded silicone retractor {{that can be}} attached to suction pipes. The developed silicone retractor can provide three functions at the same time: suction, <b>retracting,</b> and <b>retracting</b> <b>force</b> measurement. The force-sensing system is based on a visualization mechanism that displays the force as a colored pole motion. The surgeon can then roughly estimate the <b>retracting</b> <b>force.</b> With a fiberscope, the <b>retracting</b> <b>force</b> can be measured with a resolution of 0. 05 - 0. 3 N. The retractor is made of silicone and has the advantages of disposability, low cost, and easy sterilization/disinfection.

40|$|The {{molecular}} orientation behavior and structural changes of morphology at high strains for multigraft and block-graft copolymers based on polystyrene (PS) and polyisoprene (PI) were investigated during uniaxial monotonic loading via FT-IR and synchrotron SAXS. Results from FT-IR revealed specific orientations of PS and PI segments depending on molecular architecture {{and on the}} morphology, while structural investigations revealed a typical decrease in long-range order with increasing strain. This decrease was interpreted as strain-induced dissolution of the glassy blocks in the soft matrix, which is assumed to affect an additional enthalpic contribution (strain-induced mixing of polymer chains) and stronger <b>retracting</b> <b>forces</b> of the network chains during elongation. Our interpretation is supported by FT-IR measurements showing similar orientation of rubbery and glassy segments up to high strains. It also points to highly deformable PS domains. By synchrotron SAXS, we observed in the neo-Hookean region an approach of glassy domains, while at higher elongations {{the intensity of the}} primary reflection peak was significantly decreasing. The latter clearly verifies the assumption that the glassy chains are pulled out from the domains and are partly mixed in the PI matrix. Results obtained by applying models of rubber elasticity to stress-strain and hysteresis data revealed similar correlations between the softening behavior and molecular and morphological parameters. Further, an influence of the network modality was observed (random grafted branches). For sphere forming multigraft copolymers the domain functionality was found to be less important to achieve improved mechanical properties but rather size and distribution of the domains. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Endothelial barrier {{function}} is regulated at the cellular level by cytoskeletal-dependent anchoring and <b>retracting</b> <b>forces.</b> In {{the present study}} we have examined the signal transduction pathways underlying agonist-stimulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Receptor activation by thrombin, or the thrombin receptor (proteinase-activated receptor 1) agonist peptide, leads to an early increase in stress fiber formation followed by cortical actin accumulation and cell rounding. Selective inhibition of thrombin-stimulated signaling systems, including Gi/o (pertussis toxin sensitive), p 42 /p 44, and p 38 MAP kinase cascades, Src family kinases, PI- 3 kinase, or S 6 kinase pathways {{had no effect on}} the thrombin response. In contrast, staurosporine and KT 5926, an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, effectively blocked thrombin-induced cell rounding and retraction. The contribution of Rho to these effects was analyzed by using bacterial toxins that either activate or inhibit the GTPase. Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, an activator of Rho, induced the appearance of dense actin cables across cells without perturbing monolayer integrity. Accordingly, lysophosphatidic acid, an activator of Rho-dependent stress fiber formation in fibroblasts, led to reorganization of polymerized actin into stress fibers but failed to induce cell rounding. Inhibition of Rho with Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C 3 fused to the B fragment of diphtheria toxin caused loss of stress fibers with only partial attenuation of thrombin-induced cell rounding. The implication of Rac and Cdc 42 was analyzed in transient transfection experiments using either constitutively active (V 12) or dominant-interfering (N 17) mutants. Expression of RacV 12 mimicked the effect of thrombin on cell rounding, and RacN 17 blocked the response to thrombin, whereas Cdc 42 mutants were without effect. These observations suggest that Rho is involved in the maintenance of endothelial {{barrier function}} and Rac participates in cytoskeletal remodeling by thrombin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells...|$|E
40|$|We derive an {{effective}} Maxwell-London equation for entangled polymer complex under the topological constraint, borrowing the theoretical framework from the topological field theory. We {{find that the}} transverse current flux of the test polymer chain, surrounded with entangled chains, decays exponentially from its average position with finite penetration depth, which {{is analogous to the}} magnetic-field decay in a superconductor (SC). Like as the mass acquirement of photons in SC is the origin of the magnetic-field decay, the polymer earns uncrossible intersections along the chain due to the preserved linking number, which restricts the deviation of the transverse polymer current in the normal direction. Interestingly, this picture is well incorporated with the most successful phenomenological theory of the so called tube model, of which researchers have long pursued its microscopic origin. The correspondence of our equation of motion to the tube model claims that the confining tube potential is a consequence of the topological constraint (linking number). The tube radius is attributed to the decay length, and increasing the <b>retracting</b> <b>force</b> at intersections or increasing the number of intersections (linking number), the tube becomes narrow and tighter. It further shows that the probability of the tube leakage decays exponentially with the decay length of tube radius...|$|R
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{was used}} to study interaction forces between four Natural Organic Matter (NOM) samples of different physicochemical characteristics and origins and mica surface at {{a wide range of}} ionic strength. All NOM samples were strongly adsorbed on positively charged iron oxide-coated silica colloidal probe. Cross-sectioning by focused ion beam milling technique and elemental mapping by energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy indicated coating completeness of the NOM-coated colloidal probes. AFM-generated force-distance curves were analyzed to elucidate the nature and mechanisms of these interacting forces. Electrostatics and steric interactions were important contributors to repulsive forces during approach, although the latter became more influential with increasing ionic strength. <b>Retracting</b> <b>force</b> profiles showed a NOM adhesion behavior on mica consistent with its physicochemical characteristics. Humic-like substances, referred as the least hydrophilic NOM fraction, i. e., so called hydrophobic NOM, poorly adsorbed on hydrophilic mica due to their high content of ionized carboxyl groups and aromatic/hydrophobic character. However, adhesion force increased with increasing ionic strength, suggesting double layer compression. Conversely, polysaccharide-like substances showed high adhesion to mica. Hydrogen-bonding between hydroxyl groups on polysaccharide-like substances and highly electronegative elements on mica was suggested as the main adsorption mechanism, where the adhesion force decreased with increasing ionic strength. Results from this investigation indicated that all NOM samples retained their characteristics after the coating procedure. The experimental approach followed in this study can potentially be extended to investigate interactions between NOM and clean or fouled membranes as a function of NOM physicochemical characteristics and solution chemistry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Graft {{coatings}} of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) are {{of considerable}} {{interest for the}} reversible control of bio-interfacial interactions. In this study, graft coatings were prepared by free radical polymerisation from surface-bound polymerisable groups, on silicon wafers and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors. QCM with dissipation monitoring showed a gradual, extended phase change as the temperature increased. Colloid probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) revealed a marked change in the compressibility of the coating below and above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Force curves showed an approximate 9 -fold reduction in thickness between 24 °C and 38 °C, yet the collapsed coating at 38 °C still had a thickness {{significantly higher than the}} ellipsometrically determined dry thickness, indicating a residual extent of hydration above the LCST. At all temperatures, interaction force curves showed steric repulsion, though over different distances. There was little hysteresis between approach and <b>retract</b> <b>force</b> curves, which is evidence for almost instantaneous relaxation of the coating upon decompression. CP-AFM using a probe coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) showed repulsive interactions with little approach/retraction hysteresis below the LCST, indicating lack of adhesion between the pNIPAM coating and the BSA-coated probe. In contrast, above the LCST the force curves on retraction were characteristic of adhesion, while the approach curves were still repulsive, and the adhesion increased in strength as the temperature was increased further beyond the LCST. Thus, QCM-D and CP-AFM data correlated well in showing a gradual nature of the phase transition and a concomitant gradual change in the interaction force with BSA. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a force-visually-observable silicone retractor, {{which is an}} extension of a previously developed system that had the same functions of <b>retracting,</b> suction, and <b>force</b> sensing. These features provide not only high usability by reducing the number of tool changes, but also a safe choice of <b>retracting</b> by visualized <b>force</b> information. Suction is achieved by attaching the retractor to a suction pipe. The retractor has a deformable sensing component including a hole filled with a liquid. The hole is connected to an outer tube, and the liquid level displaced in proportion to the extent of deformation resulting from the retracting load. The liquid level is capable to be observed around the surgeon’s fingertips, which enhances the usability. The new hybrid structure of soft sensing and hard retracting allows the miniaturization of the retractor as well as a resolution of less than 0. 05 N and a range of 0. 1 – 0. 7 N. The overall structure is made of silicone, which has the advantages of disposability, low cost, and easy sterilization/disinfection. This system was validated by conducting experiments...|$|R

50|$|Single acting {{telescopic}} cylinders are {{the simplest}} and most common design. As with a single acting rod style cylinder, the single acting telescopic cylinder is extended using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure but <b>retracts</b> using external <b>forces</b> when the fluid medium is removed and relieved to the reservoir.

This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work portion of the machine cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|R
30|$|Indentation-type AFM or single-point nanoindentation (SPI), for example, {{implemented}} as 'Point-and-Shoot' in the Veeco operating software, is {{the most}} widely used method to measure nanomechanical properties of a sample. In this mode, the tip approaches and indents the sample until a certain predefined force is reached. At this point the tip is retracted again. During this approach and <b>retract</b> cycle the <b>force</b> is continuously measured, resulting in a force versus distance graph. AFM nanoindentation has been performed on different biological substrates such as collagen [15], insulin fibrils, and crystals [16], but also on different polymeric materials, such as fibrils used for biodegradable scaffolds [17]. The approach-retract cycle is typically performed at a rate of 0.5 to 10 Hz, which makes this method inherently slow.

40|$|SummaryIn {{migrating}} cells, {{the relative}} importance of myosin II contractility for cell rear retraction varies [1 – 12]. However, in myosin II-inhibited polarizing cells, actin organization is compromised [13 – 18]; thus it remains unclear whether myosin II is simply required for correct actin arrangement or also directly drives rear retraction [9]. Ascaris sperm cells lack actin and associated motors, and depolymerization of major sperm protein is instead thought to pull the cell rear forward [19, 20]. Opposing views exist on whether actin could also have this function [19, 20] and has not been directly experimentally sought. We probe function at high temporal resolution in polarizing fibroblasts that establish migration by forming the cell rear first [9, 15, 21]. We show that in cells with correctly organized actin, that actin filament depolymerization directly drives retraction of the rear margin to polarize cells and spatially accounts for most cell rear retraction during established migration. Myosin II contractility is required early, to form aligned actin bundles that are needed for polarization, and also later to maintain bundle length that ensures directed protrusion at the cell front. Our data imply a new mechanism: actin depolymerization-based <b>force</b> <b>retracts</b> the cell rear to polarize cells with no direct contribution from myosin II contractility...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{relevant}} fluid dynamic {{processes for}} the formation of uniformly sized droplets in microfluidic systems. Growing droplets made from a bulk source have often liquid threads or jets in between to supply liquid to the droplet. Liquid threads and jets are however known to be instable and finding parameters determining their instability/stability will possibly promote a more controlled formation of uniformly sized droplets. Different droplet formation processes in microfluidic devices are explained, such as cross-flow, co-flow and flow focussing. Dimensionless numbers (introduced in chapter 1) represent the ratio of relevant forces or pressures acting on the fluids and/or their interfaces. These forces and pressures originate from their related fluid dynamic parameters, such as viscosity, interfacial tension, mass density and velocity of the fluid within a specific fluidic confinement with a certain length scale. We show that the dimensionless Reynolds, Weber and Capillary numbers can be associated with the stability of liquid threads and/or jets and provide insight in droplet formation processes. The phenomenon of spontaneous droplet formation at low flow rates of an inner fluid confined in a microfluidic channel is studied in chapter 2. A short overview of known processes of spontaneous droplet formation with micro-engineered microfluidic devices is presented. We have studied the process of auto breakup with rectangular and round glass capillaries, the latter provided with micro-corrugations and uniform sized droplets were obtained, but only if the outer fluid is able to enter the capillary during droplet formation. The process of auto breakup is described by a new analytical model described in chapter 3. The model states that the instability of a liquid thread is induced by the decrease of a local liquid thread pressure inside the capillary near the growing droplet. Predicted droplet sizes have been experimentally verified accurately, and also the predicted breakup length inside a micro-corrugated capillary has been verified. The model states that viscous flow stabilises the liquid thread and that auto breakup happens as long as the capillary number is below a critical capillary number of 0. 0625. Above 0. 0625 droplets grow infinitely large. Auto breakup is however already hampered at Capillary numbers above 0. 03, because between 0. 03 and 0. 0625 no well controlled droplet sizes could be obtained by auto breakup. This is explained by the observed formation of a partially collapsed inner liquid thread that remains open and supplies the growing droplet with inner fluid. In chapter 4 the formation and stability of a liquid thread in free surface flow feeding a large growing droplet is demonstrated and discussed. The shape of the liquid thread is positively tapering (towards the droplet) and can be described accurately by a Navier-Stokes based ordinary differential equation (ODE) assuming steady state, axisymmetry and an averaged fluid velocity over the cross section of the liquid thread. The axial shape of a viscous liquid thread is concave and its radial dimension has initially a cubic dependence with respect to the axial dimension. A driving force to stabilise the liquid thread was identified, which is a pressure gradient Q = Q 0 /L – Q 1. Q 0 is the pressure drop over thread length L, and Q 1 is interfacial based dissipation of energy of the outer fluid. The maximum length of the liquid thread is predicted to be reached when Q goes towards 0 as the ratio Q 0 /Q 1. Shape and stability of emanating liquid jets, which appear after impact of falling droplets from a deep liquid, is presented in chapter 5. During {{rise and fall of the}} jet due to gravity, the jet is additionally decelerated towards the liquid surface by a tensile retraction force from the surface tension force exerted on the jet surface by the liquid bath. The <b>retracting</b> <b>force</b> generates an inertial deceleration pressure inside the jet that is balanced by the local Laplace pressure, herewith defining its local curvature and therefore also the shape of the complete jet. A deceleration based Young-Laplace equation is introduced and the predicted shape is experimentally verified for different fluids. Furthermore, the size of droplets forming on the tip of the jet can also be explained by the found pressure balance between the local Laplace pressure and the inertial deceleration of the jet (including the forming droplet). In general we found that the stability of a liquid thread or jet seems correlated with an applied pressure difference that is distributed between the begin and end of the thread or jet. Studying auto breakup (chapters 2 and 3) of a confined liquid thread it was found that only when the applied pressure is high enough the liquid thread is stable and infinitely large droplets are formed. For the free surface flow liquid thread (chapter 4) it was found that breakup happens when the applied pressure gradient over the length of the thread goes to zero. For the emanating jet (chapter 5) an inertial pressure difference between the base and tip of the jet comes into existence that opposes the squeezing Laplace pressure that wants to break up the liquid jet. Furthermore we found that the last stages of droplet breakup from a liquid thread or jet appeared to follow universal pinch-off, and also that micro-thread formation is observed between droplet and liquid thread or jet...|$|R
