50|$|Optical {{microscopy}} {{is usually}} used for structural {{characterization of materials}} in a narrow <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnification,</b> a small region of interest (ROI), and without changes during microscopy. But many crucial processes of damage initiation and propagation take place dynamically in a timescale ranging from 10−3 s to 103 s and distance scales from micrometers (solitary defects places) to centimeters (for correlated linked networks of defects). Multiscale Image and Video Processing (MultiscaleIVideoP) is designed to process the recorded changes in materials under mechanical deformation in a loading machine (e.g., a diamond anvil cell). The calculations include many parameters of the physical process (e.g., rate, magnification, illumination conditions, and hardware filters) and image processing parameters (e.g., size distribution, anisotropy, localization, and scaling parameters); thus, the calculations are very slow, requiring more powerful computational resources. Deploying this application on a grid computing infrastructure, utilising hundreds of machines at the same time, allows harnessing sufficient computational power to perform image and video processing {{on a larger scale}} and in a much shorter timeframe.|$|E

40|$|Though {{interface}} {{has been}} known for a critical role in determining the properties of conventional composites, its role in polymer nanocomposites is still fragmented and in its infancy. This study synthesized a series of epoxy/clay nanocomposites with different interface strength by using three types of modifiers: ethanolamine (denoted ETH), Jeffamine® M 2070 (M 27) and Jeffamine® XTJ 502 (XTJ). XTJ created a strong interface between clay layers and matrix because it bridged the layers with matrix by a chemical reaction as proved by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; M 27 produced an intermediate interface strength due to the molecular entanglement between grafted M 27 chains and matrix molecules; the interface made by ETH was weak because neither chemical bridging nor molecular entanglement was involved. The studies of mechanical and thermal properties and morphology at a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnification</b> show that the strong interface promoted the highest level of exfoliation and dispersion of clay layers, and achieved the most increment in Young’s modulus, fracture toughness and glass transition temperature (Tg) of matrix.

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} a {{system designed to}} analyze the high energy, closely spaced bunches from individual RF pulses.

The spectrometer is a compact, double-focusing QBQ design whose symmetry allows the Quads to range between F or D with a correspondingly large <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnifications,</b> dispersion and resolving power. This flexibility insures the possibility of spatially separating all of the bunches along the focal plane with minimal transverse kicks and bending angle for differing input conditions. The symmetry of the system allows a simple geometric interpretation of the resolving power in terms of thin lenses and ray optics. We discuss the optics and the hardware that is proposed to measure emittance, energy, energy spread and bunch length for each bunch in an RF pulse train for small bunch separations. We also discuss how to use such measurements for feedback and feedforward control of these bunch characteristics as well as maintain their stability. I...|$|R
40|$|Summary Many {{microscopy}} studies require reconstruction from serial sections, {{a method}} of analysis that is sometimes difficult and time-consuming. When each section is cut, mounted and imaged separately, section images must be montaged and realigned to accurately analyse and visualize the threedimensional (3 D) structure. Reconstruct is a free editor designed to facilitate montaging, alignment, analysis and visualization of serial sections. The methods used by Reconstruct for organizing, transforming and displaying data enable the analysis of series {{with large numbers of}} sections and images over a large <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnifications</b> by making efficient use of computer memory. Alignments can correct for some types of non-linear deformations, including cracks and folds, as often encountered in serial electron microscopy. A large number of different structures can be easily traced and placed together in a single 3 D scene that can be animated or saved. As a flexible editor, Reconstruct can reduce the time and resources expended for serial section studies and allows a larger tissue volume to be analysed more quickly...|$|R
40|$|A spatial {{technique}} providing global {{size and}} velocity data over a two-dimensional region of a spray is often preferred for rapid optical characterization of sprays. The Generalized Scattering Imaging (GSI) approach for droplet sizing, based {{on both the}} Lorenz-Mie theory and the Finely Stratified Sphere Scattering Model {{can be applied to}} both homogenous droplets and inhomogeneous and/or absorbing droplets. A new system has been developed using the GSI approach, with the capability to measure the velocity and size of droplets with non-uniform and/or varying refractive index, even in regions of high particle number density. A windowed FFT based approach was used to identify the presence and location of a droplet oscillation pattern, and an optimized frequency-based algorithm was used to extract the droplet size. A two-frame tracking algorithm was devised to measure the velocity of droplets from the two consecutive image frames. The size range and droplet concentration limits were investigated using simulated out-of-focus images. A maximum measurable diameter range from 10 µm to 600 µm was obtained for the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnification</b> and defocus recommended here. The maximum droplet concentration is expected to be about 3000 #/cc. Sizing accuracy was verified using monodisperse droplets and a graded index optical fiber.

Within the skull base, any configuration of bone, brain, intra- and extracranial vessels, and cranial nerves can be composed (see examples in Figs.  4, 6, 8, 9). In particular, the brainstem region can be included and the access to it demonstrated (see Fig.  8). Navigation is supplemented with axial, coronal, and sagittal 2 D images (displayed as 3 D objects) of the MRI (MP-RAGE) scan along with brain cutting in 7 directions (see Fig.  7).

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM), {{in various}} versions, has had major impact as a surface structural and spectroscopic tool since its invention in 1986. At its {{present state of}} development, however, the interpretation of AFM images {{is limited by the}} current state of methodologies for calibration over the wide dynamic <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnification.</b> Also, the parameters of individual tips, as well as the generic characteristics of different kinds of tips, affect both the quality of the images and their interpretation. Finally, {{the very nature of the}} tip-to-surface interaction will generate artefacts, in addition to those associated with tip shape, which need to be fully understood by the practitioners of force microscopy. This project seeks to address and shed light on some of these issues. Polystyrene beads deposited on mica substrates form hexagonal close-packed layers. The unit cell parameters are suitable for calibration of the AFM in the lateral plane, while the perpendicular spacing of the layers is appropriate for calibration along the vertical axis. Using different size fractions, it is straightforward to determine the extents of linearity, orthogonality, thermal and instrumental drifts over distances from 100 nm to tens of micrometres. The present results show that the methodologies for contact mode operation can be adapted to noncontact modes. It is known that an AFM image arises from a convolution of surface topography and tip shape, and is mediated by the interaction. In principle it is possible to carry out a deconvolution, if we have complete knowledge about two of the three elements (i. e. tip, surface and interaction). In practice we rarely have the requisite information. Prominent artefacts will occur when the characteristic parameters of the tip are comparable to those of the surface topography, and/or if there is a variable strength, or extent of localization, of the interaction. The present results demonstrate artefacts due to effects of geometry as well as interaction...|$|E

In this work, a helium ion microscope (HIM) {{has been used in}} conjunction with a luminescence detection system to characterize IL from materials in an analogous way to how cathodoluminescence (CL) is characterized in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A survey of the helium ion beam induced IL characteristics, including images and spectra, of a variety of materials known to exhibit CL in an SEM is presented. Direct bandgap semiconductors that luminesce strongly in the SEM, are found not do so in the HIM, possibly due to defect-related non-radiative pathways created by the ion beam. Other materials do, however, exhibit IL, including a cerium-doped garnet sample, quantum dots and rare earth doped LaPO 4 nanocrystals. These emissions are a result of transitions between f electron states or transitions across size dependent band gaps. In all these samples, IL is found to decay with exposure to the beam, fitting well to double exponential functions.

40|$|AbstractThe cores of the {{fourteen}} Advanced Gas-cooled nuclear Reactors (AGRs) within the UK comprise Gilsocarbon graphite, a manufactured material surrounded predominantly by CO 2 at {{high pressure and temperature}} to provide heat exchange. The intense ionising radiation within the reactors causes radiolytic oxidation, {{and the resulting}} mass loss is a primary factor in determining reactor lifetime. The void structure of the porous Gilsocarbon graphite affects the permeability and diffusion of the carbon dioxide, and the sites of oxidation. To model this void structure, the porosities and densities of ten virgin Gilsocarbon graphite samples have been measured by powder and helium pycnometry.

The essential requirement for the detection of such planets in these events is that the FWHM of the light curve be monitored continuously, or as nearly continuously as possible. The dependence of planet detectability on the magnification caused by microlensing, on the planet mass and planet location, and {{on the size of the}} source star, may be understood in terms of simple geometrical properties of microlensing that have been known since 1964. Planetary signals of low-mass planets are found to be approximately independent <b>of</b> the <b>magnification</b> caused by microlensing. This implies that planets can be detected in events over a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnifications,</b> from moderately high values ~ 100 to very high values ~ 1000. The former values are likely to yield more clear-cut separations of the stellar and planetary features on the light curve, but they require larger telescopes to obtain precision photometry. During 2007, twenty-four events with magnification exceeding 50 were detected by the MOA collaboration, of which about half were also detected by the OGLE collaboration. A quarter of the events received essentially continuous coverage of their FWHMs by follow-up collaborations, another quarter received partial coverage, and the remaining half received little coverage.

A ring of light emitting diodes (LEDs) is positioned within the light-path such that observation of the objective back focal plane places the il- luminating ring in appropriate conjunction with the phase ring. It is demonstrated that true Zernike phase contrast is obtained, whose geometry can be flexibly manipulated to provide an arbitrary working distance between illuminator and sample.

If mobile phone cameras are {{to live up to}} their potential to increase access to healthcare in low-resource settings, limitations of mobile phone–based imaging must be fully understood and addressed with procedures that minimize their effects on image quantification. Here we focus on microscopic optical imaging using a custom mobile phone microscope that is compatible with phones from multiple manufacturers. We demonstrate that quantitative microscopy with micron-scale spatial resolution can be carried out with multiple phones and that image linearity, distortion, and color can be corrected as needed. Using all versions of the iPhone and a selection of Android phones released between 2007 and 2012, we show that phones with greater than 5 MP are capable of nearly diffraction-limited resolution over a broad <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnifications,</b> including those relevant for single cell imaging. We find that automatic focus, exposure, and color gain standard on mobile phones can degrade image resolution and reduce accuracy of color capture if uncorrected, and we devise procedures to avoid these barriers to quantitativ...|$|R

Two representations of the data exist simultaneously at two different scales, providing an alternative to classical pan & zoom for navigating multi-scale interfaces. For many practical applications however, the <b>magnification</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> focus+context techniques is too limited. This paper addresses this limitation by exploring the quantization problem: the mismatch between visual and motor precision in the magnified region. We introduce three new interaction techniques that solve this problem by integrating fast navigation and high-precision interaction in the magnified region. Speed couples precision to navigation speed. Key and Ring use a discrete switch between precision levels, the former using a keyboard modifier, the latter by decoupling the cursor from the lens' center. We report on three experiments showing that our techniques make interacting with lenses easier while increasing the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> practical <b>magnification</b> factors, and that performance can be further improved by integrating speed-dependent visual behaviors...|$|R
