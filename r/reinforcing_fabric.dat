Although this {{may be caused by}} age and wear, it is often accelerated by mistreatment of the belt, often during initial installation. Overloading the belt by bending it to a narrow radius is a common cause of damage, either by bending out of the belt's designed axis, twisting, levering it into place with tools, bending in the correct axis but to too small a radius, or even knotting a belt in storage.

40|$|In recent years, {{the spatial}} {{resolution}} of fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) has been enhanced in various studies by helically coiling the fiber around a support structure. While solid polyvinyl chloride tubes are an appropriate support structure under water, they can produce considerable errors in aerial deployments {{due to the}} radiative heating or cooling. We used meshed <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> as a novel support structure to measure high-resolution vertical temperature profiles with a height of several meters above a meadow and within and above a small lake. This study aimed at quantifying the radiation error for the coiled DTS system and the contribution caused by the novel support structure via heat conduction. A quantitative and comprehensive energy balance model is proposed and tested, which includes the shortwave radiative, longwave radiative, convective, and conductive heat transfers and allows for modeling fiber temperatures as well as quantifying the radiation error. The sensitivity of the energy balance model to the conduction error caused by the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> is {{discussed in terms of}} its albedo, emissivity, and thermal conductivity. Modeled radiation errors amounted to − 1. 0 and 1. 3  K at 2  m height but ranged up to 2. 8  K for very high incoming shortwave radiation (1000  J s − 1  m − 2) and very weak winds (0. 1  m s − 1). After correcting for the radiation error by means of the presented energy balance, the root mean square error between DTS and reference air temperatures from an aspirated resistance thermometer or an ultrasonic anemometer was 0. 42 and 0. 26  K above the meadow and the lake, respectively. Conduction between <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> and fiber cable had a small effect on fiber temperatures (<[*] 0. 18  K). Only for locations where the plastic rings that supported the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> touched the fiber-optic cable were significant temperature artifacts of up to 2. 5  K observed. Overall, the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> offers several advantages over conventional support structures published to date in the literature as it minimizes both radiation and conduction errors...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} 3 D {{component}} parts made of fiber-reinforced composites for load bearing applications demands a load oriented fiber alignement. During the draping of the textile an undefined displacement of fibers up to wrinkle formation occurs. One possibility to in-fluence fiber orientation during draping is the utilisation {{of the characteristics}} of different fabric weaves. By combining different weaves in a textile <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> adjusted to the component part, gradient-drapability can be developed. This means that local zones with a high structural stability and zones with high drapability can be created in a textile semi-finished product. The design of these zones is done by simulation to produce a fabric structure suitable for the component part. For that purpose, material models for draping simulation developed at the Institute of Textile Machinery and High Performance Material Technology (ITM) are being improved. The material behaviour of each type of fabric weave is analysed and transformed to the simulation model. With the simulations performed the influence of the combination of different weave types on the shear behaviour of fabrics can be demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates an {{inexpensive}} but potentially very effective reinforcement method for adobe block wall systems. <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> materials were {{embedded in the}} mortar between each layer of blocks to provide a barrier against the propagation of the dominant diagonal cracks which are commonly observed in adobe walls after a seismic event, and are {{largely responsible for the}} collapse of adobe structures. The effectiveness of the reinforcing materials in resisting and arresting cracks was investigated in splitting tension tests. Reinforced and unreinforced adobe walls were fabricated and tested in diagonal compression to simulate the transfer of shear due to lateral forces. Felt fabric reinforcement was found to provide the greatest physical deformation of the wall sample and greatest dissipation of energy while maintaining acceptable load-bearing capacity. The final displacement of the reinforced sample was found to be nearly three times that of the unreinforced control specimen. A secondary motivation for this investigation was to address the need for such engineering solutions to be highly affordable to those most likely to build with adobe block. Earthquakes have ravaged many regions of the world, and while advancements in engineering and life-safety codes have resulted in significant improvements in performance of modern structures, we must also seek out methods by which traditional building systems, which continue to house large numbers of people, can withstand the scrutiny of modern safety criteria.

40|$|This {{research}} paper deals with {{an investigation of}} the flexural properties measured in a three-point bending test depending on the type and number of the E-glass prepreg layers applied to the facing sides of the resulting sandwich structure used for floor panels in the transport industry. The values of the low-cycle fatigue were measured according to the values of the flexural strength obtained from the static test. Cycling was performed at (70, 60 and 50) % values of the ultimate flexural load. Moreover, a decrease in the flexural strength and stiffness depending on the number of cycles was also studied. For the production of samples, one type of aluminum honeycomb core and various phenolic prepregs with different numbers of layers were used. These samples were produced with two, in practice commonly used methods - compression molding and vacuum bagging. The measured results show that the production technology has a certain influence on the mechanical behavior in bending and the fatigue life of sandwich structures. The experimental results proved that the type of prepreg (defined by the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> and the amount of resin) and the number of layers also affect the properties of these structures.

Design/methodology/approach: Studies of thermo-mechanical phenomena during manual arc welding MMA of tee-joints between plate girders and insert plates were carried out to identify possible sources of the concrete damage due to high welding temperature and stresses. Findings: It was shown that MMA welding at vertical-up position, by a rutile coated electrode of diameter 3, 2 [mm], at welding current 110 - 120 [A], of the butt welds of tee-joints of girders and the insert plate does not cause any harmful and damaging effect to concrete, which temperature in a region of the contact with the bottom surface of the insert plate does not exceed 240 [°C] during full cycle of welding. Tensile and compression stresses of concrete are transmitted mainly by anchoring bars, fixed in concrete and also by <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> of concrete, and do not cause any cracks of concrete. Research limitations/implications: To achieve more consistent results of the numerical analysis of stresses and deformation distribution in the insert plate with experimental results, it is necessary to calculate plastic deformation of materials and also take into consideration nonlinear change of yield point (plasticity) as a function of temperature. Practical implications: The technology was applied for welding of the girders to insert plates of the telecommunication tower in Kuwait.

40|$|We {{have for}} the first time {{combined}} the strength of hydrophilic sulfonated material and thin woven open-mesh via a continuous casting process to fabricate mesh-reinforced ultrafiltration (UF) membrane substrates with desirable structure and morphology for the development of high-performance thin-film composite (TFC) osmosis membranes. A new sulfonated polyphenylenesulfone (sPPSU) polymer with super-hydrophilic nature is used as the substrate material, while a hydrophilic polyester (PET) open-mesh with a small thickness of 45 μm and an open area of 44. 5 % is employed as the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> during membrane casting. The newly developed sPPSU-TFC membranes not only exhibit a fully sponge-like cross-section morphology, but also possess excellent water permeability (A= 3. 4 – 3. 7 L m− 2 h− 1 bar− 1) and selectivity toward NaCl (B= 0. 10 – 0. 23 L m− 2 h− 1). Due to the hydrophilic nature and low membrane thickness of 53 – 67 μm, the PET-woven reinforced sPPSU substrates have remarkably small structural parameters (S) of less than 300 μm. The sPPSU-TFC membranes thereby display impressive water fluxes (Jw) of 69. 3 – 76. 5 L m− 2 h− 1 and 38. 7 – 47. 0 L m− 2 h− 1 against a deionized water feed using 2 M NaCl as the draw solution under pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) and forward osmosis (FO) modes, respectively.

40|$|The use of hybridized carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) {{fabric to}} {{reinforce}} ceramic matrix composite face sheets and {{the integration of}} such face sheets with a foam core creates a sandwich structure capable of withstanding high-heatflux environments (150 W/cm 2) in which the core provides a temperature drop of 1, 000 C between the surface and the back face without cracking or delamination of the structure. The composite face sheet exhibits a bilinear response, which results from the SiC matrix not being cracked on fabrication. In addition, the structure exhibits damage tolerance under impact with projectiles, showing no penetration to the back face sheet. These attributes make the composite ideal for leading edge structures and control surfaces in aerospace vehicles, {{as well as for}} acreage thermal protection systems and in high-temperature, lightweight stiffened structures. By tailoring the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of a carbon fiber containing ceramic matrix composite (CMC) face sheet to match that of a ceramic foam core, the face sheet and the core can be integrally fabricated without any delamination. Carbon and SiC are woven together in the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric.</b> Integral densification of the CMC and the foam core is accomplished with chemical vapor deposition, eliminating the need for bond-line adhesive. This means {{there is no need to}} separately fabricate the core and the face sheet, or to bond the two elements together, risking edge delamination during use. Fibers of two or more types are woven together on a loom. The carbon and ceramic fibers are pulled into the same pick location during the weaving process. Tow spacing may be varied to accommodate the increased volume of the combined fiber tows while maintaining a target fiber volume fraction in the composite. Foam pore size, strut thickness, and ratio of face sheet to core thickness can be used to tailor thermal and mechanical properties. The anticipated CTE for the hybridized composite is managed by the choice of constituents, varying fiber tow sizes and constituent part ratios. This structural concept provides high strength and stiffness at low density 1. 06 g/cm 3 in panels tested. Varieties of face sheet constructions are possible, including variations in fiber type and weave geometry. The integrated structures possible with this composite could eliminate the need for non-load-bearing thermal protection systems on top of a structural component. The back sheet can readily be integrated to substructures through the incorporation of ribs. This would eliminate weight and cost for aerospace missions...|$|E
