This new service pattern {{was put into}} effect on January 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{designed}} to <b>run</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> lake shore, instead of Dundas Street to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since Lake Shore and Dundas were both overcrowded {{and in need of}} serious repairs.|$|E
50|$|Chickies Creek <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{north side}} of the ridge towards the western end, while Jones <b>Run</b> <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> south side towards the western end.|$|R

5|$|US4 {{begins to}} <b>run</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Champlain Canal after Schuylerville, {{passing through the}} hamlets of Northumberland and Starks Knob. At a {{crossing}} over the Hudson River, US4 and the concurrent NY32 split in different directions. US4, which {{is now on the}} other side of the Hudson, continues northward through Fort Miller, and crosses the River once more. The route then enters Fort Edward, where it becomes concurrent with NY197.|$|E
5|$|After {{the river}} crossing, the highway enters Benzie County {{and runs through}} the Pere Marquette State Forest. South of Benzonia, M-115 runs {{concurrently}} with US31 into town.

It crosses Boyer Creek as 76 Road and enters the hamlet of Speedsville, a small community located on top of a mountain. Here, CR115 turns to the northwest to <b>run</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> base of a valley surrounding Boyer Creek.

5|$|East of Thurston hamlet, NY333 {{continued}} to <b>run</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{base of the}} Michigan Creek valley into the town of Campbell, where the valley met a larger valley surrounding the Cohocton River. The route proceeded eastward across {{the width of the}} latter valley, crossing over the river on its way into the riverside hamlet of Campbell, the largest community along NY333. It proceeded eastward through the hamlet along Main Street to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (then-NY15 and NY17) just east of the community. NY333 ended just east of the Southern Tier at a junction with NY415. The right-of-way also terminated at the junction.|$|E
5|$|I-287 was to {{continue}} past I-95 in Port Chester and was to cross Long Island Sound via the unbuilt Oyster Bay–Rye Bridge. On Long Island, the route would <b>run</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Seaford–Oyster Bay Expressway (NY135). Then, I-287 was again {{to be extended}} into Jones Beach by merging with the Wantagh State Parkway in Merrick. The plans for the bridge, and the I-287 extension onto Long Island, were dropped in 1973 by Governor Nelson Rockefeller {{as a result of}} community opposition and environmental concerns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, a highway {{numbered}} M-178 was designated between M-28 south of Munising to M-94 in town. In 1941, the routings of M-28 and M-94 were reversed between Harvey and Munising, and M-28 supplanted the M-178 designation completely. Since then, M-28 has <b>run</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> lakeshore through Au Train. M-28 was extended along US2 {{to the state}} line at Ironwood, and {{the eastern end of}} M-28 through Brimley was moved to a new alignment ending at US2, in Dafter in 1942. The eastern end was moved along US2 back to Sault Ste. Marie in 1948, though the terminus was returned to Dafter in 1950.|$|E
50|$|Central Line trains {{depart from}} Cape Town station {{on one of}} two routes. <b>The</b> first route <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} Cape Town - Bellville main line through Salt River to Maitland, and then branches south to pass around the western and southern edge of Pinelands to Langa station. <b>The</b> other route <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> relief main line past Paarden Eiland and then branches south through Kensington to Mutual station; from Mutual it <b>runs</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> eastern edge of Pinelands to Langa.|$|R

5|$|Initially, the Clearview was {{intended}} to <b>run</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> existing right-of-ways of Utopia Parkway and Francis Lewis Boulevard. An alternate proposed routing would have run along Little Neck Bay and through Alley Pond Park, essentially parallel to the Cross Island Parkway. By September 1956, the Clearview was mapped along 206th and 207th Streets and Hollis Court Boulevard, east of Francis Lewis Boulevard, after community opposition. The reroute {{reduced the number of}} properties to be demolished or relocated from 860 to 421. An information center was set up by the TBTA for local residents displaced by the expressway.|$|E
