5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, {{but most of the}} muscles in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong <b>retractor</b> muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these <b>retractor</b> muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{such as the}} long, narrow kidney with reflexed ureter {{and closed}} {{secondary}} ureter, the penial complex with distinct penis, which is continuous with the epiphallus, epiphallic caecum (a flagellum and an appendix), unbranched gametolytic duct, lack of vaginal accessory organs, and the basic condition of the nervous and <b>retractor</b> muscle systems support the inclusion of Amphidromus in the family Camaenidae. This group of snails occur {{in a wide variety}} of habitats in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia, and is one of the most diverse families in the clade Stylommatophora. Though Laidlaw & Solem (1961) provided no more additional details on the anatomy of Amphidromus, subsequent studies by distinct authors, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have demonstrated that the reproductive system can provide valuable data for species recognition.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals {{are members}} of the class Anthozoa and like other members of the group, do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. The {{individual}} animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The base of the polyp secretes the stony material from which the coral skeleton is formed. The body wall of the polyp consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis. The mouth is at the centre of the oral disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the interior of the body and tentacles. Unlike other cnidarians however, the cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the cavity walls. The polyp is retractable into the corallite, the stony cup in which it sits, being pulled back by sheet-like <b>retractor</b> muscles.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{microscopic}} anatomic features of lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> in Caucasians, specifically {{looking for an}} anatomic division of the <b>retractors</b> into 2 layers, as {{is present in the}} Asian eyelid. DESIGN: Experimental anatomic study. PARTICIPANTS: Seven Caucasian cadavers (13 lower eyelids: 7 right and 6 left). METHODS: Sagittal full-thickness sections of the cadaveric lower eyelids were prepared and stained with Masson's trichrome. The specimens were examined microscopically to discern the configuration of the lower eyelid <b>retractors.</b> Micrographs were obtained with a digital camera system attached to the microscope. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histologic findings of the lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> in Caucasians. RESULTS: Although 2 specimens were excluded because anatomic details were severely disrupted during slide preparation, all the other samples demonstrated clear double layers of the lower eyelid <b>retractors.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> in Caucasians consist of clear double layers. In this regard, no differences were detected between Caucasian and Asian eyelid anatomic features. Hirohiko Kakizaki, WengOnn Chan, Simon N. Madge, Raman Malhotra, and Dinesh Selv...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} the microscopic {{relationships between the}} lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> and the lacrimal caruncle and to define the possible role of the caruncle in the lacrimal drainage process. DESIGN: Observational anatomic study. METHODS: Twelve eyelids with their orbital tissues (6 right and 6 left), fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, were studied in 10 Asian cadavers (mean age at death: 77. 1 years, age range: 62 - 92 years). An oblique incision in the harvested tissue specimen passed through the lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> and the lacrimal caruncle. The sliced specimens were stained with Masson's trichrome. RESULTS: In all specimens, the lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> were shown to have direct connections to the lacrimal caruncle {{at the level of}} the medial horn of the lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> and to reach the medial rectus capsulopalpebral fascia. At this level, smooth muscle fibers were abundant both in the lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> and in the medial rectus capsulopalpebral fascia, which were symmetrically situated to the caruncle. CONCLUSIONS: The lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> have direct connections to the lacrimal caruncle, at a level that is rich in smooth muscle fibers. These anatomic findings may confer functional advantages to the lacrimal drainage system. Hirohiko Kakizaki, Yasuhiro Takahashi, Takashi Nakano, Hiroshi Ikeda, Dinesh Selva and Igal Leibovitc...|$|R
40|$|Composition of cautery tip {{cleaners}} (Xodus). retraction of slippery {{muscle tissue}} by stainless steel <b>retractors</b> {{can be a}} hindrance during surgery. To overcome this situation, breast <b>retractors</b> with toothed ends are made and sold (Fig. 1) [1, 2]. However, they are not produced in South Korea so they {{are not easy to}} obtain. They are also too expensive. The aim {{of this study is to}} introduce nonslip breast <b>retractors</b> constructed from conven-tional <b>retractors</b> and cautery tip cleaners. Cautery tip cleaners (Xodus, New Kensinton, PA, USA) are composed of five layers (Fig. 2). Beginning with the top layer, the layers are nonslip paper, polyurethane foam, X-ray detectable material, acrylic adhesive tape, and release line. The top layer, nonslip paper, provides an abrasive surface. Using this surface, the cautery tip cleaners are intended to be used to remove and clean the material from the tips of mono-polar and bi-polar cautery probes. Sometimes the cautery tip cleaners are used in surgical debridement to make a clean, flat, and even wound bed [3]. The procedure for constructing nonslip breast <b>retractors</b> using cautery tip cleaners is as follows: 1) Prepare normal <b>retractors</b> and cautery tip cleaners. 2) Trim the tip cleaners according to the size of th...|$|R
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the <b>retractor</b> tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
25|$|Bulls have a fibro-elastic penis. Given {{the small}} amount of erectile tissue, there is little {{enlargement}} after erection. The penis is quite rigid when non-erect, and becomes even more rigid during erection. Protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the <b>retractor</b> penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure.|$|E
25|$|The hindlimbs {{were large}} and robust to {{accommodate}} {{the weight of the}} body and strong enough to allow a bipedal walk. The femur was slightly longer than the tibia. This may indicate that the legs were used as pillars, and not for sprinting. Taquet concluded that Ouranosaurus was not a good runner because the fourth trochanter, the attachment point for the large <b>retractor</b> muscles connected to the tail base, was weakly developed. The foot was narrow with only three toes and relatively long.|$|E
40|$|The {{lower eyelid}} <b>retractors</b> consist of double layers, the {{posterior}} layer {{of which is}} the main tractional component. Therefore, shortening of the posterior layer of the lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> causes lower eyelid retraction or cicatricial entropion. Based on this concept, we report a modified lower eyelid lengthening surgery involving complete recession of the posterior layer of the lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> by way of a transcutaneous approach that leaves the palpebral conjunctiva intact and inserts ear cartilage as a rigid spacer between the lower edge of the tarsal plate and the recessed anterior layer of the lower eyelid <b>retractors.</b> This procedure completely extirpated the preoperative maladjusted states of lower eyelid retraction and cicatricial entropion. Our procedure also prevented postoperative discomfort of the ocular surface due to the intact palpebral conjunctiva. As well, lower eyelid mobility and contour were good and within their respective permissible ranges. The lower eyelid lengthening surgery focusing on the posterior layer of the lower eyelid <b>retractors</b> using auricular cartilage via a transcutaneous approach is a useful procedure for lower eyelid retraction or cicatricial entropion...|$|R
40|$|Instruments {{manufactured}} by bending a basic metal strip or rod, either about its middle to create spring forceps (tweezers), or towards one extremity to create hooks and <b>retractors</b> are related structures. Spring forceps depend on tension mediated at the bend (hoop) or fixed end which is transmitted as dynamic 'spring' to the jaws, whereas the bend of hooks and <b>retractors</b> remains fixed and static. If such instruments refine the digital postures of pinch, pincer and retraction during surgery, {{they have not}} supplanted these manual actions entirely. After a brief historical introduction, the structure, modifications, functions and controls of spring forceps are analysed. Importantly, this instrument enjoys both right and left-handed functions, {{some of which are}} ancient, some transient as haemostats and needle-holders, and some, including left-handed dissection, surprisingly recent. Hooks are sharp or blunt and, among other functions, pre-date the left-handed spring forceps for dissection; in general hooks function as <b>retractors.</b> Hand-held <b>retractors</b> are enlarged blunt hooks, the wide retracting contact surface reducing trauma to wound margins and viscera. The physical effort of employing these <b>retractors</b> deep in body cavities is abated by applying them autostatically around a square or circular frame...|$|R

25|$|Ankylosaurids {{were likely}} very slow-moving animals. In all Ankylosauria, the fibula is more slender than the tibia, {{suggesting}} that the tibia carried most {{of the weight of}} the animal, while the fibula served as an area of muscular attachment. Hindlimb muscles of Euoplocephalus have been restored and the placement of several muscles inserting on the femur have very short moment arms. Muscles inserting on the tibia and fibula have longer moment arms. This pattern of <b>retractor</b> muscles points to an elephantine locomotion, consistent with columnar posture.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina is {{more than}} twice the length of the oviduct. Oviduct about half as long as the {{proximal}} part of the pedunculus, which is longer than the distal part. Basally the pedunculus is much broader than the adjoining oviduct. The bursa of the bursa copulatrix is separate from the spermoviduct; it reaches hardly further than the diverticulum. Male part of the genitalia with a single <b>retractor</b> muscle, without flagellum or caecum. Penis is tripartite as far as can be judged {{on the basis of the}} transparent genital slides, forming a loop with a sharp curvature about halfway. Proximal half formed by (1) a short segment with a relatively simple luminal surface, followed by (2) a clearly broader and about three times longer part with some longitudinal ridges with zigzag borders. Distal half, with the insertion of the <b>retractor</b> muscle slightly distal from halfway, about as broad or little broader than the narrow part of the proximal half; penial segment (3) with a relatively simple luminal surface; epiphallus (4) with a vague pattern of small pustulae, most clearly seen at its distal end. Vas deferens, a short part of the penis and nearly as much as the proximal half of the vagina united by a common sheath.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina {{is short}} to very short. Oviduct is {{measuring}} about 2/3 {{of the length}} of the proximal part of the pedunculus, which is clearly shorter than its much narrower distal segment.

Male part of the genitalia forming a loop because the vas deferens and a short, most proximal part of the penis are united by a common sheath; with a single <b>retractor</b> muscle, inserting rather close {{to the beginning of the}} vas deferens, without a flagellum or caecum. The luminal structure, as far as visible in the transparent genital slides, enables the distinction of three segments: (1) a short broadest part with a relatively simple, longitudinal, luminal structure, (2) a much longer part, with a more complicated luminal surface of many protuberances that very gradually decrease in size towards segment (3), which has a wall structure with very small, irregular protuberances and changes into the epiphallus near the insertion site of the <b>retractor</b> muscle, without an obvious boundary.|$|E

At this time, heparin is given to thin the blood to prevent thrombus from forming while on CPB. The surgeon places a cannula in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the venous circulation.

25|$|Reproductive system: The {{hermaphrodite}} gland (HG) is elongated and large, and {{is connected}} with spermoviduct (SO) {{by means of the}} hermaphrodite duct (HD) which takes its course through a portion of the albumen gland (AG). The spermoviduct is thick and well convoluted, and separates further down into a vas deferens or sperm-duct (VD) and an oviduct (OV). The former opens into the upper end of a very long penis (P), to which a strong <b>retractor</b> muscle (PRM) is attached. The lower portion of the penis unites with that of the oviduct at the genital orifice, so that there is no vestibule. The receptaculum seminis (RS) opens into {{the lower end of the}} penis near the junction of the two ducts.|$|E

The separation was extended digitally and was considered complete as soon as two fingers or a vaginal <b>retractor</b> could be admitted easily. Burou considered this first part of {{the operation}} to be the most important, but most risky, and stressed the importance of repeated intrarectal inspection to determine that there was no lesion to the rectal wall.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, Gillies' cousin, Archibald McIndoe, {{joined the}} {{practice}} and became committed to plastic surgery. When World War II broke out, plastic surgery provision was largely divided between the different services of the armed forces, and Gillies and his team were split up. Gillies himself was sent to Rooksdown House near Basingstoke, which became the principal army plastic surgery unit; Tommy Kilner (who had worked with Gillies during the First World War, and who now has a surgical instrument named after him, the kilner cheek <b>retractor),</b> went to Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, and Mowlem to St Albans. McIndoe, consultant to the RAF, moved to the recently rebuilt Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, Sussex, and founded a Centre for Plastic and Jaw Surgery. There, he treated very deep burn, and serious facial disfigurement, such as loss of eyelids, typical of those caused to aircrew by burning fuel.|$|E
25|$|Other {{distinctive}} {{traits are}} related to the tusk whorls on the lower jaw. Because they could rotate, this was a different method of jaw articulation which did not compare with primitive ray-finned fish. The lower jaw was entirely articulated with cartilage, without an intermediate structure between the opposite sides, allowing the separation of the bones when prey was struck. Moreover, the loose articulation caused lateral movement, making the tusk walls move out of alignment. The parts of the lower jaw would have rotated inwards upon closing in order for the tusk whorls to fit exactly into the hollow spaces in the upper jaw. It is suggested that a ligament attachment and <b>retractor</b> mechanism existed in a pit under the tusk whorl, a unique condition in vertebrates. The capacity of the teeth on the lower jaw to fit with the tooth rows in the upper jaw, upon closure, kept the tusk whorls in place.|$|E
25|$|In {{the grey}} organic mass {{at the neck}} base, muscle fibres are present that have been {{identified}} as belonging to the Musculus sternohyoideus and the Musculus sternotrachealis. Between the sixth and seventh dorsal vertebra a patch of muscle fibres is visible belonging to either the Musculus transversospinalis or the Musculus longissimus dorsi. In front of the right ischium muscle fibres are present running from the ischial foot {{in the direction of the}} femur. Their identity is uncertain: they could belong to the Musculus puboischiofemoralis pars medialis (the Musculus adductor femoris I of crocodiles) but in that case this muscle with (some) non-avian theropods would not be anchored on the obturator process. The fibres could also represent an unknown muscle. In any case they refute a conjecture by Gregory S. Paul that there would be no muscle connection between the ischium and the femur at all. Above the rectum tract a large area of horizontal unsegmented muscle fibres is present, probably representing the unsegmented Musculus caudofemoralis longus of the tail base, the main <b>retractor</b> muscle operating on the thighbone. These fibres are polygonal in cross-section and show the intercellular spaces also. Below some tail base vertebrae the connective ligaments between the chevrons are present, forming the ligmamentum interhaemale, but also some small muscle fibres and some mysterious hollow tubes arranged in a herringbone pattern; the latter perhaps represent the myosepta of the myotomes, the segments of the Musculus iliocaudalis or the Musculus ischiocaudalis.|$|E
