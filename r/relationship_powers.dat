40|$|Abstract Increasing {{rates of}} {{adolescent}} {{anxiety and depression}} present new challenges for educators. This requires educators to increase their capacity to meet the unique learning needs of students with mental health concerns. The Organizational Improvement Plan (OIP) explores this problem of practice, targeting improved teacher ability to understand student mental health, to recognize the signs of distress, and to employ teaching strategies and practices to accommodate learning needs. The notion that academic functioning is tied to mental health functioning in a bi-directional <b>relationship</b> (<b>Powers,</b> Bower, Webber 2 ̆ 6 Martinson, 2011) underscores the need for teachers to be equipped with a greater skill set than what is currently offered through pre-service training and professional development. The OIP leverages existing structures in a self-directed learning model to create communities of practice where mental health literacy and teaching strategies are learned and practiced in a collaborative learning environment. Employing a hybrid model integrating teacher, servant, and parallel leadership, improved teacher capacity in student mental health becomes a school improvement goal, aligning school vision with daily practices and all student-teacher interactions. Mental health is newly understood as a learning need consistent with those accommodated through Individual Education Plans, challenging the social stigma and other variables that have impaired the academic trajectory of students with anxiety and depression in the past. Relying on professional collaboration, school vision and shared moral purpose, the change plan hopes to improve academic outcomes - through improved school culture and teacher capacity - for students faced with mental health challenges...|$|E
40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. Philosophies {{of health}} care in South Africa tend to be based on either the medical {{approach}} or traditional healing. Psychology and psychotherapy, which occupy a niche within the greater health care system, are similarly predisposed. Focusing mainly on psychotherapy / healing, this research sets out to make some sense of the converging and diverging elements of these two broad systems. The research covers Western healing by exploring the roots of psychotherapy from the earliest written records until the late nineteenth century. A similar exercise is undertaken as regards traditional healing, whose origins are examined by speculating on shamanic healing practices which date back to the furthest reaches of human history. Next contemporary traditional healing in Africa is explored in regard to the cosmology and methodologies of healers. The African anthropological worldview in relation to health and mental health are reviewed, giving special emphasis to the elements of spirituality intrinsic to the approach. The spiritual component is then reviewed in regard to Western psychotherapy in the form of Transpersonal psychotherapy, which has become increasingly prevalent in the last decade. In tying them together, it is noted that most ancient forms of healing are directly linked to the most recent contemporary forms. In order to better understand the processes of modern practitioners, several healers and therapists across the ethnic spectrum were interviewed. Using semi-structured interview techniques followed by a phenomenological analysis, the data was divided into 50 meaning clusters and then rationalised into 10 themes most pertinent to the direction of this project. The ten extracted themes were: Western Models: The effectiveness, use, limitations, and suggestions regarding amendments to Western therapeutic approaches. Therapist Ethnicity: The experiences of Black and White therapists in practice, in regard to ethnic issues. Knowledge of Traditional Healers: The knowledge that Black and White therapists had about the worldview and methodologies of traditional healers. Traditional Healing Scope: The types of problems addressed by traditional healing. Traditional Healing Methods: The techniques and methods employed by traditional healers. Ancestors : The <b>relationship,</b> <b>powers</b> and beliefs about ancestors held by traditional healers and Black therapists. Cosmology: The South African worldview as expressed by traditional healers and Black therapists. Traditional Healing: Miscellaneous Aspects of traditional healing which were relevant but did not fall into other themes. Client Relationship: The nature of the relationship required for effective traditional healing and therapy. Therapist training: The effectiveness, use, limitations, and suggestions regarding amendments to therapy training. Each of the above themes are discussed in detail and the participants’ views on aspects such as training and the approaches to therapy and healing are extracted. The research ends by attempting to draw all the previous information together and give tentative answers to the research question. It is argued that the most fundamental link between psychotherapy and healing takes place in regard to the ‘common factors’ or contextual elements in therapy and healing. In order to make psychotherapy more relevant to Black South Africans, several recommendations are suggested, among them the Africanisation of therapeutic approaches that take into account the practical circumstances of most prospective clients. In addition it is argued that therapy can be more synergistic with healing by drawing on its intrinsic features of spirituality and reconnection. It is also suggested that additional research impetus be given to the development of African models of psychology and therapy. It is not envisaged that Western models will need to be rewritten from scratch, but rather that the particular circumstances of Africa are taken into account...|$|E

However, there is limited research on whether and how IPV changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period and on the factors that might affect women’s risk during this time. In this study, we describe the mean trajectories of physical and psychological IPV during pregnancy and the postpartum period and examine whether <b>relationship</b> <b>power,</b> partner social support, and relationship stress are associated with women’s trajectories of IPV. Data come from a longitudinal study with 1, 480 women recruited during pregnancy between May 2008 and June 2010 at a public clinic in Durban.

40|$|Background: Black South Africans {{were forced}} to live under the oppressive regime of {{apartheid}} {{for more than four}} decades. This system of government not only restricted the economic and educational opportunities for Blacks, but it also marginalized women by encouraging the preservation of a violent, patriarchal society. As a result of a long history of nationalized oppression, Black women in South Africa continue to be an economically and socially vulnerable group. Their vulnerability is translated into limited intimate <b>relationship</b> <b>power,</b> which confers a host of health and safety risks. Thus, the current study explored whether negative life events and/or HIV infection related directly to women’s intimate <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> or was moderated by community-level variables (knowledge, helpfulness, and use of resources). Method: Participants were 104 women living with HIV and 152 non-infected women, who were recruited in and around Pretoria, South Africa. Two aspects of intimate <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> were considered: <b>relationship</b> control (e. g. Partner controls what I wear) and decision making dominance (e. g. Who usually decides when you have sex?). Decision-making dominance was divided into three subscales (male dominant, female dominant and mutual). Results: For relationship control, fewer undesirable life changes were associated with more control. For decision-making dominance, several main and interaction effects were observed. Negative serostatus and women’s knowledge of community resources were directly associated with more mutual decision-making. However, more frequent family use of community resources was related to less female dominated decisions. For helpfulness of resources, a significant interaction revealed that women living with HIV/AIDS perceived their male partners as less dominant when they perceived their community resources to be more helpful. Conclusions: <b>Power</b> in intimate <b>relationships</b> may enhance the quality and length of life for Black South African women; thus, it is important to identify factors that promote or compromise power. The {{results of this study suggest}} that undesirable life changes, HIV infection, and great reliance on community resources (i. e. frequent use) are negatively associated with perceived <b>relationship</b> <b>power.</b> Alternatively, the current study identified the perceived helpfulness of community resources as one possible factor that promotes <b>relationship</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundCross-sectional {{studies have}} shown that {{intimate}} partner violence and gender inequity in relationships are associated with increased prevalence of HIV in women. Yet temporal sequence and causality have been questioned, and few HIV prevention programmes address these issues. We assessed whether intimate partner violence and <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> inequity increase risk of incident HIV infection in South African women. MethodsWe did a longitudinal analysis of data from a previously published cluster-randomised controlled trial undertaken in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in 2002 – 06. 1099 women aged 15 – 26 years who were HIV negative at baseline and had at least one additional HIV test over 2 years of follow-up were included in the analysis. Gender power equity and intimate partner violence were measured by a sexual <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> scale and the WHO violence against women instrument, respectively. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of HIV acquisition at 2 years were derived from Poisson models, adjusted for study design and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection, and used to calculate population attributable fractions. Findings 128 women acquired HIV during 2076 person-years of follow-up (incidence 6 · 2 per 100 person-years). 51 of 325 women with low <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> equity at baseline acquired HIV (8 · 5 per 100 person-years) compared with 73 of 704 women with medium or high <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> equity (5 · 5 per 100 person-years); adjusted multivariable Poisson model IRR 1 · 51, 95 % CI 1 · 05 – 2 · 17, p= 0 · 027. 45 of 253 women who reported more than one episode of intimate partner violence at baseline acquired HIV (9 · 6 per 100 person-years) compared with 83 of 846 who reported one or no episodes (5 · 2 per 100 person-years); adjusted multivariable Poisson model IRR 1 · 51, 1 · 04 – 2 · 21, p= 0 · 032. The population attributable fractions were 13 · 9 % (95 % CI 2 · 0 – 22 · 2) for <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> equity and 11 · 9 % (1 · 4 – 19 · 3) for intimate partner violence.

How these variables are related among a specific subset of nurses with lower sexual <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> is also examined. Self-efficacy theory, specifically portions of Dr. Albert Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s work is used to guide this exploration. Chapter 1 introduces the problem of HIV/AIDS in Belize; the role of power, and selected issues surrounding women and HIV/AIDS. Chapter 1 also outlines the particular variables of interest and introduces the theoretical framework for the study. Chapter 2 reviews the relevant literature surrounding the identified variables and identifies current gaps that warrant further investigation. Chapter 3 outlines the methodological strategy employed for data analyses. This chapter also discusses the specific plan to address issues surrounding data collection and missing data. Chapter 4 presents the results of the psychometric analysis of the data collection instruments. All instruments included in this study were found to be psychometrically sound. Quantitative findings as well as the findings of the open-ended question are also examined. Qualitative analysis revealed intrinsic and extrinsic reasons or influences impacting a nurse 2 ̆ 7 s decision to promote and teach condom use to women to reduce HIV risk.

This study expands this notion and presents a model of interpersonal influence that incorporates receivers concerns both for their relationships with message sources and for their relationships with third parties affected by the advocated behavior. Specifically, C = Is * Os + It * Ot, where C denotes the likelihood of a receivers compliance, I the subjective importance of the receivers relationship with either source or third party, and O the anticipated relational outcome that complying with the message has for the receiver with either source or third party. An empirical test found strong evidence for the validity of this model. Results further suggested that anticipated changes in the relationship quality with requester and in <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> with the third party are associated with greater compliance, whereas anticipated changes in the relationship quality with the third party and in the <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> with the requester are associated with less compliance. Interpersonal influence...|$|R

40|$|As {{international}} retailers {{continue to}} employ franchising {{as a major}} method of market entry, the control of these international retail franchise networks becomes of significant importance. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the methods by which UK-based international fashion franchisors control franchisees and their international franchise businesses. The paper employs a qualitative methodology and a multiple case design. Six UK-based fashion retailers with international franchise operations form the empirical basis of the study. The franchise contract, support mechanisms, franchise partner selection, the franchise relationship and the use of master/area franchising were found to be the major methods by which international retail franchisors exert control over their franchise networks. While coercive and non-coercive sources of power were identified in the form of the franchise contract and support mechanisms, the paper also identifies sources of <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> and organisational power. The paper provides practical information to existing international franchisors and those firms considering the move into the international marketplace via the franchise mode of operation. By highlighting additional sources of power in the form of organisational and <b>relationship</b> <b>power,</b> franchisors are offered further means by which to control their international businesses than hitherto identified in the international franchise literature. Traditional franchise research suggests that there is a dichotomy in the sources of power available to franchisors, that is, coercive or non-coercive sources of power. While acknowledging the existence and importance of these sources of power and their related methods of control, this paper adds further dimensions to the academic debate by introducing <b>relationship</b> <b>power</b> and organisational power. Therefore, franchise partner selection, the franchise relationship and the use of master/area franchising emerge from the qualitative findings as further control mechanisms available to international retail franchisors...|$|R
