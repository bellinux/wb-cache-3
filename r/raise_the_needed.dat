5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
2500|$|... 1887 {{began with}} Short's younger brother, Henry Jenkins Short, killing {{a man named}} Charles T. Schuyler at San Angelo, Texas on January 23. San Angelo, 200 miles {{south-west}} of Fort Worth, was the town where Short's parents {{and other family members}} lived. Initial reports indicated that Schuyler was shot twice, the bullets entering his back and coming out at the front, either one of which would have been fatal. Henry Short fled to Fort Worth, before he could be arrested, to enlist the aid and funds that his brother Luke could provide for his defense. Luke and Henry returned to San Angelo on January 29, and Henry voluntarily surrendered to the sheriff and gave bond for his appearance in the district court. The money that would be needed to defend Henry Short would have to be provided by Luke, who had already put up the money for Henry's bond. In addition, Luke had at the time some unrelated but very expensive legal problems of his own looming in the Dallas court. The amount that would be needed to handle all of these legal issues was more than Luke had on hand. In order to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> funds, Johnson agreed to purchase Luke Short's one-third interest in the White Elephant on February 7, 1887. The press informed the public that Short had no intention of leaving town [...] "but will continue to call Fort Worth home." ...|$|E

My wife, to whom I had told my plan, made some objections to it, saying {{it did not seem}} right to use half the money paid in to buy so many pictures; but I told her that no one could expect in a raffle to clear all the money subscribed, and that although we should not gain as much as I had hoped, we should clear a hundred dollars, and every man would have a picture. This was surely fair, and the fact was that the unsympathetic state of mind of our members made it necessary for me to do something of this kind, if I expected to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> money at all.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Scrotal leiomyomas {{are rare}} tumours which are {{essentially}} benign. Recurrence and malignant transformation to leiomyosarcoma have been reported. However, a specific subgroup with increased bizarre nuclei showing increased mitosis <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> {{for a closer}} follow-up. We report on such a case. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 65 -year-old man who underwent a scrotal lump excision. Histology showed a well defined leiomyoma. The presence of nuclear pleomorphism and mitoses, just falling short of the criteria for malignancy, made prediction of biological behaviour difficult. The patient remains well on 4 -year follow-up. Conclusion Histological evidence of increased mitosis <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for sustained follow-up in view of the malignant potential from the extent of mitosis. Immunohistochemistry helps in identifying those patients warranting close follow-up. </p...|$|R
