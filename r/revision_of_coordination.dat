40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the introduction of a}} Child Sexual Abuse Protocol, supported by a specialized training program, in a large social service centre, to determine effects on social work practice and case outcomes. The sample (N = 261) represented referrals during two years, one before and one after introduction of the Protocol. Data sources were agency files, supplemented by interviews with five key informants. It was found that the Protocol and training had little effect on worker practice or case outcomes. An uneven and ambiguous implementation process, combined with the lack <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> the social service, police, and judicial systems, were contributing factors. The conflicting views of managers were important influences. Interagency <b>coordination,</b> and application <b>of</b> consistent standards, are recommended.

40|$|Releases of the GDP {{are subject}} to {{revisions}} over time. This paper examines the predictability <b>of</b> German GDP <b>revisions</b> using forecast rationality tests. Previous studies of German GDP covering data until 1997 finds that <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonally adjusted GDP are predictable. This paper uses a newly available real-time data to analyze the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonal adjusted GDP, of nominal unadjusted GDP, of the seasonal pattern, and of the GDP deflator for the period between 1992 and 2006. We find that the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the nominal unadjusted GDP are unpredictable, but that the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the price adjustments are predictable. Nevertheless, <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonally adjusted GDP are hardly predictable and less well predictable compared to earlier studies. This lower predictability seems {{to be linked to}} the finding that <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> seasonal adjustments are hardly predictable, too, and that their predictability decreased over time...|$|R

30|$|Methodologies {{taken in}} the papers being {{reviewed}} are dominated by the hard aspects <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> which focus on optimization and quantitative results.

40|$|Abstract Increasing {{competition}} due {{to market}} globalisation, product diversity and technological breakthroughs stimulates independent firms to collaborate in {{a supply chain}} {{that allows them to}} gain mutual benefits. This requires the collective know-how <b>of</b> the <b>coordination</b> mode, including the ability to synchronise interdependent processes, to integrate information systems and to cope with distributed learning. However, research into coordination has paid little attention to acknowledging different modes <b>of</b> <b>coordination.</b> This study promotes the notion of mutuality and the focus <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> in order to establish a comprehensive taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> modes. Four different modes <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> have been identified: logistics synchronisation, information sharing, incentive alignment, and collective learning. The knowledge <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> is then proposed as an explicit understanding about key drivers <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> modes that have positive impacts on supply chain performance.
