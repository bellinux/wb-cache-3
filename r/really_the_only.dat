The Americans learned to do it later. But at that time, Hahn and Strassmann were <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> ones who could do it. And that was because they were such good chemists. Somehow they really succeeded in using chemistry to demonstrate and prove a physical process.|$|E
25|$|English {{may have}} been spoken in the North West from around the 7th century AD, when the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria first appears to have made inroads west of the Pennines. The {{language}} at this time {{would have been the}} Northumbrian dialect of Old English. The high percentage of English place names in the region as a whole suggests English became almost ubiquitous over the coming centuries, particularly in the area south of the Lake District. Manchester, Liverpool, Lancaster, Blackburn and Preston are among the region's many English place names. In the 9th-11th centuries, Danes from the east and Norsemen from Ireland and Scotland began settling in the area. The North West is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> area of England where Norse settlement was significant and their influence remains in the place names and dialect of the region. Elements like fell, thwaite and tarn, which are particularly common in Cumbria, are all Norse. The numerous Kirkbys and place names with 'holm' and 'dale' show the Scandinvian influence throughout the North West.|$|E

For {{the role of}} Nikola Tesla, Nolan wanted someone who was not necessarily a film star but was [...] "extraordinarily charismatic". Nolan said that [...] "David Bowie was <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> guy I had in mind to play Tesla because his function in the story is a small but very important role". Nolan contacted Bowie, who initially turned down the part. A lifelong fan, Nolan flew out to New York to pitch the role to Bowie in person, telling him {{no one else could}} possibly play the part; Bowie accepted after a few minutes.|$|E

500|$|Alan Woodhouse from NME was {{unfavorable}} in {{his review}} about the compilation, reckoning Madonna's career as two distinct phases, them being her [...] "80s output" [...] and her later career, or [...] "phaze two", summarizing by saying that [...] "Madonna clearly thinks this collection represents a celebration of her longevity [...] in reality all it does it expose her more recent failings", though Woodhouse also called it [...] "unfair to say Madge hasn’t touched magic since 1990" [...] before naming [...] "Hung Up" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". Douglas Wolk, from Pitchfork, reviewed the album in the same light, also comparing her early work with the later days, stating that [...] "'Hung Up' is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> song from the post-GHV2 period that's lodged in the American pop consciousness", concluding with saying that [...] " [...] deserves a retrospective more interesting than this haphazard piece of contract-filling product.", though being positive about the opening sequence, calling that [...] "incredibly strong, a convincing argument for her genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Stone said he {{felt the}} episode {{solidified}} major characteristics embodied by the Chef character, particularly {{the fact that he}} is one of the only adults in South Park who always understands the truth of any given situation and believes the children almost all of the time. Stone said, [...] "It's like the parents are all nuts that live in the town. The boys are kind of the most sane and Chef is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one in town who believes the kids when they say (something) is happening, when the kids are actually right and it's the town that's crazy." [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was also the first episode in which Liane Cartman, Eric Cartman's mother, was portrayed as a promiscuous woman who was previously a crack whore and is willing to engage in pornographic sex for money; during the episode, she is mentioned and actually featured on the cover of [...] "Crack Whore Magazine", much to Cartman's shock and dismay.|$|E

She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend.

500|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{features}} {{a range of}} genres; including pop, reggae, disco and dancehall, R, hip hop and [...] "punky" [...] electro-pop music. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly viewed it as [...] "an album so directly torn from Stefani's recent, much-documented romantic upheavals {{that it could be}} called 'The Ballad of Blake and Gavin". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic added that: [...] "Stefani spends roughly half of the record singing breezy songs of liberation." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented: [...] "While an artist converting personal tragedy into creative capital is hardly new, the nakedness with which Stefani assesses the ruins of her relationship is stark, especially compared to the self-proclaimed guilty pleasures of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape." [...] On writing about both relationships, Stefani claimed: [...] "I don't have any secrets; I don't have anything to hide. I haven't done anything wrong. I'm happy to share my story. [...] is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> record I've written that's mostly happy; all the others are about heartbreak.

500|$|When {{adapting}} the characters for film, Thompson {{found that in}} the novel, [...] "Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods," [...] and that [...] "making the male characters effective {{was one of the}} biggest problems. Willoughby is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> male who springs out in three dimensions." [...] Several major male characters in Sense and Sensibility were consequently altered significantly from the novel in an effort to appeal to contemporary audiences. Grant's Edward and Rickman's Brandon are [...] "ideal" [...] modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as [...] "pleasing manners", especially when contrasted with Palmer. Thompson's script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward's storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in Edward's possession is hers, when it belongs to Lucy. He was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers. To gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne's love, Thompson's screenplay has his storyline mirroring Willoughby's; they are similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Eric Warren Singer after he developed {{an interest in the}} banking scandals from the 1980s and 90s, he was looking for [...] "a paranoid thriller vibe" [...] from that period; [...] "The Godfather III was <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> film up to this point that dealt with the banking scandals, because it was really gangster warfare on a corporate level, and I thought that was {{the best part of the}} film." [...] Later reviewers compared it directly to The Parallax View (1974) and All The President's Men (1976). [...] Ridley Scott initially expressed an interest in directing the film, and the studio agreed to finance the project, only for Scott to drop out. A year later Tom Tykwer got involved through his agent, but decided a contemporary setting would work better. In April 2007, Clive Owen agreed to perform in The International. He said the script interested him because he was reminded of [...] "those '70s paranoia pictures" [...] and because it combined a factual, intelligent basis with an international thriller plot. The following July, actress Naomi Watts was cast opposite Owen. In August, the film received US$5.4 million from the [...] toward its budget. The following month its funding increased to $7.9 million, based on the board's assessment that two-thirds of The International would be produced in Germany and that a number of Germans were in important roles, such as actors Armin Mueller-Stahl and Axel Milberg, cinematographer Frank Griebe, and production designer Uli Hanisch. Filming began in Berlin on 10 September 2007. Part of the production took place in Babelsberg Studios.|$|E

Ferguson argues that <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> mode that the Didache mentions is affusion.

2500|$|Originalism is a {{means of}} {{constitutional}} interpretation, not constitutional construction; whenever [...] "to describe [...] case is not to decide it", it can only serve as a guide for what the Constitution says, not how that text applies to a given case or controversy. Thus, Originalists can reach different results in the same case; see, for example, United States v. Fordice; McIntyre; Hamdi, Gonzales v. Raich; National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services.

2500|$|In 2013, Wilson explained: [...] "I first felt I {{had a good}} {{voice when}} I was about {{seventeen}} or eighteen {{and was able to}} sing along well to records by the Four Freshmen. By singing along to those records that's how I learned how to sing falsetto. [...] I would sing along to songs like 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' 'I'll Remember April' and 'Day by Day'." [...] He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a [...] "groovy sectional sound". He added, [...] "The harmonies that we [...] are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake."

I think <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one missing is [...] Lance Stroll, but other than that it's as competitive as it could get." [...] Félix da Costa stated he was returning to Macau because of its iconic status and still had knowledge of the track despite having not driven on the circuit in the last four years. When asked if he felt he could achieve the victory, he replied [...] "yes and no" [...] because of not having had experience in Formula Three cars for the previous three years, but said he would give it an attempt and would be pleased to secure a top-five finishing position. The track's fastest lap record holder Sérgio Sette Câmara said it was [...] "amazing" [...] to compete in the event, revealing that he would carry the experience he had from the previous year and was confident in his car's set-up.|$|E
2500|$|Wanting {{to return}} to their sound from that {{particular}} era, after narrowing down the selection from twelve finished songs to ten that they wanted to record, the band sought to work with James [...] "Jimbo" [...] Barton, who had mixed and engineered the band's hit albums Operation: Mindcrime and Empire, and whom they had last worked with in the mid-90s, when he produced their album Promised Land. Deciding to work with Barton was [...] "a no-brainer", according to La Torre, and Rockenfield has said that Barton was <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> choice. Barton had stayed in contact with Wilton, who would often fill him in on {{what was going on in}} the band. Queensrÿche invited him to see them perform at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on November 24, 2012, where he reportedly said that the band [...] "had something really special here and he wanted to be a part of it." [...] In the studio in Seattle, he told the band: [...] "Look guys, let's just start where we left off, back in 1995". Rockenfield looks back on the collaboration, saying: [...] "Working with Jimbo [...] and the addition of Todd has revitalized the band in ways we never knew until we heard the final results" [...] and: [...] "We had the best time, and he was such a great, perfect match to make this record." ...|$|E
