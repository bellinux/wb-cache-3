Banton allows himself {{to be taken to}} a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and <b>reducing</b> <b>matter</b> into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that the government wants to exploit him. Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning, declaring the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital.|$|E

Under the pearl rafts, however, the quantities of these constituents have high values in both of the seas. 2) The values of ignition loss are higher in the Sasebo Bay than in the Omura Bay. Under the pearl rafts, however, these values are high, in both of the seas. 3) The ratios of organic carbon to total nitrogen are nearly ten, in the regions rich in organic matters, especially at the estuary of the Hiu, bottoms under the pearl rafts and the inlet of the strait. From the above results, we consider that these constituents are, mainly, derived from sewerages at the ordinary stations and from excretions of pearl oysters under the rafts. According to statistics, we recognize the following relations. 4) The sulfides have positive correlations with the organic carbons and the <b>reducing</b> <b>matters</b> but not with the ignition losses and the total nitrogens. 5) The ignition losses have positive correlations with the total nitrogens and the organic carbons but not with the <b>reducing</b> <b>matters</b> and ratios of organic carbon to total nitrogen. 6) The total nitrogens have positive correlation with the organic carbons and <b>reducing</b> <b>matters...</b>|$|R

An analysis based on segmentation of T 1 -weighted images from 17 developmental prosopagnosics and 18 matched controls revealed that they had <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume in the right anterior inferior temporal lobe and in the superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus bilaterally. In addition, a voxel-based morphometry analysis based on the segmentation of magnetization transfer parameter maps showed that developmental prosopagnosics also had <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume in the right middle fusiform gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus. Multiple regression analyses relating three distinct behavioural component scores, derived from a principal component analysis, to grey matter volume revealed an association between a component related to facial identity and grey matter volume in the left superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus plus the right middle fusiform gyrus/inferior temporal gyrus. Grey matter volume in the lateral occipital cortex was associated with component scores related to object recognition tasks.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to evaluate clinical characteristics and cerebral alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with diurnal visual hallucinations (VI-Is). Assessment was performed using magnetic resonance image (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Thirty-nine patients with PD (53. 8 %) and ten controls were studied. Voxel based morphology analysis was performed. Eleven patients presented diurnal VHs and among these, six had cognitive dysfunction. Patients with VHs performed worse in the mentation-related UPDRS I (p = 0. 005) and motor-related UPDRS III (p = 0. 02). Patients with VHs showed significant clusters of <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume compared to controls in the left opercula frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. PD without hallucinations demonstrated <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume in the left superior frontal gyrus compared to controls. Comparisons between patients with VHs regarding the presence of cognitive dysfunction showed that cases with cognitive dysfunction as compared to those without cognitive dysfunction showed significant clusters of <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume in the left opercular frontal gyrus. Cases without cognitive dysfunction had <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> substance in the left insula and left trigonal frontal gyrus. judging from our findings, an abnormal frontal cortex, particularly left sided insula, frontal opercular, trigonal frontal gyrus and orbital frontal would make PD patients vulnerable to hallucinations. Compromise of the left operculum distinguished cases with VHs and cognitive dysfunction. Our findings reinforce the theoretical concept of a top-down visual processing in the genesis of VI-Is in PD.

5000|$|The {{resolution}} by fusion {{means to}} fuse two conflicting themes into one. For example, {{the idea of}} a supernatural order can be fused with {{the idea of a}} natural order by making the former immanent in the latter, as it was advocated in the Romantic idea of natural supernaturalism or supernatural naturalism. Resolution by elimination denotes that one theme eliminates another. Extreme scientism is an example of this type of resolution. By looking upon physical things from a strictly positivistic and materialist point of view, the scientistic position eradicates every spiritual experience and reduces all things to physical matter. Scientific materialism is reductive; it <b>reduces</b> mind to <b>matter.</b> The opposite reduction is also possible; it is to <b>reduce</b> <b>matter</b> to mind. This is also a resolution by elimination. Unlike these reductive methods, the resolution by fusion rejects reduction. But all of them produce a monistic result. The last type of resolution is the resolution by absorption, which denotes that one theme absorbs another. This type of resolution is perhaps the most difficult to comprehend because it can easily get mistaken for the resolution by fusion. In Seung’s words: ...|$|R
