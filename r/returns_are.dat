5|$|Superman Returns {{was shot}} using Panavision's Genesis digital camera. Production {{designer}} Guy Hendrix Dyas {{was influenced by}} Frank Lloyd Wright's Johnson Wax Headquarters {{for the design of}} the Daily Planet. ESC Entertainment was originally set to design the visual effects sequences, but Warner Bros. replaced them with the hiring of Mark Stetson from Sony Pictures Imageworks as the visual effects supervisor. A total of 1,400 visual effects shots were created. The script required a scene of Superman safely delivering a Boeing 777 in a baseball park where computer-generated imagery was used as it would have been impossible to assemble the number of extras for the shots. A second unit crew traveled to Dodger Stadium to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. The scenes of Metropolis was actually {{a modified version of the}} skyline of Manhattan. Using footage from the original Superman (1978) film as a reference point, Marlon Brando was re-created by Rhythm & Hues using CGI. The opening credits for Superman <b>Returns</b> <b>are</b> presented in an intended recreation of the style used for Superman, again to the accompaniment of John Williams's theme music.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} impact of risks on returns of sukuk in different sectorial structures. The different types of risks (market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk) are independant variables and the <b>return</b> of sukuk <b>is</b> dependant variable. Data were collected from Nasdaq Dubai HSBC sukuk index of sukuk market period from 2005 to 2015 {{on a monthly basis}} and analyzed using descriptive, correlation analysis and multi-regressions analysis. The four regression models explain 70 % to 89 % of the variation. While risk exposure on global sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> 88 %, risk exposure on sovereign sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> 70 %. While risk exposure to corporate sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> 89 % risk exposure to financial sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> 73 %. The results indicate that a sovereign sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> very less exposed to risk compared with other sectors corporate sukuk and financial sukuk. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that sovereign sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> minimally exposed to risk. It is also found that when compared with finance sector risk is high in the corporate sector.

25|$|An oft-cited {{academic}} paper (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005) {{suggests that}} the net-of-fees returns to PE funds are roughly comparable to the S 500 (or even slightly under).

One should also note that these <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> not risk-adjusted. A more recent paper (Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan, 2012) found that average buyout fund returns in the U.S. have actually exceeded that of public markets.
