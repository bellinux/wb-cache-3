40|$|Malesia is {{the center}} of Dipterocarps {{diversity}} in the world, with most species found in Indonesia. Sadly, their existence is threatened by illegal logging, extensive exploitation, and habitat conversion. There are 143 Indonesian Dipterocarps categorized as threatened in the IUCN Red List. Bogor Botanic Garden (BBG) {{is one of the leading}} institutions focuses on ex situ conservation of plants. Dipterocarps collection in the BBG represents 41. 5 % of Dipterocarps of Sumatra, 17. 0 % of Dipterocarps of Kalimantan, 77. 8 % of Dipterocarps of Java, 66. 7 % of Dipterocarps of Bali and Nusa Tenggara, 57. 1 % of Dipterocarps of Sulawesi, 66. 7 % Dipterocarps of Moluccas, and 8. 3 % Dipterocarps of Papua. Totally, BBG has only conserved about 37. 8 % of threatened Indonesian Dipterocarps, still far from the target aimed by the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (60 % conserved). The BBG has initiated genetic resource conservation of Dipterocarps, through seed preservation. Since most Dipterocarps have recalcitrant seeds, conventional storage methods cannot be used. One of the alternative solutions is to cryopreserve the excised embryo or embryonic axes to overcome the limits of conventional storage methods. Collection of threatened and endemic species along with <b>research</b> <b>on</b> <b>embryo</b> culture and cryopreservation should be intensified in the future. </p...|$|E

According to the current state, bioethics is able to highlighted main issues, which are connected with medical research and suggest possible solution. This paper combines two controversial topics.

40|$|Complete {{understanding}} of the route of HIV- 1 transmission is an important prerequisite for curbing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. So far, the known routes of HIV- 1 transmission include sexual contact, needle sharing, puncture, transfusion and mother-tochild transmission. Whether HIV can be vertically transmitted from human sperm to embryo by fertilization is largely undetermined. Direct <b>research</b> <b>on</b> <b>embryo</b> derived from infected human sperm and healthy human ova have been difficult because of ethical issues and problems {{in the collection of}} ova. However, the use of inter-specific in vitro fertilization (IVF) between human sperm and hamster ova can avoid both of these problems. Combined with molecular, cytogenetical and immunological techniques such as the preparation of human sperm chromosomes, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), this study mainly explored whether any integrated HIV provirus were present in the chromosomes of infected patients ’ sperm, and whether that provirus could be transferred into early embryos by fertilization and maintain its function of replication and expression. Evidence showed that HIV- 1 nucleic acid was present in the spermatozoa of HIV/AIDS patients, that HIV- 1 provirus is present on the patient sperm chromosome, that the integrated provirus could be transferred into early embryo chromosomally integrated by fertilization, and that it could replicate alongside the embryonic genome and subsequently express its protein in the embryo. These findings indicate the possibility of vertical transmission of HIV- 1 from the sperm genome to the embryonic genome by fertilization. This stud...|$|E

40|$|Between 2011 and 2012, 213 {{heterosexual}} couples undergoing fertility treatments in a Portuguese public fertility centre were systematically {{recruited to}} assess {{factors associated with}} willingness to donate embryos for research. Data were collected by questionnaire. Most couples (87. 3 %; 95 % CI 82. 1 to 91. 5) were willing to donate embryos for research, citing benefits for science, health and infertile patients. Almost all couples (94. 3 %; 95 % CI 89. 8 to 96. 7) reached consensus about the decision. Willingness to donate was more frequent in women younger than 36 years (adjusted OR 3. 06; 95 % CI 1. 23 to 7. 61) and who considered embryo research {{to be very important}} (adjusted OR: 6. 32; 95 % CI 1. 85 to 21. 64), and in Catholic men (adjusted OR 4. 16; 95 % CI 1. 53 to 11. 30). Those unwilling to donate reported conceptualizing embryos as children or living beings and a lack of information or fears about embryo research. Men with higher levels of trait anxiety (adjusted OR 0. 90; 95 % CI 0. 84 to 0. 96) were less frequently willing to donate.

30|$|Embryonic {{stem cell}} science may optimistically be {{characterized}} as moving across the T 1 valley from basic discoveries to initial applications in health – though even recent developments, such as {{the report of the}} first cloned human stem cells[20], remind us that basic science work continues in this field. There was a time not long ago, however, when it might not have been pursued at all. Beginning with the momentous announcement in early November 1998 that human embryonic stem cells had been isolated[21] strategies for translation were hindered by numerous ethical and political hurdles. Even early claims of success turned out to be either unsupported[22] or patently false[23]. Science persisted with successes reported in other areas of stem cell science, among them Yamanaka’s Nobel prize-winning work on induced pluripotent stem cells[24]. Arguably, however, these advancements may have occurred despite the policy environment rather than because of it. For example, {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the 1998 reports U.S. President Clinton requested that the National Bioethics Advisory Commission advise on next steps[25] which was followed by actions from the NIH, FDA, the Institute of Medicine, Congress and two presidents to craft U.S. domestic federal policy that is still somewhat unsettled. This was despite more than two decades of policy deliberation in the US about ethics of embryo research. Many other jurisdictions including those in Europe developed evolving policy in parallel with the U.S. For example, France’s first bioethics law in 1994 prohibited <b>research</b> <b>on</b> <b>embryo</b> stem cells and evolved over time: following revisions of the law in 2004 certain exceptions to the prohibition were permitted, then a revision of these conditions were described in 2011, and most recently in 2013 ES cell research was proposed to be authorized with conditions. Others established country-specific rules ranging from permissive, albeit highly regulated regimes, to restrictive laws forbidding the isolation of stem cells from human embryos under any circumstances[26]. The policy landscape at that time included no shortage of recommendations, regulations, guidelines and legislation but rather than offering a clear path for translational medicine they were often unclear, ambiguous and sometimes contradictory. In some instances the uncertainty was shown to have demonstrable (and substantially detrimental) effects on the conduct of stem cell science as reported by scientists themselves[18]. This ‘patchwork’ approach was found in other countries leading to frustration and confusion by scientists and sponsors[27].|$|E

Stem cells can be coaxed into growing cells of any other type, which makes them potentially very useful indeed. However, removing stem cells from an embryo will kill the embryo, which some people object to.
