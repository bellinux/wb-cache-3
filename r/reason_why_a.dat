5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination with long hair was one <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E

25|$|The {{birthday}} {{problem in}} this more generic sense applies to hash functions: the expected number of N-bit hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not 2N, but rather only 2N/2.

25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What {{this means is that}} for Spinoza, questions regarding the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> given phenomenon {{is the way it is}} (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} sports which are fairly {{dangerous}} and involve threatening activities, especially during competition. There {{is always the}} chance of athletes getting injured while competing or during training which is exactly the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> psychologist would eventually encounter a patient who is a serious athlete and {{is in need of}} their assistance to rehabilitate their PTSD. Psychology as a general occupation has dated back to times of 1878, and around 1897 the first psychologist specialising in sport was established, by the name of Dr. Norman Triplett. Ever since, sport psychologists were helping different athletes, in the mental aspect of their game, {{in order for them to}} reach their optimum potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{interaction}} of a loudspeaker system with its environment {{is complex and}} is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present {{a more or less}} reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from resonant room modes), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and {{this is part of the}} <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2003 season, the AFL {{made a deal}} with NBC to {{televise}} league games, which was renewed for another two years in 2005. In conjunction with this, the league moved {{the beginning of the season}} from May to February (the week after the NFL's Super Bowl) and scheduled most of its games on Sunday instead of Friday or Saturday as it had in the past. In 2006, because of the XX Winter Olympic Games, the Stanley Cup playoffs and the Daytona 500, NBC scaled back from weekly coverage to scattered coverage during the regular season, but committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the 20th ArenaBowl. NBC and the Arena Football League officially severed ties on June 30, 2006, having failed to reach a new broadcast deal. Las Vegas owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> deal failed is because ESPN refused to show highlights or even mention a product being broadcast on NBC.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the belief}} that baptism is a {{necessary}} part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. However members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. [...] One author describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, [...] "Faith is the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> person is a child of God; baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God" [...] (italics are in the source). [...] Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a [...] "work" [...] that earns salvation.|$|E
500|$|Bernard Matthews {{had been}} {{importing}} 38tons of partly processed turkey meat {{on a weekly}} basis from their Saga Foods company, in Sárvár, Hungary, to a processing plant next to the farm. Though Saga Foods lies [...] from where the recent Hungarian H5N1 outbreak had occurred, a company director admitted it was [...] "possible" [...] that some of the meat could have come from the exclusion zone. In response to this revelation, Whitehall expressed concern over biosecurity and whether any meat may have been distributed for human consumption in Britain. On 9 February 2007 the Hungarian authorities started an investigation to try to establish whether there was a connection between the Suffolk and Hungarian outbreaks. On 11 February the investigation revealed that turkey products were still being transported, in both directions, between the plant and Hungary with EU regulations being cited as the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> transport ban could not be imposed.|$|E

500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year.

500|$|The {{cemetery}} {{provides some}} hints to the woman's local connections and religious affiliations. She was buried around or {{soon after the}} time when St. Hilda of Whitby {{was active in the}} region, first at Hartlepool Abbey, then at Whitby Abbey, which was founded in 657. The woman may well have known St. Hilda, who came from a similar aristocratic background and had lived for a while in East Anglia, where bed burials were more common. It is unclear, however, whether the woman was also a Christian. Features such as the typically Christian east-west orientation of the graves have been cited in support of a Christian affiliation, {{but on the other hand}} the cemetery was built on an ancient pagan site and there is no obvious <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> Christian princess would not have been buried at Whitby alongside fellow Christians. As Christianity was spreading across the region at this time, the possible Christian features of the cemetery could be due simply to local social convention favouring some Christian styles in burial rituals, even for non-Christians. Steve Sherlock considers the bed burial to be [...] "stridently pagan, a sort of rare, female equivalent of ship burials, as she is laid out on a vehicle to deliver her to the afterworld," [...] however, and he suggests that she may have been the centre of a pagan cult that was active alongside local Christians.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} leading to the [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] premiere, the {{watchdog}} group Commercial Alert filed a complaint against producers to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Commentators from the group criticized distillery brand Jack Daniel's for its decision to sponsor Mad Men, citing that it violates industry codes that prohibit alcohol marketing, as well [...] "depictions of irresponsible drinking, overt sexual activity or sexually lewd images". Robert Weissman, the director for Commercial Alert, stated that based on AMC's website, [...] "it appears that the sponsorship arrangement will violate numerous provisions of the industry's self-regulatory marketing code." [...] He continued: [...] "There is no <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>a</b> company {{should be able to}} escape normal enforcement and implementation of the Code simply because it chooses to violate the code in such brazen manner that curing the violation would cause non-trivial complications for a major television series." [...] In association with the complaint, Weissman urged in his letter that the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States become more proactive in regulating the distilleries' initiatives in the entertainment industry. [...] "Our complaint in this instance is not with the portrayal of heavy alcohol consumption, or even with the glorification of such heavy consumption; it is specific to industry sponsorship of and entwinement with such portrayals. Quite different issues are raised where artists choose to depict such activities in the absence of industry sponsorship." ...|$|E
