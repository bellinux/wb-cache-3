We develop a proof technique which allows us to rederive the same lower bound in a much simpler fashion.

50|$|Mattresses {{require a}} solid {{foundation}} which does not itself sag - a sagging foundation, such as by weak slats on a wide bed, will in turn cause the mattress to sag. Consistently sleeping {{in the same place}} and body position causes excessive wear, and thus rotating or flipping mattresses is used to reduce this: double-sided mattresses can be alternately flipped width-wise (about the long axis) and length-wise (about the shorter axis), or alternately flipped and rotated; while single-sided mattresses are only rotated, which is simpler but less effective. Flipping/rotation schedules vary between materials and manufacturers, but typically recommended is monthly for the first six months, and every two or three months thereafter. Foundations should also be rotated, if possible, though less frequently - <b>rotating</b> <b>box</b> springs twice a year is recommended. While sagging is undesirable, some level of indentation (about 8 cm or 1.5 inches) is natural if natural materials are used in a comfort layer.|$|E

Players take control of either Mario or Luigi, adventuring through eight kingdoms of the Mushroom World to defeat the seven Koopa Kids and Bowser, who have taken the seven magic rods from the kings of these seven kingdoms, transforming them into various creatures. Players are able to make use of several basic techniques such as running, jumping, and swimming. The objective of each stage is to reach a certain goal, which is typically a black background with a <b>rotating</b> <b>box</b> containing either a mushroom, flower, or star. Players access the levels by exploring various maps; once a level is complete, players may not replay it until they beat the game. This map has several features on it, such as bridges that lower after completing a level or Hammer Bros. that wander around the map. There are several kinds of levels, including a dungeon level and an airship level.

The goals of the presented numerical code are to provide a tool to investigate aspects of confined rotating convection experiments with a simple model and to illustrate the application of parity filtering. In our numerical tests, we find that a correct accounting for parity leads to clear and interesting behavior that has been observed in laboratory experiments but that has not been observed in previous numerical simulations in periodic domains...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{decaying}} turbulence in fixed and <b>rotating</b> <b>boxes</b> in two dimen- sions using the particle method SPH. The boundaries are specified by boundary force particles, and the turbulence is initiated {{by a set}} of gaussian vortices. In the case of fixed boxes we recover the results of Clercx and his colleagues obtained using both a high accuracy spectral method and experiments. Our results for fixed boxes are also in close agreement with those of Monaghan 1 and Robinson and Monaghan 2 obtained using SPH. A feature of decaying turbulence in no-slip, square, fixed boundaries is that the angular momentum of the fluid varies with time because of the reaction on the fluid of the viscous stresses on the boundary. We find that when the box is allowed to rotate freely, so that the total angular momentum of box and fluid is constant, the change in the angular momentum of the fluid is a factor ~ 500 smaller than is the case for the fixed box, and the final vorticity distribution is different. We also simulate the behaviour of the turbulence when the box is forced to rotate with small and large Rossby number, and the turbulence is initiated by gaussian vortices as before. If the rotation of the box is maintained after the turbulence is initiated we find that in the rotating frame the decay of kinetic energy, enstrophy and the vortex structure is insensitive to the angular velocity of the box. On the other hand, If the box is allowed to rotate freely after the turbulence is initiated, the evolved vortex structure is completely different...|$|R

The circulation in the bottom lens, on the other hand, was relatively weak. No such eddy forms when the depth of fresh water is relatively deep, and a regime diagram is given {{for the formation of}} the coherent eddies. Thus a relatively simple structure emerges despite the complexity of the generating process.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in hydrodynamic instabilities in dead zones of protoplanetary disks {{as a mechanism}} for driving angular momentum transport and {{as a source of}} particle-trapping vortices to mix chondrules and incubate planetesimal formation. We present simulations with a pseudo-spectral anelastic code and with the compressible code Athena, showing that stably stratified flows in a shearing, <b>rotating</b> <b>box</b> are violently unstable and produce space-filling, sustained turbulence dominated by large vortices with Rossby numbers of order 0. 2 - 0. 3. This Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI) is observed in both codes and is triggered by Kolmogorov turbulence with Mach numbers less than 0. 01. It is a common view that if a given constant density flow is stable, then stable vertical stratification should make the flow even more stable. Yet, we show that sufficient vertical stratification can be unstable to ZVI. ZVI is robust and requires no special tuning of boundary conditions, or initial radial entropy or vortensity gradients (though we have studied ZVI only in the limit of infinite cooling time). The resolution of this paradox is that stable stratification allows for a new avenue to instability: baroclinic critical layers. ZVI has not been seen in previous studies of flows in rotating, shearing boxes because those calculations frequently lacked vertical density stratification and/or sufficient numerical resolution. Although we do not expect appreciable angular momentum transport from ZVI in the small domains in this study, we hypothesize that ZVI in larger domains with compressible equations may lead to angular transport via spiral density waves.

Under the influence of the Coriolis force, the advection of the magnetic field results in a non-vanishing contribution to the mean electric field, given by (u x b).

40|$|Abstract — Many objects {{found in}} {{domestic}} environments are reflectionally symmetric. In this paper, {{we present a}} system that can visually track moving objects by their reflectional symmetry in real time. Apart from the assumption of symmetry, the tracking system does not require any prior object models of the target, such as its colour and shape. The system is robust to shadows and specular reflections. It can also deal with transparent objects. Block motion detection is {{used in conjunction with}} symmetry for object tracking. A Kalman filter is used to estimate the object state. Predictions from the Kalman filter is used to improve the efficiency of the symmetry detector. The tracker provides a real time segmentation of an object by searching for motion that is symmetric about the object’s mirror line. The tracking system also generates a <b>rotated</b> bounding <b>box,</b> aligned with the object’s symmetry line, which {{can be used as a}} window for other image processing operations.
