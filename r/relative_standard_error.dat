METHODS: PK data {{for adults and}} children were available from two different randomised studies for treatment of malaria with the same artesunate-mefloquine combination regimen. A recommended design for paediatric study on mefloquine was optimised based on an extrapolated model built from adult data through the following approach: (i) a PK model was built in adults, and parameters were estimated using the SAEM algorithm; (ii) paediatric PK parameters were then obtained by adding allometry and maturation to the adult model; (iii) a D-optimal design in children was obtained with PFIM assuming the extrapolated design. Finally, the robustness of the recommended design was evaluated {{in terms of the}} relative bias and <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>errors</b> (RSE) of the parameters in a simulation study with four different models, and was compared to the empirical design actually performed in the paediatric study. RESULTS: Combining pharmacokinetic modelling, extrapolation and design optimisation led to a design for children with 5 sampling times. Pharmacokinetic parameters were well estimated with this design with low <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>errors.</b> Although the extrapolated model did not predict the observed mefloquine concentrations in children very accurately, it allowed precise and unbiased estimates across various model assumptions, contrary to the empirical design.

40|$|Introduction The National Hospital Discharge Survey is {{a primary}} data source for {{epidemiology}} research in the United States. To ensure that estimates are reliable, confidence intervals need to be calculated. The original survey data source is not available to the public, and the usual statistical methods are unsuitable for calculating confidence intervals. Instead, calculating confidence intervals requires using the statistical methods and relative standard errors that the U. S. National Center for Health Statistics has provided. However, the <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> parameters differ by hospital, patient category, and group. They also change yearly with sampling and are expressed differently before and during or after 1988. Consequently, manual computations of confidence intervals with multiple groups, diseases, and years are inefficient and prone to error. We developed a SAS program to compute confidence intervals for National Hospital Discharge Survey data from 1979 through 2000, newborns excluded. Methods We transposed 22 tables of <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> parameters (one for each year) into two new parameter tables that maintain the sampling designs before 1988 and during and after 1988 but are similar in overall structure. We unified all values to make each set of <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> parameters unique. We developed a program, COMPURSE, to search for <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> parameters for inputted estimates and to calculate confidence intervals. We set up an interface program for users to enter data, time period, confidence interval level, and output location; to read the <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> parameter tables; and to run the COMPURSE program. Results For different sets of National Hospital Discharge Survey data, COMPURSE efficiently and correctly retrieved relevant <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> parameters for estimates and accurately calculated relative standard errors, standard errors, and confidence intervals for annual estimates, multiple-year summaries, and average annual estimates.

Data from 16 healthy volunteers were included. Possible covariates influencing lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were also assessed. Data were modeled first separately and then together by using individually predicted ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters in the final lopinavir model. The model was evaluated {{by means of a}} visual predictive check and external validation. A maximum-effect model in which ritonavir inhibited the elimination of lopinavir best described the relationship between ritonavir concentrations and lopinavir clearance (CL/F). A ritonavir concentration of 0. 06 mg/liter was associated with a 50 % maximum inhibition of the lopinavir CL/F. The population prediction of the lopinavir CL/F in the absence of ritonavir was 21. 6 liters/h (<b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error,</b> 14. 0 %), and the apparent volume of distribution and absorption rate constant were 55. 3 liters (<b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error,</b> 10. 2 %) and 0. 57 hâˆ’ 1 (<b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error,</b> 0. 39 %), respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the measurement reproducibility for a procedure evaluating the mastication process and to estimate the smallest detectable differences of 3 D kinematic and surface electromyography (sEMG) variables. Kinematics of mandible movements and sEMG activity of the masticatory muscles were obtained over two sessions with four conditions: two food textures (biscuit and bread) of two sizes (small and large). Twelve healthy adults (mean age 29. 1 years) completed the study. The second to the fifth chewing cycle of 5 bites were used for analyses. The reproducibility per outcome variable was calculated with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a Bland-Altman analysis was applied to determine the standard error of measurement relative error of measurement and smallest detectable differences of all variables. ICCs ranged from 0. 71 to 0. 98 for all outcome variables. The outcome variables consisted of four bite and fourteen chewing cycle variables. The <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of measurement of the bite variables was up to 17. 3 % for 'time-to-swallow', 'time-to-transport' and 'number of chewing cycles', but ranged from 31. 5 % to 57. 0 % for 'change of chewing side'. The <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> of measurement ranged from 4. 1 % to 24. 7 % for chewing cycle variables and was smaller for kinematic variables than sEMG variables.

These reference values are obtained from the relationship between Hg vapour mass concentrations at saturation in air (É£Hg, in ng cmâˆ’ 3) and temperature (T, in K). This relationship was re-evaluated by fitting replicated (n[*]=[*] 3, 4) SI traceable measurement results obtained for mL size mercury-saturated air samples at temperatures of around 288. 4, 293. 3, 298. 2 and 303. 1 [*]K (2. 4 %, 0. 20 %, 0. 51 % and 1. 6 % <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>errors</b> of the means, respectively). It gave É£Hg[*]=[*]C/T* 10 (âˆ’B/T) with B[*]=[*] 3282. 92 [*]K and C[*]=[*] 6. 73257 [*]Ã—[*] 1014 [*]K ng cmâˆ’ 3, at an estimated relative expanded (combined) uncertainty of 5. 9 % (k[*]=[*] 2). The measurement procedure was based on temperature controlled automated sampling of the gaseous mercury, isotope dilution of the mercury following trapping into the liquid phase under closed circuit conditions, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the signal acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Fishing {{and natural}} {{mortality}} rates and tag reporting rate for rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) in northwest Tasmania, Australia, were estimated using multiyear tagging models. These estimates {{are necessary for}} assessment of the resource. Several models were examined that had either two or three tagging events each year, and either combined sexes or kept sexes separate. The model that best described {{the dynamics of the}} fishery utilized three tagging events within a year. The year was divided into discrete periods and, within each year, fishing effort and duration of period were used to apportion fishing and natural mortalities, respectively, to the periods. The separation of fishing mortalities by sex was not found to improve the models. Although high (1. 0 - 1. 2. year-), the instantaneous fishing mortality estimates were comparable to estimates obtained from other methods and the <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>errors</b> were low. Reporting rate estimates were also precise and indicated a lack of participation by the fishing industry. Estimates of natural mortality were low (0. 00 - 0. 02. year-) but imprecise...|$|R
