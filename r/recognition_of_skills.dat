The most prevalent of these is unilateral recognition, which is mostly under the control of national credential evaluation agencies. Countries have been slow to move from input-based skill evaluations to outcome-based methodologies that focus on competencies attained.|$|E

40|$|The <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> is {{important}} to individuals. The acquisition of qualifications, their level and standing is correlated to levels of remuneration (Groot, Hartog, & Oosterbeek, 1994; Grubb, 1996; Lengerman, 1999; O'Connell, 1999), associated with occupational identity (e. g. Noon and Blyton, 1997, Pusey 2003) and, likely, the standing of the work individuals are permitted to engage in (e. g. Darrah, 1996). Those whose work is low paid and least valued (e. g. women, migrants, non-native speakers) often have the greatest need for skill recognition. Yet, for many workers there exists no bases or mechanism for their skills to be recognised, {{because of a lack}} of courses or other means of recognition. Given that workplaces are key sites for learning and demonstrating the knowledge required for work, they present an option for the recognition and certification of work skills that can assist overcome disadvantage and also be used to maintain the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> throughout working life. Yet, currently, the practice of the recognition and certification of skills learnt through work is underdeveloped and constrained by complexities in its organisation and enactment that have particular and significant policy implications. It follows that understanding further how the recognition of workplace learnt knowledge might be best enacted and identifying policies and practices to support its enactment are worthy and timely goals.

40|$|Key Messages Overseas {{employment}} of Bangladeshi workers {{is a major}} source of employment and is likely to remain so in the near future. Migration flow is positively correlated with gross domestic product growth in Bangladesh and the long-term trend has continued to be positive for more than 2 decades as economic growth has accelerated. Migrant workers’ remittances to Bangladesh are a significant source of foreign exchange, second only to ready-made garments. High costs of migration brought on by high recruitment fees and charges by intermediaries make access to migration opportunities highly skewed in favor of the upper-income groups.

Although the national infrastructure for foreign recognition of educational and professional qualifications is well-developed by international standards, the system {{has a number of}} flaws as interviews with TCNs and experts in the field reveal. TCNs often discover that their qualifications are not considered equivalent to the relevant Dutch qualifications. Given the limitations of formally recognising the educational qualifications or work experience of TCNs, Dutch policies have supported other measures, including the accreditation and recognition of prior learning (RPL). However, expert interviews show that it remains a challenge to commit education providers and employers actually to validate these learning experiences.
