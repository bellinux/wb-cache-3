2500|$|Also {{according}} to The Washington Post, the Ferguson Police Department [...] "bears little demographic resemblance" [...] to the mostly African-American community, which already harbored [...] "suspicions {{of the law}} enforcement agency" [...] preceding Brown's shooting, with 48 of the police force's 53 officers being white, while the population is only one-third white and about two-thirds black. [...] The community had experienced rapid demographic change in recent years; in 2000, just {{over half of the}} population was black. [...] An annual <b>report</b> <b>last</b> year by the office of Missouri's attorney general concluded that Ferguson police were [...] "twice as likely to arrest African Americans during traffic stops as they were whites." [...] This is after accounting for the increased proportion of population of African-Americans in the community, as this statistic measured the likelihood of being arrested after one had already been stopped as part of a traffic stop.|$|E

50|$|As a {{specialist}} in kangaroo behaviour, environmental sustainability and higher education I reviewed Mr Walters' <b>report</b> <b>last</b> December for the Australian Society for Kangaroos. My assessment was that the Ecoplan report provides no causal or supportive evidence to justify the significant conclusion it makes {{about the lives of}} kangaroos at Northern Lodge. It makes recommendations that are at variance with its own observations and remarks, is inconsistent with the learning values being advocated by the NMIT, and undertakes no benefit-cost assessment of other options. The report lacks analytical and ethical credibility and as a document that seeks to destroy the lives of sentient beings and their dependent young should be discounted as wholly inadequate and lacking moral foundation.|$|E

50|$|Denmark is {{primarily}} a transit and destination country for women and children from Baltic countries, East and Central Europe, Nigeria, Thailand, and South America subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution. There was one <b>report</b> <b>last</b> year of a male teenager from Nigeria rescued from the commercial sex trade in Denmark. The government did not report any cases of forced labor during the reporting period, though the Danish Anti-Trafficking Center highlighted that workers in domestic service, restaurants, hotels, factories, and agriculture, may be vulnerable to forced labor in Denmark. There were unconfirmed reports of foreign children being forced to engage in organized street crime. The government released a report in 2010 about increasing evidence that “au pair” organizations {{could be used as}} front companies for human trafficking. The hundreds of unaccompanied foreign minors who arrive in Denmark every year are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.|$|E
