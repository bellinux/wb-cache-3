5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the castle continued into the reign of Elizabeth I, who was advised {{that it no longer}} had any military utility. Robert <b>Redhead,</b> the tower keeper, became infamous at the time for taking parts of the castle to pieces and selling off the stonework for his own profit. Despite numerous attempts by local city and crown officials to halt this, <b>Redhead</b> continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop. Proposals were made to pull down Clifford's Tower altogether in 1596, but were turned down because of the strength of local feeling.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{known as}} the red-capped robin, {{it has also been}} {{referred}} to as <b>redhead,</b> redcap, robin red-breast or red-throated robin. Kuburi is a name used in the Kimberley. Across southwestern Australia, it was known as menekedang by the local indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|The genus Mythicomyces was {{circumscribed}} in 1986 by mycologists Scott <b>Redhead</b> and Alexander H. Smith {{to contain the}} species originally named Agaricus corneipes by Elias Magnus Fries in 1861. Fries described the species from collections made in a fir forest near Alsike, Sweden; it was subsequently recorded in North America (northwestern USA) by Andrew Price Morgan in 1907, and several times by Smith. When listing the synonyms of the species, <b>Redhead</b> and Smith cited the publication year of Fries's work as 1863 instead of the correct 1861, which rendered their new combination invalid {{according to the rules}} of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, although the generic name was valid. The binomial was subsequently published validly in 2011.|$|E

5000|$|All pochards {{have similar}} diets that include both {{plant and animal}} materials. <b>Redheads</b> undergo a niche switch when {{breeding}} and when wintering. During the breeding season, <b>redheads</b> will eat as much animal matter as possible, including gastropods, mollusks and insect larvae. [...] They will eat the occasional grass and other emergent vegetation. [...] However, once they fly south, <b>redheads</b> will change their diet to include mostly plant material, including pondweeds, wild rice, wild celery, wigeon grass, bulrushes, muskgrass and shoal grass.|$|R
40|$|<b>Redheads</b> (Aythya americana) migrate {{annually}} from their breeding {{range in the}} interior of North America to winter along the coasts of the United States and Mexico. Two of the most important areas where <b>redheads</b> traditionally concentrate in winter are the Laguna Madre and nearby bays in southern Texas and the Chandeleur Sound in southeastern Louisiana. <b>Redheads</b> experience saline-to-hypersaline (> 35 ppt) conditions in southern Texas, where they have ready access to numerous coastal ponds for drinking water. <b>Redheads</b> in the Chandeleur Sound experience reduced salinity (< 30 ppt), and they seldom use supplemental fresh water. We weighed and analyzed supraorbital salt glands from <b>redheads</b> wintering in Texas and Lou-isiana. Mean mass of salt glands was lowest in November and became stabilized in size by January. Mean mass of salt glands in Texas did not differ between the two winters. The mass of salt glands of <b>redheads</b> from Texas (winters combined) was intermediate to, and signifi-cantly different from, the mean masses of salt glands of <b>redheads</b> from two different winters in Louisiana. Females exhibited smaller salt glands than did males in both Texas and Louisiana, suggesting that they were under less osmotic loading than males. Young birds during the sec-ond winter in Louisiana exhibited the heaviest salt glands, and therefore the most osmotic loading, of all birds in both states. Water balance concerns and osmoregulatory costs should be integrated more fully into future foraging and energetics studies of water birds in marine, coastal, and estuarine systems...|$|R

5|$|In 1989, Scott <b>Redhead</b> {{reduced the}} species Crinipellis cremoricolor (originally {{described}} by Shaffer and Weaver in 1965, based on specimens found near the University of Michigan Biological Station) {{to a variety}} of C.crinipellis. The variety cremoricolor is found in eastern North America and has longer spores than the nominate variety, measuring 7–12 by 3.8–5µm. According to Shaffer and Weaver, it differs macroscopically from the typical variety in having cream- to buff-colored cap and stem, and pale pinkish-cinnamon gills.|$|E

40|$|Many {{stereotypes}} about persons with red hair are both gender-specific and derogatory. These stereotypes often stand {{in stark contrast}} to gender-role stereotypes for men and for women. In three studies, the current research considered if prejudice directed at <b>redheads</b> is, in part, a result of bias against gender-atypical people. In Study 1, participants read about a bullying incident in which the victim was a boy or girl with red hair or another hair colour. <b>Redheads,</b> in general, were seen as less masculine than persons with other hair colours, while boys with red hair were seen as less well-liked than boys with other hair colours, particularly by men. This difference was not found for girls. In Study 2, participants viewed a male or female adult target person with red hair or another hair colour, and completed measures of gender stereotyping, liking, and sexual attraction. Male <b>redheads</b> were seen as less masculine, less gender prototypical, and less sexual than male non-redheads, by both men and women. However, only men liked male <b>redheads</b> less than males with other hair colours—no differences for any variables were found for judgments of female <b>redheads</b> and non-redheads. For male <b>redheads,</b> as expected, gender prototypicality was found to mediate the relationship between hair colour and liking, but only for men. As in Study 2, in the third study participants saw male <b>redheads</b> as less gender prototypical, and less sexual, than male non-redheads. However, red hair on men did not affect how much they were liked in Study 3. Overall, the results of the three studies illustrate that prejudice toward <b>redheads</b> is at least partly about gender atypicality, that this prejudice is mostly directed at boys and men, and that this prejudice is perpetuated by men more than by women...|$|R
5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts. Each character has different traits and advantages. The eight characters consist of: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Mole, the Gentleman, the <b>Redhead,</b> and the Hacker. The Locksmith can open doors {{twice as fast as}} the other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies who are not in the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which runs around collecting coins; the Mole can dig holes through walls and takes less time to open vents; the Gentleman has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the <b>Redhead</b> can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to security systems, resulting in them shutting off temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E
5|$|<b>Redhead</b> and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group. Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} from Ceylon by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1847; soon after (1852), specimens {{were collected from}} South Carolina USA.

As Canadian mycologists <b>Redhead</b> and Ginns explain in a 1980 article on the species, since its original 1847 description, C.asprata has been given 28 names, and placed in 14 different genera.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the modern}} county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, {{the history of}} its {{constituent}} settlements goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor, and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, {{believed to have been}} an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes. Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester, and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth, are evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; <b>Redhead</b> states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, the {{following}} reviews are underway: {{a review of}} past records of Macaronesian shearwaters, reviews of all <b>redhead</b> and royal tern records, a review of great white egrets to establish if any are of the Nearctic race, a review of sandplovers, a review of records of the eastern race of redstart, a review of Orphean warbler records aimed at determining the race of each, and a review of subalpine warblers to determine which individuals are ascribable to the race albistriata. It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great snipe, as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E

5|$|He also {{experienced}} stomach disease, having a low production of gastric acids. This was worsened by harsh military conditions, including long periods with little food. The first {{references to the}} disease {{that would lead to}} his death, a case of edema, are from a year before, in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas. He declared having problems in the chest, a lung, and his right leg. A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation, and specified that it started on 23 April 1819. The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires, where he died. He was embalmed by Joseph <b>Redhead</b> and Juan Sullivan. Sullivan performed the autopsy; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple edemas and a tumor in the right epigastrium. The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels, there were hamartomas in the kidneys, and problems with the lungs and heart.|$|E
5|$|In 1819 Buenos Aires was at {{war with}} José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López, and {{requested}} San Martín and Belgrano to return with their armies {{to take part in}} the conflict. San Martín refused to do so, but Belgrano accepted. However, before his arrival the governors Estanislao López and Juan José Viamonte signed an eight-day truce to start peace negotiations. Belgrano's health was in a very bad state by this point, but he refused to resign, thinking that the morale of the Army would suffer without his presence. He moved to the frontier between Santa Fe and Córdoba, from where he would be able to move to either the litoral or the north if needed. His health continued to worsen, and he was given an unlimited leave from work by the Supreme Director. He handed command to Fernández de la Cruz and moved to Tucumán, where he met his daughter Manuela Mónica, just one year old. The governor of Tucuman, Feliciano de la Motta, was deposed during his stay, and Belgrano was taken prisoner. Abraham González led the uprising and attempted to put Belgrano into a shrew's fiddle, but Belgrano's doctor Josef <b>Redhead</b> objected, because of his delicate health, and his sentence was changed to simple imprisonment. When Bernabé Araoz took control of the government of Tucumán, Belgrano was immediately released.|$|E
