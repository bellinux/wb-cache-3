5|$|Buckner {{returned}} to Kentucky {{when he was}} eligible in 1868 and became editor of the Louisville Courier. Like most former Confederate officers, he petitioned the United States Congress {{for the restoration of}} his civil <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> stipulated by the 14th Amendment. He recovered most of his property through lawsuits and regained much of his wealth through shrewd business deals.|$|E
5|$|Convicted {{prisoners were}} refused the same <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> internees until July 1972, when Special Category Status was {{introduced}} following {{a hunger strike}} by 40 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, or political, status meant prisoners were treated similarly to prisoners of war; for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.|$|E

5|$|English jurist Jeremy Bentham was {{a critic}} of Blackstone's {{theories}}. Others saw Blackstone's theories as inaccurate statements of English law, using the Constitutions of Clarendon, the Tractatus of Glanville and the 1689 Bill of <b>Rights</b> <b>as</b> particularly obvious examples of laws Blackstone omitted.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of due process <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, a Victims' Rights Amendment {{was added}} to the Virginia Bill of <b>Rights</b> <b>as</b> §8-A. In Nobrega v. Commonwealth, the only case so far to {{interpret}} this amendment, the Virginia Supreme Court used the Victims’s Rights Amendment to support its ruling that an alleged rape victim could not be compelled to submit to a psychiatric evaluation.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> trumps and <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E

5|$|These three Native American {{leaders were}} the first to be tried, for raids (Warren Wagon Train Raid) and murder, in a United States civil court instead of a {{military}} court. This would deny them any vestige of <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> prisoners of war by being tried as any common criminal in the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District of Texas in Jacksboro, Texas near Fort Richardson.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{national}} emergency has an {{adverse effect on}} these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the President may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
5|$|After his {{promotion}} was confirmed, Saunders {{returned to}} New Guinea and, {{although it was}} contrary to policy, rejoined his old battalion.

Due to the discriminatory laws in force at the time, Saunders had fewer <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> a citizen than the white Australians he led. He was wounded in the knee by Japanese gunfire during fighting around Maprik, and was hospitalised for three weeks as a result.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory is a 2010 {{textbook}} by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane. It is {{the first}} book in the publisher Palgrave Macmillan's Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. Cochrane's book examines five schools of political theory—utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism—and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition has something to offer to these issues, but ultimately presents his own account of interest-based animal <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> preferable to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Chile's National Monuments Council {{declared}} Patio 29 a National Monument on 13 July 2006 at {{the request}} of a group of Chamber of Deputies legislators. The Council chose the site for its proof of the Pinochet military government's elaborate procedures used to conceal the disappeared's bodies and their identities. At the ceremony, Patio 29 was described {{as a symbol of the}} country's painful history and an educational place for human <b>rights.</b> <b>As</b> a national monument, the site will be conserved and maintained by government funds unless ordered otherwise by the courts. It is the first cemetery to become a national monument in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Committees {{have two}} types of members: full members and {{participating}} members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the six outlined above. In addition, however, any Senator may arrange for the Senate to agree to their being made a participating member of the committee. This gives them the same <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> full members, with the important exception of being unable to vote on motions in private meetings of the committees.|$|E

5|$|During {{subsequent}} {{discussions with}} a US consular official, Terrazas gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} or not he had truly intended to abandon his <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> a US citizen when he applied for his certificate of Mexican nationality. The State Department eventually concluded that he had lost his US citizenship, a decision which Terrazas appealed, first before the State Department's board of appellate review, and subsequently to the courts.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly elected government. West Germany regarded German citizenship and <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> applying equally to East and West German citizens. An East German who escaped or was {{released to the}} West was automatically granted West German rights including residence, the right to work, and EEC freedom of movement; West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|Gay activists, newly {{alarmed at}} {{the threat to}} their rights, confronted vice {{president}} Walter Mondale at a political rally in San Francisco {{two weeks after the}} announcement of Proposition 6. Mondale ran with Jimmy Carter in 1976 on a platform highlighting human <b>rights</b> <b>as</b> their first priority, and he was there to address the subject pertaining to Latin America. When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.|$|E
