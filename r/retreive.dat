40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{approach}} to study the properties of the Partial Least Squares (PLS) estimator. This approach relies on the link between PLS and discrete orthogonal polynomials. Indeed many important PLS objects can be expressed in terms of some specific discrete orthogonal polynomials, called the residual polynomials. Based on the explicit analytical expression we have stated for these polynomials in terms of signal and noise, we provide a new framework for the study of PLS. Furthermore, we show that this new approach allows to simplify and <b>retreive</b> independent proofs of many classical results (proved earlier by different authors using various approaches and tools).

However, it is possible to recover a subset of the input symbols from the actually received coded symbols: this process is called partial decoding and the number of recovered input symbols is termed the intermediate performance of rateless codes. In this paper we study the problem of the optimality of the partial decoding process: we say that a partial decoding algorithm is optimal if, given a rateless code, it is able to maximize the intermediate performance of the code, i. e. it is able to <b>retreive</b> the maximum number of input symbols when a certain number n of coded symbols have been received, for every n.

40|$|In {{this note}} {{we argue that}} the galactic model chosen by E. -J. Ahn, G. Medina-Tanco, P. L. Bierman and T. Stanev in their paper {{discussing}} {{the origin of the}} highest energy cosmic rays, is alone responsible for the focusing of positive particles towards the North galactic pole. We discuss the validity of this model, in particular in terms of field reversals and radial extensions. We conclude that with such a model one cannot <b>retreive</b> any directional information from the observed direction of the cosmic rays. In particular one cannot identify point sources at least up to energies of about 200 EeV 1. Therefore the apparent clustering of the back-traced highest energy cosmic rays observed to date cannot be interpreted as an evidence for a point source nor for the identification of M 87, which happens to be close to the North pole, as being such a source. It was recently claimed [1] that the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) observed up to now, may originate from a common source located {{in the direction of the}} North pole of our Galaxy; the M 87 cluster (Virgo) being the best candidate for such an emitting object.

40|$|Through {{their control}} on surface {{properties}} such as thermal inertia, surface roughness, and albedo, cities exert {{a significant impact}} on local climate. As a consequence, the correct representation of urban surfaces in regional-scale atmospheric models is of paramount importance, i. e., in applications such as numerical weather prediction, atmospheric dispersionmodeling, or model-based assessment of the urban effect in temperature time series used in the context of global warming studies. However, the representation of urban surfaces in these models constitutes a particular difficulty. Among the least known parameters, thermal conductivity and heat capacity are notoriously difficult to measure at the kilometer scale that is typically used in regional atmospheric models. Another poorly known quantity is the thermal roughness length, which regulates the exchange of heat between the surface and the atmosphere, becoming extremely small for surfaces constituted of so-called bluff-rough elements such as buildings. This contribution aims at reducing these knowledge gaps by retrieving the parameters mentioned above using an approach that combines satellite remote sensing and atmospheric modeling. The methodology relies on the minimization of the difference between simulated and retrieved urban surface temperature (UST). Model simulations were carried out by means of the ARPS model, a 3 -D prognostic atmospheric model that contains an advanced land surface-atmosphere exchange scheme and, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra Red Imager (SEVIRI) thermal imageries were used to <b>retreive</b> the UST. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The term “Smart grid ” can be {{described}} as the next generation electric power system. The metering data should be continuosly examined for valid testing {{and this is one of}} the challenge for our smart grid. In this paper we analyze the problem of supporting multidimensional range queries on encrypted metering data. The problem is motivated by the applications of secure data outsourcing where a residential user may store his data on a cloud server in an encrypted form and want to execute queries using server’s computational capabilities. When financial auditing is needed, an authorized requester can send its range query tokens to cloud server to <b>retreive</b> the metering data. The solution approach is to compute a secure indexing tag of the data by applying bucketization(data partitioning) which prevents the cloud server from learning exact values but still allows server to check if a record satisfies the query predicate. Queries are evaluated in an approximate manner where the returned set of records may contain some false positives. In this scheme we can achieve the data confidentiality & query privacy because here only an authorized requester can be able to obtain the query results. Also this approach can significantly reduce communication & computation costs. users to contribute their energy back to the grid in future. Because of this reason we can call this smart grid as a two way communication device. The use of this robust two way communication increases the efficiency and reliability of Fig 1.

The use of this smart gid commnication sytems is more nowadays to collect real-time metering data which is present at the Control center through a reliable communication network [3] as shown in Fig 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of an energy recovery system for <b>retreiving</b> otherways wasted energy {{is an effective}} method for reducing the overall energy consumption of a mobile machine. In a fork lift, there are two subsystems that can be effectively modified for recovering energy. These are the driveline and the lift/lower function of the mast. This study focuses on the latter by studying a recovery system whose main component is a hydraulic transformer consisting of a hydraulic motor, a variable displacement pump and an induction motor. Since the flow rate/pressure - ratio can be modified, the utilization of the hydraulic transformer enables downsizing of the accumulator volume. However, the decrease of the gas volume leads {{to an increase in}} the compression ratio of the accumulator, which in terms leads to higher gas temperatures after charging and consequently to higher thermal losses during holding phase.

The information about the file pieces are stored in the GFMS_DB, which can be queried only if all the process other than the required system processes have been stopped. This is to ensure that the GFMS is free from impact of spywares. The implementation of this system has been tested for Image,Documents,video and Audio files...|$|R
