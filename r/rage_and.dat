5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the <b>rage</b> <b>and</b> amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E

After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel at the location of Griotunagardar, resulting in Hrungnir's death.|$|E

Nearly mad with <b>rage</b> <b>and</b> grief, he Travels to the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry at the futility of life bound to the Wheel, he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world.

In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' <b>rage</b> <b>and</b> vengeance. The gods transformed Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale.

6000|$|Therefore what Hereward {{thought and}} felt {{will not be}} told. What he did was this. He <b>raged</b> <b>and</b> blustered. He must hide his shame. He must justify himself to his knights; and much more to himself; or if not justify himself, must shift {{some of the blame}} over to the {{opposite}} side. So he <b>raged</b> <b>and</b> blustered. He had been robbed of his wife and daughter. They had been cajoled away by the monks of Crowland. What villains were those, to rob an honest man of his family while he was fighting for his country? ...|$|R

5|$|The {{check on}} Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician {{and chairman of}} the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. At first Harding did not believe it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between <b>rage</b> <b>and</b> despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and in mid-March, Cramer committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Homer stays true to {{his word}} and remains calm. However, his new calm {{demeanor}} has taken away Bart's inspiration for his cartoon, so Bart and Milhouse set up a trap for Homer to trigger another outburst. Later, {{they go to the}} Internet company office, where they find the company has gone bankrupt. Homer reaches home and happens upon Bart's trap, but he keeps his calm throughout its run, causing lumps to develop on his neck.

Dr. Hibbert arrives and tells Marge that Bart actually saved Homer's life by enraging him. Hibbert explains the lumps on his neck were actually boils caused by suppressed <b>rage</b> <b>and</b> would have otherwise overwhelmed his system. Homer thanks Bart by taking him fishing, where he continues to make his father angry.|$|E
5|$|With Lenin now {{based in}} Geneva, the {{arguments}} between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks continued after the conference. The Bolsheviks accused their rivals of being opportunists and reformists who lacked any discipline, while the Mensheviks accused Lenin {{of being a}} despot and autocrat, comparing him to Maximilien de Robespierre. When Plekhanov sided with Martov, Lenin flew into a <b>rage</b> <b>and</b> resigned from both the Iskra editorial board and the Party Council. In May 1904, he published One Step Forward, Two Steps Back, a booklet claiming that Martov's supporters had tricked him into this. The stress added to an illness, {{which at the time}} was probably diagnosed as neurasthenia, and to relive this, he went on a climbing holiday in the countryside in June. Some party members attempted to reunite the feuding factions, but this failed, and by the spring, all eight members of the Central Committee were Bolsheviks. In December, they founded a Bolshevik newspaper, Vperëd (Forward).|$|E
