25|$|Psychologists such as William James {{initially}} {{used the}} term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar {{to the concept of}} will in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came {{to be seen as a}} primary source of motivation. According to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the <b>reality</b> <b>principle,</b> roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events. Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking. Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model.|$|E
500|$|Sigmund Freud {{viewed the}} {{struggle}} to delay gratification as a person's efforts to overcome the instinctive, libidinal drive of the id. According to classic psychoanalytic theory, a person's psyche is composed of the id, ego and superego. The id {{is driven by the}} pleasure principle: it wants physical pleasure, and it wants it now. The ego, operating under the <b>reality</b> <b>principle,</b> serves to moderate the id's desire for instant gratification against the superego, which is guided by a person's internalized sense of morality. According to psychoanalytic theory, a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by intrapsychic conflict – the ego cannot adequately regulate the battle between the id and the superego – and experiences psychological distress, often in the form of anxiety or [...] "neurosis".|$|E

2500|$|Freud divides human {{personality}} {{into three}} significant components: the id, ego and super-ego. [...] The id acts {{according to the}} pleasure principle, demanding immediate gratification of its needs regardless of external environment; the ego then must emerge in order to realistically meet the wishes and demands of the id {{in accordance with the}} outside world, adhering to the <b>reality</b> <b>principle.</b> Finally, the superego (conscience) inculcates moral judgment and societal rules upon the ego, thus forcing the demands of the id to be met not only realistically but morally. The superego is the last function of the personality to develop, and is the embodiment of parental/social ideals established during childhood. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of these three components.|$|E
2500|$|Psychoanalytic {{theories}} {{focus on}} unresolved internal and relational conflicts. These theories have been posited as overall explanations of mental disorder, although today most psychoanalytic groups {{are said to}} adhere to the biopsychosocial model and to accept an eclectic mix of subtypes of psychoanalysis. The psychoanalytic theory was originated by Sigmund Freud. This theory focuses on the impact of unconscious forces on human behavior. According to Freud, the personality is made up of three parts: the id, ego, and superego. The id operates under the pleasure principle, the ego operates under the <b>reality</b> <b>principle,</b> and the superego is the [...] "conscience" [...] and incorporates what is and is not socially acceptable into a person's value system. [...] Also, according to the psychoanalytic theory, there are five stages of psycho-sexual development that everyone goes through: the oral stage, anal stage, phallic stage, latency stage, and genital stage. Mental disorders can be caused by an individual receiving too little or too much gratification in one of the psycho-sexual developmental stages. When this happens, the individual is said to be fixated in that developmental stage.|$|E
50|$|Both the <b>reality</b> <b>principle</b> and {{pleasure}} principle pursue personal gratification, but the crucial {{difference between the}} two is that the <b>reality</b> <b>principle</b> is more focused on the long-term and is more goal-oriented while the pleasure principle disregards everything except for the immediate fulfillment of its desires.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>reality</b> <b>principle</b> and {{pleasure}} principle are two competing concepts established by Freud. The pleasure principle is the psychoanalytic concept {{based on the}} pleasure drive of the id in which people seek pleasure and avoid suffering {{in order to satisfy}} their biological and psychological needs. As people mature, the id's pleasure-seeking is modified by the <b>reality</b> <b>principle.</b> As it succeeds in establishing its dominance as a regulatory principle over the id, the search for satisfaction does not take the most direct routes, but instead postpones attainment of its goal in accordance with conditions imposed by the outside world, or in other words, deferred gratification. [...] These two concepts can be viewed in psychological terms or processes, with the pleasure principle being considered the primary process that is moderated by the secondary process, or the <b>reality</b> <b>principle.</b> From an economic standpoint, the <b>reality</b> <b>principle</b> corresponds to a transformation of free energy into bound energy.|$|E
50|$|From a Freudian standpoint, {{one means}} of {{strengthening}} the <b>reality</b> <b>principle</b> within the ego {{would be to}} attain control over the id. Through maturity and {{a better sense of}} self, individuals can find the strength to gradually develop the <b>reality</b> <b>principle</b> and learn to defer pleasure by making more rational and controlled choices. In a traditional psychoanalytic model, this could take several years of restraint, and even so, many people will make the choice to achieve instant gratification over delayed gratification.|$|E

50|$|Freud defines impulses as {{products}} of two competing forces: the pleasure principle and the <b>reality</b> <b>principle.</b> These two forces clash because impulses encourage action without any premeditated thought or deliberation and little regard to consequences, compromising {{the role of}} the <b>reality</b> <b>principle.</b> Impulses are often difficult for the mind to overcome because they hold anticipated pleasurable experiences. Freud emphasizes the importance of the development of impulse control because it is socially necessary and human civilization would fail without it. If an individual lacks sufficient impulse control, it represents a defect of repression that may lead to severe psychosocial problems (Kipnis 1971; Reich 1925; Winshie 1977).|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate whether people who do not feel strongly committed to their national in-group (i. e., low identifiers) can be mobilized against immigrant out-groups when framed with different stories on their original national identity. Four experimental studies were conducted, in the Netherlands, to examine how the relation between national identification and attitudes towards immigrants and Muslims can be moderated by these specific representations of the Dutch national category. Low identifiers displayed more negative attitudes towards immigrants and Muslims: when framed with their national instead of personal identity (Study 1), and when framed with a factual story on their originally Christian Dutch identity, compared to a neutral condition (Study 2 - 4). High identifiers tended to deepen their negative attitudes in the condition where the original Dutch national identity remained ambiguous (Study 4). These findings underline the importance of taking into account (a) the contents ascribed to identities and their relations, (b) the practical ability to pursue a way of life based on these contents, and (c) group members’ <b>reality</b> <b>principles,</b> to understand the way identity processes shape attitudes towards out-groups...|$|R
