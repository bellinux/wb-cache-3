50|$|Pešturina {{has been}} {{excavated}} on three occasions. In 2006, {{the back of}} the cave was explored, where a trench (or probe) was dug. The search yielded artifacts from later prehistory on top, <b>rock</b> <b>blades</b> and numerous bones in the central, light-brown sediment, while the lowest section, at the depth of 1.3 m, was estimated to be from the Middle Paleolithic. At that level the parent rock was reached so the excavation stopped. In 2008 and 2010-12 the remaining sections were explored. The thickest sediments are near the entrance. The depth reached so far is 2 m and the bedrock still hasn't been hit.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of blades is one identfling feature of Howiesons Poort technologies, {{along with the}} {{presence of}} backed artefacts and relatively high frequencies of fine-grained <b>rocks.</b> <b>Blades</b> in this context are commonly understood to have been produced to serve as blanks for the manufacture of backed artefacts. This paper explores the relationship between blades and backed artefacts in detail, using data from the Howiesons Poort layers at the site of Diepkloof. It is found that there is limited evidence for a direct relationship between these two assemblage elements. Instead, it is suggested that blades were used as a means of improving flaking yield, primarily towards the end of core use-lives...|$|R

50|$|Hiratsuka's {{father was}} a shrine carpenter, and his {{grandfather}} was an architect who designed houses and temples. Therefore, the artist was introduced to wood-working and architecture early in his life. Many of his woodblock prints are of temples, bridges, in addition to landscapes he captured in his travels throughout Japan, Korea, and the United States. Hiratsuka was also a serious collector of old Buddhist prints, and his works are influenced by his exposure to Buddhist figures. He also had an extensive collection of roof tiles, Judaica and Bibles in every language, {{and when he was}} not practicing his art, spent hours reading. Hiratsuka's techniques and styles evolved over his lifetime. Pre-World War II blocks included many color woodblock prints and engravings, while after World War II, he worked almost exclusively on black-and-white prints. His most famous technique is called tsukibori ("poking strokes"). With a small square-end chisel (aisuki), Hiratsuka <b>rocked</b> the <b>blade</b> side to side in short strokes, producing rough and jagged edges. His students include Kobashi Yasuhide.|$|R
40|$|Sand, {{clay and}} rock {{have to be}} {{excavated}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, such as dredging, trenching, mining (including deep sea mining), drilling, tunnel boring and many other applications. Many excavations take place on dry land, but they are also frequently required in completely saturated conditions, and the methods necessary to accomplish them consequently vary widely. This book provides an overview of cutting theories. It begins with a generic model, valid for all types of soil (sand, clay and rock), and continues with the specifics of dry sand, water-saturated sand, clay, atmospheric rock and hyperbaric <b>rock.</b> Small <b>blade</b> angles and large blade angles are discussed for each soil type, and for each case considered the equations/model for cutting forces, power and specific energy are given. With models verified by laboratory research, principally from the Delft University of Technology, and data from other recognized sources, this book will prove an invaluable reference for anybody whose work involves major excavations of any kind.

5000|$|The use of budget-cutting and time-saving {{animation}} {{measures in}} animation {{dates back to}} the earliest commercial animation, including cycled animations, mirror-image and symmetrical drawings, still characters, and other labor-saving methods were employed. In general, the progression was from early productions in which every frame was drawn by hand, independent of each other drawing, toward more limited animation that made use of the same drawings in different ways. Winsor McCay, a man who put an unprecedented amount of detail into his animations, boasted that in his 1914 film, Gertie the Dinosaur, that everything moved, including the <b>rocks</b> and <b>blades</b> of grass in the background. In contrast, his 1918 film The Sinking of the Lusitania progressed to using cels over still backgrounds, while still maintaining a level of detail comparable to that of Gertie. The 1942 Merrie Melodies short The Dover Boys was the first Warner Bros. cartoon to employ some of the processes of what would become known as [...] "limited animation", but their use was sparse and pressure from Warner Bros. curtailed further use of these processes.|$|R

50|$|Another {{material}} {{used by the}} Nok are ground stone axes {{which seemed}} to be used for mostly food production which is typically made from fine-grained volcanic rock and a few made from siliceous <b>rock.</b> These ax <b>blades</b> tend to be smaller in size, the largest reaching 20 centimeters. Stone balls appear at almost every Nok site and are approximately palm-sized. They were probably used as hammerstones or for roughening the surface of a grinding stone. Not all of them are ball shaped, however, and many have chipping marks all over or at least in one place. These stone balls likely would have served as mobile grinding stones.These ax blades tend to be smaller in size, the largest reaching 20 centimeters.|$|R
40|$|Using the {{presently}} accepted definition, komatiites are ultramafic volcanic <b>rocks</b> characterised by <b>bladed</b> and/or skeletal olivine texture (spinifex texture). Where textural {{evidence is}} absent,the geochemical definition is equivocal {{and as a}} result there is considerable ambiguity, particularly among the basaltic types. If the added control of Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ? 25 is added to the definition, this eliminates rocks of the boninite group and also the low-Ti basalts found in some ophiolite complexes. The bulk of komatiites occur in the Archaean and the most obvious explanation is that the eruption of high (up to 30 %) MgO melts was controlled by an enhanced geothermal gradient. There is some evidence to suggest that the high CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratio characteristic of some komatiites (e. g. Barberton) is found only in those greenstone belts older than 3. 0 b. y...|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} magnificent, {{brilliant}} starlight, with a pale mist over the mountains: the thermometer fell to 15.5 degrees at 7.30 p.m., and one laid upon wood with its bulb freely exposed, sank to 7.5 degrees: the snow sparkled with broad flakes of hoar-frost {{in the full}} moon, which was so bright, that I recorded my observations by its light. Owing to the extreme cold of radiation, I passed a very uncomfortable night. The minimum thermometer fell to 1 degrees in shade.* [At sunrise the temperature was 11.5 degrees; that of grass, cleared on the previous day from snow, and exposed to the sky, 6.5 degrees; that on wool, 2.2 degrees; and that {{on the surface of}} the snow, 0.7 degrees.] The sky was clear; and every <b>rock,</b> leaf, twig, <b>blade</b> of grass, and the snow itself, were covered with broad rhomboidal plates of hoar-frost, nearly one-third of an inch across: while the metal scale of the thermometer instantaneously blistered my tongue. As the sun rose, the light reflected from these myriads of facets had a splendid effect.|$|R
60|$|The reader must not, {{from any}} {{testimony}} of mine, contract a dislike towards our slumberous stream. In {{the light of}} a calm and golden sunset it becomes lovely beyond expression; the more lovely for the quietude that so well accords with the hour, when even the wind, after blustering all day long, usually hushes itself to rest. Each tree and <b>rock</b> and every <b>blade</b> of grass is distinctly imaged, and, however unsightly in reality, assumes ideal beauty in the reflection. The minutest things of earth and the broad aspect of the firmament are pictured equally without effort and with the same felicity of success. All the sky glows downward at our feet; the rich clouds float through the unruffled bosom of the stream like heavenly thoughts through a peaceful heart. We will not, then, malign our river as gross and impure while it can glorify itself with so adequate a picture of the heaven that broods above it; or, if we remember its tawny hue and the muddiness of its bed, let it be a symbol that the earthiest human soul has an infinite spiritual capacity and may contain the better world within its depths. But, indeed, the same lesson might be drawn out of any mud-puddle in the streets of a city; and, being taught us everywhere, it must be true.|$|R
40|$|In abalone {{farms and}} {{laboratories}} of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico, young and postlarval abalone feed on benthic diatoms that grow on the artificial {{surfaces of the}} culture tanks, or on epiphytic diatoms growing on kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) blades provided when a change in their diet is estimated. It is not known whether grazing selectivity occurs by postlarvae and young abalones at this time. Thus, experiments were conducted to determine whether discrimination by juveniles of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) occurs while grazing on diatoms that grow on the <b>rocks</b> and kelp <b>blades</b> extracted from their habitat, and {{to determine whether the}} ingested diatoms are, indeed, digested. Our hypothesis was that juveniles of H. rufescens would feed nonselectively on the diatom films; thus, the characteristics of the diatom assemblages (species composition, diversity) from their gut contents should be similar to those upon which they feed. We also expected that the smaller forms of diatoms would pass through the digestive tract intact. Overall, 171 diatom taxa were identified: 123 in the tank walls, 35 on the rocks, 143 in the gut contents, and 38 in the feces. Only Amphora pediculus appeared in all the gut contents examined; however, 12 taxa accounted for 80 % of the relative abundance (n ¼ 500). Highest diversity (H_¼ 4. 46) was measured in the walls of a tank where M. pyrifera was included, but abalone specimens from this tank showed the lowest H# value in their gut contents. The hypothesis that grazing by young H. rufescens is nonselective is supported, as well as the importance {{of the structure of the}} diatom assemblage grazed upon (as in H. fulgens), which is reflected in their gut contents. Moreover, feces analysis showed that many small diatoms that are ingested are not digested, and are able to reproduce and grow after passing through the digestive tract...|$|R
40|$|The {{billboard}} {{that nearly}} caused John Woods to swerve off the coastal road stood {{much higher than}} existing legislation permitted. He knew this because he had recently taken a position as a community reporter on a local rag, and {{he was starting to}} get a hang of municipal legalese, whether he liked it or not. A hundred yards on he contemplated its mysterious message, identically phrased in the reverse view, and set against the same blue background that had Woods thinking, for a subliminal moment, that the Billboard was part of the ocean beyond, the white letters nothing more than gently ruffled caps of water. The Wait is Almost Over. He looked around at the green mountainside and the gently waving forest of kelp, which flanked the ocean road. Not an impatient scene, exactly. Not a single soul waiting for a god-damned thing. He read the slogan again, and as its meaning dawned (an understanding that it must mean some development was imminent: that almost over portended the very worst for a perfectly beautiful section of mountainside, untouched for all time) he became aware of an increasing tightness in his chest, as if he were taking on pressurised air. He felt the desire to shout something back at the slogan, something equally presumptuous, equally menacing. He picked up a <b>rock,</b> a nice <b>blade</b> of Cape sandstone, and hurled it. (The missile struck with a clang, and dropped to the ground.) Next he tried to pull the billboard over, but since it was not a supple birch, the thing would not begin to lean, no matter how high he climbed. When Inspector Claude Grey rounded the corner on a routine patrol he intercepted Woods at that point of his destructive endeavours where he had attached a tow-line to the structure's left leg, and was proceeding to push the engine of his car through higher and higher revolutions as white sand spurted out from beneath his balding tyres. On the charge sheet the following information was recorded: Name: Jonathan Woods Occupation: Community Reporter, Environmental Affairs. Offence: Destruction of property Mason Construction PTY (Ltd), to whom the billboard belonged, went ahead with the prosecution. It was not to be the last charge laid against the reporter (then a young man) by that company. The story that follows is, in a sense, an account of this long and bitter feud...|$|R
5000|$|The {{day after}} the celebration, Koba is {{teaching}} Andar how to hunt. They both find a Megaloceros and bring it down with two arrows. When the dead carcass is taken to the village, Aniwa tries {{to cut through the}} hide with a <b>bladed</b> <b>rock,</b> which looks pretty dull. It is not able to cut through the hide easily, to which Catori hands her a blade, which is able to successfully work in cutting the hide of the creature. Aniwa turns around to see Koba and Andar, who makes a victory smile. Koba gives Andar a pat and accidentally makes him fall in a silly way. Sepinta is seen carving a rock to make a spear with Turok watching. The villagers then tie the Megaloceross hide onto wooden poles and make lined holes on them. Sepinta is also making what appears to be beads. Aniwa is then training Andar to ride on a terror bird, which goes out of control. Later that night, Sepinta brings Turoks weapons to him, who thanks her. Sepinta tells him that he is free to go unless he decides to stay, but Turok says he and his people do not belong in the underworld. Sepinta tells him that this is his home now, but Turok replies that he has no home. He tells her that they leave tomorrow, which upsets Sepinta. The chief sentry calls out, [...] "Tower!" [...] with the tower sentry saying, [...] "Tower all clear!" [...] The tower sentry then says, [...] "Bridge!" [...] with the bridge sentry saying, [...] "Bridge all clear!" [...] However, the tamed Terror Birds are bothered by something or someone that has startled them. When the bridge sentry asks them whats wrong, Chichak suddenly appears and snaps his neck. He takes the dead sentrys helmet to disguise himself and then proceeds to the bridge. The tower sentry yawns as Chichak blocks his mouth and stabs him with a spear, killing him. When he heads to the chief sentry, the chief sentry, who believes Chichak is one of their own, asks him why is he on this side. Chichak impales him with the spear, killing the sentry. Chichak puts his new helmet back on and tells the cavemen that the coast is clear to attack.|$|R
