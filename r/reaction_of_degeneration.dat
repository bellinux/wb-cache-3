40|$|Sarcoglycans are a {{group of}} {{single-pass}} transmembrane glycoproteins. In striated muscle, sarcoglycans interact with dystrophin and other dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) to form the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC). The DGC protects the sarcolemma from contraction-induced injury. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by dystrophin gene mutations. In the absence of dystrophin, the DGC is disassembled from the sarcolemma. This initiates a chain <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> muscle <b>degeneration,</b> necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In contrast to human patients, dystrophin-null mdx mice are only mildly affected. Enhanced muscle regeneration and the up-regulation of utrophin and integrin are thought to protect mdx muscle. Interestingly, trace amounts of sarcoglycans and other DAPs can be detected at the mdx sarcolemma. It is currently unclear whether sub-physiological sarcoglycan expression also contributes to the mild phenotype in mdx mice. To answer this question, we generated δ-sarcoglycan/dystrophin double knockout mice (δ-Dko) in which residual sarcoglycans were completely eliminated from the sarcolemma. Interestingly, utrophin levels were further increased in these mice. However, enhanced utrophin expression did not mitigate disease. The clinical manifestation of δ-Dko mice was worse than that of mdx mice. They showed characteristic dystrophic signs, body emaciation and more macrophage infiltration. Their lifespan was reduced by 60 %. Furthermore, δ-Dko muscle generated significantly less absolute muscle force and became more susceptible to contraction-induced injury. Our results suggest that sub-physiological sarcoglycan expression plays {{a critical role in}} ameliorating muscle disease in mdx mice. We speculate that low-level sarcoglycan expression may represent a useful strategy to palliate DMD...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background {{and purpose}} Neuromuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (NMES) is a modality sometimes {{used to help}} strengthen weak muscles. On occasion, however, the targeted muscles {{do not respond to}} the current delivered. No response to electrical stimulation should raise the consideration of unsuspected peripheral nerve damage. Two case studies are presented showing how absence of response was due to unsuspected peripheral neuropathy, which had not been considered in either of the original referral diagnoses. Case descriptions The first individual sustained head trauma and did not respond to NMES to facilitate finger flexor contractions in the left hand. This prompted a <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>degeneration</b> test (R/D test) which revealed evidence of a median nerve lesion. The second individual presented with right ankle dorsiflexor and evertor paralysis following a right total hip replacement. The R/D test helped rule out a central nervous system lesion by revealing evidence of right peroneal nerve degeneration. Conclusion The case reports show how clinical suspicion followed by simple R/D testing can be used to screen for nerve damage, prompting further electrodiagnostic work up of individuals with profound weakness and or paralysis. </p...|$|E

The detection of positive homologous leucocytic antibody <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>degeneration</b> (HLA-DR) of LC indicates an age-associated reduction in sun-protected thigh skin in aged versus young subjects (263 ± 63 versus 589. 25 ± 142. 643, p < 0. 001). The mean number of LC four weeks after transplanation remained almost constant. Prior to skin engraftment, a decreased number of melanocytes was found in aged versus young epidermis (160. 77 ± 51. 7 versus 255. 83 ± 81. 2, respectively, p < 0. 05). A significantly increased number of melanocytes was noted four weeks following engraftment in epidermis from aged (307. 44 ± 174, p < 0. 05) and young human donors (402. 16 ± l 39,p < 0. 02). The marked increase in density of dopa-positive melanocytes following engraftment onto nude mice may indicate the existence of circulating factors in nude mice that perhaps both stimulates and enhances proliferation and activity of these cells...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the true nature}} of flaccid paralysis of infant polyradiculoneuritis with Guillain-Barres syndrme (G. N. S.), which occurred intermittently in the coast regions of the Inland Sea from 1950 to 1955, the author made comparative studies on the electromyograms of this disease with those of paralytic poliomyelitis (H. M.), and obtained the following results: 1. In 23 cases with G. B. S. and 41 cases of H. M. electromyographical examinations were carried out 76 and 102 times up to 10 weeks after the onset of disease, and their tested total number of muscles came up to 884 and 716 respectively. Among them 686 muscles of G. B. S. and 510 of H. M. showed abnormal electromyographic findings. These abrormal electromyograms were classified into 6 types, namely, those at the maximum voluntary contraction: electrical silence, low amplitude NAIU voltage (L. A. NAUV.), synchronization voltage (S. V.), complex NMU voltage, and decreased spike number of normal NMU voltage; and those at rest, fibrillation voltage. The two diseses showed some differences in the percentage of each abnormal elect romyograms in these various muscles. Namely, of them the most marked difference was the L. A. NMU V. at the maximum contraction; and it was observed in 25. 3 per cent of G. B. S. and in 1. 1 per cent of H. M., while electrical silence was observed in 8. 9 per cent of the former and in 28. 6 per cent of the latter. On the other hand, synchronization voltage was noticed in 17 per cent of G. B. S. while in 12. 6 per cent of H. M., showing slightly more in the former. The normal NMU voltage was cassified into three grades; the let to the third degree according to the discharge frequency, that is to say, the number of discharges 1 - 15 (Ⅲ). 16 - 30 (Ⅱ), and 31 - 50 /sec(Ⅰ). Summing them up, these discharges were found in 48. 4 per cent of G. B. S. while in 57. 2 per cent in H. M., As for the complex NMU voltage it was found in 0. 43 per cent of the former, while in 0. 4 per cent of the latter; and fibrillation voltage at rest was in 1. 7 per cent and 0. 4 per cent respectively, showing no significant difference in either case. 2. Follow-up examinations were studied on the 20 cases with G. B. S. presenting limb paralysis at the extreme stages one to six years after the onset of disease and on the eight cases with H. M., presenting bilateral paralysis within ten weeks, at the three years after the onset. Only 28 out of 250 muscles in G. B. S. (10 Cases out of 20) showed abnormal electromyographic findings, namely, 11. 2 per cent were found to be ahnormal. While 37 muscles out of 46 of H. M. examimed within 10 weeks after the onset namely, 80. 4 per cent showed the abnormality. All electromyographic findings of 28 muscles from G. B. S. were of incomplete synchronization voltage, presenting a desynchronization tendency, while in H. M. 7 muscles out of 46 (15. 2 %) were of electrical silence. But these 46 muscles revealed it in 50 per cent of them within 10 weeks after the onset of disease. As for the decreased number of normal NMU voltage concerned, 17 muscles (36. 9 %) were positive, while within 10 weeks after the onset 40 per cent recognized. On the other hand, S. V. of H. M. was recognized in 13 muscles out of 46 (28. 2 %), though within 10 weeks after the onset it was in 19. 6 per cent of 46 muscles, moreover 10 muscles out of 13 revealed complete S. V., 3. 119 muscles out of 884 from G. B. S. and 81 muscles out of 716 from H. M. tested eletromyographicaly were negative tendon reflex. But the electrical activity at the maximum voluntary contraction was recognized in 86 muscles (72. 3 %) out of the total of 119 muscles in the former and 17 muscles (20. 9 %) out of 81 muscles in the latter. After 8 weeks the elctrical activity in G. B. S. came out in all muscles, while on the contrary none in H. M [...] The relationship between the degree range of tendon reflex and the S. V. as well as L. A. NMU voltage was examined, and S. V. was found most often in those muscles with sluggish tendon reflex in both diseases. In G. B. S. those muscles either with normal tendon reflex or without it showed more S. V. than in H. M [...] L. A. NMU voltage was found much more in the muscles without tendon reflex rather than in those with normal tendon reflex. 4. In the electrical evainiuation studied up to seven weeks after the onset in 15 cases of G. B. S. in 8 cases of H. M., hardly typical <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>degeneration</b> could be recognized in G. B. S. but only traces of atypical <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>degeneration,</b> showing reduction of excitability in the majority, while in H. M. typical and atypical <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>degeneration</b> could still be recognized in 50 per cent of the cases after seven weeks from the onset. 5. Above mentioned results, i. e. the electromyographical change, its relation between tendon reflex and electrical excitability, show that G. B. S. consists mainly of pathologic changes in peripheral nerves and muscles and their spinal changes are slight and transient, whereas in H. M. the main pathologic changes are held in the anterior horn of the spine...|$|E

G Wells’s novel The Time Machine is a {{significant}} work of science fiction that dramatizes the themes <b>of</b> <b>degeneration</b> and social inequality, themes that were very relevant during the Victorian era {{in relation to the}} discovery <b>of</b> evolution. <b>Degeneration</b> was seen as the degradation of society into primitiveness far from the Victorian standards, and the problem of social difference, where the gap between poor and rich was very wide, became the visible proof of the difference between the evolved and civilized and the degenerated and primitive.
