This protocol assays cell migration between the gonad and mesonephros using tissue recombination between genetically marked and unmarked tissue, combined with an organ culture technique. First, agar blocks are prepared in a custom-built mold. The {{size and shape of}} the wells are important to maintain the authentic three-dimensional morphology of the organ; the molds here are designed specifically to accommodate the gonad/mesonephros complex. Freshly dissected organs are then transferred to grooves within the agar blocks, where they are allowed to grow over 24 - 48 h. Using this protocol, organs develop with good morphology, and show only an ~ 12 -h delay relative to in vivo development. ### RELATED INFORMATION Details on the techniques used in this procedure have been described previously (Martineau et al. 1997; Tilmann and Capel 1999; Brennan et al. 2002, 2003). An overview of the preparation of recombinant organ cultures is presented in Figure 1. The sex of the embryos can be determined by [Sex Chromatin Staining in Amnion Cells]([URL] (Capel and Batchvarov 2008). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Overview of experimental plan. The gonad/mesonephros complex is dissected from wild-type (CD 1) and genetically marked mice (ROSA 26). Gonads and mesonephroi are separated, and wild-type gonads are recombined with transgenically marked mesonephroi and cultured for 24 - 48 h in agar blocks. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Bacto Agar - Buffer for DNA extraction - DMEM containing 10 % fetal calf serum and 50 μg/mL ampicillin (organ culture medium) - Dulbecco’s Minimal Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), prewarmed to 37 °C for Step 17 - Embryos, mouse, 11. 5 - 16. 5 days post-coitum (dpc) - *Obtain embryos from pregnant mice of both a wild-type strain and a transgenic strain expressing a constitutive marker in all of its cells (e. g., β-gal [Gt(ROSA) 26 Sor/J] or EGFP [Cg-Tg(CAG-EGFP) B 5 Nagy/J]; both lines are available from the Jackson Laboratory.) * - Ethanol (optional; see Step 8) ### Equipment ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **. (A) Dimensions of machined mold for casting agar blocks (in.). (B) Finished mold. This mold has three ridges of slightly different dimensions. 1. Agar-block molds - *The dimensions of the wells are important to maintain the morphology of the organ. Design wells specifically for the organ under study, and have them custom-made in a good machine shop. For the recombinant gonad culture presented here, use the dimensions in Figure 2 *. - Autoclave - Beaker - Dishes (tissue culture; 30 -, 60 -, and 100 -mm) - Erlenmeyer flask (500 -mL) - Forceps (# 5; see Step 16) - Hood (tissue culture) - Incubator (tissue culture) preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 - Micropipettor with tips (20 -μL, 200 -μL) - Microscope (dissecting) - Needles (30 -gauge) - Pipettes (glass, hand-pulled) - *The diameters of the openings should be slightly larger than the mesonephroi or gonads, as appropriate; see Steps 21 and 24 *. - Pipettes (plastic, transfer) - *Trim tips to accommodate the urogenital complex comfortably*. - Plates (tissue culture; four-, 12 - or 24 -well) - Razor blade (sterile) - Soap for washing agar-block molds - Stir bar - Stirrer/heater - Tubes (heatproof, 15 mL) - Tubes (microcentrifuge, 1. 5 -mL) (for 11. 5 dpc wild-type embryos; see Step 15. i) ### METHOD **Preparation of the Agar** 1. Add 1. 5 g of Bacto Agar to 100 mL of DMEM in a 500 -mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add a stir bar. - Place the flask into a beaker of H 2 O to make a double boiler. Heat while stirring on a stirrer/heater until the agar is dissolved completely. - *Do not microwave; it will overflow*. - Transfer the flask directly to the heat. Boil the agar for 3 - 5 min. - *Monitor carefully; this boils over easily*. - Aliquot the agar into 15 -mL heatproof tubes in convenient quantities. - *Use 5 - 9 mL, depending on the number of blocks needed for an experiment. Each block requires 1. 5 mL*. - Store the agar aliquots at 4 °C. **Preparation of the Agar Blocks** 6. Wash the agar-block molds with soap and water. Rinse 10 times with tap H 2 O and 10 times with distilled H 2 O. 7. Autoclave the molds. - *Alternatively, just before use, dip the blocks in ethanol and flame them*. 8. Reheat an aliquot of agar in a beaker of H 2 O until it melts completely, then <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> keep in a beaker of warm H 2 O. 9. Working in a tissue culture hood, place a mold with the trench side up into a 100 -mm tissue culture dish. 10. Slowly pipet 1. 5 mL of melted agar onto the top of the mold (surface tension will keep the agar on the block). 11. Cover the tissue culture dish to avoid dehydration. Allow the agar to set for ~ 10 min. 12. Using a sterile razor blade, loosen the agar around the edges. Peel the agar off of the block, inverting it into a 30 -mm tissue culture dish. - *Peel the agar from the block {{in the same direction as}} the trenches are running or the agar will break along the trenches*. 13. Cover the agar with 1. 5 mL of organ culture medium. Allow the agar to equilibrate for at least 2 h (or overnight) in the incubator. **Assembling Recombinant Gonad Organ Cultures** 14. Collect embryos from wild-type or transgenic mice at the developmental stage of interest. Place each embryo in a single well of a tissue culture plate (four-, 12 - or 24 -well). 15. For 11. 5 -dpc wild-type embryos, follow these additional steps: - i. Collect the amnions into 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice. - ii. Catalog each amnion with the well number containing the associated urogenital complex (see Step 17). - iii. Determine the sex of the embryos using the protocol [Sex Chromatin Staining in Amnion Cells]([URL] (Capel and Batchvarov 2008). - *This is a quick method for identifying XX samples by the presence of cells with a condensed chromatin body*. - iv. Reserve a bit of each embryo’s tail for confirmation of the sex by PCR. - *Tail tips are stable in a dry tube on ice for several hours during dissection. Alternatively, they can be processed immediately for DNA extraction or stored at - 20 °C in buffer for DNA extraction*. 16. Using # 5 forceps, dissect the entire bilateral urogenital complex (see Fig. 3) along with the dorsal aorta from all of the embryos. ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. The entire urogenital complex at 11. 5 dpc contains the left and right gonad (G) /mesonephroi (M) and the dorsal aorta (DA), which lies at the midline. Separate the left and right gonad/mesonephros from the complex when you are ready to assemble to avoid tissue curling. Separate the gonad and mesonephros using a 30 -gauge needle. 17. Place each complex back into the individual well of the tissue culture plate containing prewarmed DMEM. Keep tissues at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. - *Four-well plates are preferred: You can remove one plate at a time from the incubator for fine dissection while the rest of the samples stay at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 *. 18. After determining the sex of the wild-type embryos, transfer each urogenital complex to a 60 -mm dish using a plastic transfer pipette (trimmed to accommodate the urogenital complex). 19. Using a 30 -gauge needle, separate the mesonephroi from the urogenital complexes of the embryos carrying a transgenic label. 20. Using a micropipettor with a 200 -μL tip, remove all but 100 - 200 μL of medium from the dish holding the agar block (from Step 13). - *It is much easier to assemble the recombination tissues in a dry well*. 21. Using a pulled glass pipette that has a diameter slightly larger than the mesonephros, transfer the transgenic mesonephroi into the grooves of the agar blocks. - *Each groove can hold approximately three mesonephroi*. - *Dissect one pair of mesonephroi at a time and transfer them to an agar block to prevent curling of the organ*. - *See Troubleshooting*. 22. Position mesonephroi into the groove under a dissecting microscope (see Fig. 3). - *Do not crowd samples; they are easier to work with if they are positioned far apart*. 23. Using a fresh 30 -gauge needle, separate the gonads from the wild-type urogenital complexes. - *To prevent curling, dissect only one or two wild-type gonads before transferring them to the agar and immediately assembling with a mesonephros*. 24. Using a pulled glass pipette that has a diameter slightly larger than the gonads, transfer gonads to an agar groove containing a mesonephros. - *When drawing the gonads into the pipette, keep track of the “cut” side, so that you can deposit the cut side toward the cut side of the mesonephros in the well*. *See Troubleshooting*. 25. Assemble the cut edges of the gonad and mesonephros together (Fig. 4). ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. (A) Agar block with three trenches, equilibrated, medium removed, and ready for loading samples with pulled glass mouth-pipette. (B) Four gonad/mesonephros cocultures are loaded in the top trench, and one is loaded in the middle left. (C) Higher magnification of coculture positioned in trenches; (left) gonad oriented downward; (right) gonad facing up. - *See Troubleshooting*. 26. Once all the samples are assembled completely, use a micropipettor with a 20 -μL tip to remove the remainder of the DMEM. - *Removing medium from the grooves will promote adhesion between the mesonephroi and gonads once you are satisfied with their position*. 27. Add 350 - 400 μL of fresh organ culture medium to the bottom of the 30 -mm tissue culture dish. Incubate for 1 - 2 h in the incubator. - *Do not disturb the samples until they have had time to adhere*. 28. Incubate the agar blocks in closed tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2. - *Placing the 30 -mm dishes inside 100 -mm culture dishes makes them easier to handle when transferring in and out of the incubator*. 29. Change the organ culture medium in the bottom of the dish daily. - *Cultures maintain good morphology for at least 48 h. See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The gonads or mesonephroi stick to the inside of the glass pipette **[Steps 21 and 24]** - **Solution**: Be sure to pick up a small volume of liquid in your pipette before you pick up the organ. - **Problem**: The gonads and mesonephroi are not properly aligned. [Step 25] - **Solution**: The organs are very sticky. Consider the following: - 1. Use pulled glass pipettes that are just slightly larger than the organ. This will provide better control as you pick up and orient the two tissues. - 2. Make sure that the cut sides of the organs are facing one another. - 3. If organs fail to align properly, add some DMEM to the trough and allow the organs to float apart. Then remove most of the medium (i. e., all but 100 - 200 μL) and use a pulled glass pipette or a needle to reassemble the gonads and mesonephroi. - **Problem**: Cultures are not growing optimally. **[Step 29]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Cultures can be improved by pipetting a drop of medium atop each organ to wash it each time you change the medium. Remove the excess washing medium from the well before returning samples to the incubator. - 2. There are differences in serum batches that affect viability and migation efficiency. When changing serum, test three or four batches to determine the best lot. - **Problem**: Mixed organ cultures become contaminated. **[Step 29]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Replace the medium each day to help control contamination. - 2. In general, additional antibiotics and fungicides take a toll on the tissue, but they might be required under some conditions. - 3. Spread the samples among multiple plates so that all the work is not lost if one plate becomes contaminated. - **Problem**: Labeling of plate is lost and it is not possible to distinguish the top and bottom groove on the plate - **Solution**: Always load the plate asymmetrically (e. g., four samples in the top groove, two in the middle, and three on the bottom). Document the location and details of each sample in a diagram in your notebook for reference in case labels on the plates are smudged or lost. ### REFERENCES 1. Brennan J., Karl J., Capel B.

All solutions of reacting materials were prepared in distilled water. In typical experiment, 50 ml of 0.001 M K 2 PtCl 6 was heated to boiling point. To this solution, 5 ml of 1 % trisodium citrate was added drop by drop. The solution was stirred by magnetic stirrer (RH-KT/C, IKA, Selangor, Malaysia) during the experiment. The temperature was controlled using a water bath (Ultratemp FP 35 -HC, Julabo GmbH, Seelbach, Germany). The solution was heated until color change is evident (bright yellow to black). Then, it was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>heating</b> element <b>and</b> stirred until cooled to room temperature. Platinum precipitate was separated by centrifuge (NF 615, Nuve, Ankara, Turkey) at 3, 000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitate formed by the metallic nanoparticles was washed several times [23] with deionized water and acetone, then put in acetone as a suspension. Then, the acetone and water in liquid phase was vaporized in an oven at 110 °C.|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} <b>heat</b> {{recovery}} <b>from</b> {{the ground below}} solar ponds is investigated in the present brief note. Solar ponds lose considerable amount of <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> its bottom to the ground due to temperature gradient between them. This waste <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> ground, which is at different temperature at different depths decreasing downwards {{from the bottom of}} the solar pond, can be extracted to enhance the thermal performance of the solar pond. This note addresses the technique to <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> ground <b>and</b> shows the enhancement of the <b>heat</b> removal <b>and</b> efficiency in doing so. Thermal performance of solar ponds is investigated and compared for the cases where the heat extraction fluid (HEF) flux through the LCZ and ground is constant and when they are different. Results show that constant HEF flux through LCZ and ground is a preferable option for heat removal. Also it is evident that the <b>heat</b> recovered <b>from</b> ground may reach a significant quantity which may almost be equal to the <b>heat</b> extracted <b>from</b> LCZ. Hence not recovering <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> ground leads to loss of up to 50 % thermal energy...|$|R
40|$|Cooling systems <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> {{components}} <b>and</b> industrial equipment. Water cooling, employing natural waters, {{is typically}} used for cooling large industrial facilities, such as power plants, factories or refineries. Due to moderate temperatures, cooling water cycles {{are susceptible to}} biofouling, inorganic fouling and scaling, which may reduce <b>heat</b> transfer <b>and</b> enhance corrosion. Hypochlorite treatment or antifouling coatings are used to prevent biological fouling in these systems. In this research, we examine biofouling and materials’ degradation in a brackish seawater environment using a range of test materials, both uncoated and coated. The fouling and corrosion resistance of titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), super austenitic stainless steel (254 SMO) and epoxy-coated carbon steel (Intershield Inerta 160) were studied in the absence and presence of hypochlorite. Our results demonstrate that biological fouling is intensive in cooling systems using brackish seawater in sub-arctic areas. The microfouling comprised a vast diversity of bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae and protozoa. Chlorination was effective against biological fouling: up to a 10 – 1000 -fold decrease in bacterial and archaeal numbers was detected. Chlorination also changed {{the diversity of the}} biofilm-forming community. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that chlorination enhances cracking of the epoxy coating...|$|R

A 50  μg DOTATATE (JPT, Berlin, Germany) was dissolved in 100  μl Ultrapur® water (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) {{and added to}} the dry HEPES powder. The 68 Ge/ 68 Ga-generator was eluted with 5  ml of 0.6  M HCl (made from 30 % HCl, and water, both Ultrapur® grade, Merck Millipore). Two milliliters of the 68 Ga containing eluate {{was transferred}} to the HEPES/DOTATATE mixture. After very careful shaking, the mixture was heated for 15  min at 85 °C in a heating block. It was then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>heating</b> block <b>and</b> cooled down for 10  min before being diluted with 6  ml water (Ultrapur®). The labelling mixture was purified on a SepPak light C 18 cartridge (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) with 10  ml water (Ultrapur®) and eluted with 2  ml ethanol (70 %, made from ethanol, ROTIPURAN®, ROTH, Karlsruhe, Germany, and Ultrapur® water). The cartridge was pre-conditioned by rinsing first with 5  ml ethanol (70 %), then with 10  ml Ultrapur® water and 5  ml air. Four milliliters of sterile isotonic saline (BERLIN-CHEMIE AG, Berlin, Germany) was added to the ethanolic solution for injection. The preparations were followed by a sterile filtration, and before administration, the product is diluted with approximately 20  ml saline.|$|R
40|$|The term rapid {{prototyping}} (RP) {{is widely used}} to describe technologies which create physical prototypes directly from digital data. The first methods for {{rapid prototyping}} became available in the late 1980 s and were used to produce models and prototype parts. Three-dimensional (3 D) rapid prototyping methods are widely employed in various areas of manufacturing, research, and education. Typical applications include engineering, architecture, and medicine. The present level of technical and commercial demand requires the development of faster and cheaper methodologies for the design and execution of structures. Various techniques based on CAD platforms and rapid prototyping are available. Parts can be produced {{in a variety of}} materials: polymers, metal, paper, ceramics, and composites. The RP method also enables the production of prototypes useful for analysing the characteristics of a complex system (e. g. interference between dynamic parts, geometric evaluation, quality, and reliability). RP technologies can produce very complex parts which are impossible or difficult to produce by traditional methods. This paper presents typical applications of rapid prototyping technology for the manufacture of mechanical parts for fuel cells, such as housing parts or bipolar plates which supply reactants (hydrogen to anodes and oxygen to cathodes), conduct electrons from one cell to the next, <b>remove</b> waste <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> cells, <b>and</b> provide mechanical support for cells in a stack. Conventional graphite or composite materials can be replaced by lighter metallic materials characterised by vastly superior manufacturability and cost effectiveness, greater mechanical strength, increased durability and resistance to shock and vibration, and zero permeability. The potential for the application of this method for the manufacture of metallic bipolar plates (BPP) for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is presented and discussed. Special attention is paid to the fabrication of light elements for the construction of PEMFC stacks designed for mobile applications such as aviation technology and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) ...|$|R
