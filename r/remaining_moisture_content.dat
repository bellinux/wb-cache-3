To accomplish this, we studied the electric parameters, the drying rate and the dried quality of Chinese wolfberry fruits using EHD, including, for example, the <b>remaining</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> shrinkage, rehydration ratio, Vitamin C contents. Ten mathematical models were compared to determine which one best represented the drying characteristics of the Chinese wolfberry fruits.

The instrumented indentation and 3 -point bending tests were performed on different liquid polymer hydrated bentonite clay mats at varying <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Properties measured include modified Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) and elastic structural stiffness (EI). The dependence of flexural stiffness on <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is demonstrated to conform to a best power function variation. The ductile to brittle transition of clay mat is affected primarily by {{the change in the}} <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and for the clay mat to <b>remain</b> flexible, critical <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of 1. 7 times of its plastic limit is required.

Bark beetle activity in conifer stands {{has also been shown}} to alter foliar fuel <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and chemistry {{over the course of the}} bark beetle rotation. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes to fine surface fuels, foliar fuel moisture and chemistry and litter chemistry in and under whitebark pine trees infested by mountain pine beetle. Fuels were measured beneath green (healthy) trees compared to red (two years since initial MPB attack with 50 % or greater needles remaining) and gray (greater than two years since attack with between 15 % and 45 % needles <b>remaining)</b> trees. Foliar <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> was measured in four mountain pine beetle crown condition classes: green-uninfested, green-infested (current year’s attack), yellow (last year’s attack), and red. Total terpene content was analyzed in whitebark pine needle litter and volatile terpenes were collected and analyzed from green, green-infested, yellow, and red trees. Significant differences were found in litter depths under green, red, and graytrees. Duff depths were significantly less beneath green trees than red and gray trees. One hour and ten hour fuels were more influenced by diameter and crown size than beetle crown condition classes. Foliar fuel <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> dramatically decreased from green-infested to the red beetle crown condition class. No differences were detected in shrub and forb biomass between green, red, and gray trees. Green-infested trees had significantly lower foliar fuel moisture than green trees and by late in the season showed fuel moisture levels similar to red trees which had the lowest fuel <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Litter beneath red trees contained large amounts of terpenes, including compounds known to increase foliage flammability that remain in the litter throughout the fire season.

While not currently available in the U. S., there are manufacturers in Europe and Japan that produce units for those markets. Drawing on analysis conducted for the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) current rulemaking on amended standards for clothes dryers, this paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of HPCDs in American homes, as well as the national impact analysis for different market share scenarios. In order to get an accurate measurement of real energy savings potential, the paper offers a new energy use calculation methodology that takes into account the most current data on clothes washer cycles, clothes dryer usage frequency, <b>remaining</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> and load weight per cycle, which is very different from current test procedure values. Using the above methodology along with product cost estimates developed by DOE, the paper presents the results of a life-cycle cost analysis of the adoption of HPCDs in a representative sample of American homes.

40|$|The {{washing machine}} {{is widely used}} in the present day’s society for washing and drying of clothes. The Fisher & Paykel EcoSmart GWL 10 washing machine has been awarded “The America’s Most Energy Efficient Washer ” for this year by The Consortium of Energy Efficiency, which rates washers in the market {{depending}} on their energy and water consumption and the <b>remaining</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Most of the raw materials used in the manufacturing process of the washing machine have considerable negative social and environmental impacts which include mass scale extraction of metals, releases of toxic gases during production and processing, contamination of land and health hazards caused in humans and animals. Therefore it is important to mitigate these effects while achieving the social requirements. It is believed that providing a service to replace the domestic washing machine would be a feasible solution for this dilemma. A service can be introduced where all the dirty laundry will be collected on a weekly basis, washed, dried, ironed and then returned to the users after a certain number of days. It is suggested that these services be well organised and functioned as a service to the community than a business to individual service providing companies. Therefore a fixed charge for a fixed volume or number of clothes is strongly recommended. Thusitha Mabotuwana Table of content...|$|E
40|$|Fluctuations in soil {{moisture}} create drying-rewetting events affecting {{the activity of}} microorganisms. Microbial responses to drying-rewetting are mostly studied in soils that are air-dried before rewetting. Upon rewetting, two patterns of bacterial growth have been observed. In the Type 1 pattern, bacterial growth rates increase immediately in a linear fashion. In the Type 2 pattern, bacterial growth rates increase exponentially after a lag period. However, soils are often only partially dried. Partial drying (higher <b>remaining</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> before rewetting) may be considered a less harsh treatment compared with air-drying. We hypothesized that a soil with a Type 2 response upon rewetting air-dried soil would transform into a Type 1 response if dried partially before rewetting. Two soils were dried to a gradient of different moisture content. Respiration and bacterial growth rates were then measured before and during 48 h after rewetting to 50 % of water holding capacity (WHC). Initial moisture content determined growth and respiration in a sigmoidal fashion, with lowest activity in air-dried soil and maximum above ca. 30 % WHC. Partial drying resulted in shorter lag periods, shorter recovery times and lower maximum bacterial growth rates after rewetting. The respiration after rewetting was lower when soil was partially dried and higher when soils were air-dried. The threshold moisture content where transition from a Type 2 to a Type 1 response occurred was about 14 % WHC, while > 30 % WHC resulted in no rewetting effect. We combine our result with other recent reports to propose a framework of response patterns after drying-rewetting, where the harshness of drying determines the response pattern of bacteria upon rewetting dried soils...|$|E

The equilibrium <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> determined from desorption experiment, was well described by the Hailwood-Horrobin solution theory. <b>Moisture</b> <b>content</b> of 23 + 4 % best represented the value of apparent fiber saturation point, Mp, determined from physical and mechanical properties data. Above Mp, values of all physical and mechanical properties examined were fairly constant. Maximum volumetric shrinkage from <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> above Mp to an oven-dry condition was 8. 2 + 1. 8 %. Specific gravity and density were 0. 55 + 0. 03 and 614 + 30 kg/m 3 at 12 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Below Mp, ultimate compressive stress (UCS) parallel to grain, ultimate shear stress parallel to grain, modulus of elasticity (MOE) for compression parallel to grain, and shear modulus parallel to grain increased exponentially with decreasing <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Shear strain at fracture and work to fracture of shear parallel to grain were found to increase as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> decreased below Mp and attained the maximum values at 20 % and 12 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> respectively. The values decreased with further lowering of the level of <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Ultimate compressive stress (UCS) parallel to grain was closely correlated with specific gravity and was more sensitive to changes in <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> at higher specific gravity level...|$|R

From Fig.  8, when the assumed value of <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is half of the true value (0.5 on the horizontal axis), the estimation accuracy of MOE 15 (ASTM) becomes 1.04 [*]±[*] 0.13; in contrast, when the assumed value of <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is 1.5 times (1.5 on the horizontal axis), the estimation accuracy of MOE becomes 1.37 [*]±[*] 0.26. For instance, in a full-scale timber of 80 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> MOE is estimated by assuming the <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> as 40 %. Although the assumed <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is incorrect, the estimated value is about the same as the observed value. As mentioned above, this is because the Young’s modulus derived via the Monte Carlo method without measuring the density has been overestimated about 20 %. This point is offset by having underestimated the <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> the resulting estimation accuracy hence improves. Conversely, assuming 120 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> on an 80 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of a full-scale timber to estimate MOE, the value is being overestimated by about 40 %. For this result, the difference in the measurement position is hardly found.|$|R

Moench) sample sets {{representative}} of commonly grown hybrids and diverse physical attributes were analyzed for alkaline cooking performance. The influence of kernel characteristics including hardness, density, starch properties (thermal, pasting, and crystallinity), starch content, protein content, and prolamin content on alkaline cooking performance was also determined. Corn nixtamal <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> was lower for hard, dense kernels with high protein contents; sorghum nixtamal <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> was lower for kernels with low <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> and low starch relative crystallinities. Statistically significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) regression equations showed that corn nixtamal <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> {{was influenced by}} TADD (tangential abrasive dehulling device) index, kernel <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> starch content, and protein content; sorghum nixtamal <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> was influenced by starch relative crystallinity, kernel <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> and abrasive hardness index. Pericarp removal was not strongly correlated with kernel characterization tests. Location (environmental) and hybrid (genetic) factors influenced most kernel characteristics and nixtamalization processing variables...|$|R

The length, width, thickness of seed increased from 10. 69 to 11. 62 mm, 8. 55 to 9. 38 mm and 6. 85 to 7. 3 mm respectively as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased. Seed roundness and sphericity decreased linearly from 95. 2 to 81. 7 % and 83. 9 to 79 % respectively as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased. One thousand seed weight increased from 400. 9 to 423. 1 g as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased. As <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased from 5. 3 % to 29. 6 % (d. b) bulk density decreased from 0. 676 to 0. 593 g/cm 3 while true density and porosity increased from 1. 077 to 1. 11 g/cm 3 and 37. 2 to 46. 5 % respectively. Angle of repose increased from 22. 3 to 32. 6 o as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased. Seed static {{coefficient of friction}} on different surfaces increased {{in the order of}} hessian bag (0. 6322 to 0. 708), galvanized steel sheet (0. 5095 to 0. 5681), glass (0. 404 to 0. 5774) and plywood (0. 3959 to 0. 5228) as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased. Specific heat varied from 1266. 45 to 1562. 12 J/kg K as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased from 5. 3 % to 29. 6 % (d. b). Regression analysis of results showed that all properties followed linear trend as <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> increased except specific heat that exhibited a second order polynomial increase with <b>moisture</b> <b>content...</b>|$|R
