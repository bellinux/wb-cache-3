5000|$|The {{revision}} of the long-tufted screech owl's distribution has brought attention to references relating to a name which had been published 43 years prior to sanctaecatarinae. Martin Heinrich Karl Lichtenstein published a list of type specimens in the Berlin Museum, to which some new names were introduced, but {{it was simply a}} list, and all the names therein lacked descriptions. One of these nomen nudum was based upon a screech-owl taken by the collector Sello near the vicinity of Montevideo, Uruguay - Ephialtes [...] Hermann Schlegel later published a description of this same type, but the description was done in a manner that did not allow for clarity {{as to whether or not}} he felt that argentina was a valid species (one recognized for a legitimate taxon). The description was provided as a footnote, not as a synonym, for his entry for Scops brasiliensis. Schlegel did not see how this specimen differed from brasiliensis, and also suggested that it might be compared to Ephialtes Watsonii (another name which was not validly adopted in his review): [...] "...ne se distinguishe Sc. brasiliensis que par une taille un peu plus forte et par ses teintes en general un peu plus claires. Cet oiseau a ete observe daus les environs de Montevideo d'ou M. Sello en a fait parvenir deux individus femelles au Musee de Berlin. Quatrieme <b>remige</b> egalanta a peu pres la cinquieme.

Pointe d'aile 18 lignes. Queue 3 pouces 9 lignes. Tarse 16 lignes. Doigt du milieu 11 lignes. Aigrettes 15 lignes. Doigts nus."

40|$|ABSTRACT Turkey hens were thyroidectomized at {{different}} ages and phases of their reproductive cycles. Egg production, primary <b>remige</b> molting, and plasma thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) concentrations were monitored during {{each of three}} experiments. Thyroidectomy of hens (26 and 30 wk of age) prior to photoinduction of egg production prevented subsequent egg production and molting. Thyroidectomy of adult hens (36 wk of age) early in the egg production cycle caused a gradual termination of egg laying without the occurrence of molting. Thyroidec-tomy of mature hens (66 wk of age) during the light restriction period prior to their second egg production cycle prevented subsequent egg laying and molting. All successful thyroidectomies reduced plasma T 4 and T 3 to concentrations below the sensitivity levels of the assays. Feeding 1 ppm T 4 to thyroidectomized hens resulted in resumption of normal egg production and molting. These {{results indicate that the}} thyroid is essential for the initiation and maintenance of egg production and for molting in turkey hens...|$|E
40|$|URL] {{studied the}} {{foraging}} ecology of a tropical seabird community in 2 {{islands of the}} Seychelles from 2005 to 2007. Chick dietary samples were used to compare feeding habits among species and assess inter-annual and seasonal variations in diet. Fish prey dominated the diet of the community (68 to 100 % of prey consumed), although cephalopods were present in 61. 3, 40. 0, 27. 1 and 32. 9 % of the food samples from white-tailed tropicbirds, sooty terns, brown noddies and wedgetailed shearwaters, respectively. We found high diet overlap between species (Mullidae fish being the first prey consumed [30 to 90 %] for all species except for the white-tailed tropicbird [< 2 %]) but some segregation in prey length. Other important prey were Exocoetidae, Carangidae, Scombridae and Clupeidae mainly for white-tailed tropicbirds, sooty terns and brown noddies, Hemiramphidae and Coryphaenidae for white-tailed tropicbirds, and Engraulidae and fish larvae for lesser noddies and Audubon’s shearwaters. Despite some inter-annual and seasonal variations in diet, these were not consistent within the community. Responses of the seabird community to an environmental perturbation that negatively affected chick growth and breeding success of lesser noddies emphasised the higher vulnerability of species with smaller foraging ranges and/or with lower ability to switch diet (lesser noddy, roseate tern) compared to less range-restricted and/or more opportunistic ones (white-tailed tropicbird, brown noddy, sooty tern, white tern). Although situated in a tropical region, the food availability in the Seychelles seems to be predictable at a large (annual) temporal scale, but highly unpredictable at a small intra-seasonal or daily) temporal scale.

40|$|The {{northern}} {{coast of}} Pernambuco State, Brazil, is an wintering area for shorebirds originally from north America, {{especially from the}} east. The first flocks arrive in September, staying till April, when they molts, change plumage, and acquire enough biomass to migrate back to the northern hemisfere. In order to calculate flight range mass and length of the wing of Charadrius semipalmatus Bonaparte, 1825, Calidris fuscicollis Vieillot, 1819, C. pusilla Linnaeus, 1766 and C. alba Pallas, 1764 was recorded. Traps were carried out in Coroa do Avião (7 º 40 ' S and 34 º 50 'W) in the northern coast of the State of Pernambuco, between May 1992 and April 1995. The length of the wing was registered with the wing spread (from the insertion of the bone till the extremity of the longest primary <b>remige).</b> Individuals which were changing the tenth primary {{were not included in}} this measuring. Mass was taken in grarns, and flight range was calculated using the equations proposed for adult individuais. The individual with the highest flight range reached around 1831, 87 km, and had been trapped and ringed in 14 th April 1994, when had 61, 5 g and wing measuring 12, 9 cm, with intermediate plumage.

40|$|O estudo das aves configura uma importante ferramenta para o conhecimento dos processos envolvidos de padrões comportamentais e morfológicos. A espécie aqui estudada pertence à família Thamnophilidae, a terceira maior família restrita a região Neo{{tropical}}. São conhecidos popularmente como papa-formigas e compreendem 209 espécies. Grande parcela das espécies apresenta comportamento críptico, tornando a comunicação acústica importante ferramenta para manutenção de contato das aves. Herpsilochmus pectoralis Sclater 1857, possui dimorfismo sexual evidente, mede entre 10 e 12 cm, é encontrada em fragmentos florestais do Nordeste e é categorizada como vulnerável a processo de extinção. Este estudo foi realizado em três fragmentos de restinga no litoral leste do estado do Rio Grande do Norte. Através de gravações entre 2006 e 2012 foi possível descrever e caracterizar o canto de H. pectoralis. O canto do macho tem mais notas e maior duração do que o da fêmea (16 % de dimorfismo). Não encontramos diferença na frequência dominante entre os sexos. Descrevemos quatro tipos de chamadas para o repertório da espécie. Por meio de capturas com redes ornitológicas entre 2009 e 2012 foi possível descrever e comparar a morfologia de H. pectoralis. A espécie apresentou menores valores de massa no período de seca. Os jovens apresentaram similaridades morfométricas com relação aos adultos. A espécie não possui dimorfismo acentuado em suas características morfométricas. Os jovens que voam possuem características morfométricas de adultos mesmo não apresentando plumagem característica de adulto. O padrão de muda na espécie é característico de aves tropicais, mas possui período reprodutivo curto, característico de espécies temperadas. A espécie mesmo estando em região tropical sofre com o regime sazonal de chuvas, que influencia em sua fenologia reprodutiva e no ciclo de muda (<b>rêmige</b> e retriz). Dessa forma, a presente dissertação traz informações sobre a biologia de H. pectoralis para subsidiar o entendimento da relação dessa espécie com o ambiente e conhecer as variações de aspectos morfológicos e vocais, visando entender padrões e características gerais dos Thamnophilidae. The {{study of}} birds represents {{an important tool}} for {{the understanding of the}} processes involved in behavioral and morphological patterns. The species we have studied belongs to Thamnophilidae family, the third largest family restricted to the Neotropic ecozone. They are popularly known as antbirds and comprise 209 species. A large portion of the species has cryptic behavior, making the acoustic communication an important tool for maintaining contact among birds. Herpsilochmus pectoralis Sclater 1857 has evident sexual dimorphism, measured between 10 and 12 cm height and it is found in forest fragments in the Northeast and it is also categorized as vulnerable to extinction process. This study was conducted in three sandbank fragments on the east coast of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. With the help of tape recordings between 2006 and 2012 it was possible to describe and characterize the sing of H. pectoralis. The sing from male birds has more and longer length than the female sing (16 % of dimorphism). No differences were found in the dominant frequency between the sexes. We describe four types of calls from this species repertoire. Through capturing with ornithological nets between 2009 and 2012 it was possible to describe and compare the morphology of H. pectoralis. The species have shown lower corporal mass in the dry season. The young birds showed morphometric similarities in comparison to adults. The species has no accentuated dimorphism in their morphometric characteristics. The young ones with flying capabilities have morphometric characteristics of adults, even though they do not show a characteristic adult plumage. The moult pattern in the species is a characteristic of tropical birds, but it shows short reproductive period, typical of temperate species. Even being in the tropical region, the species suffers with seasonal rainfall, which influences their reproductive phenology and moult (remex and rectrix) cycle. Thus, this dissertation provides information on the biology of H. pectoralis to support the understanding of the relationship of this species to the environment and also to know the variations of morphology and vocal aspects, in order to understand patterns and general characteristics of Thamnophilidae...|$|E
