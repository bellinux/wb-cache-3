5|$|US 5 {{begins on}} State Street at exit 5 of Interstate 91 in New Haven. State Street {{continues}} southwest into downtown as a local, unnumbered street. US 5 starts {{out as an}} undivided four-lane road becoming two lanes just before crossing into Hamden. State Street continues north through Hamden and the industrial section of North Haven, closely paralleling the Amtrak <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> {{on the west side}} of the Quinnipiac River. It has an interchange with Route 40 in this area. US 5 then turns right at the intersection with Bishop Street in North Haven and crosses the Quinnipiac River, the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> and I-91 (at exit 11) overlapped with Route 22 on a four-lane wide road.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the field}} of {{detecting}} for defects of <b>railroad</b> <b>track</b> surface, computer vision method for detection has been widely used. An online real-time image processing system for defects of <b>railroad</b> <b>track</b> surface is introduced in the paper. Results show that: {{if the number of}} pixels in each <b>railroad</b> <b>track</b> surface image is 512 × 240, the train speed can be 50 Km/h while the image processing system can real-time detect the railway track surface defects, the number of pixels in in each <b>railroad</b> <b>track</b> surface image is 320 × 250, the train speed can be 100 Km/h while the image processing system can real-time detect the railway track surface defects...|$|R

5|$|In the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} community, NY117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> and connects to exit39 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6km), NY117 runs alongside {{the northern edge of}} the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> again as it intersects with the parkway's exit42. NY117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, NY117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit43 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. NY117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit43 serves as the start of NY117 southbound.|$|E
5|$|On August 2 {{as many as}} 3,000 {{troops of}} the Pennsylvania National Guard First Division arrived from Pittsburgh {{under the command of}} Major General Robert Brinton, and imposed martial law. The troops had arrested an {{estimated}} 70 activists en route, and forced those apprehended to repair places where the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> between the cities had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After he is accosted by Doerachman, Mardjan {{reveals that}} the letter which Doerachman signed was {{actually}} a statement granting Mardjan all of the hadji's wealth. Furious at Mardjan's behaviour, Asmadi attacks him while Rachmat restrains the others. After a lengthy knife fight, Mardjan's foot is caught in the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> and he is soon killed by a passing train. Doerachman, pleased {{with the return of}} his wealth, destroys the letter and grants Rachmat permission to marry Atikah.|$|E

5|$|All {{funds for}} the $7.4 million library came from private donors that {{numbered}} over 1,300 companies, individuals, or non-profit organizations. Large donations came from the Fred Meyer Charitable Trust, the M. J. Murdock Charitable Trust, and The Collins Foundation. Construction {{was a part of}} a broader plan to open up the southern portion of the campus after <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> were removed in 1981 and the Mill Race re-routed and landscaped.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the {{dam site}} {{occurred}} in May 1957 with {{the relocation of}} the Western Pacific <b>Railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> that ran through the Feather River canyon. The Burns-Porter Act of the California Legislature, which authorized the SWP, was not passed until November 8, 1960 – and only by a slim margin. Engineer Donald Thayer of the DWR was commissioned to design and head construction of Oroville Dam, and the primary work contract was awarded to Oro Dam Constructors Inc., a joint venture led by Oman Construction Co.|$|E

5|$|On {{the weekend}} of April 28, 1979, more than 15,000 people {{demonstrated}} against the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant. The protest was coordinated with other anti-nuclear demonstrations across the country. Daniel Ellsberg and Allen Ginsberg were among the 284 people who were arrested. The demonstration followed {{more than six months}} of continuous protests that included an attempted blockade of the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> leading to the site. Large pro-nuclear counter demonstrations were also staged that year.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{the park}} were officially {{announced}} in March 1998 and construction began in September of that year. Initial construction was {{under the auspices of}} the Chicago Department of Transportation, because the project bridges the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks.</b> However, as the project grew and expanded, its broad variety of features and amenities outside the scope of the field of transportation placed it under the jurisdiction of the city's Public Buildings Commission.|$|E
5|$|The railroad's Purdy's {{station is}} a short {{distance}} west of the next junction, NY116, after which NY22 crosses under I-684, remaining {{between it and the}} <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks.</b> Turning left onto Hardscrabble Road, it follows the tracks away from the interstate {{to the site of the}} next station, North Salem's hamlet of Croton Falls. Just north of the hamlet, Route22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by US202. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the Croton River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir.|$|E

5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> {{and leaves the}} village, the road widens and becomes a {{commercial}} highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E
5|$|Although Brunner died on February 14, 1925, {{elements}} of his plans were still completed, {{except for his}} People's Court, which became a parking lot. Brunner planned a bridge to cross the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> and connect the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13thStreet. Brunner had also originally planned to have another bridge span the Susquehanna River, {{on the west side}} of the capitol. After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931.|$|E
5|$|From Gallery Place – Chinatown through Judiciary Square, {{the line}} runs southeast, turning east again at D Street to reach Union Station. There it turns north and {{surfaces}} adjacent to Union Station's platforms, follows the Washington Terminal yard tracks north to Brentwood {{where the line}} turns northwestward and again joins CSX Transportation's Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, running in a unique gauntlet arrangement with the freight <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> straddling the Metro tracks. The Red Line continues in this manner northwest across the District-Maryland line, through Takoma and past Silver Spring. It reenters a tunnel at 16th Street and heads north under Georgia Avenue to the end at Glenmont. There is a maintenance yard between the NoMa and Rhode Island Avenue stops.|$|E

5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over another set of <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank farms to an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward {{from this point on}} NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville's {{boundaries}} are Kentucky Street to the north, Avery Street (Cardinal Boulevard) to the south, I-65 to the east, the CSX <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks</b> to the west. Originally, the neighborhood extended {{all the way}} to Broadway on the north, Attwood Street on the south, and Floyd Street on the East; but the northern part was mostly razed for parking lots and light industry, the southern area between Attwood and Avery Streets (now Cardinal Blvd) was razed when the University of Louisville doubled the size of its main campus, and I-65 was built through the area in the 1960s, which created a physical barrier between it and Shelby Park neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of River Street, south from the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum across the <b>railroad</b> <b>tracks,</b> the Mill Works Building, {{originally}} a foundry, contains the Ypsilanti Food Co-op and the River Street Bakery, owned by the co-op. On the roof of the Mill Works Building, Solar Ypsi installed 12 solar panels for the co-op in April 2009, followed by 30 panels for the bakery in 2010, producing a total of 8.3kilowatts during peak sunlight. Data from the meters can be viewed at the Solar Ypsi website, allowing anyone to compare generation from different sites.|$|E
