40|$|Parents receive diet {{recommendations}} {{for their children}} from dentists and dietitians, but a conflict of diet suggestions has been reported. This research was conducted to investigate dental caries experiences in children consuming snacks that were <b>recommended</b> by dentists and/or dietitians. A total of 442 kindergarteners under went dental examinations, and their caregivers filled out questionnaires. Snacks were sorted by name. Three dentists and three dietitians determined whether they would <b>recommend</b> these snacks. The snacks were divided into four categories: snacks <b>recommended</b> by both groups, snacks <b>recommended</b> by neither, snacks <b>recommended</b> only by dentists, and snacks <b>recommend</b> only by dieticians. Children were assigned to particular groups based on their primary snack consumption. The children’s caries experiences (dft) were compared among the four groups. The agreement level on the <b>recommended</b> snacks between dietitians and dentists was moderate (Kappa= 0. 43). Thirty-nine snacks were identified; 13 <b>recommended</b> by neither, 4 <b>recommended</b> by dietitians, 7 were <b>recommended</b> only by dentists, and 15 were <b>recommended</b> by both. The mean (standard deviation) of dft amongthe children was 4. 66 (3. 81), 2. 66 (3. 17), 3. 21 (3. 37), and 4. 02 (4. 02), and respectively.

40|$|International audienceScreening {{with breast}} {{ultrasound}} {{in combination with}} mammography is needed to investigate a clinical breast mass (Grade B), colored single-pore breast nipple discharge (Grade C), or mastitis (Grade C). The BI-RADS system is <b>recommended</b> for describing and classifying abnormal breast imaging findings. For a breast abscess, a percutaneous biopsy is <b>recommended</b> {{in the case of}} a mass or persistent symptoms (Grade C). For mastalgia, when breast imaging is normal, no MRI or breast biopsy is <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). Percutaneous biopsy is <b>recommended</b> for a BI-RADS category 4 - 5 mass (Grade B). For persistent erythematous nipple or atypical eczema lesions, a nipple biopsy is <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). For distortion and asymmetry, a vacuum core-needle biopsy is <b>recommended</b> due to the risk of underestimation by simple core-needle biopsy (Grade C). For BI-RADS category 4 - 5 microcalcifications without any ultrasound signal, a minimum 11 -G vacuum core-needle biopsy is <b>recommended</b> (Grade B). In the absence of microcalcifications on radiography cores additional samples are <b>recommended</b> (Grade B). For atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, flat epithelial atypia, radial scar and mucocele with atypia, surgical excision is commonly <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). Expectant management is feasible after multidisciplinary consensus. For these lesions, when excision margins are not clear, no new excision is <b>recommended</b> except for LCIS characterized as pleomorphic or with necrosis (Grade C). For grade 1 phyllodes tumor, surgical resection with clear margins is <b>recommended.</b> For grade 2 phyllodes tumor, 10 mm margins are <b>recommended</b> (Grade C).

Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González <b>recommends</b> that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist.
