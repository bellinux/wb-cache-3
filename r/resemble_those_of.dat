5|$|The Wulgulmerang form, located to {{the north}} and east of Omeo, to Wulgulmerang and the Little River. The flower limb is a more {{yellow-brown}} and the infructescences <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> B.marginata.

5|$|The fruit bodies vaguely <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> {{the species}} Gymnopaxillus nudus, found in Australia growing in {{association}} with Eucalyptus. However, Gymnopaxillus fruit bodies grow underground, lack a strong odor, do not stain purple with potassium hydroxide, and have longer spores, typically 11–16µm.|$|E

5|$|The spiny {{plates on}} the back and tail of the tuatara <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a {{crocodile}} more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara is {{considered}} the most unspecialised living amniote; the brain and mode of locomotion <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> amphibians and the heart is more primitive than {{that of any other}} reptile. The lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi.|$|E
5|$|Another {{removable}} roadblocking {{system used}} mines. The extant remains of such systems superficially <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> hedgehog or hairpin, but the pits are shallow: just {{deep enough to}} take an anti-tank mine. When not in use, the sockets were filled with a wooden plug allowing traffic to pass normally.|$|E

5|$|B.menziesiis inflorescences <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> {{no other}} banksia; its closest {{relatives}} were felt by George to be B.speciosa (showy banksia) and B.baxteri (bird's nest banksia), which differs from B.menziesii in having yellow flowers and leaves with deep triangular lobes. In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed its closest relatives {{to be the}} members of the series Crocinae.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} part of the period there is {{relatively}} little metalwork and a larger amount of ceramics. The assemblage of early Iron Age ceramics from Atlantic Scotland is large compared with the rest of Britain. There are a wide variety of forms and styles, some which <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> southern Britain, particularly those with incised geometric ornament.|$|E
5|$|In the DNA-study by Fain and Houde (2004) {{they were}} {{included}} in the Metaves, together with the Columbiformes. In the larger study by Hackett et al. (2008) they were once again positioned close to the Columbiformes, in Columbimorphae, but also with the Mesites. The intricately patterned, precocial downy young and egg colouration (though not shape) closely <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> many Charadriiformes. Eggs are near elliptical.|$|E

5|$|Juvenile {{birds of}} both sexes have less {{extensive}} blue on their faces, the coloration not extending past the eye. The upperparts <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the adult female. Both sexes have the white wing-stripe, which disappears with maturity in males. The immature male has a red patch on the wing and may also have an orange wash on the belly.|$|E
5|$|Male elands have 31 diploid {{chromosomes}} {{and females}} have 32. The male (Y) chromosome has been translocated {{to the short}} arm of an autosome. Both the X and Y replicate late; they do not match well and are variable. The chromosomes <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros).|$|E
5|$|The spiders {{are unique}} in the {{flexible}} and teethed hook-like claws on the last segments (tarsus) of their legs. These elongated claws <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> spiders in the family Gradungulidae of Australia and New Zealand, but the two families are only distantly related. Hooked tarsal claws are also present {{to a lesser extent}} in the unrelated genera Doryonychus of Tetragnathidae, Hetrogriffus of Thomisidae and Celaenia of Araneidae.|$|E

5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> caesium. A heavy element {{with a single}} valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since element 112 (copernicium) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E
5|$|North American birds {{most closely}} <b>resemble</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Eurasia, which was {{connected}} to the continent as part of the supercontinent Laurasia until around 60 million years ago. Many groups occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere and worldwide. However some groups unique to the New World have also arisen; those represented in this list are the hummingbirds, the New World vultures, the New World quail, the tyrant flycatchers, the vireos, the mimids, the New World warblers, the tanagers, the cardinals and the icterids.|$|E
