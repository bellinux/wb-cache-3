Three main arguments regarding Amazonian urbanization are discussed. 1) The lack of urban infrastructure in the Amazon is non-selective, affecting cities notwithstanding age, size, and location. 2) As a result, subregional inter-urban networks are emerging marked by the rise of node service cities {{in different parts of the}} region. 3) High <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization,</b> dependency on subsidies, lack of industries and dominant informal economy points to limited prospects for short-term improvements in urban conditions and quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Summary: This paper {{investigates the}} {{conditional}} convergence of both human capital indicators and {{per capita income}} across Canadian provinces in an empirical framework. In this framework, long-run relative provincial steady states are determined by relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> and one-time shocks to Quebec and Alberta’s relative steady states. As predicted by the theoretical framework of Barro, Mankiw, and Sala-i-Martin (1995), we found that indicators of relative human capital ratios appear to have converged {{at roughly the same}} speed as per capita income—around 5 per cent in the 1951 – 1996 period. The quantitative effects <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> and regional shocks to relative human capital and per capita income are similar, with one exception: In Alberta, the 1973 oil shock contributed to the rise in per capita income but not in human capital. In comparison, however, the negative shock in 1970 to Quebec’s convergence path appears to have affected the evolution of both human capital and per capita income...|$|R

40|$|Globally, {{the high}} <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> {{over the past}} century have spurred {{unprecedented}} levels of tunnel construction. With each tunnel installation, there is a large affiliated risk for damage to aboveground structures, especially those of unreinforced masonry. Such damage (and the subsequent costs and litigation) occur, despite huge sums committed to construction monitoring and pre-tunnel mitigation. Arguably, damage still happens because the wide range of parameters and the extent of their variability are not sufficiently considered in the risk assessment process. To address these uncertainties, a probabilistic framework for the large-scale risk assessment of existing, unreinforced masonry buildings subjected to bored tunnelling is proposed by the Urban Modelling Group (UMG) at the University College Dublin (UCD).
