25|$|Though the {{population}} of striped bass was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that {{the rapid growth of}} the striped bass population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (<b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> shad, and blueback herring). This pressure on their food source was putting their own population at risk due to {{the population}} of prey naturally not coming back to the same spawning areas.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the declining trend for <b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> the states of Alabama, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Virginia and North Carolina have instituted moratoriums on taking and possession.|$|E
50|$|The fish {{targeted}} for upstream passage at the Rahway River Water Supply Dam are alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), white perch (Morone Americana) and the endangered American eel (Anguilla rostrate). Alewife and blueback herring are collectively {{referred to as}} <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> due to their similarity in appearance, range, and life histories. <b>River</b> <b>herring,</b> gizzard shad, and white perch are all anadromous (adults spawn in freshwater; juveniles migrate to saltwater); whereas American eel are catadromous (adults spawn in the ocean; the young migrate to freshwater habitats).|$|E
50|$|The shads are pelagic (open water) {{schooling}} fish, {{of which}} many are anadromous or even landlocked. Several species are of commercial importance, e.g. in the genus Alosa (<b>river</b> <b>herrings),</b> Brevoortia (menhadens), and Hilsa.|$|R
50|$|Some fish, such as pineconefish, are {{completely}} or partially covered in scutes. <b>River</b> <b>herrings</b> and threadfins have an abdominal row of scutes, which are scales with raised, sharp points {{that are used}} for protection. Some jacks have a row of scutes following the lateral line on either side.|$|R
50|$|Alosa is a genus of fish, the <b>river</b> <b>herrings,</b> in {{the family}} Clupeidae. Along with other genera in the {{subgenus}} Alosinae, they are generally known as shads. They are distinct from other herrings by having a deeper body and spawning in rivers. Several species {{can be found on}} both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Also, several taxa occur in the brackish-water Caspian Sea and the Black Sea basin. Many are found in fresh water during spawning and some are only found in landlocked fresh water.|$|R
50|$|The toothed <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> or Papuan river sprat (Clupeoides papuensis) is {{a species}} of fish in the Clupeidae family. It is found in West Papua in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|Fishing is {{a popular}} {{activity}} along the Chickahominy, both above and below Walker's Dam. Among the most populated are blue catfish, largemouth bass, <b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> striped bass, shad, bowfin and yellow perch.|$|E
50|$|The brook led to {{upstream}} spawning grounds for <b>river</b> <b>herring.</b> It also attracted eels and fresh water fowl. Squanto, an Indian interpreter, taught the colonists {{to use the}} fish to fertilize their corn crop. The first corn mill was built along the brook.|$|E
2500|$|Over 130 {{species of}} fish {{including}} bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas), rays, cobblers (Cnidoglanis macrocephalus, also known as Swan <b>River</b> catfish), <b>herring</b> (Elops machnata), pilchard (Sardinops neopilchardus), bream (Kyphosus sydneyanus), flatheads, leatherjackets and blowfish (Tetraodontidae) ...|$|R
50|$|Carthage Central High School {{is located}} on a 123 acre site in a rural {{geographic}} area of northern New York State, 40 miles from the Canada-United States border, six miles south of Fort Drum, 15 miles east of Watertown, and 90 miles northeast of Syracuse. The high school serves the villages of Carthage, West Carthage, Black River, Great Bend, Felts Mills, Deferiet, Deer <b>River,</b> <b>Herrings</b> and Natural Bridge along with {{a portion of the}} housing at the Fort Drum Army base. The population within this area is approximately 22,000. The high school is on Route 26, one-half mile east from the intersection of Route 26 & Route 126 in West Carthage and serves an area of about 260 square miles. It maintains a population of about 950 for grades 9-12.|$|R
40|$|Captures {{of adult}} Atlantic salmon were predictably low during this project period. The {{predicted}} {{returns to the}} Connecticut River {{were based on the}} quality and quantity of salmon smolts released in 1980. High losses of young salmon at the Pittsford National Fish Hatchery in 1979, attributed to a virulent strain of furunculosis, affected the two year classes yielding the 1980 and 1981 smolt releases. As a result low adult salmon returns to the Connecticut River system are also predicted for 1983. With the experience of the previous year 2 ̆ 7 s operation, the Adult Salmon Holding Station was operated under a more efficient regime resulting in decreased mortalities. One major contributing factor appears to be the development of a vaccine by Wildlife Vaccines of Wheatridge, Colorado which immunizes against furunculosis. Treatment procedures for control of other stress factors may have been timely because capabilities have been developed to identify and treat specific problems. Use of the fish passage facilities by other species of anadromous fishes has continued to be documented. The increase in American shad using the Rainbow Fishway resulted in numbers comparable to the first years of fishway operation. <b>River</b> <b>herrings</b> have been reluctant to pass through the Rainbow Fishway but have been utilizing the Leesville Fishway to some extent...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{although}} the river has historically supported large <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> runs, the fish have greatly declined since the mid-1970s. This {{may be caused}} by rapid urbanization and by dam construction. Efforts are now underway to restore herring runs to the river.|$|E
50|$|This {{river is}} a {{significant}} clam fishery. Some of the migratory fishes in the river include alewives, blueback herring (together called <b>river</b> <b>herring),</b> American eels (the juveniles called elvers or glass eels), rainbow smelt and striped bass. Two other notable species are the horseshoe crab and quahog clam.|$|E
50|$|A {{sizeable}} herring run was {{an important}} food source for Weymouth's citizens as documented in town records as early as 1648. At Iron Hill Park off Iron Hill Street, Whitman's Pond was dammed to turn the machines which processed the natural bog iron for the Weymouth Iron Works. Later, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts installed a herring ladder to allow the herring to bypass the dam on their spawning runs. Historically the herring ran to Whitman's Pond, and beyond up Mill River and Swamp River, to Great Pond. <b>River</b> <b>herring</b> commonly refers to two species, Blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis) and alewife ((Alosa pseudoharengus)). Today, 1/2 million <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> and Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) run up the river each year to spawn (although they {{are not able to}} ascend the fish ladders and only utilize the tidal portions of the river).|$|E
50|$|The Agawam River {{originates}} at Halfway Pond, {{east of the}} Myles Standish State Forest in Plymouth, flows southwest through Glen Charlie Pond and East Wareham, and drains {{into the}} Wareham River {{near the center of}} Wareham. As the estuary's major contributor of nutrients and fresh water, the Agawam {{was one of the most}} important <b>herring</b> <b>rivers</b> in Massachusetts. Its herring runs have been operated by European settlers since 1632 and were officially established as a managed run in 1832.|$|R
50|$|After {{the time}} of Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde and Archbishop of Lund, peace {{was brought to the}} area in the 11th century, fishing {{families}} settled {{at the mouth of the}} <b>river</b> Vassa as <b>herring</b> fishing became the main source of trade. Ystad was not mentioned in documents until 1244, in a record of King Eric's visit to the town with his brother, Abel. A Franciscan monastery, Gråbrödraklostret, was founded in 1267, and Ystad joined the Hanseatic League in the 14th century.|$|R
60|$|But, {{in other}} cases, rot and mildew and dead {{citizens}} formed the uppermost scent, while, infused into it in a dreamy way {{not at all}} displeasing, was the staple character of the neighbourhood. In the churches about Mark-lane, for example, there was a dry whiff of wheat; and I accidentally struck an airy sample of barley out of an aged hassock in one of them. From Rood-lane to Tower-street, and thereabouts, there was often a subtle flavour of wine: sometimes, of tea. One church near Mincing-lane smelt like a druggist's drawer. Behind the Monument the service had a flavour of damaged oranges, which, a little further down towards the <b>river,</b> tempered into <b>herrings,</b> and gradually toned into a cosmopolitan blast of fish. In one church, the exact counterpart {{of the church in}} the Rake's Progress where the hero is being married to the horrible old lady, there was no speciality of atmosphere, until the organ shook a perfume of hides all over us from some adjacent warehouse.|$|R
50|$|The {{river was}} a key aspect of colonial Braintree for its <b>river</b> <b>herring.</b> Later its strong flow was useful for early {{industry}} such as grist mills. It has remained a relatively clean river to date, with wildlife including birds, turtles, muskrats and fish, but recently has not been polluted by sediments from the Graziano Inc. concrete batching operation.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{conservationist}} {{concerns over}} fish numbers, the area immediately below the dam {{is a popular}} fishing location for breeds such as white perch, American shad, <b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> and in season, striped bass, also known as [...] "stripers", as the area has a larger concentration of fish due to the dam and an easily accessible shoreline for both boaters and shoreside anglers.|$|E
50|$|In {{fisheries}} management, stock {{refers to}} a harvested or managed unit of a fish. Typically stocks are divided based on geographical location and not based on individual population. Spanish mackerel are distributed from Maine to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. They are divided into two stocks, based on whether they migrate northward along the eastern United States coast or if they migrate into the Gulf of Mexico. Each stock of Spanish mackerel does not represent discrete populations. Stocks are not always composed of a single species. Stocks can be composed of multiple species due to their being harvested together or {{as a form of}} convenience for managers. An example of a multispecies stock is <b>river</b> <b>herring.</b> Alewives and blueback herring are labeled as <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> for management purposes due to their similar physical appearances and being harvested together. Individuals within a stock are subdivided into cohorts. A cohort is a group of fish born in the same year within a population or stock.|$|E
50|$|The {{creation}} of Hinge Park and Habitat Island has incorporated freshwater wetlands, rocky inter-tidal zones, and shoreline forest habitats into the dense urban environment of Olympic Village. These novel habitats have promoted biodiversity {{by becoming a}} unique gathering spot for wildlife. Wildlife sightings in Hinge Park and Habitat Island include coyotes, <b>river</b> otters, raccoons, <b>herring,</b> beavers, and several species of waterfowl. Earlier in April 2013, a pair of beavers were first sighted in Hinge Park and have made the stormwater-fed wetland their home. Since establishing a local lodge in January 2015, the pair of beavers have quickly gained popularity over social media and is loved by many locals in the community. Since July 2016, up to three baby beaver kits have been spotted living with their parents. The urban habitat of Hinge Park is smaller than the usual habitats that beavers occupy, meaning the amount of available resources to allow the beaver population to thrive will be challenging. Currently, {{there are no plans}} to capture, kill, or relocate the beaver family, however trees have been wrapped in wire mesh {{to reduce the number of}} trees taken down by the beavers.|$|R
50|$|Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, {{and rivers}} support diverse {{shellfish}} and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink <b>River</b> supports blueback <b>herring,</b> Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, winter flounder, and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|R
40|$|The Agawam River Project is a river study {{project for}} 8 th grade {{students}} at St. Margaret Regional School {{which is located}} in Buzzards Bay, in Southeastern Massachusetts. The mouth of the Agawam River where the river converges with the Wankinco River and the Wareham River in Wareham, is located approximately 5 km from the school. The headwaters of the river where the water overflows from Halfway Pond in Plymouth, is approximately 15 to 20 km away from the school. The river, ultimately as an estuary system, flows into the Buzzards Bay Watershed. Here, the fresh water of the three converging rivers mixes with the salt water of Buzzards Bay influenced by tides. Over the past 10 years, ten 8 th grade classes have collected samples and studied the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the Agawam River. The total number of participants is approximately 200 students. The data collected has been compiled into books depicting each year. This project has been showcased at the Barnstable County Fair, Americorps Environmental Exhibits, the Wareham Library, and St. Margaret Regional School. The chemical properties of river data collected have been sampled by sophisticated equipment, such as the HydroLab and Sigma, and by student collection using hands on Hach kits and turbidity tubes. Both methods have been valid systems of measurement when compared to one another over the years. The physical properties of river data collected have been collected by recording observations of the physical surroundings and by using nets and buckets to collect macroinvertebrates. The collection of macroinvertebrates is taken back to the classroom where density population is calculated. Often, the macroinvertebrates are released back into the river. Rare and healthy species are counted, but are not taken from the river. Over the past ten years, the chemical properties of our river study has proved the river to be a stable system. Nitrogen levels have been stable, turbidity is healthy, phosphorus levels are normal, and dissolved oxygen and temperature is consistent. One year, we found a high level of phosphorus, and when we investigated we found out that Wareham 2 ̆ 7 s Water Pollution Control Facility {{was in the process of}} upgrading the Facility to a Phosphorus and Nitrogen Removal Upgrade. The collection of macroinvertebrates often varies from year to year, depending on river flow, temperatures, anaerobic or aerobic soil, and influx of runoff. One year, we did find a higher amount of tolerant macroinvertebrates. We concluded that the surrounding soil was anaerobic, due to suffocation of the soil in an area of a tightly rooted river bank in orange colored soil, which most likely was iron. The physical surroundings of our study system has been changed over the past five years, due to a project by the DEP to barrier and control the flow of the water from the surrounding ponds into the river. We have observed that this has improved an area of extreme anaerobic soil to a faster flow which is helping the dissolved oxygen levels in this particular area. The students have researched the historical data of the river and have learned that Daniel Webster fished at this river and they have observed the ruins of a rolling mill. Agawam means 2 ̆ 2 a place where fish are caught 2 ̆ 2 from the Agawam tribes in the 1600 s. Fish ladders exist along the <b>river</b> for the <b>herring</b> to still find their way to Halfway Pond to spawn...|$|R
50|$|Another fish is the alewife and its cousin, the blueback herring, collectively {{known as}} <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> or simply herring. Both migrate {{from the ocean}} into the fresh water of the Malden River every spring to spawn. Striped bass, a prized {{saltwater}} fish, also {{come in from the}} ocean to spawn and prey on the herring. Other fish, like bluegill, largemouth bass, and catfish, are less common.|$|E
50|$|Even today, {{it remains}} one of the few managed herring runs in Massachusetts, {{although}} few fish reach the river's spawning and nursery habitat. It includes 570 acre of water bodies that could serve as habitat to alewife, blueback herring, and American shad. Approximately 36% of this habitat is in Halfway Pond. Fishway retrofit projects aim to restore <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> population to historic levels, perhaps as many as 100,000+ fish annually.|$|E
5000|$|Sport {{fishing for}} {{flathead}} catfish using either rod and reel, limb lines, or bare hands (noodling) {{can be an}} exciting pastime. Anglers target this species {{in a variety of}} waterways, including small rivers (barely large enough for a canoe), large rivers (such as the Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, and Colorado Rivers), and reservoirs. A common element of flathead catfish location is submerged wood cover such as logs and rootwads which often collect at bends in rivers. A good flathead spot usually also includes relatively deep water compared to the rest of a particular section of river, a moderate amount of current, and access to plentiful baitfish such as <b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> shad, carp, drum, panfish, or suckers. Anglers targeting large flathead catfish usually use stout tackle such as medium-heavy or heavy action rods from 6 - 10 ft in length with large line-capacity reels and line ranging from 20 - 80 lbf N test breaking strength. Generally large live baits are preferred such as <b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> shad, sunfish (such as bluegill), suckers, carp, goldfish, drum, and bullheads ranging from 5 - 12 in in length.|$|E
50|$|The Watertown Dam is {{the second}} of {{numerous}} dams located {{along the length of}} the Charles River. The current earthen dam creates an obstacle for the <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> that run in the spring, but herring have long been harvested at this site. The Pequossette (one of the tribes of the Massachusett people) inserted stakes into the river then interwove brushwood to create a weir that would trap the herring as the tide went out.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the National Park Service {{finished}} {{a project to}} remove or bypass eight fish barriers in the creek by adding a fish ladder to bypass the 1905 Peirce Mill Dam, modifying historic fords, and removing abandoned sewage lines and fords. The effort is designed to restore American shad, <b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> and other migratory fish to the creek and their historic upriver spawning grounds. An estimated two million fish migrate up the creek each year.|$|E
50|$|Though the {{population}} of striped bass was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that {{the rapid growth of}} the striped bass population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (<b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> shad, and blueback herring). This pressure on their food source was putting their own population at risk due to {{the population}} of prey naturally not coming back to the same spawning areas.|$|E
50|$|The river {{drainage}} from Monponsett to Stump Brook to the Satucket {{formed a}} very important water way link of transportation for the Wampanoag’s. It {{was part of the}} historic Wampanoag Canoe Passage and was utilized for years."Satucket River and Robbins Pond <b>River</b> <b>Herring</b> Habitat Assessment". By traveling up the Taunton River from Mount Hope Bay they could cross over up the Satucket to the North River watershed into Massachusetts Bay. Later in the early 1900s the river served as {{an important role in the}} economy of the town and the Carver Cotton Gin Mill.|$|E
50|$|The {{shoreline}} of the Lamprey River, its floodplain and its wetlands {{provide a}} wide range of valuable wildlife habitats. Its anadromous fishery is one of the strongest in the Great Bay watershed. Anadromous fish species that use the Lamprey River include shad, <b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> smelt and even Atlantic salmon. These fish are hatched in the river, then spend most of their lives out at sea, returning to the river to spawn. The fish species will move up the river as far as Durham, where they are prevented from moving further upstream by Wiswall Dam.|$|E
5000|$|Native Americans {{called it}} the Musketaquid or [...] "grass-grown" [...] river, because its {{sluggish}} waters abound in aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation and its banks are fringed with wild grasses and sedges which stretch for miles along {{both sides of this}} placid stream. [...] This creates a good environment for a variety of fish, including Bass, Shad, and Alewife (<b>River</b> <b>Herring),</b> Pickerel, Carp, and American eel. [...] Native Americans wove sticks in intricate designs to trap Alewives and other migrating fish at the mouths of rivers throughout this region.|$|E
5000|$|The dark, tannin stained {{waters of}} the Blackwater River host runs of striped bass, <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> (alewives and blueback), American and hickory shad in the spring. Angling for redbreast sunfish ("red throats" [...] or [...] "red robins") is also quite good in the spring. The river also hosts largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, flier, and chain {{pickerel}} populations. Bowfin and gar are common in the lower main stem. Angling for bowfin provides {{a great opportunity to}} catch many hard-fighting fish in a short amount of time. The possibility also exists to land a trophy bowfin over ten pounds.|$|E
50|$|In 1837, the Edwards Dam {{was built}} across the Kennebec River, {{just shy of}} the limit of tidal influence. Made of timber and concrete, it {{extended}} 917 ft across the river and 25 ft high. Its reservoir stretched 17 mi upstream, and covered 1143 acre. Immediately after its construction, the population of spawning fish, including but not limited to, Atlantic salmon, <b>river</b> <b>herring,</b> striped bass and sturgeon, plummeted. The local fishing industry was the most heavily hit, and completely disappeared by 1867, 30 years after the construction of Edwards Dam. A series of fish ladders intended to help fish migrate past dams was installed, but were useless causing the anadromous fish population to practically vanish.|$|E
50|$|The river {{formed as}} the last glacier retreated from New England about 12,000 years ago, when glacial melting {{increased}} the sea level and low - lying coastal areas were flooded. Its <b>river</b> <b>herring</b> runs were {{an important source of}} food to both native and European inhabitants, and it served as the Hingham-Weymouth boundary as early as 1635. Various industries have used the river, including a steel mill, wool factory, and fertilizer factory. During the 20th century, the Army Corps of Engineers conducted two projects on the river, completed in 1912 and 1943. The first created a large channel (12 feet deep, 200 ft wide) from the river mouth to a former fertilizer company wharf, about one mile (1.6 km) upstream. The second deepened the channel to 15 ft.|$|E
