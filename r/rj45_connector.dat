50|$|Most radios with modular {{microphone}} connectors use the 8P8C (vernacular: <b>RJ45)</b> <b>connector,</b> {{but some}} use 6P6C or 4P4C connectors.|$|E
50|$|The RJ45S jack {{must not}} be {{confused}} with the 8P8C eight-pin modular connector. The latter is often incorrectly called <b>RJ45</b> <b>connector</b> in several fields such as telecommunications and computer networking but it lacks the extra tab. Besides, its pin-out involves some particular schematics as just mentioned.|$|E
5000|$|The Catalyst 3032: a {{layer 2 switch}} with 16 {{internal}} and 4 external 1Gb Ethernet interfaces with an option to extend to 8 external 1Gb interfaces. The built-in external ports are 10/100/1000 BaseT copper interfaces with an <b>RJ45</b> <b>connector</b> and up to 4 additional 1Gb ports can be added using the extension module slots that each offer 2 SFP slots for fiber-optic or Twinax 1Gb links. The Catalyst 3032 doesn't offer stacking (virtual blade switching) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} specifies how {{to connect}} eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling, such as Category 3 and Category 6 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP), to 8P8C eight-pin modular connectors (often incorrectly called <b>RJ45</b> <b>connectors).</b>|$|R
50|$|In later {{implementations}} of Token Ring, Cat 6 cabling {{was also}} supported, so <b>RJ45</b> <b>connectors</b> were used {{on both of}} the MAUs, CAUs and NICs; {{with many of the}} network cards supporting both RJ45 and DE-9 for backwards compatibility.|$|R
50|$|Cable types, {{connector}} {{types and}} cabling topologies {{are defined by}} TIA/EIA-568-B. Nearly always, 8P8C modular connectors (often referred to as <b>RJ45</b> <b>connectors)</b> are used for connecting category 5 cable. The cable is terminated in either the T568A scheme or the T568B scheme. The two schemes work equally well and may be mixed in an installation {{so long as the}} same scheme is used on both ends of each cable.|$|R
5000|$|The Compaq Presario R3000 Line is a Series of laptops {{designed}} and built by Hewlett-Packard Corporation. They could be shipped with Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, ME, or XP. The series used Intel or AMD Processors, could have 256 MB (256 MiB) or 512 MB of RAM (Some of this was reserved for the Graphics Card), and had an ATI Mobility Radeon 9000/9100 IGP (Integrated Graphics Processor) [...] "on board". The sound card was made by Analog Devices, and was also [...] "on board". Some of the ports on the computer are USB, IEEE 1394 (Firewire), Headphone Out, Microphone In, S-Video Out, Monitor Out, and Parallel. It also has a <b>RJ45</b> <b>Connector</b> (Network cable) and a Phone line jack. One that is special to this series is an Expansion Port for HP's Expansion Dock. This type of port is found in some of HP's other Notebooks. Some models in the series have Broadcom WiFi adapters.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the boards}} have USB and <b>RJ45</b> Ethernet <b>connectors,</b> SD and other card slots, and some also have SATA ports.|$|R
5000|$|This {{family has}} 144-pin STM32 ICs, Arduino Uno Rev3 female headers, ST Zio female headers, ST morpho male pin headers (two 19x2), second Micro-AB USB <b>connector,</b> and <b>RJ45</b> Ethernet <b>connector</b> (some boards).|$|R
5000|$|Cabling is {{generally}} IBM [...] "Type-1", a heavy two-pair 150 Ohm {{shielded twisted pair}} cable. This was the basic cable for the [...] "IBM Cabling System", a structured cabling system that IBM hoped would be widely adopted. Unique hermaphroditic connectors, {{commonly referred to as}} IBM Data Connectors in formal writing or colloquially as Boy George connectors were used. The connectors have the disadvantage of being quite bulky, requiring at least 3 x 3 cm panel space, and being relatively fragile. The advantages of the connectors being that they are genderless and have superior shielding over standard unshielded <b>RJ45.</b> <b>Connectors</b> at the computer were usually DE-9 female.|$|R
5000|$|MT-RJ (Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack) uses a {{form factor}} and latch {{similar to the}} 8P8C (<b>RJ45)</b> <b>connectors.</b> Two {{separate}} fibers are included in one unified connector. It is easier to terminate and install than ST or SC connectors. The smaller size allows twice the port density on a face plate than ST or SC connectors do. The MT-RJ connector was designed by AMP, but was later standardized as FOCIS 12 (Fiber Optic Connector Intermateability Standards) in EIA/TIA-604-12. There are two variations: pinned and no-pin. The pinned variety, which has two small stainless steel guide pins {{on the face of}} the connector, is used in patch panels to mate with the no-pin connectors on MT-RJ patch cords.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "registered jack" [...] in RJ11, <b>RJ45</b> {{and similar}} <b>connectors,</b> and {{includes}} the modular jacks used in modern telephone systems and computer network interfaces (for example, [...] "Ethernet jack").|$|R
5000|$|It {{is based}} on RS232 Serial {{communications}} at 9600 bit/s, 8N1, no flow control typically though a DE-9 connector, but can also be on 8-Pin DIN, <b>RJ45</b> and RJ11 <b>connectors</b> use in daisy chain configurations.|$|R
50|$|The GG45 (where GG {{stands for}} GigaGate, and 45 is {{to remind the}} {{backward}} compatibility with the 8P8C modular connector - often colloquially called <b>RJ45)</b> is a <b>connector</b> for high-speed Category 7 cable (generally known as Cat 7) LAN cabling developed by Nexans.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 a new {{standard}} for cabled applications was released called HDBaseT a consumer electronic (CE) and commercial connectivity technology for transmission of uncompressed high-definition video (HD), audio, power, home networking, Ethernet, USB, and some control signals, over a common category (Cat5e or above) cable with a standard <b>connector</b> (<b>RJ45).</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} card form factors: Type I, Type II, and Type III cards. The card {{connector}} used {{for each type}} include: Type I and II use a 100-pin stacking connector, while Type III uses a 124-pin edge connector, i.e. the connector for Types I and II differs from that for Type III, where the connector is {{on the edge of}} a card, like with a SO-DIMM. The additional 24 pins provide the extra signals required to route I/O back through the system connector (audio, AC-Link, LAN, phone-line interface). Type II cards have RJ11 and <b>RJ45</b> mounted <b>connectors.</b> These cards must be located at the edge of the computer or docking station so that the RJ11 and RJ45 ports can be mounted for external access.|$|R
