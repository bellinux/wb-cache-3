5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy <b>raiding</b> {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the <b>raiding</b> while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E

5000|$|Nested <b>RAID</b> {{levels are}} usually {{numbered}} using {{a series of}} numbers, where {{the most commonly used}} levels use two numbers. The first number in the numeric designation denotes the lowest <b>RAID</b> level in the [...] "stack", while the rightmost one denotes the highest layered <b>RAID</b> level; for example, <b>RAID</b> 50 layers the data striping of <b>RAID</b> 0 on top of the distributed parity of <b>RAID</b> 5. Nested <b>RAID</b> levels include <b>RAID</b> 01, <b>RAID</b> 10, <b>RAID</b> 100, <b>RAID</b> 50 and <b>RAID</b> 60, which all combine data striping with other <b>RAID</b> techniques; {{as a result of the}} layering scheme, <b>RAID</b> 01 and <b>RAID</b> 10 represent significantly different nested <b>RAID</b> levels.|$|R
50|$|Intel Matrix <b>RAID</b> {{is not a}} new <b>RAID</b> level. It allows {{different}} areas (e.g. partitions or logical volumes) on the same disk to be assigned to different <b>RAID</b> devices, unlike some other <b>RAID</b> controllers. The ICH10R supports <b>RAID</b> 0, <b>RAID</b> 1, <b>RAID</b> 10, and <b>RAID</b> 5.|$|R
5000|$|Linux's md {{supports}} <b>RAID</b> 0, <b>RAID</b> 1, <b>RAID</b> 4, <b>RAID</b> 5, <b>RAID</b> 6, and all nestings. Certain reshaping/resizing/expanding {{operations are}} also supported.|$|R
5|$|The Action of 21 October 1794 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} between Great Britain and France {{fought off}} the Breton coast of France during {{the second year of}} the French Revolutionary Wars. French frigates had been <b>raiding</b> British Atlantic trade routes with considerable success since the outbreak of the war, and in response the Admiralty had formed a frigate squadron to patrol the French Channel and Atlantic coasts in search of French raiders. On 13 October 1794, the large, modern and powerful 40-gun French frigate Révolutionnaire under the command of Captain Antoine René Thévenard sailed from Le Havre for a <b>raiding</b> cruise against British trade routes in the Atlantic. Eight days later, while rounding the Breton headland of Ushant about 25– out to sea, Révolutionnaire encountered the British frigate squadron, commanded by Commodore Sir Edward Pellew, which had secured a number of victories over French <b>raiding</b> frigates during the previous two years.|$|E
5|$|The Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) was a {{reconnaissance}} and <b>raiding</b> {{unit of the}} British Army {{during the}} Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The Orcs {{enlarged}} {{the portal}} {{until they could}} transport seven warriors, who massacred a Human village. The <b>raiding</b> party brought back samples of good food and fine worksmanship, and a report that the Humans were defenseless. The Orcs' <b>raiding</b> parties grew larger and bolder, until they assaulted Azeroth's principal castle. However, the Humans had been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, heavily armed Knights. These, assisted by Human Sorcerers, gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal, which the Humans had not discovered.|$|E
5000|$|<b>RAID</b> 100, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} <b>RAID</b> 10+0, is a stripe of <b>RAID</b> 10s. This is logically {{equivalent to a}} wider <b>RAID</b> 10 array, but is generally implemented using software <b>RAID</b> 0 over hardware <b>RAID</b> 10. Being [...] "striped two ways", <b>RAID</b> 100 {{is described as a}} [...] "plaid RAID".|$|R
50|$|<b>RAID</b> 10, {{also called}} <b>RAID</b> 1+0 and {{sometimes}} <b>RAID</b> 1&0, {{is similar to}} <b>RAID</b> 01 with an exception that two used standard <b>RAID</b> levels are layered in the opposite order; thus, <b>RAID</b> 10 is a stripe of mirrors.|$|R
50|$|<b>RAID</b> 60, {{also called}} <b>RAID</b> 6+0, {{combines}} the straight block-level striping of <b>RAID</b> 0 with the distributed double parity of <b>RAID</b> 6, {{resulting in a}} <b>RAID</b> 0 array striped across <b>RAID</b> 6 elements. It requires at least eight disks.|$|R
5|$|The <b>raiding</b> {{forces were}} mostly {{provided}} by the British Commandos, but the two largest raids, Operation Gauntlet and Operation Jubilee, drew heavily on Canadian troops. The size of the <b>raiding</b> force depended on the objective. The smallest raid was two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest raid involved over 10,500 men in Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight, but some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted {{over a number of}} days.|$|E
5|$|Trench <b>raiding</b> {{involved}} making small-scale surprise {{attacks on}} enemy positions, {{often in the}} middle of the night for reasons of stealth. All belligerents employed trench <b>raiding</b> as a tactic to harass their enemy and gain intelligence. In the Canadian Corps trench <b>raiding</b> developed into a training and leadership-building mechanism. The size of a raid would normally be anything from a few men to an entire company, or more, depending on the size of the mission. The four months before the April attack saw the Canadian Corps execute no fewer than 55 separate trench raids. Competition between units even developed with units competing for the honour of the greatest number of prisoners captured or most destruction wrought. The policy of aggressive trench <b>raiding</b> was not without its cost. A large-scale trench raid on 13 February 1917, involving 900 men from the 4th Canadian Division, resulted in 150 casualties. An even more ambitious trench raid on 1 March 1917, once again by the 4th Canadian Division, failed and resulted in 637 casualties including two battalion commanders and a number of company commanders killed. This experience did not lessen the extent to which the Canadian Corps employed trench <b>raiding</b> with raids being conducted nightly between 20 March and the opening of the offensive on 9 April, resulting in approximately 1,400 additional Canadian casualties. The Germans operated an active patrolling policy and although not as large and ambitious as those of the Canadian Corps, they also engaged in trench <b>raiding.</b> As an example, a German trench raid launched by 79 men against the 3rd Canadian Division on 15 March 1917 was successful in capturing prisoners and causing damage.|$|E
5|$|After Dieppe the {{headquarters}} staff changed again. Lovat {{was promoted to}} brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth {{and the formation of}} a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller <b>raiding</b> operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a <b>raiding</b> force.|$|E
5000|$|Btrfs {{supports}} <b>RAID</b> 0, <b>RAID</b> 1 and <b>RAID</b> 10 (<b>RAID</b> 5 and 6 {{are under}} development).|$|R
5000|$|<b>RAID</b> 50, {{also called}} <b>RAID</b> 5+0, {{combines}} the straight block-level striping of <b>RAID</b> 0 with the distributed parity of <b>RAID</b> 5. [...] As a <b>RAID</b> 0 array striped across <b>RAID</b> 5 elements, minimal <b>RAID</b> 50 configuration requires six drives. On {{the right is}} an example where three collections of 120 GB <b>RAID</b> 5s are striped together to make 720 GB of total storage space.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>Raid</b> on St. Stephen, Church {{moved on}} to <b>raid</b> other Acadian villages in the <b>Raid</b> on Grand Pré, the <b>Raid</b> on Piziquid, and the <b>Raid</b> on Chignecto.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Allied landings, Morotai was defended by {{approximately}} 500 Japanese soldiers. The main unit was the 2nd Provisional <b>Raiding</b> Unit, which had gradually arrived on the island between 12–19 July 1944, to replace the 32nd Division's battalions when they were withdrawn. The 2nd Provisional <b>Raiding</b> Unit comprised four companies and was manned by Japanese officers and Formosan soldiers. Small elements of several other infantry, military police and support units were also present on the island. The 2nd Provisional <b>Raiding</b> Unit's commander, Major Takenobu Kawashima, deployed the unit in the south-west sector of the island and used the smaller units to establish lookout posts and detachments around Morotai's coastline. The largest of these outposts was on the island's north-east end at Cape Sopi, which consisted of about 100 men. The Japanese force was too small and widely dispersed to be able to mount an effective defense, so the 32nd Division ordered it to build dummy camps and use other deceptions in an attempt to trick the Allies into thinking that Morotai was strongly held.|$|E
5|$|By now the Commandos {{started to}} move away from smaller <b>raiding</b> operations. They were formed into four brigades to {{spearhead}} future Allied landing operations. The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major General Robert Sturges. Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 were used {{in the formation of the}} four Special Service brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale <b>raiding</b> role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.|$|E
5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from <b>raiding</b> the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more <b>raiding</b> Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.|$|E
5000|$|This term is also {{associated}} with <b>RAID</b> levels that perform actual write operations as atomic read-modify-write sequences. [...] Such <b>RAID</b> levels include <b>RAID</b> 4, <b>RAID</b> 5 and <b>RAID</b> 6.|$|R
5000|$|JBOD <b>RAID</b> N+N: With JBOD (just a {{bunch of}} disks), it is {{possible}} to concatenate disks, but also volumes such as <b>RAID</b> sets. With larger drive capacities, write and rebuilding time may increase dramatically (especially, as described above, with <b>RAID</b> 5 and <b>RAID</b> 6). By splitting larger <b>RAID</b> sets into smaller subsets and concatenating them with JBOD, write and rebuilding time may be reduced. If a hardware <b>RAID</b> controller is not capable of nesting JBOD with <b>RAID,</b> then JBOD can be achieved with software <b>RAID</b> in combination with <b>RAID</b> set volumes offered by the hardware <b>RAID</b> controller. There is another advantage in the form of disaster recovery, if a small <b>RAID</b> subset fails, then the data on the other <b>RAID</b> subsets is not lost, reducing restore time.|$|R

5|$|On May 21, 1832, a small <b>raiding</b> party {{made up of}} some {{independent}} minded braves from Keokuk's village or the Fox {{village at}} Dubuque's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present-day Savanna, Illinois on the Plum River. The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated {{by a desire to}} collect needed supplies. When the small <b>raiding</b> party arrived at the settlement they found it practically deserted: only three men were present. Of the six men originally at the settlement, three had left when the <b>raiding</b> party arrived: Blundell was away, Upton was hunting nearby, and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse. Of the three men left at the settlement, Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock, while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse. Pierce heard a dog barking outside and looked up to see a small band of Native Americans creeping along the river's edge. He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse. Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification.|$|E
5000|$|The final array {{is known}} as the top array. When the top array is <b>RAID</b> 0 (such as in <b>RAID</b> 1+0 and <b>RAID</b> 5+0), most vendors omit the [...] "+" [...] (yielding <b>RAID</b> 10 and <b>RAID</b> 50, respectively).|$|R
