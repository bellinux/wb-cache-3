The hardness test results also showed that the Vickers hardness rates will increase by increasing the Ca content in the Mg-Ca alloys which was mainly due to the grain refinement and increment of Mg 2 Ca volume hindering the dislocations movements; According to the corrosion potential values, in-vitro corrosion rate and pH values, it was found out that binary Mg-Ca alloys with greater Ca contents corrodes faster than alloys containing less Ca; thus, increases the pH of the SBF solution and hydrogen evoluted from cathodic reaction more than others, that is predominantly due to grain refinement and increased Mg 2 Ca by adding more Ca.

In addition, it was observed commonly the structure of the material had a change through re-crystallization with increasing temperatures.
