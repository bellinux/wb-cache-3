MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: APACHE II, and <b>Ranson</b> and Imrie <b>scores,</b> and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. The Balthazar-Ranson criteria were used for scoring of computed tomograms (CT). RESULTS: 27 of the 50 patients were male. The median age of the whole series was 60 years (range 19 - 85). The estimated incidence was 32 / 100000 for the first attack of acute pancreatitis. The causes were; gallstones 21 (42 %), alcohol 16 (32 %), miscellaneous 12 (24 %), and idiopathic 1 (2 %). 15 (33 %) of the patients had APACHE II scores > or = 9, 17 (38 %) had <b>Ranson</b> <b>scores</b> of > or = 3, 23 (50 %) had Imrie scores of > or = 3, and 16 (34 %) had CRP concentrations over 210 mg/L during the first 4 days or > 120 mg/L during the first week.

40|$|Respiratory {{failure in}} acute {{pancreatitis}} {{is one of}} the prognostic factors for mortality and can lead to death {{in the first week of}} treatment. Therefore, much attention has been devoted to the respiratory complications of this condition. The most common pleuropulmonary complications of acute pancreatitis are inflammatory response syndrome, atelectasis, alveolar consolidation, and diaphragmatic dysfunction. (1, 2) Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) is an advance in intensive care in specific cases of acute respiratory failure, such as in COPD exacerbation and in cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To re-assess {{the value}} of CT and {{clinical}} criteria as prognostic and severity indicators in acute pancreatitis and the correlation between them. METHODS: Sixty-five cases with acute pancreatitis (AP) {{were included in the}} study. The hospitalization days, fevering days and overall complications were regarded as clinical endpoints for the patient group. CT criteria used for AP evaluation included Balthazar's plain CT scan score, CT severity index (CTSI) and London's pancreatic size index (PSI) score. Clinical criteria was <b>Ranson</b> <b>score.</b> The correlations between each criterion and the clinical endpoints, and the relation between CT and clinical criteria were analyzed. The power of each criterion and combination of CT and clinical criteria in predicting overall complications of AP were assessed and compared by using a receiver operative characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The mean scores of PSI, Ranson among the three groups classified according to overall complications were significantly different. Except Balthazar's plain CT scan criterion, each criterion's mean score in-groups with local complications was significantly higher than that in-group without. The overall complications were significantly more in severe group than that in mild group classified according to each criterion except plain CT scan criterion. Mean days of hospital stay and fevering were significantly longer in severe group with <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> than that in mild group. PSI and <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> had a linear correlation with fevering days, and <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> had a linear correlation with hospitalization days. In CT criteria, only PSI had a linear correlation with <b>Ranson</b> <b>score.</b> The findings of plain CT scan was found to be some laggard compared with that of clinic. ROC analysis showed the largest A(Z) of <b>Ranson</b> <b>score,</b> and there was no A(Z) increase when CT criteria were added to clinical criteria. CONCLUSION: The predictive values of Ranson and PSI score in AP patients are superior to that of other criteria. CT criteria are superior to clinical criterion in predicting local complications, and short-term CT follow-up examination is important in the evaluation of AP. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{clinical}} features of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in aged patients, {{and to explore}} the measures of its diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The clinical data of 100 aged patients (55 - 85 years old) with SAP admitted from January 2003 to December 2005 were reviewed and {{compared with those of}} 221 non-aged SAP patients (11 - 54 years old) admitted at the same period. Results: Totally 112 times of onset occurred in 100 aged patients, and the main causes for senile SAP were biliary diseases and hyperlipemia. Both acute physiology and chronic health evaluation Ⅱ(APACHEⅡ) and <b>Ranson</b> <b>scores</b> of the aged patients with SAP were higher than those of the control group (P＜ 0. 05); while {{there was no significant difference}} in Balthazar score between the two groups(P＞ 0. 05).

Methods: One hundred and four patients with hyperlipoidemia-related SAP {{were divided into}} two groups: early group (admitted to hospital within 3 days after onset) and late group (admitted to hospital from 3 days to 7 days after onset). There were 52 cases in each group. All the patients were treated by Yihuo Qingxia method. Results: There were no statistical differences in 48 -hour <b>Ranson</b> <b>scores,</b> CT scores, 24 -hour acute physiology and chronic heath evaluationⅡ scores (APACHE Ⅱ scores), and the levels of 24 -hour serum triglyceride (TG) and serum glucose in the two groups (P> 0. 05). At the 10 th day after onset, the serum TG level in early group was lower than that in late group (P< 0. 01). The incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, hepatic inadequacy, congestive heart failure, shock, encephalopathy, infection and alimentary tract hemorrhage in early group were higher than those in late group (P< 0. 05). The mortality in early group was lower than that in the late group (P< 0. 05). The length of hospital stay in early group was shorter than that in late group (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Context: Release {{of oxygen}} free {{radicals}} is increased in acute pancreatitis, but whether {{this can be}} used to predict clinical severity is not known. Objective: This study assesses whether plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde (a marker of lipid peroxidation) and superoxide dismutase (an oxygen free radical scavenger) {{can be used to}} predict severity of acute pancreatitis. Patients: Fifty-one patients with acute pancreatitis and two control groups were recruited. Main outcome measures: Plasma levels of malondialdehyde and erythrocyte content of superoxide dismutase were measured at 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after admission. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II, Glasgow and <b>Ranson</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated. Acute pancreatitis severity was defined by Atlanta criteria. Premorbid antioxidant intake was assessed by dietary questionnaire. Results Levels: of malondialdehyde were raised in acute pancreatitis patients and increased in patients with severe compared with mild acute pancreatitis; 12 hours after admission plasma malondialdehyde was 4. 42 ± 0. 54 µmol/L and 2. 95 ± 0. 24 µmol/L in severe and mild pancreatitis, respectively (mean±SEM; P= 0. 007). Plasma malondialdehyde greater than 2. 75 µmol/L at 12 hours after admission had high overall accuracy for predicting severe acute pancreatitis. Superoxide dismutase levels were found to decrease in acute pancreatitis but no substantial significant difference was demonstrated between severe and mild acute pancreatitis patients. There was no difference in pre-morbid antioxidant dietary intake between the mild and severe pancreatitis groups. Conclusion: Plasma malondialdehyde may be a helpful additional marker of severity in the very early stages of acute pancreatitis. <br/...|$|R

Aims: (1) the staging of acute pancreatitis by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, (2) the correlation of computed tomography and magnetic resonance severity indices and 3) the correlation of magnetic resonance severity index with C-reactive protein, <b>Ranson</b> <b>score,</b> duration of hospitalization and clinical outcome. Patients: Thirty-five patients (median age: 64 (27 - 89)) were studied. Twenty-two patients had biliary acute pancreatitis. Methods: The following examinations were conducted: (1) computed tomography 48 h, 7 and 30 days after admission, (2) magnetic resonance imaging 7 and 30 days after admission, (3) C-reactive protein and 4) <b>Ranson</b> <b>score.</b> Clinical outcome was determined on a scale 0 - 3 (0 : remission, 1 : local complications, 2 : systemic complications, 3 : death). Results: Six of 35 patients (17 %) had necrotizing acute pancreatitis. Fifteen of 35 patients (43 %) had severe acute pancreatitis according to Ranson criteria. A significant correlation was noted between magnetic resonance severity index and C-reactive protein (r = 0. 419, p < 0. 005), <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> (r = 0. 431, p < 0. 05), duration of hospitalization (r = 0. 497, p < 0. 01) and clinical outcome (r = 0. 420, p < 0. 05).

40|$|AIM: To study {{retrospectively}} {{the influence}} of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in patients with early acute pancreatitis (AP) (during the first week after admission) on physiological functions, and the association {{of the presence of}} IAH/ACS and outcome. METHODS: Patients (n = 74) with AP recruited in this study were divided into two groups according to intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) determined by indirect measurement using the transvesical route via Foley bladder catheter during the first week after admission. Patients (n = 44) with IAP ≥ 12 mmHg were assigned in IAH group, and the remaining patients (n = 30) with IAP < 12 mmHg in normal IAP group. For analysis of {{the influence of}} IAH/ACS on organ function and outcome, the physiological parameters and the occurrence of organ dysfunction during intensive care unit (ICU) stay were recorded, as were the incidences of pancreatic infection and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: IAH within the first week after admission was found in 44 patients (59. 46 %). Although the APACHE II scores on admission and the <b>Ranson</b> <b>scores</b> within 48 h after hospitalization were elevated in IAH patients in early stage, they did not show the statistically significant differences from patients with normal IAP within a week after admission (16. 18 ± 3. 90 vs 15. 70 ± 4. 25, P = 0. 616; 3. 70 ± 0. 93 vs 3. 47 ± 0. 94, P = 0. 285, respectively). ACS in early AP was recorded in 20 patients (27. 03 %). During any 24 -h period of the first week after admission, the recorded mean IAP correlated significantly with the Marshall score calculated at the same time interval in IAH group (r = 0. 635, P < 0. 001). Although ACS patients had obvious amelioration in physiological variables within 24 h after decompression, the incidences of pancreatitic infection, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death in the patients with ACS were significantly higher than that in other patients without ACS (pancreatitic infection: 60. 0 % vs 7. 4 %, P < 0. 001; septic shock: 70. 0 % vs 11. 1 %, P < 0. 001; MODS: 90. 0 % vs 31. 5 %, P < 0. 001; mortality: 75. 0 % vs 3. 7 %, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: IAH/ACS is a frequent finding in patients admitted to the ICU because of AP. Patients with IAP at approximately 10 - 12 mmHg and early signs of changes in physiologic variables should be seriously considered for urgent decompression to improve survival...|$|R

30|$|The early {{prediction}} of severity becomes {{a critical issue}} {{in the management of}} AP. When the prediction is accurate, it allows for proper patient stratification with clinical management implications: Patients predicted at risk of developing severe AP will get enhanced hemodynamic support and close monitoring aimed at prompt recognition of local or systemic complications that may require specific treatment. Unfortunately, our ability to identify with high accuracy those severe cases early {{in the course of the}} disease is still unsatisfactory. The current {{prediction of}} severity is mainly based on multifactorial <b>scores</b> (<b>Ranson,</b> Imrie, APACHE-II, BISAP, etc.) [4, 5]. However, some of them are cumbersome to calculate (APACHE-II, Ranson, Imrie) and, most importantly, these scoring systems have a limited accuracy for mortality or persistent organ failure (>  48  h) [5 – 8]. In addition, some reports indicate that these scoring systems are not superior to easier-to-determine biomarkers, such as blood urea nitrogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), hematocrit or creatinine [6]. In this scenario, a blood biomarker with improved accuracy in predicting severe AP (as compared to previously described predictors) would be a step forward toward better early management of patients with severe AP.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{accuracy}} of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomography (CT) in assessing acute pancreatitis (AP) and to explore the correlation between MRI findings and clinical outcome. METHODS: Patients with AP were investigated by contrast-enhanced CT and MRI on admission and 7 and 30 days thereafter. MRI was performed with intravenous secretin and contrast medium. Balthazar's grading system {{was used to measure}} CT and MRI severity indices (CTSI and MRSI, respectively). RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (median age, 47 years; range, 15 - 86) were studied. AP was of biliary etiology in 19 patients (49 %). On admission, AP was assessed clinically as severe in 7 patients (18 %). A strong correlation was demonstrated between CTSI and MRSI on admission and 7 days later. MRSI on admission correlated with the following: the <b>Ranson</b> <b>score,</b> C-reactive protein levels 48 hours after admission, duration of hospitalization, and clinical outcome regarding morbidity, including local and systemic complications. Considering the <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> as the gold standard, MRI detected severe AP with 83 % (58 - 96, 95 % CI) sensitivity, 91 % (68 - 98) specificity vs. 78 % (52 - 93) and 86 % (63 - 96) for CT. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography after i. v. secretin injection showed pancreatic duct leakage in 3 patients (8 %). CONCLUSIONS: MRI is a reliable method of staging AP severity, has predictive value for the prognosis of the disease, and has fewer contraindications than CT. It can also detect pancreatic duct disruption, which may occur early in the course of AP. Comparative StudyEvaluation StudiesJournal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

All the cases were evaluated by abdominal ultrasound exam, computed tomography and severity <b>scores</b> (<b>Ranson</b> and Apache). Also, the patients were treated and monitored {{in the intensive care}} unit. We performed the antibiotic prophylaxy with tienam (500 mg x 4 / day) associated with metronidazole (1 g/ day).

The aim o/ {{this work is}} to valuate the accuracy o/ the prognostic factors actually employed and the results o/ a multidisciplinary treatment o/ the AP. Methods: A consecutive series 0 / 2441 atients affècted by AP (J 68 mild, 76 severe) is analyse. Mean age 64, 4 years (range 17 - 94 years old). As regard as aetiology is con- cerned, 166 are biliary pancreatitis, 42 alcoholic, 27 idio- pathic, 9 iatrogenic.

40|$|Background/Aim: To {{examine the}} {{validity}} of Ranson&#x 2032;s criteria in the prediction {{of the severity of}} acute pancreatitis (as judged by the occurrence of complications) in a high-altitude area of Saudi Arabia with a predominant biliary pancreatitis. Materials and Methods: All consecutive cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) admitted to a tertiary care hospital over a two-and-half-year period were included in this prospective study. Ranson&#x 2032;s criteria (RC) were used to determine the severity of the attack of AP, which was then correlated with the occurrence of complications. The validity of Ranson&#x 2032;s score and that of each of its individual components was estimated. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, new optimum values for these components were calculated and a new modified score was constructed. Results: Seventy-three attacks of AP in 69 patients formed the material of this study. Ranson&#x 2032;s prediction criteria classified 43. 8 &#x 0025; of the attacks as "severe", but only 22 &#x 0025; of those attacks were associated with complications. Calcium level (&# 60; 8 mg/dl) was the only criterion that was significantly associated with complications (Kappa = 0. 32, p 0 = 0. 02). Using ROC curve to determine the optimum cut-off levels for prediction identified only four criteria, which were significantly associated with complications as compared with the original Ranson&#x 2032;s cut-off levels. Those were: a serum glucose value of &# 8805; 160 mg/dl (P < 0. 05), blood urea nitrogen rise of &# 8805; 35 mg/dl (P < 0. 02) and an arterial Po 2 value of &# 8804; 55 mm Hg (P < 0. 01), in addition to calcium value of &# 60; 8 mg/dl (P = 0. 02) as originally set by <b>Ranson.</b> A new <b>scoring</b> system, ranging from 0 to 4, based on these cut-off levels, together with a calcium level of &# 60; 8 mg/dl, could correctly classify the severity of AP.

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{remains a}} disease with high morbidity and mortality. Acute pancreatitis can be subdivided in acute interstitial pancreatitis and necrotising pancreatitis, largely compatible with clinically mild and severe pancreatitis. This diagnosis is {{made on the}} basis of patient history, physical examination, laboratory parameters, contrast CT scan and, occasionally, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Prognosis on admission can be established using a scoring system such as the modified Glasgow score, the <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> and the 'Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation'(APACHE) -II-score. The treatment of acute pancreatitis is primarily conservative. Indications for surgical intervention are: progressive sepsis despite maximum conservative management, an established infection of (peri) pancreatic necrosis, peripancreatic abscess and perforation of stomach, small intestine or colon. The purpose of an operation is to remove necrotic tissue, achieve adequate drainage of the necrotic area or to treat a perforation. The Groningen and Utrecht University Hospitals have collaborated to develop a protocol to standardise the diagnostic approach, management, timing and choice of surgical intervention, as well as to prospectively investigate the effect of such a strategy in patients with acute pancreatitis...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim was {{to study}} the role of {{abdominal}} compartment syndrome and intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) as indipendent predictor factors on outcome and mortality in patients during early phase of acute pancreatitis (AP). Material and Methods: According the IAP 102 patients with medically treated AP were divided: in the first group (N = 32 patients) the IAP was over 12 mmHg, in second group (N = 27 patients) the IAP was over 20 mmHg (ACS), and the third group (N = 43 patients) with normal pressure. There were recorded APACHE 2 score in admission, the incidence of multiorganic dysfunction syndrome and mortality. Results: No statistical significance is observed between three groups regarding age, gender, APACHE II score, <b>Ranson</b> <b>score,</b> CTSI. Kruskal-Wallis test resulted positive for all variables suggesting {{a statistically significant difference}} between groups. The pairwise test for comparison of subgroups according to Conover, yielded a statistically significant difference of ACS (P< 0. 05). ACS group resulted with more early deaths (13 patients) and total deaths (15 patients). Conlusion: The abdominal compartment syndrome and increased intrabdominal pressure occurred during the early fase of AP may be predictors of increased MODS and mortality...|$|E
40|$|Organophosphate {{poisoning}} (OP) {{results in}} various poisoning symptoms {{due to its}} strong inhibitory effect on cholinesterase. One of the occasional complications of OP is pancreatitis. A 62 -year-old woman drank alcohol and went home at midnight. After she quarreled {{with her husband and}} drank 100 ml of malathion, a parasympathomimetic organophosphate that binds irreversibly to cholinesterase, she was transported to our hospital in an ambulance. On admission, activated charcoal, magnesium citrate, and pralidoxime methiodide (PAM) were used for decontamination after gastric lavage. Abdominal computed tomography detected edema of the small intestine and colon with doubtful bowel ischemia, and acute pancreatitis was suspected. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe lactic acidosis. The <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> was 6 and the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) score was 14. Based on these findings, severe acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. One day after admission, hemodiafiltration (HDF) was started for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. On the third hospital day, OP symptoms were exacerbated, with muscarinic manifestations including bradycardia and hypersalivation and decreased plasma cholinesterase activity. Atropine was given and the symptoms improved. The patient’s general condition including hemodynamic status improved. Pancreatitis was attenuated by 5 days of HDF. Ultimately, it took 14 days for acute pancreatitis to improve, and th...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to analyse}} our {{experience}} with a combined approach of postoperative local lavage and on demand surgical intervention {{in the treatment of}} acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Patients and methods: all patients operated on for acute pancreatitis in a tertiary hospital between June 1993 and July 1997 were studied retrospectively. Demographic data, <b>Ranson</b> <b>score,</b> APACHE II score at admission were recorded. Hospital charts and clinical courses were reviewed, Results: Seventeen patients were treated surgically because of end stage multiple organ failure (MOF) (n = 13) or infected necrosis (n = 4). APACHE II and Ranson scores were 26, 2 +/- 9, 25 and 7, 33 +/- 1, 35 respectively. All patients had protracted clinical courses, and required aggressive intensive care therapy. Forty-eight surgical interventions were performed in 17 patients. Early mortality was 36 percent. Complications were numerous, and mostly consisted of intra-abdominal abscesses. Young age (under 55) was associated with significantly better outcome (22 % vs. 87 % mortality, p = 0, 015) Conclusion: Continuous local lavage after surgical debridement, with on demand re-laparotomy, proves to be a valuable approach in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. It appears however, that the role of surgery for acute pancreatitis is limited to patients with infected necrosis or end stage MOF...|$|E
40|$|Norethindrone acetate/ethinyl {{estradiol}} (Estrostep; Warner Chilcott, Rockaway, New Jersey) is an ‘‘estrophasic’ ’ type of oral contraceptive, {{which combines}} a continuous low progestin dose with a gradually increasing estrogen dose. In clinical trials, this medication {{failed to produce}} clinically significant changes in serum lipid levels. We report a case of severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis in a 24 -year-old woman caused by Estrostep, occurring nearly 10 years after she began using the drug. The patient {{was admitted to the}} medical intensive care unit (ICU) for aggressive volume resuscitation and management of severe electrolyte abnormalities. Laboratory studies obtained on admission indicated severe hypertriglyceridemia (2, 200 mg/dL), hypo-natremia (120 mEq/L), and hypocalcemia (0. 78 mmol/L). Amylase and lipase levels were also elevated (193 and 200 U/L, respec-tively). <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> calculated after 48 hours of admission was 4, and her Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score was 35. Treatment included an insulin infusion, o- 3 fatty acid esters, and gemfibrozil.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This phase-I study {{transferred}} {{the concept of}} isovolemic hemodilution, which {{has been proven beneficial}} in the treatment of experimental acute pancreatitis to the patient. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Pancreatic ischemia represents one main mechanism in the pathogenesis of necrotizing pancreatitis. Isovolemic hemodilution with dextran 60 has been shown experimentally to limit the progression of pancreatic necrosis by improving pancreatic microcirculation. METHODS: Thirteen patients with clinically severe nonbiliary pancreatitis and CT-classification E according to Balthazar were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were anemia, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coagulopathies, and secondary referral. The volume of blood to be exchanged for dextran 60 was calculated from a nomogram based on body surface. Isovolemic hemodilution aimed at a hematocrit of 30 %. Independent from the exchange procedure conventional fluid resuscitation was performed to adjust the central venous pressure at 6 +/- 2 mm Hg. RESULTS: Whole blood (750 - 1, 700 mL) was exchanged for dextran 60 during 45 to 70 minutes. No adverse effect was encountered; central hemodynamics were not affected. Considering a mean <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> of 5, mortality was low (7. 7 %). Progression of pancreatic necrosis was registered in only two patients subsequently undergoing surgical treatment (15 %). CONCLUSIONS: Isovolemic hemodilution is practicable in patients. A randomized trial has to prove whether isovolemic hemodilution can substantially alter the course of acute pancreatitis as anticipated from animal studies...|$|E

Methods: SAP patients were randomly divided into treatment group (26 cases included) and control group (28 cases included). In addition to the same protocol of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment for both groups, intravenous drip infusion of 0. 5 g imipenem-cilastatin was administered to the patients {{in the control group}} every eight hours for ten days. The 48 -hour <b>Ranson</b> <b>score,</b> 24 -hour acute physiology and chronic heath evaluation Ⅱ score, and incidence rates of complications were observed. The concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) on days 1, 3, 7 and 10 were measured, and strains of infection were detected with smear and culture examination for bacteria and fungi. Results: There were no statistical differences in demographic information, baseline data and incidence rates of complications between the two groups (P> 0. 05), but fungal infection rate in the control group was higher than that in the treatment group (P 0. 05), but the serum CRP concentrations on days 1, 3, 7 and 10 in infected patients were higher than those in non-infected patients (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01). Conclusion: The study cannot confirm that the incidence rates of secondary infection and mortality in SAP patients treated with integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine are reduced by prophylaxis with imipenem-cilastatin...|$|E
40|$|Background. Multifactorial scorings, {{radiological}} scores, and biochemical markers {{may help}} in early prediction of severity, pancreatic necrosis, and mortality {{in patients with}} acute pancreatitis (AP). Methods. BISAP, APACHE-II, MOSS, and SIRS scores were calculated using data within 24 [*]hrs of admission, whereas Ranson and Glasgow scores after 48 [*]hrs of admission; CTSI was calculated on day 4 whereas IL- 6 and CRP values at end of study. Predictive accuracy of scoring systems, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of various markers in prediction of severe acute pancreatitis, organ failure, pancreatic necrosis, admission to intensive care units and mortality were calculated. Results. Of 72 patients, 31 patients had organ failure and local complication classified as severe acute pancreatitis, 17 had pancreatic necrosis, and 9 died (12. 5 %). Area under curves for Ranson, Glasgow, MOSS, SIRS, APACHE-II, BISAP, CTSI, IL- 6, and CRP in predicting SAP were 0. 85, 0. 75, 0. 73, 0. 73, 0. 88, 0. 80, 0. 90, and 0. 91, respectively, for pancreatic necrosis 0. 70, 0. 64, 0. 61, 0. 61, 0. 68, 0. 61, 0. 75, 0. 86, and 0. 90, respectively, and for mortality 0. 84, 0. 83, 0. 77, 0. 76, 0. 86, 0. 83, 0. 57, 0. 80, and 0. 75, respectively.

40|$|Context An {{uncomplicated}} and easy-to-use {{method of}} pre-estimating {{the severity of}} gallstone pancreatitis shortly after admission was {{required in order to}} direct clinicians for monitoring and/or transferring to a specialized center. Objective To determine the role of brief assessment in pre-estimating the severity of gallstone pancreatitis at admission. Patients Fifty-eight patients with gallstone pancreatitis were consecutively followed regarding the course of complications. Main outcome variables Sensitivity analysis of the Biliary <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> (> 3), the modified Imrie score (> 3), the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score (> 5), white blood cell count (> 14. 5 x 103 /dL), blood urea nitrogen (> 12 mg/dL), random blood sugar (> 150 mg/dL), pulse rate (> 100 beats/min) and combinations of the four brief assessments were compared using the z-test. Two-tailed P values less than 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Results Both the Biliary Ranson score> 3 and the modified Imrie score> 3 had a sensitivity of 96. 4 % and a specificity of 96. 7 %. Both the APACHE-II score> 5 and random blood sugar> 150 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 89. 3 % which is comparable to a Biliary Ranson score> 3 and a modified Imrie score> 3. Conclusion As compared to a Biliary Ranson score> 3, a modified Imrie score> 3 and an APACHE-II score> 5, random blood sugar> 150 mg/dL can be considered as an oversimplified and effective prognostic indicator at admission in patients with gallstone pancreatitis...|$|E
40|$|Th e fi rst case of {{bloodstream}} infection by Pediococcus pentosaceus after {{the administration of}} a symbiotic formula to a critically ill patient is presented. Th e infection was successfully treated with ceftriaxone. Probiotics are increasingly used {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU), mainly for the management of intractable diarrhea. As probiotics are living organisms, one risk following their administration is infection of the host, primarily by Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii [1]. Th is is the fi rst report of a {{bloodstream infection}} by Pediococcus pentosaceus following symbiotic adminis tra tion to a critically ill patient. A 64 -year-old man with severe acute gallstone pan-creatitis was admitted to our ICU; he had an APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score of 35 and a <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> of 7. He stayed in the ICU for 191   days and eventually died of multiorgan failure. During his stay, he developed recurrent intra-abdominal abscesses for which he required both percutaneous drainage and surgical debridement.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the prognostic importance of platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutro - phil-lymphocyte ratio(NLR) combination for patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and its relationship with mortality. Methods: This retrospective study was included 142 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Ranson, Atlanta and BISAP 0 h, 24 h and 48 h scores of the patients were calculated by examining their patient files. The patients were divided into three groups as low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk patients according to their PLR and NLR levels. Results: The number of patients with acute pancreatitis complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis, acute renal failure, sepsis and cholangitis was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to other groups. Mortality rate {{was found to be}} 90 % in the high-risk group, 16 % in the medium-risk group, and 1. 9 % in the low-risk group. The number of patients with a <b>Ranson</b> <b>score</b> of 5 and 6, a severe Atlanta score, a BISAP 0 h score of 3 and 4, a BISAP 24 h and 48 h score of 4 and 5 was higher in the high-risk group compared to other groups. PLR-NLR combination, Atlanta and Ranson scores, and C-reactive protein level were determined to be independent risk factors predicting mortality in stepwise regression model. PLR-NLR combination had the highest area under curve value in terms of predicting acute claspancreatitis prognosis and had a similar diagnostic discrimination with other scoring systems. Conclusion: In our study it was found that PLR-NLR combination had a similar prognostic importance with other scoring systems used to determine acute pancreatitis prognosis...|$|E
