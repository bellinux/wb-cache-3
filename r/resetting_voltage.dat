40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{operation}} of the current transfonner (CT) when sensing retum-to-zero current pulses in power electronic circuitry. The CT's output signal is nonnally rectified when sensing current pulses and the effects of the different rectification techniques on peak current and average current droop are evaluated. Initially, the various current sensing techniques and their application in power electronics circuits are reviewed. The CT and both diode and synchronous rectification are then reviewed in more detail. Operation of the CT with diode rectification (DR) and natural resetting is investigated. Three operating modes are identified. These are the discontinuous magnetizing current, continuous magnetizing current and discontinuous secondary current modes. The error (droop) in the average output signal obtained is found to be predominantly defined by CT core losses. Coefficients are given for correcting the error due to droop, provided that the discontinuous secondary current mode is avoided. Diode rectification with the dual CT arrangement is also investigated. Operation of the CT with synchronous rectification (SR) and natural resetting is then investigated. The SR topologies possible using a discrete MOSFET are categorized. During experimentation the arrangement used to drive the MOSFET's gate is found to be important if distortion is to be minimized. It also is found that the average current droop is dependent on the oscillatory behaviour of the resetting circuit and has an effectively random component. The magnitude of this component is defined by the voltage drop exhibited by the SR MOSFET's intrinsic anti-parallel diode. SR is then implemented using a commercially available analogue switch. The problems detailed {{with the use of a}} discrete MOSFET are largely alleviated. Another benefit is that the increased restriction on maximum duty factor imposed by introducing a discrete MOSFET is also eased. However, whichever SR technique is implemented, an operational amplifier is used and the transient response of this circuit element is important. A method of minimizing droop by indirect sensing of the CT's peak core flux excursion is then presented. A corresponding correcting voltage is applied in series with the CT's output terminals during a current pulse. The magnitude of this voltage is based on the magnitude of the <b>resetting</b> <b>voltage</b> sensed during previous switching cycles. A circuit is implemented and simulated. Experimental results are presented. A switched-mode circuit operating at a frequency higher than that of the main power circuit is then used to apply the correcting voltage with the objective of reducing the power drawn. Again, the circuit is implemented and simulated and experimental results are presented. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

30|$|In summary, we {{have studied}} the reset {{statistics}} of the CBRAM device with a Cu/HfO 2 / Pt structure.

The distributions of the <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> and current observed in different resistance ranges divided by ‘resistance screening method’ are compatible with the Weibull model. The Weibull slopes of <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> and current are constant, independent of the on-state resistance. The scale factors of the <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> increases and that of the reset current decreases with the on-state resistance in linearity, respectively.

30|$|In this letter, we have {{investigated}} the reset statistical characteristics of the conductive bridge random access memory (CBRAM) device based on a Cu/HfO 2 /Pt structure connected to a transistor. The experimental {{results show that the}} <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> increases with on-state resistance and the reset current decreases with it, which can be well explained by the thermal dissolution model. Since the on-state resistance has strong influence on the reset switching parameters, the resistance screening method is employed to decompose the resistance into several ranges. The distributions of the <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> and current studied in different resistance ranges are compatible with the Weibull model. The Weibull slopes of <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> and current {{have nothing to do with}} the on-state resistance. The scale factor of the <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> linearly increases with the on-state resistance while that of the reset current decreases with it in linearity, respectively. These results are all consistent with the thermal dissolution model. Our work is of great significance on the deep understanding of the switching mechanism and the improvement of the uniformity of RRAM devices.|$|R

The model that we propose describes filament resistance measured at low (∼ 0. 1 V) reading voltage in both low-resistance state (LRS) and high-resistance state (HRS). The proposed description confirms that conduction in LRS is ohmic (after forming with a sufficiently high current compliance) and {{is consistent with}} the earlier description of HRS resistance as controlled by a trap-assisted electron transfer via traps in the oxidized portion of the filament. The length of the nonohmic part of the filament is found to be directly proportional to <b>reset</b> <b>voltage.</b> Moreover, low-frequency noise measurements at different <b>reset</b> <b>voltages</b> evidence a tradeoff between HRS resistance and noise in reading conditions...|$|R
30|$|A major {{challenge}} of resistive switching memory (resistive {{random access memory}} (RRAM)) for future application is how to reduce the fluctuation of the resistive switching parameters. In this letter, with a statistical methodology, we have systematically analyzed the reset statistics of the conductive bridge random access memory (CBRAM) with a Cu/HfO 2 /Pt structure which displays bipolar switching property. The experimental observations show that the distributions of the <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> (Vreset) and <b>reset</b> current (Ireset) are greatly influenced by the initial on-state resistance (Ron) which {{is closely related to}} the size of the conductive filament (CF) before the reset process. The <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> increases and the current decreases with the on-state resistance, respectively, according to the scatter plots of the experimental data. Using resistance screening method, the statistical data of the <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> and current are decomposed into several ranges and the distributions of them in each range are analyzed by the Weibull model. Both the Weibull slopes of the <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> and current are demonstrated to be independent of the on-state resistance which indicates that no CF dissolution occurs before the reset point. The scale factor of the <b>reset</b> <b>voltage</b> increases with on-state resistance while that of the reset current decreases with it. These behaviors are fully in consistency with the thermal dissolution model, which gives an insight on the physical mechanism of the reset switching. Our work has provided an inspiration on effectively reducing the variation of the switching parameters of RRAM devices.|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of SET switching time of bipolar switching tantalum oxide thin films is studied using pulse measurement techniques. SET switching times are measured by repeating SET and RESET operations {{in a single}} cell. It is found that the distribution measured with a high <b>RESET</b> <b>voltage</b> can be well described by a steep Weibull distribution with a shape parameter > 1, but lowering the <b>RESET</b> <b>voltage</b> results in a broad distribution at high cumulative frequencies. Statistical analysis shows that this broadening of the distribution {{can be attributed to}} the variation of initial conditions for SET, whereas a steep Weibull distribution points to an aging process leading to SET under a voltage stress. It is also shown that although the power of the leakage current before SET determines the fastest limit of the SET switching speed, those SET in the broadened distributions are delayed due to gradual current increase prior to the SET. The waiting time for the start of the gradual current increase has a correlation with the power of the leakage current, showing that Joule heating effect is still a significant factor in the SET mechanism even if the SET time distribution is broadened due to the variation of initial states programmed by low <b>RESET</b> <b>voltages...</b>|$|R
