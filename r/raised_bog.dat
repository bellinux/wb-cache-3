5|$|The low-lying swampy area of Westhay Moor has had peat {{laid down}} over older rocks {{for the last}} 10,000 years. The Neolithic people lived on the areas of {{slightly}} higher ground but exploited the reed beds for materials and built wooden trackways to cross the <b>raised</b> <b>bog.</b> Peat extraction on the Somerset Levels has occurred since the area was first drained by the Romans. Measures to improve the drainage were {{carried out in the}} Middle Ages largely by Glastonbury Abbey. In the 17th and 18th centuries further drainage work was undertaken including digging a series of rhynes, or ditches and larger drainage canals. Peat extraction peaked in the 1960s but has since declined.|$|E
5|$|Carrington Moss is a lowland <b>raised</b> <b>bog.</b> The area drains slowly, which {{slows the}} {{decomposition}} of plant life {{and leads to}} the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support {{a wide range of}} flora and fauna; Sphagnum balticum, a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), cranberries, bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the Journal of Ecology included English oak (Quercus robur), and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Undergrowth included common hazel (Corylus avellana), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Several species of ground vegetation included creeping soft grass (Holcus mollis), common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), iris (Iris pseudacorus), mad-dog weed (Alisma plantago-aquatica), and cat-o'-nine-tails (Typha latifolia).|$|E
5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, <b>raised</b> <b>bog,</b> lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
40|$|The {{member states}} of the European Community are obliged to monitor the {{development}} of conservation status of natural habitats protected by the Habitats Directive. In Denmark a comprehensive programme on nature monitoring, called NOVANA, was launched in 2004. The monitoring programme is developed by the Danish National Environmental Research Institute (NERI). <b>Raised</b> <b>bogs</b> {{are one of the}} natural habitats included in the programme. This master thesis investigates how the nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is organized in Denmark. Based on raised bogs’ unique ecology, it is assessed whether NERI’s approach to monitor <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is adequate. The thesis focuses on application of methods to monitor vegetation ecology. As a part of this research project, two <b>raised</b> <b>bogs,</b> Skidendam and Holmegårds Mose, have been subjected to nature monitoring during autumn 2004. Similar nature monitoring was conducted in both bogs in 1987 and 1995. In order to examine the development of conservation status of the bogs over the time span, the results from the three sets of data are compared. The thesis takes in theories on ecology of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs,</b> theories on organization of nature monitoring and theories on aggregation of monitoring data. It is concluded that the conservation status of Skidendam is favourable; that the conservation status of Holmegårds Mose is unfavourable. Moreover, it is concluded that NERI’s approach to nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is inadequate. NERI’s approach to nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is based on an insufficient understanding of the special hydrological and morphological structure of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs.</b> This has resulted in the use of inappropriate criteria for favourable conservation status of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs.</b> NERI’s approach to nature monitoring is organized against these criteria. Furthermore, the placement of sample plots to monitor vegetation ecology do not consider the inhomogeneous structure of raised bogs’ vegetation. Hence, the sampling design is unsuitable for <b>raised</b> <b>bogs...</b>|$|R

5|$|The River Brue {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels {{to the east of}} the Polden Hills. It rises in hills near the {{southern}} border of the county, flows through Bruton, where it is joined by the River Pitt, and on through Baltonsborough. The lower reaches have been diverted into a channel that joins the Parrett at Burnham-on-Sea in Bridgwater Bay. There is a <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> in the central Brue valley and the surrounding area is a mosaic of swamps, meres and alder woodland. The River Parrett rises in the hills around Chedington in Dorset and flows northwestwards past Aller, Somerset, and through the Somerset Levels to Bridgwater, after which it becomes an estuary with its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The river has a tidal bore, similar to that in the River Severn. The Somerset Levels are only a few feet above sea level and liable to flooding. They are drained by ditches and channels that drain into the Parrett including the King's Sedgemoor Drain, just south of the Polden Hills.|$|E

The three main extant domes are hydrologically isolated by the River Teifi and associated surface drainage features, and all three have suffered extensive damage as a con{{sequence of}} past drainage and peat-cutting. The river terraces associated with the component bog mesotopes are regularly flooded and support vegetation that includes reed canary-grass Phalaris arundinacea, soft rush Juncus effusus, purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea and, more rarely, water sedge Carex aquatilis. Substantial areas of the surface of each of the three component bogs still retain good quality active <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> vegetation mainly referable to NVC type M18 Sphagnum papillosum – Erica tetralix community, with frequent bog-rosemary Andromeda polifolia and white beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba and, more locally, the bog-mosses Sphagnum magellanicum and S. pulchrum. Extensive areas with a high cover of heather Calluna vulgaris and deergrass Trichophorum cespitosum are also present, while purple moor-grass M. caerulea is particularly prominent on the more modified bog margins. Although present as an important peat-former until as recently as the 18th century, Sphagnum imbricatum is absent from the contemporary bog flora.|$|E
25|$|The reserve {{comprises}} a vast open lowland {{landscape with}} {{a mosaic of}} swamps, moors, lakes, rivers and forests located between the basins of the Bug and Wieprz rivers. The site {{is part of the}} European Ecological Corridor of the Bug River. The location supports bird species including raptors such as lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) and Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) and birds such as aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), marsh sandpiper (Tringa stagnatilis) and Eurasian cranes (Grus grus). The area is considered to be an important crossing point for migratory birds. The north-south flyways and east-west flyways of birds meet in the region. The areas consists of boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests, black alder (Alnus glutinosa) wetland forests, meadows and peatbog (<b>raised</b> <b>bog,</b> transitional bog and fen) ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|The term 'transition mire' {{relates to}} {{vegetation}} that in floristic composition and general ecological characteristics is transitional between acid bog and 7230 Alkaline fens, {{in which the}} surface conditions range from markedly acidic to slightly base-rich. The vegetation normally has intimate mixtures of species considered to be acidophile and others thought of as calciphile or basophile. In some cases the mire occupies a physically transitional location between bog and fen vegetation, as for example on the marginal lagg of <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> or associated with certain valley and basin mires. In other cases these intermediate properties may reflect the actual process of succession, as peat accumulates in groundwater-fed fen or open water to produce rainwater-fed bog isolated from groundwater influence. Many of these systems are very unstable underfoot and can therefore also be described as 'quaking bogs'.|$|E
