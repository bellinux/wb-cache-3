5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) <b>risk</b> <b>assessment,</b> the results of which may {{determine}} what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E

Each school is to undergo a <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> before the implementation of this plan.|$|E

5|$|The process {{requires}} the regulator to directly link a robust <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> to a suggested regulatory response (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment). Regulatory risk differentiation is {{also referred to}} as the Compliance Model in some regulatory agencies.

PAIRS is the Probability And Impact Rating System, while SOARS is the Supervisory Oversight And Response System.|$|E

As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others. Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E
25|$|Ecological <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> aims {{to source}} of {{contamination}} to exposure to a toxicity endpoint. This requires a risk assessor to identify and estimate exposure pathways. Tissue residue is the only approach that inherently accounts for toxicity due to multiple exposure pathways. There is also a need in <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> to understand the bioaccumulation of chemicals4, {{as well as a}} direct estimation of bioavailability. Modeling food web exposure is difficult in <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and requires many assumptions but this uncertainty can be reduced through tissue residue. Tissue residue may also allow provide a link between ecological <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> and human health <b>risk</b> <b>assessment.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 2004, DHSs use of its CBRN <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> to inform its CBRN response plans has varied, from directly influencing information in the plans to not being used at all. DHS guidance states that response planning and resource decisions should be informed by risk information. GAOs analysis showed that DHS used its CBRN <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> to directly inform 2 of 12 CBRN response plans GAO identified because planners considered the <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> to be more accurate than earlier DHS planning assumptions. For another 7 of the 12 plans, DHS officials said that the assessments indirectly informed the plans by providing background information prior to plan development. However, GAO could not independently verify this because DHS officials could not document how the <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> influenced {{the information contained in}} the plans. GAOs analysis found general consistency between the <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> and the plans. For the remaining 3 plans, DHS officials did not use the <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> to inform the plans; for 2 of the 3 plans DHS officials told GAO they were not aware of the assessments. DHS officials also noted that there was no departmental guidance on when or how the CBRN <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> should be used when developing such plans. ...|$|R

However, an opportunity is being missed to combine these <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> to identify generic risks and risk contributors across institutions. The U. S.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether country (Australia or Japan) and client type (public sector or private sector) impact the auditor's client <b>risk</b> <b>assessments,</b> {{subsequent}} audit planning decisions (planned audit hours) and audit planning responsiveness to client <b>risk</b> <b>assessments.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on previously developed audit planning models and uses working paper-sourced data of planned auditor effort and nine client <b>risk</b> <b>assessments.</b> The study samples are taken from public and private sector audit engagements of two major audit firms in Australia and Japan, respectively. Findings – Evidence is found that country and client type do have an impact on the auditor's client <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> and planned total audit hours, but they do not moderate audit planning responsiveness to client <b>risk</b> <b>assessments.</b> Research limitations/implications – The test variable is confounded by the country and client type characteristics inherent in the study's samples. If the differences are caused by country, this suggests that audit planning decisions vary across countries, even when the same auditing standards are adopted. However, if they are caused by client type, this suggests that the same audit approach (i. e. the audit risk model) is applied differently depending on client characteristics. Practical implications – These findings are useful to international standard setters, audit practice quality control and training, and audit research. Originality/value – No prior study has examined the role of country and client type on the auditor's client <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> and audit planning decisions. Further, no prior study has examined whether the relationship between the auditor's client <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> and audit planning decisions is moderated by country and client type.
