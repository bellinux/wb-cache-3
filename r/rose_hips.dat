Chitimacha basket weavers have a complex formula for yellow that employs a dock plant (most likely Rumex crispus) for yellow. Navajo artists create yellow dyes from small snake-weed, brown onion skins, and rubber plant (Parthenium incanum).

Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, Vaccinium and Rubus species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, <b>rose</b> <b>hips</b> and apples predominate outside the breeding season.

Their dinner of Dolly Varden trout, wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and <b>rose</b> <b>hips,</b> along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21.

On the basis of anecdotal reports about the effects of <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> preparations on human health and citations to the same in ancient texts, in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted that have made it possible to learn about some active ingredients in <b>rose</b> <b>hip,</b> as well as how the component compounds might exert their effects. From such studies, it has been documented that there is a great variation in active ingredients when comparing different <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> products. Factors which affect {{the quality and quantity of}} active ingredients in the <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> products include the subspecies of the particular R. canina from which the fruits are harvested, the environment during plant growth, time of harvesting, and the amount of seeds and shells/husks incorporated into the preparation. Studies in animals and in humans are of great importance for determining the true bio-effects of <b>rose</b> <b>hip.</b> Such in vivo studies that have only been performed during the last 2 decades indicate that the treatment of patients with different types of joint disease with <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> powder based on a subspecies of R. canina (Lito) containing a certain galactolipid (GOPO) can alleviate pain, improve daily activity, and even reduce the consumption of regular pain relievers. As several <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> components have been shown to be anti-inflammatory, it is suggested that anti-inflammatory mechanisms might explain some reductions in symptoms associated with administering <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> to arthritic conditions. Although the number of publications of randomized and placebo-controlled clinic studies with <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> is small, the overriding evidence is that the anti-inflammatory effects from administration of <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> preparations containing both shells and seeds are superior to preparations containing shells alone.

Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 300 : E 111 -E 121, 2011. First published October 19, 2010; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpendo. 00268. 2010. -The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the metabolic effects of a dietary supplement of powdered <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> to C 57 BL/ 6 J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Two different study protocols were used; <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> was fed together with HFD to lean mice for 20 wk (prevention study) and to obese mice for 10 wk (intervention study). Parameters related to obesity and glucose tolerance were monitored, and livers were examined for lipids and expression of genes and proteins related to lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. A supplement of <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> was capable of both preventing and reversing the increase in body weight and body fat mass imposed by a HFD in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse. Oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests together with lower basal levels of insulin and glucose showed improved glucose tolerance in mice fed a supplement of <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> compared with control mice. Hepatic lipid accumulation was reduced in mice fed <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> compared with control, and the expression of lipogenic proteins was downregulated, whereas AMP-activated protein kinase and other proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation were unaltered. <b>Rose</b> <b>hip</b> intake lowered total plasma cholesterol as well as the low-density lipoprotein-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio via a mechanism not involving altered gene expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 or 3 -hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Taken together, these data show that a dietary supplement of <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> prevents the development of a diabetic state in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse and that downregulation of the hepatic lipogenic program appears to be at least one mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effect of <b>rose</b> <b>hip...</b>|$|R

Methods: A total of 34 healthy subjects, aged 35 – 65  years, with wrinkles on the face (crow’s-feet) were subjected to a randomized and double-blinded clinical study {{of the effects of the}} <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> powder, as compared to astaxanthin, a well-known remedy against wrinkles. During the 8 -week study, half of the participants ingested the standardized <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> product, while the other half ingested astaxanthin. Objective measurements of facial wrinkles, skin moisture, and elasticity were made by using Visioscan, Corneometer, and Cutometer at the beginning of the study, after 4  weeks, and after 8  weeks. Evaluation of participant satisfaction of both supplements was assessed using questionnaires. In addition, the effect of the <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> preparation on cell longevity was measured in terms of leakage of hemoglobin through red cell membranes (hemolytic index) in blood samples kept in a blood bank for 5  weeks. Significance of all values was attained with P≤ 0. 05. Results: In the double-blinded study, the <b>rose</b> <b>hip</b> group showed statistically significant improvements in crow’s-feet wrinkles (P< 0. 05), skin moisture (P< 0. 05), and elasticity (P< 0. 05) after 8  weeks of treatment.
