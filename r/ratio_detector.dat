5000|$|Practically {{all modern}} {{receivers}} {{are of the}} superheterodyne design. The RF signal from the antenna may have one stage of amplification to improve the receiver's noise figure, although at lower frequencies this is typically omitted. The RF signal enters a mixer, along with {{the output of the}} local oscillator, in order to produce a so-called intermediate frequency (IF) signal. An early optimization of the superheterodyne was to combine the local oscillator and mixer into a single stage called [...] "converter". The local oscillator is tuned to a frequency somewhat higher (or lower) than the intended reception frequency so that the IF signal will be at a particular frequency where it is further amplified in a narrow-band multistage amplifier. Tuning the receiver involves changing the frequency of the local oscillator, with further processing of the signal (especially in relation to increasing the receiver) conveniently done at a single frequency (the IF frequency) thus requiring no further tuning for different stations.Here we show block diagrams for typical superheterodyne receivers for AM and FM broadcast respectively. This particular FM design uses a modern phase locked loop detector, unlike the frequency discriminator or <b>ratio</b> <b>detector</b> used in earlier FM receivers.|$|E

50|$|To {{match the}} {{performance}} of the superheterodyne receiver, a number of the functions normally addressed by the IF stage must be accomplished at baseband. Since there is no high gain IF amplifier utilizing automatic gain control (AGC), the baseband output level may vary over a very wide range dependent on the received signal strength. This is one major technical challenge which limited the practicability of the design. Another issue is the inability of this design to implement envelope detection of AM signals. Thus direct demodulation of AM or FM signals (as used in broadcasting) requires phase locking the local oscillator to the carrier frequency, a much more demanding task compared to the more robust envelope detector or <b>ratio</b> <b>detector</b> at the output of an IF stage in a superheterodyne design. However this can be avoided {{in the case of a}} direct-conversion design using quadrature detection followed by digital signal processing. Using software radio techniques, the two quadrature outputs can be processed in order to perform any sort of demodulation and filtering on down-converted signals from frequencies close to the local oscillator frequency. The proliferation of digital hardware, along with refinements in the analog components involved in the frequency conversion to baseband, has thus made this simpler topology practical in many applications.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{detection}} of attackers within firewalls of enterprise computer net- works is of paramount importance. Anomaly detectors {{address this problem}} by quantifying deviations from baseline statistical models of normal network behav- ior and signaling an intrusion when the observed data deviates significantly from the baseline model. However, many anomaly detectors do {{not take into account}} plausible attacker behavior. As a result, anomaly detectors are prone to a large number of false positives due to unusual but benign activity. This paper first in- troduces a stochastic model of attacker behavior which is motivated by real world attacker traversal. Then, we develop a likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>detector</b> that compares the probability of observed network behavior under normal conditions against the case when an attacker has possibly compromised a subset of hosts within the network. Since the likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>detector</b> requires integrating over the time each host be- comes compromised, we illustrate how to use Monte Carlo methods to compute the requisite integral. We then present Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for various network parameterizations that show for any rate of true posi- tives, the rate of false positives for the likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>detector</b> is no higher than that of a simple anomaly detector and is often lower. We conclude by demon- strating the superiority of the proposed likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>detector</b> when the network topologies and parameterizations are extracted from real-world networks...|$|E

30|$|Wedgelets provide nearly minimax {{estimation}} of boundaries or contours, {{but they are}} not well designed to extract linear features, see Figure 2. This is because the two-region mask they take detects step-structure edge only, while linear features are usually noted as ridge edges. In addition, they lack information about the width of a line segment[7, 19]. Though having a three-region mask, <b>ratio</b> correlation <b>detector,</b> on the other hand, lacks the flexibility to change mask size and direction adaptively, which results in a failure in the detection of features with varying widths, as shown in Figure 2. In this article, we propose a method that regards a three-region filter mask, the <b>ratio</b> correlation <b>detector,</b> in a multiscale manner. As already mentioned, we name this detector multiscale linear feature detector (MLFD). MLFD can be used to extract curvilinear targets from SAR data.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{detecting}} target in system-dependent clutter (SDC) background with a single observation from the test cell is researched. Classical detectors, such as the generalized likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>detectors</b> (GLRDs) and the adaptive matched filters (AMFs), etc., usually deal with the clutter and the noise as a whole. The low rank detectors (LRDs) {{make use of the}} low rank property of the clutter to improve the detection performance. However, the performance of LRDs degrades when the signal is not orthogonal with respect to (w. r. t.) the clutter. In this paper, an adaptive subspace detector for SDC (SDC-ASD) background which deals with the clutter and the noise separately is proposed. The SDC-ASD designs the test statistic by replacing the signal and the clutter covariance matrix with their maximum likelihood estimations (MLEs). Its theoretical false alarm probability and detection probability are analytically deduced. Analytical results show that the test statistic has the form of non-central distribution. Besides, it is shown that the SDC-ASD has constant false alarm rate (CFAR) performance w. r. t. the clutter and the noise. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the detection performance of the SDC-ASD in dealing with the target detection in SDC background...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptive}} subspace detector in system-dependent clutter background (SDC-ASD) is {{proved to}} be able to improve the detection performance for deterministic target detection in the authors' previous study. However, the exact performance of the SDC-ASD for fluctuating target detection is still unknown. In this study, with the aid of matrix decomposition theory, the analytical performance of the SDC-ASD for detecting fluctuating target is considered and assessed. At the design stage, the rigorous mathematical derivation processes for the exact theoretical detection performance of the SDC-ASD for fluctuating target detection is derived. The theoretical results, which have explicitly expressions for both the false alarm probability and the detection probability, not only provide an effective mathematical method to analyse the fluctuating target detection performance, but also can further simplify the deterministic target detection assessments. At the analysis stage, Monte Carlo simulations are resorted to validate the analytical results. Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the SDC-ASD for fluctuating target detection. Results show that the SDC-ASD, by dealing separately with the clutter and the noise, performs the best in comparison with its published counterparts, i. e. the generalised likelihood <b>ratio</b> <b>detectors,</b> the adaptive matched filters, the adaptive subspace detectors and the low-rank detectors based on sample covariance matrix...|$|R

To carry these measurements out routinely and consistently, a set of plug-ins for Gatan DigitalMicrograph named XUtils was developed. In the XUtils plug-ins, two main plug-ins can be used for determination of detector performance parameters as briefly described below. NiOx: The main dialog is shown in Fig. 1 (a).
