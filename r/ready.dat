5|$|Schlachtgeschwader 4 and Jagdgeschwader 2 (SG 4 and JG 2) were {{to strike}} at Sint-Truiden airfield. JG 2 was {{commanded}} by Kurt Bühligen. I./JG 2's ground crews managed to make <b>ready</b> 35 of 46 Fw 190s, 29 of which were Fw 190D. Only 33 pilots were fit for operations. So the Gruppe reported only 33 Fw 190s <b>ready.</b> II./JG 2 could field 20 of 29 Bf 109s. Stab./JG 2 had three Fw 190s <b>ready</b> for the mission. It {{is not clear whether}} Bühligen took part in the mission. III./JG 2 reported 40 Fw 190s operational, 34 of them Fw 190Ds. However, only 28 of the 43 pilots in the unit were fit for operations and the formation fielded only 28 fighters. In total, 84 aircraft were <b>ready</b> on 31 December, including 28 Fw 190D-9s.|$|E

5|$|Birch's tidy {{schedule}} was disrupted in December by Groves, who ordered Oppenheimer to {{give priority to}} the gun-type over implosion, so that the weapon would be <b>ready</b> by 1 July 1945. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was <b>ready</b> {{at the beginning of}} May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the cruiser , arriving 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E

5|$|Blücher {{spent most}} of November 1939 fitting out and {{finishing}} additional improvements. By {{the end of the}} month, the ship was <b>ready</b> for sea trials; she steamed to Gotenhafen in the Baltic Sea. The trials lasted until mid-December, after which the ship returned to Kiel for final modifications. In January 1940, she resumed her exercises in the Baltic, but {{by the middle of the}} month, severe ice forced the ship to remain in port. On 5 April, she was deemed to be <b>ready</b> for action, and was therefore assigned to the forces participating in the invasion of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Cats are <b>ready</b> {{to go to}} {{new homes}} at about 12 weeks of age, when they are <b>ready</b> to leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, in {{an attempt}} to rectify this, the <b>Ready</b> Reserve scheme was established. Under this scheme the 6th Brigade, an {{existing}} Regular brigade based in Brisbane at the time, was converted to a <b>Ready</b> Reserve formation. The majority of the personnel were Reservists who undertook a period of twelve months full-time service before returning to normal Reserve status for a further four years. The scheme showed considerable promise. Nevertheless, due to cost constraints it was abolished in 1996 by the newly elected Howard government.|$|E

The only pilot that was downed was a Jordanian, {{but he did not}} have a radio on him when he ejected and landed too close to ISIL forces.|$|E
