25|$|A closely <b>related</b> <b>{{property}}</b> is chirality, {{which in}} turn is closely related to a more easily visualized property called helicity. The helicity of a particle is the direction of its spin relative to its momentum; particles with spin {{in the same direction as}} their momentum are called right-handed and otherwise they are called left-handed. When a particle is massless, the direction of its momentum relative to its spin is frame independent, while for massive particles it is possible to 'overtake' the particle by a Lorentz transformation flipping the helicity. Chirality is a technical property (defined through the transformation behaviour under the Poincaré group) that agrees with helicity for (approximately) massless particles and is still well defined for massive particles.|$|E

2500|$|The World Wide Web is {{a popular}} example of a {{decentralized}} system exhibiting emergent properties. [...] There is no central organization rationing the number of links, yet the number of links pointing to each page follows a power law in which a few pages are linked to many times and most pages are seldom linked to. [...] A <b>related</b> <b>property</b> of the network of links in the World Wide Web is that almost any pair of pages can be connected to each other through a relatively short chain of links. [...] Although relatively well known now, this property was initially unexpected in an unregulated network. [...] It is shared with many other types of networks called small-world networks.|$|E
2500|$|When Tuen Mun was {{developed}} in the 1970s, the Hong Kong government had set aside space for the laying of rail tracks. There was uncertainty however as to which company would be commissioned to build the train line. In 1982 Hong Kong Tramways showed interest in building the system and running double-decker trams on it, before abandoning the project after negotiations over land premiums for <b>related</b> <b>property</b> development failed. The government sought another builder. The Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) was [...] "heavily indebted" [...] at the time, and so Secretary for Transport Alan Scott invited the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) to consider the project instead. The KCRC announced they would build the system in 1984 to a budget of $1.5 billion, after investigating ways to improve commercial viability. After some research, construction commenced on 14 July 1985.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the fabric parameters, as independent variables, and the comfort <b>related</b> <b>properties,</b> as dependent variables, of commercial suiting fabrics, containing both natural and man-made fibres, have been studied. The fabric parameters measured {{in the study were}} mass, thickness, density, and air permeability. The comfort <b>related</b> <b>properties,</b> tested on a Permetest instrument, included water vapour permeability, water vapour resistance, and thermal resistance, with the moisture permeability index being derived. A total of 26 commercial suiting fabrics, covering a wide range of mass, as well as different fibre types and blends and fabric structures, was tested. The fibres covered, included wool, polyester, viscose, and cotton, while the fabric structures covered were 1 x 1 plain weave, 2 x 1 twill and 2 x 2 twill weave. The objectives of this study were to determine the empirical relationships between the measured fabric properties and the measured comfort <b>related</b> <b>properties,</b> and to determine the role, if any, of fibre type and fabric structure, since many claims are made in practice concerning the relative advantages, in terms of comfort, of a specific fibre type or blend, or fabric structure, over others, some of which being supported by research results. Since the fabrics covered, were commercial and were not engineered so that the different fabric parameters (independent variables) and fibre type and blend, as well as fabric structure could be varied independently of each other, the effects of the various fabric parameters on the fabric comfort <b>related</b> <b>properties</b> were determined and quantified by multiple regression analyses (multi-linear and multi-quadratic), and the best fit regression equations, and contribution of each parameter to the overall fit established. It was found that fabric thickness and fabric mass had the largest effect on the comfort <b>related</b> <b>properties</b> as measured here, fabric mass determining, to a large extent, water vapour permeability, and fabric thickness, thermal resistance. The rest of the fabric parameters included in the study had only a relatively small effect on the measured comfort <b>related</b> <b>properties.</b> The influence of fabric parameters, with particular reference to mass and thickness, on the measured comfort <b>related</b> <b>properties,</b> were much greater than that of fibre type or blend, or fabric structure. It was, therefore, concluded from this study, that the fabric parameters, as opposed to the intrinsic characteristics of a particular fibre, whether natural or man-made, largely determined those fabric comfort <b>related</b> <b>properties</b> measured her...|$|R
