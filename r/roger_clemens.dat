5|$|The Red Sox {{gained a}} {{supplemental}} first-round pick in 1997 for losing free agent <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> {{holds the}} Red Sox {{record for most}} Opening Day starts with eight. The other {{pitchers}} with five or more Opening Day starts for Boston are Pedro Martínez (7), Cy Young (6), and Dennis Eckersley (5).|$|E
5|$|Other {{major league}} {{pitchers}} {{who have won}} multiple Pitching Triple Crowns include Christy Mathewson (1905 and 1908 New York Giants), Lefty Grove (1930 and 1931 Philadelphia Athletics), Lefty Gomez (1934 and 1937 New York Yankees), and <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> (1997 and 1998 Toronto Blue Jays).|$|E
5|$|About {{four months}} after victory, the Yankees {{controversially}} traded fan favorite David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays for <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> a fan favorite with the Red Sox between 1984 and 1996. Clemens was coming off two consecutive season with the Blue Jays where he had won both the pitching triple crown and the Cy Young Award in both 1997 and 1998.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his three American League wins, Young also led the National League twice (1892, 1895) to amass the third-highest total of win championships in major league history. Joe McGinnity and Tom Glavine also captured five wins titles in the National League. Pitchers who have led their league four times include Steve Carlton, <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> Christy Mathewson, Hal Newhouser, and Robin Roberts.|$|E
5|$|Nova secured {{for a spot}} in the {{starting}} rotation for the 2012 season in spring training. He won 15 consecutive games from June 2011 through May 2012, one short of the franchise record set by <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens.</b> He surpassed the Yankees' rookie record of twelve consecutive wins, set by Atley Donald in 1939, during the 2011 season.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{made his}} postseason debut in Game 4 of the AL Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees. He went 5.2 innings, struck out 5, walked 2, and allowed an earned run. Zito earned the win, outpitching <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens.</b> However, the Yankees {{would win the}} series, 3–2, and {{would go on to}} win their third {{straight}} World Series.|$|E
5|$|After the season, Kershaw and the Dodgers {{agreed on}} a seven-year, $215 million, {{contract}} extension. The deal was the richest in MLB history for a pitcher, eclipsing the seven-year, $180 million, contract signed by Justin Verlander the previous year. The average annual value of $30.7 million was also the largest ever for a baseball player, beating the $28 million <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> received in 2007 and the 10-year, $275 million contract that Alex Rodriguez signed that same year.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, {{pitchers}} {{have rarely}} won the award. When Justin Verlander won the AL award in 2011, {{he became the}} first pitcher in either league to be named the MVP since Dennis Eckersley in 1992. Verlander also became the first starting pitcher to win this award since <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> had accomplished the feat in 1986. The National League went even longer without an MVP award to a pitcher—after Bob Gibson won in 1968, no pitcher in that league was named MVP until Clayton Kershaw in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} {{have joined the}} 300win club: <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes in {{the game in the}} last decade of the 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|Whitey Ford, Ron Guidry, and Mel Stottlemyre {{hold the}} Yankees {{record for most}} Opening Day starts with seven. The other {{pitchers}} with three or more Opening Day starts for New York are CC Sabathia (6), Lefty Gomez (6), Red Ruffing (5), Jack Chesbro (4), <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> (4), Bob Shawkey (4), Ray Caldwell (3), Jimmy Key (3), Vic Raschi (3), and most recently Masahiro Tanaka (3). Jimmy Key holds the Yankee record for best Opening Day record with a perfect 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Barry Bonds {{received}} the award in 2002, becoming the third player so honored {{for breaking the}} single-season home run record. Bonds {{was the first of}} two players to receive the award that season, along with Rickey Henderson. The award was given in each year from 2004 until 2007: <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> was honored during the 2004 All-Star Game, and Ichiro Suzuki was presented with the award for breaking the single-season hits record in 2005. Rachel Robinson was honored in 2007, receiving the award for establishing the Jackie Robinson Foundation. She was the first woman and the first non-player to be thus honored.|$|E
5|$|Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens.</b> As a youth, he starred on Little League All-Star teams. He later {{attended}} Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He {{had trouble}} with grades and {{not paying attention to}} his coach during his freshman year. His coach was so frustrated with him he threw him off the team. He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball. He also raised his GPA and was able {{to get back on the}} team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2004 season began, the Houston Astros signed Andy Pettitte {{to boost}} their {{starting}} rotation. As a result, Robertson found himself battling with Tim Redding, Jared Fernandez, Carlos Hernández and Brandon Duckworth for the final spot in the rotation. After <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> was signed as well, the Astros decided before spring training began that Robertson would pitch out of the bullpen for the season. By the end of spring training, Robertson failed to crack the bullpen, and was to be demoted to the Zephyrs. On March 31, just before the season started, the Astros traded Robertson to the Cleveland Indians for Luke Scott and Willy Taveras.|$|E
5|$|Humber {{finished}} his three-year career with a 35–8 win–loss record and 2.80 ERA, striking out 422 in 354 innings pitched. Humber's totals rank {{him with the}} third most wins in Rice baseball history and second most strikeouts. Among his honors for the season were selection to the 2004 Louisville Slugger All-America team by Collegiate Baseball and the 2004 USA TODAY/Sports Weekly All-America team. During the inaugural year for the <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> Award, which designates the top college pitcher, {{he was one of}} 10 named semifinalists. He was also among the 10 finalists for the Dick Howser Trophy in 2004, in recognition of his performance as one of college baseball's top players.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> Wade Boggs, Ken Griffey, Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, José Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia all guest starred as themselves, {{playing the}} ringers hired by Mr. Burns. Terry Cashman sang a song over the end credits. The guest stars were {{recorded}} over several months, with differing degrees of cooperation. The episode is often named among the show's best, {{and was the}} first to beat The Cosby Show in the ratings on its original airing. In 2014, showrunner Al Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his 17-year major league career, Lefty Grove led the American League in ERA nine times, with a career single-season low of 2.06 for the 1931 Philadelphia Athletics. <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> has won the second-most ERA titles, {{capturing}} six in the American League and one in the National League. Sandy Koufax led the National League in ERA for five consecutive seasons (1962–1966); Koufax' five awards are the most won consecutively by any player and are tied for the most awards by a player in the National League with Christy Mathewson and Clayton Kershaw. In the American League, Walter Johnson also won five ERA titles, and Pedro Martínez has won a total of five (four American League and one National League) with two different teams.|$|E
5|$|The lone {{bright spot}} for the Red Sox came in Game 3 at Boston's Fenway Park, in {{what had been a}} much {{anticipated}} pitching match-up of former Red Sox star <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> who was now pitching for the Yankees, and Boston ace Pedro Martínez. Martínez struck out twelve and did not allow a run through seven innings of work; Clemens was hit hard, giving up five earned runs and only lasting two innings of a 13–1 Red Sox victory. The Yankees rebounded to win Games 4 and 5, clinching the American League pennant and advancing to the Series, where they swept the Atlanta Braves, (including two 8th-inning comebacks). The loss to Pedro Martínez was the Yankees' only postseason loss, as the team went 11–1.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{statistics}} for the 1980s gave him a valid claim as the best reliever of the decade, although he was rivaled by Jeff Reardon. While Smith had four consecutive 30-save seasons, Reardon finished the decade with five consecutive. Smith saved 234 games {{by the end of}} 1989, and Reardon had 266. Reardon was {{also a member of the}} 1987 World Series-winning Minnesota Twins. On December 6, , the Red Sox had both closers on their roster when they signed Reardon as a free agent. Two of the past decade's most dominating closers in history were even pitching in games together for Boston for the first month of 1990 with Reardon setting up Smith for a save on April 18—a game started by a third famous pitcher, <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens.</b> The unusual double-closer situation lasted less than a month before Smith was traded to St. Louis for slugging outfielder Tom Brunansky on May 4, 1990.|$|E
5|$|Two {{of their}} first-round picks have won {{championship}}s with the franchise. Outfielder Trot Nixon (1993) {{was on the}} 2004 championship team and outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury (2005) played with the 2007 championship team. Nomar Garciaparra (1994) won the Rookie of the Year Award with the Red Sox in 1997. Jim Rice (drafted in 1971), <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> (drafted in 1983), and Mo Vaughn (drafted in 1989) have each won a Most Valuable Player Award with the team. Clemens also won three Cy Young Awards with the Red Sox and another four with other teams {{for a total of}} seven, more than any other pitcher in MLB history. Clay Buchholz (2005) threw a no-hitter, the 17th in Red Sox franchise history, in his second major league start, tying him with Wilson Álvarez for the second-fastest no-hitter by an MLB pitcher. Jim Rice is the only first-round pick of the Red Sox in the Baseball Hall of Fame, inducted in 2009.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} inning of a 2007 game at Fenway Park, Manny Ramírez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four {{consecutive}} home runs off Yankee pitcher Chase Wright, powering a comeback from a three-run deficit and completing a three-game sweep of the Yankees at Fenway Park {{for the first time}} since 1990. By May, after long speculation about what team he would play for after retirement, <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> chose to return to the Yankees as opposed to the Red Sox (where he started his career) or the Houston Astros (his hometown and last team he played for). Clemens helped the Yankees overcome a 14-game deficit in the standings to roar back to reach the playoffs again, however, this was not enough to win the division. On September 28, Boston won the AL East after a win against the Minnesota Twins and a loss by the Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles. This was the first AL East Championship for the Red Sox since 1995, ending the Yankees' nine-year reign in the division.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball {{recognizes the}} player or players in each league {{with the most}} strikeouts each season. Jim Devlin led the National League in its inaugural season of 1876; he threw 122 strikeouts for the Louisville Grays. The American League's first winner was Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who {{captured}} the American League Triple Crown in 1901 by striking out 158 batters, along with leading the league in wins and earned run average. Walter Johnson led the American League in strikeouts 12 times during his Hall of Fame career, most among all players. He is followed by Nolan Ryan, who captured 11 titles between both leagues (9 American League and 2 National League). Randy Johnson won nine strikeout titles, including five with his home state Arizona Diamondbacks. Three players have won seven strikeout championships: Dazzy Vance, who leads the National League; Bob Feller; and Lefty Grove. Grover Cleveland Alexander and Rube Waddell led their league six times, and five-time winners include Steve Carlton, <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> Sam McDowell, Christy Mathewson, Amos Rusie, and Tom Seaver.|$|E
5|$|After the 1998 season, Wells {{was traded}} to the Toronto Blue Jays for <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> who had just {{completed}} two consecutive Cy Young Award-winning seasons. In a regular season that included another perfect game by a Yankees pitcher, this one by David Cone, New York led the AL East with 98 wins and beat the Rangers in the ALDS. This led to an ALCS against the rival Red Sox. New York won the first two games en route to a 4–1 series win, and went on to sweep the Braves in the 1999 World Series. The postseason results gave the 1998–99 Yankees a 22–3 playoff record, and the team held a 12-game winning streak in World Series competition dating back to 1996. Although the 2000 Yankees had an 87–74 regular season record that was the worst among playoff qualifiers, the team won consecutive playoff series to claim the AL championship. New York's pennant placed them in the 2000 World Series against the cross-town Mets, the first Subway Series in 44 years. With a four games to one victory, the Yankees gained their third successive title. As of 2016, the 2000 Yankees are the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and the Yankees of 1998–2000 are the last team to win three consecutive World Series.|$|E
5|$|Young led his {{league in}} wins five times (1892, 1895, and 19011903), {{finishing}} second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two {{more than the}} runners-up, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. Young won two ERA titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, {{but this was not}} uncommon during the dead-ball era. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times. Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the WHIP ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times. Young is tied with <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E
5|$|To placate the Yankees' {{concerns}} about his durability, Rivera followed a {{strength and conditioning}} program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre {{said that he would}} try to reduce Rivera's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer. However, Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season's first half, saving 16games in 17opportunities. His save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens.</b> Rivera slumped early in the second half; over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40saves in 46opportunities. In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the arch-rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had {{one of the most memorable}} postseason performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees' series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16innings pitched that postseason.|$|E
25|$|<b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> won the {{pitching}} triple crown in 1997 and 1998.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> and Andy Pettitte {{filed for}} free agency on Monday, {{five days before}} the Nov. 11 deadline.|$|E
25|$|Only five {{pitchers}} in {{the history}} of major league baseball have as many victories as Mussina and a better winning percentage: Lefty Grove, Christy Mathewson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> and Randy Johnson.|$|E
25|$|All {{pitchers}} with 100 more wins than losses {{who have}} been eligible, {{with the exception of}} <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> have been inducted to the Hall of Fame. With a record of 270–153, Mussina fits that criterion.|$|E
25|$|In the American League Championship Series, Martínez pitched seven shutout innings to beat Red Sox nemesis <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> and the New York Yankees in Game 3, {{handing the}} World Champions their only {{loss of the}} 1999 postseason.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{had also}} {{developed}} an excellent pitching staff, anchored by Roy Oswalt, Andy Pettitte, <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> (who had a league-low ERA of only 1.87), and Brandon Backe. Rookie starters Ezequiel Astacio and Wandy Rodríguez were also successful.|$|E
25|$|Former Longhorns {{who have}} gone on to success in Major League Baseball include <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> Bibb Falk, Ron Gardenhire, Calvin Schiraldi, Burt Hooton, Keith Moreland, Spike Owen, Greg Swindell, Huston Street, Omar Quintanilla, Taylor Teagarden, Sam LeCure and Drew Stubbs.|$|E
25|$|Wakefield {{finished}} his Red Sox career third in wins (behind <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens</b> and Cy Young), second in strikeouts (behind Clemens), second in game appearances by a pitcher (behind reliever Bob Stanley), first in games {{started as a}} pitcher, and first in innings pitched.|$|E
25|$|This World Series win was {{sense of}} revenge for <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> because {{he won the}} World Series in the same stadium he lost it in 1986 while with the Red Sox. Members of the Mets' 1986 team threw out the {{ceremonial}} first pitch before the clinching game.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{a loss to}} the Mets on September 28 {{guaranteed}} the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie Chuck James besting <b>Roger</b> <b>Clemens,</b> Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79-83.|$|E
