2500|$|Upon formation, the 1st Armoured Division was {{intended}} {{to serve in the}} Middle East, but following Japan's entry into the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Malaya in December 1941, it was retained in Australia, as a key part of Australia's defensive plans to resist a potential invasion. [...] The regiment participated in the 1st Armoured Division's large-scale exercises which were held near Narrabri, New South Wales in late 1942, at which time the division reached operational readiness. Following the Allied naval victory during the Battle of the Coral Sea and the successes elsewhere such as at Buna–Gona, the threat posed by Japanese forces to the Australian mainland decreased, and as a result the need for large armoured formations diminished. By this then, the Australian Army was suffering a manpower shortage, which resulted in a <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and the gradual reduction of Australia's armoured units. In October 1942, the regiment was reduced in size when 'D' Squadron was used to form the 2/4th Armoured Regiment in Queensland.|$|E

50|$|For low inequalities the Theil {{index is}} smaller than the Hoover index.Here, {{on the path to}} {{reaching}} equilibrium, a planned and optimized <b>reallocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> would contribute more to the dynamics of redistribution than stochastic redistribution. This also is intuitively understandable, as low inequalities also weaken the urge to redistribute resources. People in such a system may tolerate or even foster an increase the inequality. As this is would be an increase of redundancy (an decrease of entropy), redundancy would have to be imported into (entropy would have to be exported from) the society. In that case the society needs to be an open system.|$|E
