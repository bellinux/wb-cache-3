The generation of new ideas was investigated by first noting how ideas are created for object concepts, such as 'tools' and 'animals', and then testing whether or not the same mechanism applies to idea generation for the non-object concept, of 'rituals'. The manner in which new ideas are generated is thought to follow the path of least resistance, where category exemplars that come to mind first are the ones used as starting points for novel creations from a given domain. Properties of a concept are determined through 'representativeness' measures (Output Dominance, Typicality, and Familiarity) that indicate the participants' cognitive structure of the concept. Characteristics of the concept properties were collected by participants listing and rating rituals exemplars. Idea generation tasks were performed, and were then examined for the occurrence of exemplars. By correlating the three concept measures with the occurrence of exemplars in the idea generation task, {{it was found that the}} Output Dominance measure is the best predictor of new idea starting points. This was previously shown to be the case with object categories, and in this study using the non-object category of rituals, there is evidence that the Output Dominance measure of concept representativeness is also a reliable predictor of novel idea starting points. New ideas may also be generated through priming. In these experiments, an imaginary sense re-creation/diverse-knowledge-domains prime was applied to see if <b>originality</b> <b>scores</b> could be improved. The evidence collected here indicates that visualization and non-specific priming of knowledge domains do not affect <b>originality</b> <b>scores</b> on imagination tasks...|$|R

In this study {{the extent to which}} visual creativity is related to cognitive processes underlying visual mental imagery was investigated. Fifty college students (25 women) carried out: the Creative Synthesis Task, which measures the ability to produce creative objects belonging to a given category (originality, synthesis and transformation scores of pre-inventive forms, and <b>originality</b> and practicality <b>scores</b> of inventions were computed); an adaptation of Clark’s Drawing Ability Test, which measures the ability to produce actual creative artworks (graphic ability, aesthetic and creativity scores of drawings were assessed) and three mental imagery tasks that investigate the three main cognitive processes involved in visual mental imagery: generation, inspection and transformation. Vividness of imagery and verbalizer-visualizer cognitive style were also measured using questionnaires. Correlation analysis revealed that all measures of the creativity tasks positively correlated with the image transformation imagery ability; practicality of inventions negatively correlated with vividness of imagery; originality of inventions positively correlated with the visualization cognitive style. However, regression analysis confirmed the predictive role of the transformation imagery ability only for the <b>originality</b> <b>score</b> of inventions and for the graphic ability and aesthetic scores of artistic drawings; on the other hand, the visualization cognitive style predicted the originality of inventions, whereas the vividness of imagery predicted practicality of inventions.

Prior studies on diversity provide evidence that working with diverse individuals can make groups more productive in generating creative ideas. Diversity of academic major is {{an important element of}} group diversity that has not been sufficiently studied. This study provided direction for future research to help us understand the ways that diversity may influence creative thinking as well as enrich the school curriculum. A total of 56 graduate students from University of Connecticut were recruited to study this issue. The Alternate Uses Test was used to obtain the divergent thinking score, which is an essential indicator of creative thinking of individuals and groups. The scores on three outcomes of divergent thinking (fluency, flexibility and originality) were collected to analyze if students in diverse academic major groups work better than those in non-diverse academic major groups. The results show that groups with divergent majors, perform more effectively on the <b>originality</b> <b>score</b> for both individual tasks and the group creativity task, compared to groups with common majors.

The growing interest and concern in tapping creativity has prompted many researches on creativity to be undertaken in a number of countries, particularly Malaysia. This paper explored the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as an important tool for fostering and assessing the creative potentials of a person. The researcher implemented an integrated system on 97 university undergraduates who would be potential teachers in the near future. Could computer be used to measure the creativity traits of a person? Could they improve their respective creative potentials? How did creativity improve? The research found that the assessment of creativity traits such as fluency, flexibility, elaboration and originality using computer was valid and possible using definitions and algorithms adapted from Torrance’s TTCT and Guilford’s Alternative Task (Torrance & Ball, 1984; Guilford, 1977). It was also found that 85 out of the 97 subjects managed to improve their respective fluency, flexibility, elaboration and <b>originality</b> <b>scores</b> in the posttest. The improvement of their creative potentials was pinpointed to the effective implementation of the Morphological Analysis Method in the brainstorming activities (pretest and posttest). The successful knowledge acquirement of the creativity technique by the subjects was due to the lively and effective delivery of multimedia training modules on the MA Method. It was recommended that the MA Method be adapted for repeated uses on any academic curriculums in schools or universities/colleges to improve the creative potentials of a person on long term basis...|$|R
40|$|Divergent {{thinking}} (DT) {{tests are}} {{the most frequently used}} types of creativity assessment and have been administered in traditional paper and pencil format for more than a half century. With the prevalence of computer-based testing and increasing demands for large-scale, faster, and more flexible testing procedures, it is necessary to explore and test the usability of computer-based divergent thinking tests. Yet few studies have focused on the use of technologies in the assessment of creativity, including divergent thinking tests. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to design and test the feasibility of an online divergent thinking (DT) test. The following three aims were addressed: (1) evaluate reliability evidence of DT test scores, (2) explore relationships between technology use and online DT performance, and (3) compare the online test with its paper version regarding DT scores. One hundred and sixty-four participants were recruited from the University of Connecticut and randomly assigned into three groups: online-basic (OB), online-advanced (OA), and paper-and-pencil (PP). Based on the results of reliability analysis, six DT scores were selected for analysis of variance and multiple regression modeling. The findings indicated that, despite of the possible link between technology use and online DT performance, no differences were found between different modes (online vs. paper) or different interfaces (simple tools vs. advanced tools) in terms of either DT scores or reliability evidence.

Multiple baseline across behaviors design was replicated across four participants. This research also investigated relationships between the interventions and creativity scores by employing pretest and posttest design as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT). The results varied with the participants and the interventions. The overall mean in all three treatments increased a mild degree based on descriptive statistics. All four participants showed a drastic variability in math problem solving. T-test results from the TTCT showed that there were significant differences in both fluency and flexibility <b>scores.</b> Elaboration and <b>originality</b> <b>scores</b> appeared unaffected since the instructions were mean in all three treatments increased to a mild degree based on descriptive statistics.

It was found that only math inquiry intervention was effective to a mild degree for three out of four participants. Fluency and flexibility scores increased as a result of divergent production activities, however not enough to say that overall creativity is fostered directly by the program. Issues emerged out of the math problem solving in terms of controlling variability and developing content materials for the instruction. Further research is needed to ascertain the effects of multiple interventions on students with math difficulty.

Ninety-eight subjects, ranging in age from twelve to seventeen and participating in Texas A&M University??s Youth Adventure Program for gifted students, comprised the sample. All took the Thinking Creatively with Sounds and Words test and were divided into three creativity groups (high, middle, and low) based on <b>originality</b> <b>scores.</b> A proportional stratified random sampling procedure was implemented to ensure equal representation for experimental and control groups. The subjects were then presented an experimenter-designed idea generation task, patterned after Smith, Ward, & Schumacher (1993), that called for them to generate ideas for a chair of the future. The experimental group viewed examples prior to task onset that all included three specific features relevant to the design of a chair (adjustable lever, four legs, drink holder). The control group did not view any examples prior to task onset. Conformity effects were measured in relation to the proportion of the features in the examples that were included in the ideas generated by the subjects.

Fluency was assessed by the number of responses provided, and a second measure of elaboration used the average word count of their responses. The combined ratings and personality data used for analysis can be found in "HMSL_scoreData", and the original dataset of all completed participants is "HMSL_data_allcompleted". A complete and detailed description of each of the 8 files in this dataset follows. The main five data files are in both SPSS and CSV format in their respective zip files. The descriptions of these files are as follows: 1) HMSL_data_allcompleted. sav/. csv is the dataset with only complete responses; 2) HMSL_scoreData. sav/. csv is the data file for analysis with scores per participant; 3) HMSL_Originality_scores. sav/. csv is the raw <b>originality</b> <b>scores</b> from judges, organized by response 4) HMSL_Flexibility_scores. sav/. csv is the raw flexibility scores from judges, organized by random participant ID 5) HMSL_Elaboration_scores. sav/. csv is the raw elaboration scores from judges, organized by response. The remaining 3 files are R scripts and the codebook. Their descriptions are: 6) HMSL_preprocessing. R is the R script for data cleaning and preparation; 7) HMSL_analysis. R is the R script for data analysis from article; and 8) CreativityStudy_Documentation&Codebook. pdf is the codebook. Note: HMSL prefix refers to authors last names (Hofelich Mohr, Sell, and Lindsay) This study was designed to test whether responses to a divergent thinking task (the Alternative Uses Task, AUT; Guildford, 1967) could be influenced by visual design characteristics of the survey response box. We manipulated the type of response box (whether participants saw one large, essay style box - unsegmented - or whether they saw several small, list-style boxes - segmented; see variable "Segmented") and the size/number of boxes seen (5, 10, or 15 lines or boxes; see variable "Lines"). Participants were recruited from the United States between February and early May, 2014 from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and completed the task online. They were given two minutes to list as many uses for either a brick or a paperclip (randomized across participants; see variable "Item"), and then were automatically advanced to answer questions about their personality (the 44 item Big Five Inventory; John & Srivastava, 1991) and demographic information (Age, Sex, Education). Judges scored their responses for elaboration, flexibility, and originality...|$|R
40|$|Background: There has {{for some}} time now been {{recognition}} that there was a relationship between exceptional creative talent and mental disorder. The works of Andreasen (2008) and others in this area have been very significant. However, most of the research has been carried out in USA and Europe. Very little has come out of Africa on the subject. Aim : To survey the beliefs of different groups within an African society, concerning the possibility of a relationship between creative talent and mental disorder. To assess creativity within a community of people with a formal diagnosis of mental disorder. Materials and Methods: Some of the mythology of the Yoruba was examined for content, concerning the behaviour of certain notable individuals and the existence of psychopathology based on modern-day criteria. The beliefs of members of the general public and mental health professionals concerning the existence of a relationship between creative talent and psychopathology were surveyed using a questionnaire designed for the project. A sample of patients with formal diagnoses of affective disorder or schizophrenia drawn from two units, the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital and the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Yaba, were assessed for &#x 2032;Creativity. &#x 2032; Results : Although there are notable &#x 2032;eccentric&#x 2032; figures in local mythology, {{the overwhelming majority of the}} people surveyed do not believe there is any relationship between creativity and mental illness. They however believe that engaging in creative activities helps the mentally ill to recover from illness. The mental health professionals, who were clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, had a significant minority who believed that a relationship does exist, and they also strongly assert that creative activity has a therapeutic effect for the mentally ill. A survey of in-patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and affective disorder failed to show a significant difference in the creativity of the two populations, as measured by the <b>originality</b> <b>score</b> of the Rorschach scale. The survey of patients is inconclusive, based on small sample size (ten patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, ten with bipolar affective disorder.). The linkage between formal mental disorder is only recognised by a significant minority of mental health professionals. A significant proportion of the population believe that creative activity aids recovery from mental illness. More research is required into this important subject in Africa...|$|R
