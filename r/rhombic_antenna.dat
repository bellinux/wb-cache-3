50|$|Edmond Bruce (September 28, 1899 - November 28, 1973) was an American radio pioneer {{best known}} for {{creating}} the <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> and Bruce array.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> is a {{broadband}} directional {{wire antenna}} co-invented by Edmond Bruce [...] and Harald Friis, in 1931, mostly {{commonly used in}} the high frequency (HF) or shortwave band.|$|E
40|$|Upon {{examining}} the formulas for self and mutual impedances of antennas, {{it is found}} that while the mutual impedance formula for separately driven coilinear standing wave antennas may be used directly in determining the radiation impedance when such antennas are connected in cascade, certain modifications must be made in the case of travelling wave antennas under similar circumstances. Accordingly, formulas are derived for <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> spaced in tandem and are modified to permit the determining of the radiation impedance of two identical <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> connected in cascade.

5000|$|Multiple <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> can be {{connected}} in an end-to-end fashion to form MUSA (Multiple Unit Steerable Antenna). MUSA arrays can receive long distance, short wave, horizontally polarized downcoming waves.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was used for}} potato storage up until 1955 when the station began to install shortwave transmitters once again, first only for diplomatic communications, and then for foreign broadcast in 1958. Thirty-nine <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> were erected for transmitting.|$|R
50|$|Two 25 m high {{antennae}} {{made possible}} {{to communicate with}} Buenos Aires through radio telegraphy. They also erected four 18 m towers for the 100 m per side <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bruce {{received}} the 1932 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award [...] "for his theoretical investigations and field {{developments in the}} domain of directional antennas", and the Franklin Institute's 1935 Longstreth Award for inventing the <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> {{consists}} {{of one to}} three parallel wires suspended above {{the ground in a}} [...] "rhombic" [...] (diamond) shape, supported by poles or towers at each vertex to which the wires are attached by insulators. Each of the four sides are the same length. The length is not critical, typically from one to two wavelengths (Î»). A horizontal <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> (picture, top right) radiates horizontally polarized radio waves at a low elevation angle off the end of the antenna opposite the feedline. Its principal advantages over other types of antenna are its simplicity, high forward gain and wide bandwidth, the ability to operate over a wide range of frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The {{antenna system}} {{consists}} of thirteen masts, each 227 m tall, which {{are arranged in}} two rings around the central mast. The VLF antenna consists of four <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> hung on large insulators on the masts, which are all grounded.|$|R
25|$|Numerous {{antennae}} {{were added}} to the site over the years, each for a specific purpose, particularly after OTC took control of the station. In 1960 two <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennae</b> were installed for use with NASA space missions, bringing the total number of antennae up to 22.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to its use as a simple and effective transmitting antenna (as described above), the rhombic {{can also be used}} as an HF receiving antenna with good gain and directivity. For example, BBC Monitoring's Crowsley Park receiving station has three <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> aligned for reception at azimuths of 37, 57 and 77 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Over twelve {{working days}} the crew built the two-story main house with double wooden walls, a main deposit, an {{emergency}} house, five metal warehouses for supplies, {{housing for the}} dog packs, a power generator and the four towers for the 25 m high <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1924 {{he joined}} the Western Electric Company, and in 1925 became a {{research}} engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he helped develop short-wave radio receivers and field strength measuring equipment, and designed directional antennas for short-wave radio communication, including his celebrated <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> (1931). Karl Jansky used a steerable Bruce array in his earliest radio astronomy experiments, also in 1931.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> can radiate at {{elevation}} angles {{close to}} the horizon or at higher angles depending on its height above ground relative to the operating frequency and its physical construction. Likewise, its beamwidth can be narrow or broad, depending primarily on its length. The shallow radiation angle makes it useful for skywave ("skip") propagation, the dominant mode at shortwave frequencies, in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky reflect from layers in the ionosphere and return to Earth beyond the horizon.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> were {{installed}} on the Parade Ground, and the old post exchange/gymnasium building was converted into a top secret listening post code-named [...] "Station S". Inside [...] "Station S", men and women worked 24 hours a day, listening in on Japanese naval communications, which were transmitted in the Japanese Morse Code. This building is now a private home.|$|R

"Multiple Unit Steerable Antenna" [...] {{refers to}} an array of <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> used for high {{frequency}} (3-30 MHz) trans-Atlantic communication, [...] "steerable" [...] by the act of connecting several antennas together via a phasing circuit, thus achieving maximum antenna gain in the required direction. The Musa connector was developed, perhaps by Bell Laboratories, as a reliable and readily deployed means of achieving the desired configuration.|$|R
5000|$|The GPO {{built in}} an {{experimental}} chain of radio relay stations for television, which used {{the relatively low}} VHF frequency of 195 MHz and frequency modulation with a deviation of 6 MHz per volt. Each relay station consisted essentially of back-to-back <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> {{on opposite sides of}} a hilltop, connected via an amplifier. The frequency was not changed. The system was first tested on March 24, 1949. The stations were located at: ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1930s Friis helped design the radio {{receiver}} used by Karl Jansky for radio astronomy, and with Edmond Bruce invented the <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> widely used for shortwave communications. In 1938 Friis became {{the director of}} the Holmdel Radio Laboratory developing microwave systems, where he and Alfred C. Beck designed the horn reflector antenna, which was widely used in AT&T's national microwave relay network in the 1960s. During World War II, Friis invented a [...] "rocking horse" [...] mechanical scanner for radar used to locate enemy mortars. He also authorized research into the first germanium diodes (Teal, 1942).|$|E
50|$|In {{radio and}} telecommunication, a {{traveling}}-wave antenna is {{a class of}} antenna that uses a traveling wave on a guiding structure as the main radiating mechanism. Their distinguishing feature is that the radio-frequency current that generates the radio waves travels through the antenna in one direction. This {{is in contrast to}} a resonant antenna, such as the monopole or dipole, in which the antenna acts as a resonator, with radio currents traveling in both directions, bouncing {{back and forth between the}} ends of the antenna. An advantage of traveling wave antennas is that since they are nonresonant they often have a wider bandwidth than resonant antennas. Common types of traveling wave antenna are the Beverage antenna and the <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{generalised}} circuit {{is partially}} integrated {{and the physical}} significance of certain terms is discussed. Afterwards, an unattenuated travelling wave of current is postulated as a first approximation to the current along a <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna,</b> and the integration is completed to yield a formula for the radiation impedance of a <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> in free space. The resistive component of the impedance checks with the radiation resistance as listed by Leonard Lewin {{in a discussion of}} a paper by Donald Foster, with Lewin apparently obtaining his formula by the solid angle Poynting vector method.

50|$|Near Dudinka {{there is}} a 462 m tall radio mast which was {{formerly}} used for the CHAYKA radio navigation system. It is a grounded mast with a <b>rhombic</b> cage <b>antenna.</b>|$|R
50|$|Prior to World War II, the rhombic {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular {{point-to-point}} high frequency antenna arrays. After World War II the rhombic largely fell out of favor for shortwave broadcast and point-to-point communications work, being replaced by log periodic antennas and curtain arrays. Larger log periodics provide wider frequency coverage with comparable gain to rhombics. Distributed feed curtains or HRS curtain arrays provided a cleaner pattern, ability to steer the pattern in elevation and azimuth, much higher efficiency, and significantly higher gain in less space. However, <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> are used in cases where the combination of high forward gain (despite the losses described above) and large operating bandwidth cannot be achieved by other means.|$|R

40|$|Can rhombic antennas be {{used for}} {{high-power}} broadcasting? How one of the world's big broadcasters got on the air. Figure 1. Horizontal <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> (from Laport [1]) Introducing the rhombic The first published description of the horizontal <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna,</b> as shown in Figure 1, was in 1931 following its development by Edmond Bruce (1899 - 1973), also known for his earlier Bruce array, and Harald T Friis (1893 - 1976), both then of Bell Telephone Laboratories. The equi-sided rhomboid-shaped antenna was commonly used for overseas radiotelephone and press circuits before and during WWII, for both transmitting and receiving.

5000|$|M.S. Neiman {{made the}} {{significant}} contribution to the development of many areas of radioelectronics. In 1920-1930-s under his leadership and with his participation transmitters of different power and range, and also antenna-feeder systems for different ranges for the greatest Soviet shortwave broadcasting centers were developed. He developed methods of regulating the phase velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves along the antenna wire, which have found wide application in the later traveling wave tubes of UHF and microwave bands, as well as a surface wave antennas. He published the monograph [...] "The transmitting antennas", which for a long time served as a guide for the design of these antennas and was used as the textbook. He created a general theory of frequency stabilization, developed a theory of calculation of passive vibrators. He conducted the study of the phenomenon of flare expiration of the antenna wire, the results of it were used in the design of antennas and super-powerful Soviet shortwave radios. He created the general theory of receive antennas based on an electrodynamic principle of reciprocity, and it became conventional in radio engineering. He carried out a number of theoretical and experimental studies of band <b>antennae</b> (in-phase and <b>rhombic),</b> developed the theory of <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas,</b> invented two advanced systems of <b>rhombic</b> <b>antennas.</b> Also developed the theory of inhomogeneous lines with impedance that varies exponentially. Proposed and developed a general theory and methods of calculation of closed oscillating electromagnetic devices, later known as the [...] "volume resonators", which are the basis of many systems of UHF and microwave bands. He developed a new type of antenna - diffraction antenna (one of its species is slot antenna). Also proposed the theory and method of preparation of the traveling wave along the wire without loss of power. He formulated the general requirements and principles of the building of broadband antennas, discovered and described the phenomenon known as [...] "feeder echo." [...] Together with A.A. Pistolkors he developed the theory of a direct measurement of the traveling wave in the feeders and created the appropriate measuring devices, so called [...] "feeder reflectometers".|$|R

40|$|Uniform illumination, over {{space and}} frequency, of the bottom-side {{ionosphere}} {{is important for}} a vertical incidence ionosonde. Ionospheric tilts and structures produce echoes several tens of degrees from vertical even under quiet conditions. Characteristics of traditional traveling wave Delta and <b>Rhombic</b> <b>antennas</b> offer poor frequency and spatial characteristics. An inverted log periodic antenna (LPA) was designed and built for the new vertical incidence VIPIR/Dynasonde ionosonde at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility.

Objective Vertical incidence ionosonde transmit antennas need to operate over a broad range of frequencies, ideally 300 kHz to 30 MHz, to cover the natural range of ionosphere plasma frequencies.

40|$|In {{applying}} {{the formula for}} the driving point impedance of a radiating electric circuit, as given by the generalized circuit method, it is ^ found that additional terms must be. included. These terms are required {{to account for the}} negative spatial rate of change at which the reactive Power is being returned into the wire from the localized principal wave, retardation being neglected. In the case of a biconical antenna, it is demonstrated that these terms are cancelled by choosing a proper procedure of integration. However, these terms must be retained {{in the case of a}} radiating transmission line. The radiation impedance of a parallel wire line is given and is uniformly distributed along the line. The added attenuation due to radiation losses is considered in the determination of the driving Point impedance of the line. The latter procedure is applicable to a terminated <b>rhombic</b> <b>antenna</b> provided due c ognizance is taken of the non-uniformity of the line.

Although the design is of general application to the reception, in high-noise areas, of long distance transmissions, this work deals in particular with the London-Salisbury circuit, at September noon, 1956, on 21. 47 Mc/s. A basis of theoretical comparison between the performances of different antennas has been proposed. It relies on the technique of replacing a thunder storm by an "equivalent radio transmitter" set up on the frequency to which the receiver is tuned and for which the antenna is designed. A V. H. F. scale model has been used to produce an optimum design for the proposed antenna which is an end-fire array of parasitic elements. The polar diagrams and signal-to-noise performance of the proposed design are derived for several different types of earth mat. The method used for these derivations is substantiated by correlation with practical sampling measurements.
