40|$|A new Ferrofluidics {{exclusion}} seal promises {{improvement in}} controlling "fugitive emissions" -vapors that escape {{into the atmosphere}} from petroleum refining and chemical processing facilities. These are primarily volatile organic compounds, and their emissions are highly regulated by the EPA.

Ferrofluids are magnetic liquids - fluids in which microscopic metal particles have been suspended, allowing the liquid {{to be controlled by}} a magnetic force. The concept was developed {{in the early years of}} the Space program, but never used. Two Avco scientists, however, saw commercial potential in ferrofluids and formed a company.

40|$|In the {{deposition}} of multilayer coatings (say of A and B materials) thicknesses of individual layers {{are of the}} order of few angstroms. The thicknesses of the individual layers are determined by dwell time of substrate underneath each target. Typically the dwell time is {{of the order of}} few seconds depending upon the process conditions. Manual control of accurate dwell time is very difficult. More so, the repeatability of the individual layer thicknesses greatly affects properties of the multilayer coatings. In order to deposit multilayer coatings with controlled layer thicknesses and repeatability a PC based control system is designed and tested. This system consists of a driver circuit power supply and a stepper motor connected to the substrate holder through a <b>rotary</b> <b>feedthrough.</b> A user-friendly software is written in Visual Basic and Visual C++ for driving the stepper motor.

50|$|Magnetic liquid rotary seals {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical seal assemblies called <b>rotary</b> <b>feedthroughs,</b> which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the seal gap, and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid held magnetically between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the drag torque very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, bearing arrangements, and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10−8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 °C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|R

40|$|At the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CBBAF), a 4 GeV {{multipass}} CW {{electron beam}} {{is to be}} accelerated by 338 SRF, 5 -cell niobium cavities operating at a resonant frequency of 1497 MHz. Eight cavities arranged as four pairs comprise a cryomodule, a cryogenically isolated linac subdivision. The frequency is controlled by a mechanical tuner attached to the fist and fifth cell of the cavity which elastically deforms the cavity and thereby alters its resonant frequency. The tuner is driven by a stepper motor mounted external to the cryomodule that transfers torque through two <b>rotary</b> <b>feedthroughs.</b> A linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) mounted on the tuner monitors the displacement, and two limit switches interlock the movement beyond a 400 kHz bandwidth. Since the cavity has a loaded Q of 6. 6. 106, the control system must maintain {{the frequency of the}} cavity to within * 50 Hz of the drive frequency for efficient coupling. This requirement is somewhat difficult to achieve since the difference in thermal contractions of the cavity and the tuner creates a frequency hysteresis of approximately 10 kHz. The cavity is also subject o frequency shifts due to pressure fluctuations of the helium bath as well as radiation pressure. This requires that each cavity be characterized in terms of frequency change as a function of applied motor steps to allow proper tuning operations. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical performance of the cavity tuner during the commissioning and operation of the cryomodules manufactured todate. I...|$|R
40|$|Conformal Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of {{nanoparticles}} is an now {{an established}} nanofabrication concept employed by many researchers for {{applications such as}} creating diffusion barriers, tuning catalysis, or masking a toxic particle core with a biocompatible shell. To conformally coat many grams of nanoparticles with ALD, long precursor soaking steps, fluidized beds, vibrating stages, or <b>rotary</b> <b>feedthroughs</b> are typically needed. While these impressive advancements in ALD techniques dominate literature searches of particle ALD coating, such methods {{may lead to a}} more time-intensive or cost-prohibitive process than what is required by many typical academic researchers. Thus we have performed this study to explore the limits of static planar ALD particle coating, the simplest method to coat nanoparticles with an ALD film. Using an Arradiance GEMStar 6 ALD system, we have explored a fast and simple static ALD particle coating process. Our protocol produces relatively small, but still academically useful, quantities of uniformally ALD-coated nanospheres. This process can be scaled up to nanoparticle samples in the tens of milligram to gram range. We have demonstrated that we can achieve silica or titania spherical particle synthesis, and then uniform ALD coating on the nanoparticles, all within 8 - 10 hours. The diameter of the chemically synthesized silica and titania nanoparticles is tunable from 50 nm up to greater than a micron. The refractive index of the titania nanoparticles is tunable from approximately 1. 7 to 2. 7. This report will be most useful for researchers who are new to particle ALD, or who want to experiment with core particles conformally covered with ALD shells before moving to a more complicated, higher throughput ALD method. We provide details for particle synthesis, storage, and ALD coating along with a comparison to more conventional approaches. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) show rich phase {{diagrams}} {{with various}} magnetic and electronic phases {{that arise from}} the complex interplay between spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom. The most prominent class of materials, which has attracted {{a lot of attention}} in the last decades, are probably high-temperature superconductors (HTS), in which the resitivity drops to zero below a critical temperature. Further examples are different kind of complex ordering phenomena, for example a modulation of the charge, spin or orbital density. In some systems a coexistence of energetically close phases is found. X-ray diffraction experiments are sensitive to a periodic arrangement of an electron-density modulation. If tuned to an absorption edge of one of the contained elements, a virtual transition from the core states to the valence states probes the occupation of the intermediate state and makes the process spectroscopically sensitive to the scattering center. Many of the interesting x-ray absorption edges of TMOs are in the energy interval between 400 and 3000 eV, in which also the absorption in air is strong. In Chap. 2 we report about commissioning and building up a novel ultar-high vacuum (UHV) diffractometer for soft x-ray diffraction experiments, which is meant as an user endstation at P 04 beamline of the new synchrotron facility PETRA III. The instrument is based on a sufficiently large vacuum chamber with two differentially pumped <b>rotary</b> <b>feedthroughs</b> for an independent sample and detector rotation. The large detector circle allows to use complex detector setups, like an in-vacuum CCD and polarization analyzer. Therefore, the diffractometer is well suited for new techniques of gaining importance, like coherent x-ray diffraction (CXD), in which the finestructure of a diffraction reflex reveals information about the domain-wall dynamics, and like resonant soft x-ray diffraction (RSXD), which shows its full power when combined with a polarization analysis of the diffracted photons. In first experiments at DESY, BESSY II, and FLASH, the new machine has been successfully operated and helped to obtain data in unprecedented precision. Data recorded from multilayer reflectors, which will be used for the setup of the new polarization analyzer, and data that were recorded with the new CCD detector are presented in this chapter as well. Further data, from a RSXD experiment on magnetite are presented in Chap. 4. In Chap. 3 we report about a moderately surface-sensitive RSXD experiment in which for the first time charge stripe order in the proto-typical HTS La 1. 88 Sr 0. 12 CuO 4 (LSCO) was found. The strong similarity of the resonant diffraction spectra from the charge order reflex in LSCO to those from an La 1. 48 Nd 0. 4 Sr 0. 12 CuO 4 (LNSCO) reference sample, in which the existence of charge stripe order is well established, clearly shows the similar electronic origin. While charge stripe peaks were found in all LSCO samples that were studied, including in-situ cleaved and ex-situ polished ones, we could not find a reflex with bulk-sensitive hard x-ray diffraction experiments. From this we conclude that LSCO is close to the formation of a charge stripe order that already the reduced dimensionality in the near-surface region is sufficient to stabilize them in a layer of at least 5 nm thickness. In Chap. 4 we present a RSXD experiment from the (0 0 1 / 2) charge-orbital order reflex in Fe 3 O 4. The azimuthal dependence of the linear dichroism shows a low-symmetry pattern, which reflects a strong monoclinic symmetry of the electronic 3 dwave func-tion. We found this monoclinic deviation prior to the refinements from the pseudo-orthorhombic to the monoclinic crystal structure, which was published this year. From the orbital ordering models that were proposed so far only a calculation, which is based on a complex-coefficient orbital ordering, could predict our experiment correctly. This theory further predicts a circular dichroism in the diffraction signal, which we indeed found in our experiment. In Chap. 5 we report about our results of CXD experiments on doped titanates, in which a coexistence of charge-ordered insulating an metallic regions was found. Charge ordered regions are characterized by superstructure reflections. Coherent illumination of these regions allows to produce an interference pattern that reflects information on the spatial arrangement of the insulating regions. The temporal evolution of this pattern provides insight into the dynamics due to domain reorganizations and domain-wall movements. First experiments at the ESRF and BESSY II were seriously limited due to the lacking stability of the sample setup. CXD experiments at BESSY II and PETRA III with a new sample setup, which was developed in cooperation with the University of Amsterdam, have shown that domain-wall dynamics take place on even shorter time scales than accessible. RSXD and CXD are powerful tools to study various properties of TMOs, ranging from the local electronicdwave symmetry in magnetite to the reorganization of mesoscopic domains. The new UHV diffractometer will allow to perform these kind of experiments with high precision and modern detector setups.
