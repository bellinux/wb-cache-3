The print is a <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> of the pattern upon the digit that made it. The pattern on one hand is, as already said, a <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> of a similar pattern as it shows on the other. In the various processes by which prints are multiplied, the patterns may be reversed and re-reversed. Thus, if a finger is impressed on a lithographic stone, the impressions from that stone are reversals of the impression made by the same finger upon paper. If made on transfer paper and thence transferred to stone, there is a re-reversal. There are even more varied possibilities when photography is employed. It is worth recollecting that there are twelve capital letters in the English alphabet which, if printed in block type, are unaffected by being reversed. They are A.H.I.M.O.T.U.V.W.X.Y.Z. Some symbols do the same, such as, * + - = :. These and the letters H.O.I.X. have the further peculiarity of appearing unaltered when upside down.|$|E

6000|$|The {{provisional}} list {{of standard}} patterns {{published in the}} Phil. Trans. was not appropriate for this purpose. It related chiefly to thumbs, and consequently omitted the tented arch; it also referred to the left hand, but in the following tabulations the right hand has been used; and its numbering is rather inconvenient. The present set of fifty-three patterns has faults, and cannot be considered in any way as final, but it was suitable for our purposes and may be convenient to others; as Mr. Collins worked wholly by it, it may be distinguished as the [...] "C. set." [...] The banded patterns, 24-31, are very rarely found on the fingers, but being common on the thumb, were retained, on the chance of our requiring the introduction of thumb patterns into the tabulations. The numerals refer to the patterns as seen in impressions of the right hand only. [They would be equally true for the patterns as seen on the fingers themselves of the left hand.] For impressions of the left hand the numerals up to 7 inclusive would be the same, but those of all the rest would be changed. These are arranged in couplets, the {{one member of the}} couplet being a <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> of the other, those in each couplet being distinguished by severally bearing an odd and an even number. Therefore, in impressions of the left hand, 8 would have to be changed into 9, and 9 into 8; 10 into 11, and 11 into 10; and so on, up to the end, viz. 52 and 53. The numeral 54 was used to express nondescript patterns.|$|E

40|$|Summary. 1. Sleep was {{studied in}} the diurnal ro-dent Eutamias ibiricus, chronically {{implanted}} with EEG and EMG electrodes. Analysis of the distri-bution of wakefulness, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep over the 24 h period (LD 12 :] 2) showed that total sleep time was 27. 5 % of recording time dur-ing the 12 h light period and 74. 4 % during the 12 h dark period. Spectral analysis of the sleep EEG revealed a progressive decay in delta power density in NREM sleep during darkness. Power density of the higher frequencies increased {{at the end of}} darkness. Power density of the higher fre-quencies decreased and that of the lower frequen-cies increased uring light. 2. Analysis of the distribution of vigilance states under three different photoperiods (LD 18 : 6; 12 : 12; 6 : 18) revealed that changes in daylength mainly resulted in a redistribution of sleep and wakefulness over light and darkness. Under long days the percentage of sleep during light was enhanced. The time course of delta power density in NREM sleep was characterized by a long rising part and a short falling part under long days, while a <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> emerged under short days. As a consequence, the power density during light was relatively high under long days. 3. After 24 h sleep deprivation by forced activi-ty, no significant changes in the percentage ofwake-fulness and NREM were observed, whereas REM sleep was slightly enhanced.

40|$|Only a {{few decades}} ago a common {{perception}} prevailed that the historic­al Native Americans were very prone to violence and warfare. Scalping and torture were seen as a specific custom attached into their ideology and sociocultural ethos. However in the 1960 s a completely <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> started to emerge, following the course of other worldwide movements, such as ethnic rights, pan-Indianism, ecological conscience, revisionist historiography and so on. Immediately the Native American people came to be seen as the victims of the European colonialism and the Whites were the bad guys who massacred innocent women and children, either at Sand Creek or in Vietnam. Books were written in which the historians pointed out that the practice of scalping was actually not present in the Americas before the whites came. This theory drew sustenance from some early colonial accounts, especially from the Dutch and New England colonies, where it was documented that a special bounty was offered for Indian scalps. According to this idea, the practice of scalping among the Indians escalated only after this. On the other hand, the blame fell on the Iroquois tribesmen, whose cruel fighting spread terror throughout the seventeenth century, when they expanded an empire in the north eastern wilderness. This accords with those theorists who wanted to maintain a more balanced view of the diffusion of scalping and torture, agreeing that these traits were indeed present in Pre-Columbian America, but limited only to the Iroquoians of the east. Colonial American history has been rewritten every now and then. In the 1980 s, and in the field of archaeology especially, a completely new set of insights have arisen. There has been a secondary burial of the myth of Noble Savage and a return of the old Wild Indian idea, but this time stripped of its cartoon stereo­typical attachments. The Indians are now seen as being like any other human beings, with their usual mixture of vices and virtues. Understanding this, one may approach such a topic as scalping and torture without more bias than when reading of any practice of atrocities in human history...|$|E
40|$|In {{the chicken}} the {{transition}} of a poikilotherm to a homeotherm reaction upon cold exposure {{takes place in the}} perinatal period between pipping and hatching. However, newly hatched chicks cannot maintain their body temperature within narrow limits after cold exposure. The fact that relatively little attention was payed on the role of thyroid hormones in the thermoregulatory reaction to cold of young chicks was probably due to the hypothetically long latention time that was thought to be necessary to bring about changes in secretory activity by cold stimulation. However, more recently, rapid changes (within hours) of thyroid hormone concentrations upon cold exposure were described in the chickens and the quail. In this study, changes in circulating T 3 and T 4 concentrations upon cold exposure of young chicks during the first two weeks were followed, that means during the period wherein NST (non-shivering thermogenesis), if it exists at all, should be progressively replaced by ST (shivering thermogenesis). Because of the importance of feeding condition on thyroid hormone levels, the experiments were carried out with and without a preceeding fasting period. In all experiments a short-term cold exposure of young chickens (1 - 11 days) fed ad lib decreased T 3 but increased T 4 levels while a <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> was found after short cold exposure of the fasted animals. However, after prolonged cold stimulus (15 degrees C) of young chickens fed ad lib, plasma T 3 was also significantly elevated over that of controls whereas T 4 levels returned to normal values. A prolonged warm treatment (37 degrees C) of young chickens fed ad lib resulted in significantly lower T 3 and higher T 4 concentrations. After a prolonged cold treatment no differences in T 4 or T 3 response upon TRH were found whereas the warm treatment abolished these responses upon TRH. However, a cold treatment at the stage of incubation during which the hypothalamo-hypophyseal control of thyroid function is established (dag 10 - 14) enhanced the T 4 response to TRH with a long lasting effect extending to the posthatch period. Since T 3 is thought to be the active form of thyroid hormones with regard to thermopoiesis we have studied more specifically the effect of blocking peripheral conversion of T 4 on thermoregulatory abilities in young chicks and the influence of temperature treatment on monodeiodination capacity. The lower rectal temperatures following the interference with the peripheral monodeiodination of T 4, the effect being more pronounced at the lower ambient temperature, are indicative for a preponderant role of T 3 on thermogenesis.

40|$|Data from 10, 126 {{earthquakes}} {{that occurred}} in the southern California region between 1934 and 1963 have been synthesized in the attempt to understand better their relationship to regional geologic structure, which is here dominated by a system of faults related mainly to the San Andreas system. Most of these faults have been considered “active” from physiographic evidence, but both geologic and short-term seismic criteria for “active” versus “inactive” faults are generally inadequate. Of the large historic earthquakes that have been associated with surficial fault displacements, most and perhaps all were on major throughgoing faults having a previous history of extensive Quaternary displacements. The same relationship holds for most earthquakes down to magnitude 6. 0, but smaller shocks are much more randomly spread throughout the region, and most are not clearly associated with any mappable surficial faults. Virtually all areas of high seismicity in this region fall within areas having numerous Quaternary fault scarps, but not all intensely faulted areas have been active during this particular 29 -year period. Strain-release maps show high activity in the Salton trough, the Agua Blanca-San Miguel fault region of Baja California, most of the Transverse Ranges, the central Mojave Desert, and the Owens Valley-southern Sierra Nevada region. Areas of low activity include the San Diego region, the western and easternmost Mojave Desert, and the southern San Joaquin Valley. Because these areas also generally lack Quaternary faults, they probably represent truly stable blocks. In contrast, regions of low seismicity during this period that show widespread Quaternary faulting include the San Andreas fault within and north of the Transverse Ranges, the Garlock fault, and several quiescent zones along major faults within otherwise very active regions. We suspect that seismic quiescence in large areas may be temporary and that they represent likely candidates for future large earthquakes. Without more adequate geodetic control, however, it is not known that strain is necessarily accumulating in all of these areas. Even in areas of demonstrated regional shearing, the relative importance of elastic strain accumulation versus fault slippage is unknown, although slippage is clearly not taking place everywhere along major “active” faults of the region. Recurrence curves of earthquake magnitude versus frequency are presented for six tectonically distinct 8500 -km^ 2 areas within the region. They suggest either that an area of this small size or that a sample period of only 29 years is insufficient for establishing valid recurrence expectancies; on this basis the San Andreas fault would be the least hazardous zone of the region, because only a few small earthquakes have occurred here during this particular period. Although recurrence expectancies apparently break down for these smaller areas, historic records suggest that the calculated recurrence rate of 52 years for M = 8. 0 earthquakes for the entire region may well be valid. Neither a fault map nor the 29 -year seismic record provides sufficient information for detailed seismic zoning maps; not only are many other geologic factors important in determining seismic risk, but the strain-release or epicenter map by itself may give a partially <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> of future seismic expectance. Seismic and structural relationships suggest that the fault theory still provides the most satisfactory explanation of earthquakes in this region...|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of pictures over words is only evident when visual similarity {{is not a}} reliable cue; because it takes longer to understand pictures than words (Snodgrass & McCullough, 1986). Pictures are only superior to words for list learning because differentiation is easier for pictures (Dominowski & Gadlin, 1968). In <b>reverse</b> <b>picture</b> superiority {{it was observed that}} learning was much slower when the responses were pictures (Postman, 1978). Words produced a faster response than pictures and pictures did not have an advantages of having easier access to sematic memory or superior effect over words for dual-coding theory (Amrhein, McDaniel & Waddill 2002). Similarly, studies where response time deadlines have been implemented, the reserve superiroity effect was reported. This is related to the dual-process model of familiarity and recollection. When deadlines to the response were short, the process of familiarity was present, along with an increased tendency to recall words over pictures. When response deadlines were longer, the process of recollection was being utilized, and a strong picture superiority effect was present. In addition, equivalent response time was reported for pictures and words for intelligence comparison (Paivio & Marschark, 1980). Contrary to the assumption that pictures have faster access to the same semantic code than words do; all semantic information is stored in a single system. The only difference is that pictures and words access different features of the semantic code (te Linde, 1982).|$|R
