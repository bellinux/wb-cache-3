5|$|The {{relationship}} between sections 3 and 4 and parliamentary sovereignty has been commented on most extensively. The most common criticism {{has been of}} the implied limitations on legislative supremacy. Opponents of this criticism has questioned both its factual accuracy and its suggestion that the weakening of parliamentary sovereignty should be avoided. They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive features of this change. The limits of courts' powers have also been queried. The <b>retroactivity</b> of law making is one criticism related {{to the rule of}} law, although the advancement of human rights is seen as a positive feature also associated with the rule of law. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the imposition of the judiciary on parliament's domain, these have also been challenged.|$|E
25|$|Works of {{nationals}} of UCC countries, or works {{first published}} in such a country (regardless of the author's nationality), were subject to copyright in Russia if the works were first published on or after May 27, 1973. Because of the Russian reservation concerning the <b>retroactivity</b> of the Berne Convention, this applied {{whether or not the}} UCC country had also signed the Berne Convention.|$|E
25|$|The {{dissenting opinion}} {{said that the}} legislators had {{explicitly}} made the law non-retroactive and, therefore, should not be applied to Wilson.

The dissenters argued that the precedents the majority relied upon involved legislation with no prohibitions against <b>retroactivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|With the {{accession}} of Russia to the Berne Convention, Soviet and Russian {{works that}} were copyrighted in Russia in 1995 became copyrighted outside of Russia. By {{virtue of the}} <b>retroactivity</b> of the Russian copyright law of 1993, this also included many pre-1973 Soviet works. In the United States, these works became copyrighted on January 1, 1996, the effective date of the U.S. Uruguay Round Agreements Act, if they were still copyrighted in Russia on that date. In the countries that had bilateral treaties with the USSR, pre-1973 Soviet works (from any of the fifteen SSRs) were copyrighted even before.|$|E
25|$|All works {{copyright}}ed in Russia in 1995, when Russia {{joined the}} Berne Convention, became copyrighted in other Berne countries. By {{virtue of the}} <b>retroactivity</b> of the Russian copyright law of 1993, this also included many pre-1973 Soviet works, namely all works published in 1945 or later and also older works of authors who died or were rehabilitated in 1945 or later (or 1941 for authors who lived during the Great Patriotic War), if these works were first published in the Russian SFSR (or later in Russia) or the author had become {{a citizen of the}} Russian Federation after the demise of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Many Russian {{scholars}} {{agreed that}} this provision from the implementation act made the law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights on Soviet works {{on which the}} much shorter copyright terms from Soviet times had already expired. This also applied to neighbouring rights on performances, phonograms, and broadcasts. Gavrilov presented a dissenting opinion, stating that while {{this might have been}} the intention, the wording did not actually have that effect. Elst argued that the 1993 law would have been inconsistent and contain several meaningless provisions if it were not retroactive. In the United States, the general consensus was that the Russian 1993 law was retroactive. In a ruling in 2006, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the <b>retroactivity</b> of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their old, Soviet 25-year term had already expired.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} act {{for the new}} copyright law, law no. 5352-1 of July 9, 1993, {{stated that}} the copyright provisions from the 1991 Fundamentals were invalidated. It also stated that the new copyright law applied to all works on which the 50-year term for copyrights and neighbouring rights had not yet elapsed in 1993. Subsequently, a discussion amongst copyright specialists erupted about whether this made the law applied retroactively, restoring copyrights on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. The question was resolved definitively only in 2006, when the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the <b>retroactivity</b> of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their old, Soviet 25-year term had already expired. For the neighbouring rights, which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively. The 1993 copyright law thus rendered the old Soviet legislation largely obsolete in Russia; it remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.|$|E
25|$|In response, the Legislative Council {{proposed}} {{to restrict the}} right of such persons by adding another requirement {{that one of the}} child's parents must have been a permanent resident {{at the time of the}} child's birth. On 10 July 1997, the Legislative Council passed the Immigration Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance, which introduced a certification system. Under this system, any person who claimed to have the right of abode in Hong Kong could prove their status only by showing a certificate of right of abode issued by the Director of Immigration of Hong Kong. This certificate could be applied for only in mainland China, and it would not be issued until the application obtained a one-way permit to cross the border to Hong Kong from the Chinese Public Security Bureau. The amendment was made retroactive to 1 July 1997, which meant that even children who had already arrived in Hong Kong with previously sufficient legal documentation would have been stripped of their right for lack of a certificate that did not yet exist when they entered Hong Kong. The <b>retroactivity</b> of the amendment triggered a number of test cases in court, which eventually came before the Court of Final Appeal as Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration and Chan Kam Nga v. Director of Immigration.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia, {{joined by}} Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented from the {{decision}} of the Court, arguing that the new more lenient minimums don't apply to pre-2010 offenders. Scalia saw the silence of the Act on <b>retroactivity</b> as a reason that the Court should not apply it themselves. [...] "The canon of constitutional avoidance [...] no application here," [...] Scalia argued, [...] " [...] although many observers viewed the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio under the prior law as having a racially disparate impact, only intentional discrimination may violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause." ...|$|E
2500|$|This Russian {{interpretation}} {{was heavily}} criticized by Western countries {{and in particular}} by the United States. Russian scholars, however, repeatedly (and, {{in the opinion of}} Elst, rightly) pointed out {{that there had been a}} very prominent precedent: in 1989, when the U.S. had joined the Berne Convention, they also had denied the <b>retroactivity</b> of the treaty. From 1989 until 1995, the U.S. only respected the copyrights under the Berne Convention on foreign works from another country that were published on or after the later of that country's adherence date to the Berne Convention and March 1, 1989 (the adherence date of U.S.), and on foreign works from a UCC country according to the provisions of the UCC, which meant on works that were published after the later of September 16, 1955 (the date the UCC entered in force for the U.S. and the other initial signatories) and the adherence date of the foreign UCC country. In the case of Russian or Soviet works, this meant that until 1996, the U.S. continued to recognize only copyrights on Soviet works published after May 27, 1973. The U.S. faced harsh critique for its unilateral denouncement of the <b>retroactivity</b> of the Berne Convention defined in article 18(1) BC. Ultimately, the U.S. had to reverse its position on that issue. It implemented the TRIPS agreement (a precondition to becoming a WTO member) in its Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), which was signed into law on December 8, 1994. The URAA effectively restored the copyright in the U.S. on foreign works on January 1, 1996, if those works were until then not copyrighted in the U.S. because of a failure to meet the U.S. [...] formalities (such as not bearing a copyright notice, or lacking registration with the U.S. Copyright Office) or because of a lack of international treaties between the U.S. and the source country of the work, if the work was still copyrighted in its source country on January 1, 1996.|$|E
2500|$|Russian {{scholars}} have disputed this <b>retroactivity</b> issue at length. Gavrilov, for instance, who had {{argued for the}} Russian reservation to the Berne Convention, kept defending it, while others disagreed. Maggs and Sergeyev, for instance, pointed out in 2000 that the reservation was inadmissible under article 30(1) of the Berne Convention; Podshibikhin and Leontiev agreed in 2002. [...] The modification of the copyright law through law 72-FL in 2004 refuelled the discussion, because this law added a new paragraph 4 to article 5 of the 1993 copyright law which clearly stated under which conditions foreign works were copyrighted in Russia, using a wording that corresponded in essence to articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the Berne Convention. Although law 72-FL indeed was intended to rescind the non-retroactivity reservation, thereby restoring copyrights on pre-1973 foreign works, the common practice in Russia continued treating pre-1973 foreign works as uncopyrighted.|$|E
2500|$|In its {{declaration}} of accession, Russia made a reservation regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention, {{stating that the}} treaty [...] "shall not extend to the works which, at {{the date of entry}} into force of the said Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, are already in the public domain in its territory." [...] This statement effectively denied the <b>retroactivity</b> of the Berne Convention for foreign works within Russia. This was of some importance because of the issue of foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the UCC. Such works had never been eligible to copyright in the Soviet Union or in Russia. Under §18(2) of the Berne Convention, they should have become copyrighted in 1995 because that article only exempted works that once were copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia. The reservation made by Russia used a slightly different phrasing, just stating that works that were in the public domain in Russia in 1995 would not be reprotected. As pre-1973 foreign works were not copyrighted at all and thus in the public domain in Russia in 1995, such foreign works remained in the public domain in Russia.|$|E

Nevertheless, Gavrilov continued arguing in favour of the non-protection of pre-1973 foreign works, arguing {{that this was not}} so much a reservation to the Berne Convention but merely an interpretation, whereas others considered the 2004 amendments to finally do away with this reservation and claimed that law 72-FL restored copyright in Russia on pre-1973 foreign works. According to the Russian representative at the negotiations on Russia's accession to the WTO, law 72-FL indeed was intended to rescind the non-retroactivity reservation, thereby restoring copyrights on pre-1973 foreign works. The Russian copyright law (already before 2004) also considered international treaties self-executing and to take precedence over the Russian law (article 3). The common practice in Russia nevertheless did not change; pre-1973 foreign works were commonly considered to be uncopyrighted in Russia due to this reservation.|$|E
2500|$|The Implementation Act 231-FL {{made the}} new {{legislation}} applicable also to legal relations from before the coming in force of the new law, as far as new rights granted by the new law were concerned (<b>retroactivity).</b> In article 5 of the implementation act, the new law was made applicable to all new works, {{as well as to}} new rights that arose on pre-existing works. Existing rights on already existing works were henceforth governed by the rules of the new law, but initial authorship was to be determined by the laws in effect at the time a work was created. Article 6 of the implementation act specified that the 70-year copyright term was applicable in all cases where the old 50-year copyright term had not yet expired by January 1, 1993, and to all cases from before August 3, 1993 where a legal entity was the copyright holder - this applies to [...] "whole works" [...] in the form of cinematographic, television, radio works, as well as print periodicals and compilations, which were created by a state corporation, but individual authors such as script writers, artists, composers etc. retain copyright for their respective parts of the work. In this latter case, the copyright was to expire 70 years after the work was first lawfully disclosed, or 70 years after the creation of the work, if the work was undisclosed. Previously, the 70-year copyright term had applied only to works whose 50-year term had not yet expired in 2004, and thus the new Part IV of the Civil Code removed a number of works from the public domain, namely all those where the 50-year term had expired in the years 1994-2003: these became copyrighted again (with a 70-year term) under the new intellectual property legislation.|$|E
2500|$|The Berne Convention {{also became}} {{effective}} for Russia on March 13, 1995. The Berne Convention is retroactive in principle: {{according to its}} article 18, it applies to all works that are copyrighted in their source country (the country where the first publication of the work occurred) {{on the day the}} treaty enters in force with respect to a joining country such as Russia. Article 18(2) adds that if [...] "through the expiry of the term of protection which was previously granted, a work has fallen into the public domain of the country where protection is claimed, that work shall not be protected anew." [...] Hence works that were copyrighted in Russia on March 13, 1995 became copyrighted in all other Berne Countries on that date. Under these provisions, foreign works not formerly copyrighted in Russia should also have become copyrighted in Russia. Russian legal scholars had warned of this, and the government feared the impacts on the trade balance with Western countries if Russian publishers would suddenly have to pay royalties for foreign works. In its declaration of accession, Russia therefore made a reservation regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention, stating that the treaty [...] "shall not extend to the works which, at the date of entry into force of the said Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, are already in the public domain in its territory." [...] For Russian and Soviet work that originated in Russia, this was just a restatement of article 18(1) of the Berne Convention; but as far as foreign works were concerned, this reservation effectively denied the <b>retroactivity</b> of the Berne Convention within Russia. This was of some importance because of the issue of foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the UCC. Such works had never been eligible to copyright in the Soviet Union or in Russia. Under §18(2) of the Berne Convention, they should have become copyrighted in 1995 because that article only exempted works that once were copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia.

As pre-1973 foreign works were not copyrighted at all and thus in the public domain in Russia in 1995, such works remained in the public domain in Russia. Russia thus got rather favorable conditions when it joined Berne Convention: Russian and Soviet works became copyrighted retroactively in other Berne countries, but pre-1973 works from those other countries did not become copyrighted in Russia.|$|E
