50|$|Since the 1950s, {{evidence}} has existed that neurons {{in the central}} nervous system generate an action potential, or voltage spike, that travels both through the axon to signal the next neuron and backpropagates through the dendrites sending a <b>retrograde</b> <b>signal</b> to its presynaptic signaling neurons. This current decays significantly with travel length along the dendrites, so effects are predicted to be more significant for neurons whose synapses are near the postsynaptic cell body, with magnitude depending mainly on sodium-channel density in the dendrite. It is also dependent on the shape of the dendritic tree and, more importantly, on the rate of signal currents to the neuron. On average, a backpropagating spike loses about half its voltage after traveling nearly 500 micrometres.|$|E
50|$|Neural {{backpropagation}} {{can occur}} {{in one of two}} ways. First, during the initiation of an axonal action potential, the cell body, or soma, can become depolarized as well. This depolarization can spread through the cell body towards the dendritic tree where there are voltage-gated sodium channels. The depolarization of these voltage-gated sodium channels can then result in the propagation of a dendritic action potential. Such backpropagation is sometimes referred to as an echo of the forward propagating action potential (Staley 2004). It has also been shown that an action potential initiated in the axon can create a <b>retrograde</b> <b>signal</b> that travels in the opposite direction (Hausser 2000). This impulse travels up the axon eventually causing the cell body to become depolarized, thus triggering the dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels. As described in the first process, the triggering of dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels leads to the propagation of a dendritic action potential.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRetrograde {{signaling}} {{plays an}} important role in synaptic homeostasis, growth, and plasticity. A <b>retrograde</b> <b>signal</b> at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of Drosophila controls the homeostasis of neurotransmitter release. Here, we show that this <b>retrograde</b> <b>signal</b> is regulated by the postsynaptic activity of Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Reducing CaMKII activity in muscles enhances the signal and increases neurotransmitter release, while constitutive activation of CaMKII in muscles inhibits the signal and decreases neurotransmitter release. Postsynaptic inhibition of CaMKII increases the number of presynaptic, vesicle-associated T bars at the active zones. Consistently, we show that glutamate receptor mutants also have a higher number of T bars; this increase is suppressed by postsynaptic activation of CaMKII. Furthermore, we demonstrate that presynaptic BMP receptor wishful thinking is required for the <b>retrograde</b> <b>signal</b> to function.

It is currently unclear if <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> in response to constitutive mitochondrial biogenesis defects is mediated by the same pathways as those triggered during acute mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, it is unknown if <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> can effectively improve plant performance when mitochondrial function is constitutively impaired. Here we show that <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> in mutants defective in mitochondrial proteins RNA polymerase rpotmp or prohibitin atphb 3 can be suppressed by knocking out the transcription factor ANAC 017. Genome-wide RNA-seq expression analysis revealed that ANAC 017 is almost solely responsible for the most dramatic transcriptional changes common to rpotmp and atphb 3 mutants, regulating classical marker genes such as alternative oxidase 1 a (AOX 1 a) and also previously-uncharacterised DUF 295 genes that appear to be new retrograde markers. In contrast, ANAC 017 does not regulate intra-mitochondrial gene expression or transcriptional changes unique to either rpotmp or atphb 3 genotype, suggesting the existence of currently unknown signalling cascades. The data show that ANAC 017 function extends beyond common retrograde transcriptional responses and affects downstream protein abundance and enzyme activity of alternative oxidase, as well as steady-state energy metabolism in atphb 3 plants. Furthermore, detailed growth analysis revealed that ANAC 017 -dependent <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> provides benefits for growth and productivity in plants with mitochondrial defects.

40|$|Long-term {{changes of}} {{synaptic}} transmission in slices of rat visual cortex were induced by intracellular tetanization: bursts of short depolarizing pulses applied through the intracellular electrode without concomitant presynaptic stimulation. Long-term synaptic changes after this purely postsynaptic induction {{were associated with}} alterations of release indices, thus providing a case for <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> at neocortical synapses. Both long-term potentiation and long-term depression were accompanied by presynaptic changes, indicating that <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> can achieve both up- and down-regulation of transmitter release. The direction and {{the magnitude of the}} amplitude changes induced by a prolonged intracellular tetanization depended on the initial properties of the input. The inputs with initially high paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) ratio, indicative of low release probability, were most often potentiated. The inputs with initially low PPF ratio, indicative of high release probability, were usually depressed or did not change. Thus, prolonged postsynaptic activity can lead to normalization of the weights of nonactivated synapses. The dependence of polarity of synaptic modi®cations on initial PPF disappeared when plastic changes were induced with a shorter intracellular tetanization, or when the NO signalling pathway was interrupted by inhibition of NO synthase activity or by application of NO scavengers. This indicates that the NO-dependent <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> system has a relatively high activation threshold. Long-term synaptic modi®cations, induced by a weak postsynaptic challenge or under blockade of NO signalling, were nevertheless associated with presynaptic changes. This suggests the existence of another <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> system, additional to the high threshold, NO-dependent system. Therefore, our data provide a clear case for <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> at neocortical synapses and indicate that multiple <b>retrograde</b> <b>signalling</b> systems, part of which are NO-dependent, are involved...|$|R
40|$|Action {{potential}} firing or depolarization of the {{postsynaptic neuron}} can induce a transient suppression of inhibitory synaptic inputs to the depolarized neuron in the cerebellum and hippocampus. This phenomenon, termed depolarizationinduced suppression of inhibition (DSI), is initiated postsynaptically by {{an elevation of}} intracellular Ca 2 � concentration ([Ca 2 �] i) and is expressed presynaptically as a suppression of the transmitter release. It is, therefore, thought that some <b>retrograde</b> <b>signal</b> must exist from the depolarized postsynaptic neurons to the presynaptic terminals. Recent studies on hippocampal neurons have revealed that endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) {{play a key role}} as a retrograde messenger. There are, however, conflicting reports that glutamate may be a candidate retrograde messenger for cerebellar DSI that acts on presynaptic group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). In this study, we examined whether endocannabinoids mediate <b>retrograde</b> <b>signal</b> for cerebellar DSI. We recorded IPSCs from Purkinje cells by stimulating putative basket cell axons in mouse cerebellar slices. DSI was readily induced in evoked IPSCs by a depolarizing pulse train. We found that DSI was completely occluded by a cannabinoid agonist, WIN 55, 212 - 2, was totally eliminated by a specific antagonist of the type 1 cannabinoid (CB 1) receptor, SR 141716 A, and was deficient in the CB 1 knock-out mouse. In contrast, a group II mGluR-specific agonist, (2 S, 2 �R, 3 �R) - 2 -(2 �, 3 �-dicarboxycyclopropyl) glycine, did not completely occlude DSI, and an mGluR antagonist, (RS) -�-methyl- 4 -carboxyphenylglycine, had no depressant effect on DSI.
