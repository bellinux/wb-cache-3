50|$|The {{two most}} common types of cutting are done with {{abrasive}} coated line - <b>release</b> <b>cutting</b> or pull cutting.

There are many factors in who will win the event and include {{the size of the}} kite, the quality of the kite, the quality of the line, the quality of the abrasive on the line, the quality and size of the spool, the spool handler, initial contact, the skill of the person flying the kite, and the wind conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} the first {{production}} of Powell and Pressburger {{not to be a}} major box office success. With the war over Powell was forced by the studio to completely re-edit the film for the U.S. <b>release,</b> <b>cutting</b> over 20 minutes to make the film shorter and faster moving, adding narration by Raymond Massey, and filming [...] "bookends" [...] which introduced Kim Hunter as Sergeant Johnson's girlfriend to make the film more contemporary. At the time of filming, Hunter and Massey were preparing to film A Matter of Life and Death for Powell. Powell filmed Hunter's sequences with Sweet on an English set simulating New York City where the couple, now married, presented the film as a flashback similar to the openings of The Way to the Stars and 12 O'Clock High. Sweet was actually filmed in New York with the sequences combined. The film was fully restored by the British Film Institute in the late 1970s and the new print was hailed as a masterwork of British cinema. It has since been reissued on DVD in both the UK and USA.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to evaluate different methods of improving seed production, seed germination, seedling survival and seedling growth when using natural regeneration with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seed trees and shelterwoods. Two experiments and a survey study were used to evaluate effects of (i) shelterwood density and seedling height at release on survival, damage and height growth of advance growth seedlings of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), (ii) <b>release</b> <b>cutting</b> on seed production, seed quality and needle nutrient contents in seed trees, (iii) weather and seed tree size on seed production, (iv) correlation between needle nutrient contents and seed production and seed weight, and (v) scarification in relation to seed fall. For all advance growth seedling sizes, growth was highest at shelterwood densities of 80 - 160 stems ha⁻¹, whereas the optimum density for survival was about 160 stems ha⁻¹. Height, top-shoot length and top-shoot diameter in seedlings the year before <b>release</b> <b>cutting</b> showed significant positive correlations with both survival and height growth. A majority of the small seedlings (< 20 cm) wilted the spring after overstorey <b>release</b> <b>cutting,</b> probably as a combined effect of drought in the humus and “light shock”. The only identified damaging agent causing significant mortality was pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L.). Cone and seed production were about five times higher in seed trees that had been released for 4 - 5 years, compared to control trees in the unreleased forest. Seed trees released for {{less than three years}} had about the same level of cone production as the controls. After release, the number of cones increased more in {{the lower part of the}} tree crowns than in the uppermost two metres. The concentration of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus in needles and mean needle dry weight was significantly higher in released trees compared to unreleased control trees. N, P and K concentrations in needles were significantly positively correlated to numbers of conelets as well as to mean 1000 -seed weight. In 1996, there were about eight times more cones than in 1995, probably because summer temperatures were higher in 1994 than in 1993, the years when the respective flower buds were initiated. Trees with a diameter at breast height of 400 mm produced twice as many cones as trees with a diameter of 300 mm. By timing soil scarification in relation to a rich seed fall twice as many seedlings were established compared to scarification immediately after <b>release</b> <b>cutting.</b> Unscarified plots showed poorest result according number of seedlings, and number of plots without seedlings (0 -plots). Height growth was significantly improved by scarification...|$|E
40|$|The stand {{dynamics}} {{and production of}} two one-acre plots of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L) in Connecticut have been followed {{for more than six}} decades. Data were recorded for all individual trees. One plot (Saltonstall) was established in 1924 after the removal of a hardwood overstory. This stand had a nearly pure, almost fully closed understory of hemlock that was subjected to partial cuttings in 1936, 1954, and 1956. The stand was lost to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in 1993. The other plot (Perry) was established in 1931 in a nearly pure hemlock stand that had arisen on an abandoned pasture around 1850. This plot had a crop-tree <b>release</b> <b>cutting</b> in 1931 and has not been infested with hemlock woolly adelgid. Both plots developed a rotated sigmoid diameter distribution, characteristic of uneven-aged forests, after sixty years of management. The 1936 attempt at group-selection cutting in the Saltonstall plot did not maintain the reverse J-shaped diameter distribution that had initially existed. The stand was essentially even-aged and the diameter distribution shifted to a broad bell-shaped form and then to a rotated sigmoid curve when a new age class grew large enough {{to be included in the}} tally. The thinning of the Perry plot also turned the initial bell-shaped diameter-distribution curve to the rotated sigmoid form for the same reason. Annual periodic increment (including harvested volumes) was 52 and 50 cubic feet/acre for the Saltonstall and Perry plot, respectively. Annual basal area growth decreased from over 3 ft 2 /acre to approximately 2 ft 2 /acre on both plots over sixty years. These findings indicate that hemlock is capable of rapid growth with stand management. Implications for managing hemlock forests are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{probability of}} Taxus baccata (L.) decline given climate change brings forth many uncertainties for conservation management decisions. In this article, the authors present {{the effects of}} applying regeneration cuttings since the year 2000 on {{the viability of the}} understory yew population. By collecting data from a stand located at the centre of the largest population of European yew in Slovakia, containing approximately 160, 000 individuals, and analysing tree-ring records from 38 sampled trees, the improved performance of yews, including stem growth, seed production, and number of regenerated individuals, was revealed. Thinning the canopy by removing 15 % of the growing stock volume per decade, combined with the subsequent irregular shelterwood cuttings, was assessed as a useful strategy. Moreover, lower radial growth of females compared to males, but simultaneously their similar response to climate, suggests a possible trade-off between reproduction and growth. <b>Release</b> <b>cuttings</b> of up to 30 % of the standing volume {{in the vicinity of the}} female trees, executed in the rainy summers following warmer winters, and consistent elimination of deer browsing, can further enhance the positive effects of applied cuts on yew viability. Overall, the suggested active measures could be considered as an effective option to preserve the unique biodiversity of calcareous beech-dominated forests in Central Europe...|$|R

30|$|A major {{obstacle}} to using eucalypts for veneers and LVL is {{the high level of}} growth-stresses present in the logs. These growth-stresses are generated by the newly formed wood cells. The exact molecular mechanism by which the cell walls generate such large stresses is unknown (Alméras and Clair 2016; Okuyama et al. 1994; Toba et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2005). However, the newly formed cells tend to contract longitudinally and expand transversely during cell wall maturation. As a consequence, the centre of the stem is under axial compression while the outside is under axial tension (Kubler 1987). These growth-stresses are <b>released</b> when <b>cutting</b> into the stem i.e. during felling, sawing or veneer peeling. The release of growth-stresses can lead to severe end-splitting following a crosscut, board distortion during sawing and breakage of veneers in the peeling process (Archer 1987; Jacobs 1945; Yang and Waugh 2001). These defects are more prominent in smaller diameter logs, i.e. a plantation resource. Splitting of veneers caused by growth-stress lowers veneer quality and reduces yield. For example, only 20 % usable veneers were recovered from E. grandis W.Hill due to severe end-splitting (Margadant 1981). To date, no technological solution to reduce the effects of growth-stresses has been implemented successfully.|$|R
