50|$|As {{part of the}} {{requirements}} phase, the <b>reliability</b> <b>engineer</b> develops a test strategy with the customer.

50|$|Because {{reliability}} engineering {{is critical to}} early system design, it has become common for <b>reliability</b> <b>engineers,</b> however the organization is structured, to work {{as part of an}} integrated product team.|$|R
50|$|For example, with an {{activation}} energy of 0.7 eV, 125 °C stress temperature and 55 °C use temperature, the acceleration factor (Arrhenius equation) is 78.6.

50|$|In some cases, {{a company}} {{may wish to}} {{establish}} an independent reliability organization. This is desirable {{to ensure that the}} system reliability, which is often expensive and time consuming, is not unduly slighted due to budget and schedule pressures.

5000|$|A key {{aspect of}} {{reliability}} testing is to define [...] "failure". Although {{this may seem}} obvious, there are many situations where {{it is not clear}} whether a failure is really the fault of the system. Variations in test conditions, operator differences, weather and unexpected situations create differences between the customer and the system developer. One strategy to address this issue is to use a scoring conference process. A scoring conference includes representatives from the customer, the developer, the test organization, the reliability organization, and sometimes independent observers. The scoring conference process is defined in the statement of work. Each test case is considered by the group and [...] "scored" [...] as a success or failure. This scoring is the official result used by the <b>reliability</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E
50|$|A common {{reliability}} metric is {{the number}} of software faults, usually expressed as faults per thousand lines of code. This metric, along with software execution time, is key to most software reliability models and estimates. The theory is that the software reliability increases as the number of faults (or fault density) decreases or goes down. Establishing a direct connection between fault density and mean-time-between-failure is difficult, however, because of the way software faults are distributed in the code, their severity, and the probability of the combination of inputs necessary to encounter the fault. Nevertheless, fault density serves as a useful indicator for the <b>reliability</b> <b>engineer.</b> Other software metrics, such as complexity, are also used. This metric remains controversial, since changes in software development and verification practices can have dramatic impact on overall defect rates.|$|E
