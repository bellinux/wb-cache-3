5|$|Poe eschewed the {{scientific}} method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>he</b> considered it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece.

5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally.

One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E
