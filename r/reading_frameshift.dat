40|$|AIM: To {{present the}} clinical, dermatological, and {{histological}} {{features of a}} patient with generalised xanthomatosis, familial apolipoprotein (apo) E deficiency, and unusual type III hyperlipoproteinaemia (HLP). METHODS: The underlying molecular defect was disclosed using molecular biological techniques. The unusual xanthomas were histologically analysed and the morphology of the abnormal lipoprotein particles examined using electron microscopy. RESULTS: A 10 base pair deletion in exon 4 of the proband's apo epsilon gene (base pairs 4037 - 4046 coding for amino acids 209 - 212 of the mature protein) was identified. This is predictive for a <b>reading</b> <b>frameshift</b> encoding a premature stop (TGA) in codon 229. The mutation is responsible for delayed catabolism of atherogenic lipoprotein remnants, lipid storage in monocyte/macrophages, and phenotypic expression of xanthomatosis early in life. CONCLUSIONS: Familial apo E deficiency is a rare genetic disease which offers the unique opportunity to study the impact of apo E on lipoprotein metabolism and development of atherosclerosis in humans...|$|E
40|$|The RB 1 gene from 12 human {{retinoblastoma}} tumors {{has been}} analyzed exon-by-exon with the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. Mutations {{were found in}} all tumors, and one-third of the tumors had independent mutations in both alleles neither of which {{were found in the}} germ line, confirming their true sporadic nature. In the remaining two-thirds of the tumors only one mutation was found, consistent with the loss-of-heterozygosity theory of tumorigenesis. Point mutations, the majority of which were C [...] >T transitions, were the most common abnormality and usually resulted in the conversion of an arginine codon to a stop codon. Small deletions were the second most common abnormality and most often created a downstream stop codon {{as the result of a}} <b>reading</b> <b>frameshift.</b> Deletions and point mutations also affected splice junctions. Direct repeats were present at the breakpoint junctions in the majority of deletions, supporting a slipped-mispairing mechanism.

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{deficiency of}} the mitochondrial matrix enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is the inborn error in gyrate atrophy (GA), an autosomal recessive degenerative {{disease of the}} retina and choroid of the eye. Mutations in the OAT gene show {{a high degree of}} molecular heterogeneity in GA, reflecting the genetic heterogeneity in this disease. Using the combined techniques of PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct sequencing, we have identified three nonsense-codon mutations and one nonsense codon-generating mutation of the OAT gene in GA pedigrees. Three of them are single-base substitutions, and one is a 2 -bp deletion resulting in a <b>reading</b> <b>frameshift.</b> A nonsense codon created at position 79 (TGA) by a frameshift and nonsense mutations at codons 209 (TAT [...] TAA) and 299 (TAC [...] TAG) result in abnormally low levels of OAT mRNA in the patient's skin fibroblasts. A nonsense mutation at codon 426 (CGA [...] TGA) in the last exon, however, has little effect on the mRNA level. Thus, the mRNA level can be reduced by nonsense-codon mutations, but the position of the mutation may be important, with earlier premature-translation termination having a greater effect than a later mutation...|$|E

40|$|The Leishmania tarentolae {{cytochrome}} oxidase (EC 1. 9. 3. 1) subunit II (COII) and maxicircle unidentified reading frame 3 (MURF 3) mRNAs are edited internally {{by the addition}} of four and five uridine residues, respectively, which eliminate - 1 and + 1 <b>reading</b> <b>frameshifts</b> in the gene sequences. The editing events in COII are conserved in three kinetoplastid species, and those in MURF 3 are conserved in two species. A primer extension assay showed that the ratio of edited to unedited RNA differed for each gene: 89 % of the COII and 36 % of the MURF 3 transcripts are edited. Preliminary evidence was obtained for translation of the edited COII transcript into protein: antibodies generated against a synthetic peptide with the predicted carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence reacted with a polypeptide of the correct molecular weight in immunoblots of a mitochondrial lysate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNonsense codon {{readthrough}} {{and changed}} translational reading frame were measured in different growth phases in E. coli. The strains used carry plasmid constructs with a translation assay reporter gene. This reporter gene contains an internal stop codon or {{a run of}} U-residues. Termination or frameshifting give rise to stable proteins that can be physically quantified on gels along with the complete protein products. Readthrough of the stop codon UGA by a nearcognate tRNA is several fold higher in active growth than in late exponential phase. In early exponential phase, about 7 % of − 1 frameshift at a U 9 slippery sequence is detectable; upon entry to stationary phase this frameshifting increases to about 40 % followed by a decrease in stationary phase. A similar increase is observed {{in the case of}} + 1 <b>reading</b> <b>frameshift</b> at the U 9 sequence, which increases from 13 % in early exponential growth phase up to 38 % at the beginning of stationary phase followed by a decrease. Thus, the levels of both stop codon readthrough and frameshifting are growth phase dependent, though not in an identical fashion...|$|E
40|$|Prokaryotic toxin–antitoxin loci encode mRNA {{cleaving}} {{enzymes that}} inhibit translation. Two types are known: those that cleave mRNA codons at the ribosomal A site {{and those that}} cleave any RNA site specifically. RelE of Escherichia coli cleaves mRNA at the ribosomal A site in vivo and in vitro but does not cleave pure RNA in vitro. RelE exhibits an incomplete RNase fold that may explain why RelE requires its substrate mRNA to presented by the ribosome. In contrast, RelE homologue YoeB has a complete RNase fold and cleaves RNA independently of ribosomes in vitro. Here, we show that YoeB cleavage of mRNA is strictly dependent on translation of the mRNA in vivo. Non-translated model mRNAs were not cleaved whereas the corresponding wild-type mRNAs were cleaved efficiently. Model mRNAs carrying frameshift mutations exhibited a YoeB-mediated cleavage pattern consistent with the <b>reading</b> <b>frameshift</b> thus giving strong evidence that YoeB cleavage specificity {{was determined by the}} translational reading frame. In contrast, site-specific mRNA cleavage by MazF occurred independently of translation. In one case, translation seriously influenced MazF cleavage efficiency, thus solving a previous apparent paradox. We propose that translation enhances MazF-mediated cleavage of mRNA by destabilization of the mRNA secondary structure...|$|E
40|$|Type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) {{is usually}} {{associated}} with homozygosity for apolipoprotein (apo) E 2. We identified a 30 -year-old male German of Hungarian ancestry with severe type III HLP and apo E deficiency. The disease was expressed in an extreme phenotype with multiple cutaneous xanthomas. Apo E was detectable only in trace amounts in plasma {{but not in the}} different lipoprotein fractions. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified segments of the apo epsilon gene identified a 10 -bp deletion in exon 4 (bp 4037 - 4046 coding for amino acids 209 - 212 of the mature protein). The mutation is predictive for a <b>reading</b> <b>frameshift</b> introducing a premature stop codon (TGA) at amino acid 229. By western blot analysis, we found small amounts of a truncated apo E in the patient's plasma. Family analysis revealed that the proband was homozygous [...] and 10 of 24 relatives were heterozygous [...] for the mutation. Heterozygotes had, as compared to unaffected family members, significantly higher triglycerides (TG), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and a significantly higher VLDL cholesterol-to-serum TG ratio, which is indicative of a delayed remnant catabolism. We propose that the absence of a functionally active apo E is the cause of the severe type III HLP in the patient and that the mutation, even in a single dose in heterozygotes, predisposes in variable severity to the phenotypic expression of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{expression}} of the CCU/CCA/CCG-decoding tRNAPro 3 on a multicopy plasmid leads to suppression of several + 1 frameshift mutations in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Systematic analysis of the site of frameshifting indicates that excess tRNAPro 3 promotes near-cognate decoding at CCC codons. Re-phasing of the reading frame {{can be achieved by}} a subsequent slippage of the tRNA onto a cognate codon in the + 1 <b>reading</b> frame. <b>Frameshifting</b> appears to be due to an imbalance of CCC-cognate and near-cognate tRNAs, as the effect of excess tRNAPro 3 on reading frame maintenance can be reversed by increasing simultaneously the concentration of the cognate tRNAPro 2. Finally, the cmo 5 U modification present at position 34 of tRNAPro 3, which allows this tRNA to decode CCU in addition to CCG and CCA, also affects frameshifting, indicating that the ability of the near-cognate tRNA to decode a cognate codon efficiently in the alternative reading frame is important for re-phasing of the reading frame...|$|R

In a classic study, Francis Crick (et al.) used intragenic suppression to study the fundamental nature of the genetic code. From this study it was shown that genes are expressed as non-overlapping triplets (codons). [...] Researchers showed that mutations caused by either a single base insertion (+) or a single base deletion (-) could be [...] "suppressed" [...] or restored by a second mutation of the opposite sign, as long as the two mutations occurred in the same vicinity of the gene. This led to the conclusion that genes needed to be read in a specific [...] "reading frame" [...] and a single base insertion or deletion would shift the <b>reading</b> frame (<b>frameshift</b> mutation) {{in such a way that}} the remaining DNA would code for a different polypeptide than the one intended. Therefore, researchers concluded that the second mutation of opposite sign suppresses the original mutation by restoring the reading frame, as long as the portion between the two mutations is not critical for protein function.|$|R
40|$|Waxy {{varieties}} of the tetraploid cereal broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) have endosperm starch granules lacking detectable amylose. This {{study investigated the}} basis of this phenotype using molecular and biochemical methods. Iodine staining of starch granules in 72 plants from 38 landrace accessions found 58 nonwaxy and 14 waxy phenotype plants. All waxy types were in plants from Chinese and Korean accessions, a distribution {{similar to that of the}} waxy phenotype in other cereals. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) protein was present in the endosperm of both nonwaxy and waxy individuals, but waxy types had little or no granule-bound starch synthase activity compared with the wild types. Sequencing of the GBSSI (Waxy) gene showed that this gene is present in two different forms (L and S) in P. miliaceum, which probably represent homeologues derived from two distinct diploid ancestors. Protein products of both these forms are present in starch granules. We identified three polymorphisms in the exon sequence coding for mature GBSSI peptides. A 15 -bp deletion has occurred in the S type GBSSI, resulting in the loss of five amino acids from glucosyl transferase domain 1 (GTD 1). The second GBSSI type (L) shows two sequence polymorphisms. One is the insertion of an adenine residue that causes a <b>reading</b> <b>frameshift,</b> and the second causes a cysteine–tyrosine amino acid polymorphism.

40|$|The Lpin 1 gene encodes the phosphatidate {{phosphatase}} (PAP 1) enzyme Lipin 1, {{which plays}} {{a critical role}} in lipid metabolism. In this study we describe the identification and characterization of a rat model with a mutated Lpin 1 gene (Lpin 1 (1 Hubr)), generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Lpin 1 (1 Hubr) rats are characterized by hindlimb paralysis and mild lipodystrophy that are detectable from the second postnatal week. Sequencing of Lpin 1 identified a point mutation in the 5 '-end splice site of intron 18 resulting in mis-splicing, a <b>reading</b> <b>frameshift,</b> and a premature stop codon. As this mutation does not induce nonsense-mediated decay, it allows the production of a truncated Lipin 1 protein lacking PAP 1 activity. Lpin 1 (1 Hubr) rats developed hypomyelination and mild lipodystrophy rather than the pronounced demyelination and adipocyte defects characteristic of Lpin 1 (fld/fld) mice, which carry a null allele for Lpin 1. Furthermore, biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses revealed that these lesions improve in older Lpin 1 (1 Hubr) rats as compared with young Lpin 1 (1 Hubr) rats and Lpin 1 (fld/fld) mice. We observed activation of compensatory biochemical pathways substituting for missing PAP 1 activity that, in combination with a possible non-enzymatic Lipin 1 function residing outside of its PAP 1 domain, may contribute to the less severe phenotypes observed in Lpin 1 (1 Hubr) rats as compared with Lpin 1 (fld/fld) mice. Although we are cautious in making a direct parallel between the presented rodent model and human disease, our data may provide new insight into the pathogenicity of recently identified human LPIN 1 mutations.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein domain {{classification}} is {{an important}} step in metagenomic annotation. The state-of-the-art method for protein domain classification is profile HMM-based alignment. However, the relatively high rates of insertions and deletions in homopolymer regions of pyrosequencing <b>reads</b> create <b>frameshifts,</b> causing conventional profile HMM alignment tools to generate alignments with marginal scores. This makes error-containing gene fragments unclassifiable with conventional tools. Thus, {{there is a need for}} an accurate domain classification tool that can detect and correct sequencing errors. Results We introduce HMM-FRAME, a protein domain classification tool based on an augmented Viterbi algorithm that can incorporate error models from different sequencing platforms. HMM-FRAME corrects sequencing errors and classifies putative gene fragments into domain families. It achieved high error detection sensitivity and specificity in a data set with annotated errors. We applied HMM-FRAME in Targeted Metagenomics and a published metagenomic data set. The results showed that our tool can correct frameshifts in error-containing sequences, generate much longer alignments with significantly smaller E-values, and classify more sequences into their native families. Conclusions HMM-FRAME provides a complementary protein domain classification tool to conventional profile HMM-based methods for data sets containing frameshifts. Its current implementation is best used for small-scale metagenomic data sets. The source code of HMM-FRAME can be downloaded at [URL] and at [URL]. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sequences and {{structures}} in the mRNA can alter the accuracy of translation. In some cases, mRNA secondary structures like hairpin loops or pseudoknots can cause frequent errors of translational <b>reading</b> frame (programmed <b>frameshifting)</b> or misreading of termination codons as sense (nonsense readthrough). In other cases, the primary mRNA sequence stimulates the error probably by interacting with {{an element of the}} ribosome to interfere with error correction. One such primary mRNA sequence, the Ty 3 stimulator, increases programmed + 1 frameshifting 7. 5 times in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|Autonomous {{mobility}} of different {{copies of the}} Fot 1 element was determined for several strains of the fungal plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum to develop a transposon tagging system. Two Fot 1 copies inserted into the third intron of the nitrate reductase structural gene (niaD) were separately introduced into two genetic backgrounds devoid of endogenous Fot 1 elements. Mobility of these copies was observed through a phenotypic assay for excision based on the restoration of nitrate reductase activity. Inactivation of the Fot 1 transposase open <b>reading</b> frame (<b>frameshift,</b> deletion, or disruption) prevented excision in strains free of Fot 1 elements. Molecular analysis of the Nia + revertant strains showed that the Fot 1 element reintegrated frequently into new genomic sites after excision and that it can transpose from the introduced niaD gene into a different chromosome. Sequence analysis of several Fot 1 excision sites revealed the so-called footprint left by this transposable element. Three reinserted Fot 1 elements were cloned and the DNA sequences flanking the transposon were determined using inverse polymerase chain reaction. In all cases, the transposon was inserted into a TA dinucleotide and created the characteristic TA target site duplication. The availability of autonomous Fot 1 copies will now permit {{the development of an}} efficient two-component transposon tagging system comprising a trans -activator element supplying transposase and a cis -responsive marked element...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of frameshifting: pseudoknot {{structure}} and slippery sequence (usually UUUAAAC). A pseudoknot is an RNA secondary structure generated by intramolecular interactions of mRNA that cause it to bend and fold. The ribosome bumps into the knotted mRNA while it is translating the mRNA and shifts back (-1) one nucleotide and continues translating in a new <b>reading</b> frame. This <b>frameshift</b> occurs about 10% of the time, allowing differential protein expression. This form of frameshifting is used by HIV-1, among others. A slippery sequence is a sequence of codons for rare tRNA, meaning that the ribosome has to pause in order to wait for the correct tRNA to bring the appropriate amino acid. However, this long pause is often accompanied by the ribosome advancing forward one nucleotide (+1). This form of frameshifting is utilized by influenza A, among others.|$|R
40|$|Expression of {{retroviral}} replication enzymes (Pol) {{requires a}} controlled translational recoding event {{to bypass the}} stop codon {{at the end of}} gag. This recoding event occurs either by direct suppression of termination via the insertion of an amino acid at the stop codon (readthrough) or by alteration of the mRNA <b>reading</b> frame (<b>frameshift).</b> Here we report the effects of a host protein, large ribosomal protein 4 (RPL 4), on the efficiency of recoding. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay, we found that transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding RPL 4 cDNA increases recoding efficiency in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal en-hancement of nearly twofold. Expression of RPL 4 increases recoding of reporters containing retroviral readthrough and frame-shift sequences, as well as the Sindbis virus leaky termination signal. RPL 4 -induced enhancement of recoding is cell line specific and appears to be specific to RPL 4 among ribosomal proteins. Cotransfection of RPL 4 cDNAwithMoloney murine leukemia proviral DNA results in Gag processing defects and a reduction of viral particle formation, presumably caused by the RPL 4 -de-pendent alteration of the Gag-to-Gag-Pol ratio required for virion assembly and release. Translation is a tightly regulated process that is dependent uponinterpretation of signals in the mRNA for proper initiation, synthesis, and termination of a nascent protein. The ribosomes and initiation and termination factors involved in this process are designed for accurate interpretation of these signals, resulting in a very low error rate during normal cellular translation.

40|$|The mRNA {{encoding}} Escherichia coli {{polypeptide chain}} release factor 2 (RF 2) has two partially overlapping reading frames.
