40|$|AbstractThe rails of {{electromagnetic}} railgun can be ablated by {{the temperature rise}} due to current concentration. The current distributions on the rails and armature are not only affected by the skin effect, but also influenced by the proximity effect which is rarely mentioned. This paper illustrated the difference between skin effect and proximity effect, and the influencing factors of proximity effect were investigated. Results show that the current is concentrated on the surface around rails due to the skin effect, and the proximity effect exacerbates the current density on the inner surfaces of rails. Decrease in distance from rails enhances the proximity effect, but {{has nothing to do}} with the skin effect, which also augments the <b>rail</b> <b>resistance,</b> resulting in temperature rise. It can explain the reason why the ablation is often detected in the small caliber railgun. Research results in this paper can provide support for design and optimization {{of electromagnetic}} railgun...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: With the {{introduction}} of high-speed traffic there is an increased consumption of traction current by new types of rolling stock. This issue is important, as high levels of traction currents can have not only prevents, but also a dangerous impact on the equipment of railway automation devices. It is necessary to investigate the propagation of traction currents and potentials along the rails. Objective: Investigate the propagation of traction currents and potentials along the rails, the determination of critical currents, which not executed tone track circuits modes. Methods: In order to investigate the mathematical model, and the method of calculation tone track circuits modes was used. Results: By means of mathematical model, which includes being several rolling-stocks at the feeder zone, different <b>rail</b> <b>resistance</b> and isolation, the diagrams of currents and potentials propagations for DC and AC electric traction have been obtained. A comparative analysis of the experimental data {{and the results of}} the investigation has been realized. Based on received levels of reverse traction current their influence on track circuit modes has been investigated. Conclusions: The reverse traction current level near the substation and rolling-stock can be more than 600 A. Great reverse traction current levels have an influence on tonal track circuit functioning, namely normal and shunt modes. When the traction current arrives 200 A there is a reduction criteria of tonal track circuits...|$|E

50|$|The basic gain {{stage for}} a valve {{amplifier}} is the auto-biased common cathode stage, in which an anode resistor, the valve, and a cathode resistor form a potential divider across the supply <b>rails.</b> The <b>resistance</b> of the valve varies {{as a function of}} the voltage on the grid, relative to the voltage on the cathode.|$|R
30|$|The {{technology}} of continuously welded rails (CWRs) {{is important in}} modern railway track structures. To measure <b>rail</b> stress, <b>resistance</b> strain gauges are preferred due to their good stability, sensitivity, and resistance to external interference. Based on the bi-directional strain method, we present a new method for measuring longitudinal <b>rail</b> stress using <b>resistance</b> strain gauges and develop a monitoring device for rail stress to realize long-term and multi-point measurement. Also relevant experimental verification and analysis are conducted. Results indicate that under various constraints the rail stress–strain values can be calculated just with the measured total longitudinal strain and total vertical strain. Considering the measurement error caused by sectional feature of sensors, we put forward a correction equation applicable to different stress conditions. Although the temperature values of the four full-bridge stress gauges can offset each other, the measurement error caused by rail flexural strain can also be eliminated {{to a certain extent}} at the same time, the non-uniform distribution of rail cross section temperature and unbalanced flexural strain still affect the measurement error. The experimental results also show that the developed rail-stress-monitoring sensor is suitable for measuring rail stress with reliable working performance.|$|R
50|$|From the 1820s to the 1880s urban transit in North America {{began when}} horse-drawn omnibus lines started to operate along city streets. Examples {{included}} Gilbert Vanderwerken's 1826 omnibus service in Newark, New Jersey. Before long Omnibus companies sought to boost profitability of their wagons by increasing ridership along their lines. Horsecar lines simply ran wagons along rails {{set in a}} city street {{instead of on the}} unpaved street surface as the omnibus lines used. When a wagon was drawn upon <b>rails</b> the rolling <b>resistance</b> of the vehicle was lowered and the average speed was increased.|$|R
50|$|This {{design with}} its low {{stress on the}} <b>rails,</b> low {{inherent}} <b>resistance</b> and simple weight compensation was promising especially as it also avoided the use of cranked driving axles. Similar thoughts in the USA during the 1930s {{led to the development}} of duplex locomotives. Because the cylinders of adjacent axles also had 28 mm of side play, the locomotive could negotiate radii of as little as 170 m. Through the special design of the cylinders, the use of crank axles (Kropfachse) was avoided. Whilst this design enabled the steam lines between the high- and low-pressure cylinders to be extremely short, long admission and exhaust tubes were necessary.|$|R

The issue of track-bridge interaction is relatively broad and includes wide range of input parameters, which are currently under investigation as part of research projects focused on this problem. Measurement of existing bridge structures, rails, numerical models and so forth are under investigation. One of the parameters that have an influence on longitudinal <b>resistance</b> of the <b>rail</b> is the residual stress field in it. For the past years residual stresses were under investigation mainly {{because they have a}} big influence on the fatigue <b>resistance</b> of the <b>rail</b> {{which is one of the}} failure modes for the steel rail. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the residual stresses on flexural behaviour of the <b>rail.</b> Bending <b>resistance</b> of two specimens will be experimentally studied: new rail with residual stresses and heat treated piece with relieved residual stresses. Finite Element Model (FEM) will be developed to simulate the test. Map of residual stresses is introduced in numerical model of the rail and it is based on the evaluation and analysis of a number of researches that were done in this area. In order to check compatibility of the chosen pattern with our specimens, residual stresses in an additional - third specimen will be checked according to simplified procedure described in EN 13674 - 1 Annex C...|$|R
40|$|Running rails used as {{a return}} {{conductor}} and ungrounded scheme have been widely adopted in DC traction power systems. Due to the longitudinal <b>resistance</b> of running <b>rails</b> and insulation <b>resistance</b> of rail-to-ground, {{there will be a}} potential rise between running rails and the ground when return current flows through the running rails, which is known as rail potential. At present, abnormal rise of rail potential exists widely in DC traction power systems. The present rail potential model still cannot simulate and explain the abnormal rail potential in the system. Based on the analysis of power distribution with multiple trains running in multiple sections, a dynamic simulation model of rail potential in the whole line is proposed. The dynamic distribution of rail potential and stray current in DC traction power systems when multiple trains run in multiple sections is analyzed, and the impact of traction current distribution on rail potential is evaluated. Simulation results show that the abnormal rise of rail potential during the dynamic operation of the system can be evaluated effectively...|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{ultrasonic}} nanocrystalline {{surface modification}} (UNSM) technique {{was applied to}} normal and heat-treated rails made of 60 kgK steel to enhance the wear resistance of the wheel-rail interaction. The hardness and compressive residual stress values of the untreated and UNSM-treated rails were measured by the Brinell hardness tester and X-ray diffraction technique, respectively. It was found, according to the measurement results, that the hardness was increased by about 20 % and 8 %, whereas the compressive residual stress was induced by about 52 % and 62 % for the UNSM-treated normal and heat-treated rails, respectively. The UNSM-treated normal rail showed a slightly higher hardness than the heat-treated <b>rail.</b> The wear <b>resistance</b> of <b>rails</b> with respect to rotating speed and rolling time was assessed using a rolling contact wear (RCW) tester under dry conditions. The RCW test results revealed that the wear of the UNSM-treated rails was enhanced in comparison {{with those of the}} untreated rails. Also, the wear amount of the rails was increased with increasing the rotation speed. The UNSM-treated normal rail exhibited the highest wear resistance with respect to the rotation speed. The wear mechanisms of the rails are also discussed based on microscopic images of the worn out surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Polyaniline (PANI) {{films have}} been {{deposited}} on stainless steel (SS) substrate by galvanostatic, potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods. Electrochemical impedance spectra of the electrodes have been analyzed using a transmission line model {{consisting of two}} <b>rails</b> of finite <b>resistances.</b> The impedance spectra of the galvanostatically prepared electrodes are similar in shape to those of potentiostatically grown electrodes. The resistance of aqueous pore (R_aq) due to ionic doping–dedoping process {{is greater than the}} resistance (R_p) of electronic chargetransfer on polymer chain. These parameters exhibit an increase in magnitude with thickness of PANI, as expected from the transmission line theory. The shape of impedance spectra of potentiodynamically grown PANI, however, is different and its R_aq≤ R_p. The impedance parameters of potentiodynamically prepared PANI/SS electrodes have been found to depend on the sweep rate used for the deposition of PANI. Several possible explanations have been discussed to understand the influence of sweep rate during deposition on impedance parameters of the electrodes. In contrast to the behavior of PANI deposited by galvanostatic and potentiostatic methods, R_p decreases with an increase in thickness of PANI deposited by the potentiodynamic method. The effect of concentration of aniline used for the deposition of PANI on impedance parameters has also been studied. The results of capacitance of PANI obtained from the ac impedance studies {{have been found to be}} comparable with those obtained from the cyclic voltammetric studies...|$|R
40|$|QR National’s {{experience}} of wheel wear {{in the operation}} of its central Queensland coal fleet has shown a high sensitivity to the proportion of the wagon fleet with high bogie rotational resistance. In periods where significant parts of the fleet exhibited high centre bearing rotational <b>resistance</b> <b>rail</b> lubrication conditions also were deteriorated and wheel life fleet wide was noticed to shorten. QR National believe that this increase in wheel rail wear was the result of reduce rail lubrication effectiveness caused by unfavorable contact mechanics at the gauge face of the rail. The Rail CRC Australia Bogie Rotation Friction Management project has conducted a case study of the QR National VSA wagon. The case study analysis shows wheel rail wear on the Goonyella system operations of VSA wagons are very sensitive to bogie rotation friction especially for the tightest curve (304 m) where wheelsets 1, 2 and 3 all flange. The wheel rail contact mechanics are dependant on the bogie rotation friction specifically the angle of attack generated on axle 1 and 2 increases due to bogie rotation friction. The flange contact forces and resulting contact stresses change only slightly with increases of bogie rotation friction, under 10 %. The significant change in the gauge face contact mechanics is the creepage angle. The creepage angle on the gauge face of the 304 m curve changes from 47 to 65 degrees to the rail axis for axle 1 and 18 to 57 degrees on axle 2. With this change in the flange contact creepage angle lubricant is increasingly swept off the rail gauge face increasing the friction coefficients for following wheelsets. Previous studies on bogie rotation friction has shown that wear losses from high bogie rotation forces are due to warp of the bogie. Bogie warp occurs in the track transition in order to rotate the bogie however in constant curving {{there is no need to}} retain the warped bogie shape and transition design can be used to relieve bogie warp 1. An alternative curve transition design is suggested for the 304 m curve. This alternative design termed a “curvature overrun transition”, has small section of tighter curve radius in the transition section whilst the curve body is a slightly larger radius giving a minimal change to the curve alignment. The curvature over run design gives significant improvements to the angle of attack and contact mechanics in the curve body. However wheel wear savings only occur for vehicles having high bogie rotation friction and rail wear rates are effectively higher due to higher peak rail wear...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{reported}} in the thesis deal with surface modification of non-platinum metals by coating with electronically conducting polymers, namely, polyanilne (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPY). The oxidation of Г/I 2, hydroquinone/quinine and [Fe(CN) 6] 3 -/ [Fe(CN) 6] 4 -are studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry experiments. It has been shown tht the redox reactions, which do not occur on bare stainless steel electrode, occur through electron-transfer mediated by conducting polymers. The effect of heating of polyaniline (PANI) at 80 0 C on its electrochemical activity is studies. Although the thermogravimetric analysis indicates that PANI is stable at temperatures up to about 250 0 C and it undergoes decomposition at higher temperatures, its intrinsic redox electrochemical activity decreases with duration of heating at a temperature as low as 80 0 C. The polymer completely loses its electrochemical activity. The decrease in lectrochemical activity of PANI is attributed to an irreversible loss of water molecules. The reaction order for degradation of PANI {{is found to be}} close to unity, and a value of 1. 63 X 10 - 4 s- 1 is obtained for the rate constant. The deactivated PANI does not recover its electrochemical activity even after a prolonged treatment in acidic electrolytes. The electrodeposition of PANI is carried out by galvanostatic, potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods. The impedance data reflect a marked difference between the PANI deposited by static and dynamic methods. Furthermore, the impedance parameters vary with the sweep rate used in potentiodynamic method. Electrochemical impedance spectra of the electrodes are analyzed using a transmission line model consisting of two <b>rails</b> of finite <b>resistances.</b> Electrochemical deposition of polyaniline (PANI) is carried out on a porous carbon substrate for supercapacitor studies. PANI deposited at 100 mV s- 1 sweep rate by potentiodynamic technique on porous carbon substrate is found to possess superior capacitance properties. Capacitance values as high as 1600 F g- 1 are obtained and PANI coated carbon electrodes facilitate charge-discharge current densities as hgh as 45 mA cm- 2 (19. 8 A g- 1). Electrodes are found to be fairly stable over a long cycle-life, although there is some capacitance loss during the initial stages of cycling. Electrooxidation of ascorbic acid on polyaniline is studied in a fuel-cell. Ascorbic acid (H 2 A) is employed as fuel and polyaniline (PANI) as the catalyst. H 2 A is an environmentally and biologically friendly molecule. The catalyst, namely PANI does not consist of any platinum group metal, and at 70 0 C, a maximum power density of 4. 3 mW cm- 2 is obtained at a current density of 15 mA cm- 2. Also, studies on anodically deposited RuO 2 for capacitor applications are reported. Cathodic deposition of RuO 2 generally produces a mixture of Ru and RuO 2. On the other hand, the anodic depsotion on SS substrates is found to produce RUO 2 which is characterized with high power supercapacitance properties. A capacitance value of 274 F g- 1 is obtained at a current density of 20 mA cm- 2...|$|R
