Two pilot surveys are conducted for a total about 50 participants to examine {{the advantages of the}} survey system. By comparing activity data collected by the software with the data collected by conventional paper-based activity diary surveys, it is found that the system developed in this study is useful in terms of reducing “time lag ” in data entry and mitigation of spatial constraints for data entry.

40|$|This article proposes an {{extremely}} flexible procedure for perceptual mapping based on multiattribute ratings, {{such that the}} respondent freely generates sets of both brands and attributes. Therefore, the brands and attributes are known and relevant to each participant. Collecting and analyzing such idiosyncratic datasets can be challenging.

The model results in a common perceptual map with subject-specific and overall fit measures. An experimental study compares the proposed procedure with alternative approaches using predetermined sets of brands and/or attributes. In the proposed procedure, brands are better known, attributes appear more relevant, and the <b>respondent's</b> <b>burden</b> is lower. The positions of brands in the new perceptual map differ from those obtained when using fixed brand sets. Moreover, the new procedure typically yields positioning information on more brands.

40|$|Culture {{plays a role}} {{in mental}} health, partly by {{defining}} the characteristics that are indicative of positive adjustment. In Chinese cultures, positive family relationships are considered central to well-being. The culturally emphasized characteristic of family harmony may be an important factor associated with psychopathology. This article presents the development and psychometric examination of the Family Harmony Scale (FHS), an indigenously developed 24 -item instrument tapping family harmony in 17, 461 Hong Kong residents from 7, 791 households. A higher-order model with 1 second-order factor and 5 first-order factors fit the data well and showed factorial invariance across sex and participants in different family roles. A 5 -item short form (FHS- 5) was also developed, with 1 item from each first-order factor. The short scale showed, as expected, a single-factor structure with good fit. Both scales demonstrated high internal consistency, acceptable test-retest reliability, and good convergent and discriminant validity. The 24 -item FHS was negatively associated with depressive symptoms after accounting for individual risk factors and general family function. Family harmony moderated the relationship between life stress and depressive symptoms such that those individuals who reported low family harmony had stronger associations between life stress and depressive symptoms. This study adds to the literature a systematically developed, multidimensional measure of family harmony, which may be an important psychological protective factor, in a large urban Chinese sample. The FHS- 5 minimizes operational and <b>respondent</b> <b>burdens,</b> making it an attractive tool for large-scale epidemiological studies with Chinese populations in urban settings, where over half of China's 1. 4 billion people reside.

40|$|Users of {{socio-economic}} statistics typically want {{more and better}} information. Often, these needs can be met simply by more extensive data collections, subject to usual concerns over financial costs and survey <b>respondent</b> <b>burdens.</b> Users, particularly for public policy purposes, have also expressed a continuing, and as yet unfilled, demand for an integrated and coherent system of {{socio-economic statistics}}. In this case, additional data will not be sufficient; the more important constraint {{is the absence of}} an agreed conceptual approach. In this paper, we briefly review the state of frameworks for social and economic statistics, including the kinds of socio-economic indicators users may want. These indicators are motivated first in general terms from basic principles and intuitive concepts, leaving aside for the moment the practicalities of their construction. We then show how a coherent structure of such indicators might be assembled. A key implication is that this structure requires a coordinated network of surveys and data collection processes, and higher data quality standards. This in turn implies a breaking down of the "stovepipe" systems that typify much of the survey work in national statistical agencies (i. e. parallel but generally unrelated data "production lines"). Moreover, the data flowing from the network of surveys must be integrated. Since the data of interest are dynamic, the proposed method goes beyond statistical matching to microsimulation modeling. Finally, these ideas are illustrated with preliminary results from the LifePaths model currently under development in Statistics Canada.

40|$|The Measurement Issues Study (MIS) {{was part}} of a {{comprehensive}} and ongoing effort to examine alternative data collection strategies for the Consumer Expenditure Quarterly Interview Survey (CEQ). These strategies seek to improve data quality, maintain or increase response rates, and reduce <b>respondent</b> <b>burden</b> and data collection costs. One component of the 2010 CE Strategic Plan was to address the following three survey design questions: (1) does splitting the questionnaire reduce <b>respondent</b> <b>burden</b> and/or improve data quality; (2) do monthly reference periods provide better quality data than quarterly reference periods; and, (3) do global questions provide data of sufficient quality to replace detailed questions? The MIS was originally designed to offer insights to the first two questions, but the incorporation of global questions in one of study treatment conditions also provided an opportunity to examine the third survey design question raised in the 2010 CE Strategic Plan.

40|$|The {{principle}} that the statistical system should provide flexibility [...] possibilities for generating multiple groupings of data to satisfy multiple objectives [...] {{if it is to}} satisfy users is universally accepted. Yet in practice, this goal has not been achieved. This paper discusses the feasibility of providing flexibility in the statistical system to accommodate multiple uses of the industrial data now primarily examined within the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. In one sense, the question of feasibility is almost trivial. With today's computer technology, vast amounts of data can be manipulated and stored at very low cost. Reconfigurations of the basic data are very inexpensive compared to the cost of collecting the data. Flexibility in the statistical system implies more than the technical ability to regroup data. It requires that the basic data are sufficiently detailed to support user needs and are processed and maintained in a fashion that makes the use of a variety of aggregation rules possible. For this to happen, statistical agencies must recognize the need for high quality microdata and build this into their planning processes. Agencies need to view their missions from a multiple use perspective and move away from use of a primary reporting and collection vehicle. Although the categories used to report data must be flexible, practical considerations dictate that data collection proceed within a fixed classification system. It is simply too expensive for both respondents and statistical agencies to process survey responses in the absence of standardized forms, data entry programs, etc. I argue for a basic classification centered on commodities [...] products, services, raw materials and labor inputs [...] as the focus of data collection. The idea is to make the principle variables of interest [...] the commodities [...] the vehicle for the collection and processing of the data. For completeness, the basic classification should include labor usage through some form of occupational classification. In most economic surveys at the Census Bureau, the reporting unit and the classified unit have been the establishment. But {{there is no need for}} this to be so. The basic principle to be followed in data collection is that the data should be collected in the most efficient way [...] efficiency being defined jointly in terms of statistical agency collection costs and <b>respondent</b> <b>burdens.</b> CES,economic,research,micro,data,microdata,chief,economist...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>respondent</b> contact <b>burden</b> in sample surveys is defined, and a {{multi-stage}} process to develop policies for curtailing nonresponse follow-up is described {{with the goal}} of reducing this burden on prospective survey respondents. The method depends on contact history paradata containing information about contact attempts both for respondents and for sampled nonrespondents. By analysis of past data, policies to stop case follow-up based on control variables measured in paradata can be developed by calculating propensities to respond for paradata-defined subgroups of sampled cases. Competing policies can be assessed by comparing outcomes (lost interviews, numbers of contacts, patterns of reluctant participation, or refusal to participate) as if these stopping policies had been followed in past data. Finally, embedded survey experiments may be used to assess contact-burden reduction policies when these are implemented in the field.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} two updated measures of diabetes regimen adherence. The Diabetes Self-Management Profile (DSMP) is a widely used, structured interview. Limitations include a substantial interviewer and <b>respondent</b> time <b>burden</b> and the need for well-trained interviewers to use appropriate prompts and score the open-ended re-sponses. The Diabetes Behavior Rating Scale (DBRS) is a self-administered, fixed-choice survey. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Both measures were administered to 146 youth with type 1 diabetes (aged 11 – 18 years) and their parents. Items were added to the DBRS to allow for both flexible and conventional regimens, and the DSMP was modified to use standardized wording across items, accommodate flexible regimens, and permit administration by nonmedical interviewers. RESULTS — Both measures had good evidence of internal consistency (for the DSMP: parent 0. 75 and youth 0. 70; for the DBRS: parent 0. 84 and youth 0. 84). Scores on the DSMP and the DBRS were significantly related (r 0. 72 for parents and 0. 74 for youth). There was moderate agreement between parent and youth (DSMP, r 0. 51; DBRS, r 0. 48).

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the relation between}} attrition and characteristics of the study protocol, specifically contact frequency, and <b>respondent</b> <b>burden.</b> The study is {{based on data from}} a longitudinal study with side studies on various topics, so that respondents have differential exposure to these study characteristics. Attrition outcomes are refusal and ineligibility through frailty. The effect of side study contact frequency and <b>respondent</b> <b>burden</b> on these outcomes is examined in two analytical samples: (1) baseline participants surviving to the first follow-up after 10 months (sample I), and (2) first follow-up participants surviving to the second follow-up after 3 years (sample II). Attrition during the first study interval was higher than during the second study interval, 15. 5 and 5. 4 %, respectively. In sample I, the request to participate in a side study on social network implied an increased risk of refusal to participate at first follow-up if subjects refused the request (RR 8. 34). However, if subjects participated in the network study, their risk of refusal was decreased (RR 0. 42). In sample II, requests to participate in one to four side study cycles increased the risk of refusal to participate at second follow-up if subjects participated in fewer cycles than requested (RR 9. 21). If subjects participated in all side study cycles that they were approached for, even if the number of cycles was five or more, this had an opposite effect: it decreased the risk of refusal (RR 0. 18). Ineligibility was not significantly associated with contact frequency or <b>respondent</b> <b>burden.</b> Furthermore, neither contact frequency nor <b>respondent</b> <b>burden</b> related refusal was selective with respect to socio-demographic characteristics and physical and mental health indicators. It is concluded that contact frequency is nonlinearly associated with attrition. The findings further suggest that designing a series of side studies within the 'longitudinal paradigm' does not severely damage the study's validity in terms of selective attrition.
