40|$|Two major {{concerns}} have inhibited {{the use of}} natural laminar flow (NLF) for viscous drag reduction on production aircraft.

50|$|The taildragger {{configuration}} {{has its own}} advantages, and {{is arguably}} more suited to rougher landing strips.

The subject tests utilized 33 % chord double-slotted flaps on a low aspect ratio wing that was fully immersed <b>in</b> the <b>propeller</b> <b>slipstream.</b> Evaluation of the flap effectiveness is aided by comparisons with the results of tests of other flap systems on the same twin propeller, twin tail boom STOL utility aircraft mode.

The lift and descent capability of the inverting flaps compared very favorably with that of the other flap systems that have been tested on this model, including some with much greater mechanical complexity. As expected, the flaps caused large nose down, pitching moment increments at the high lift settings; however, the trimmed characteristics are still competitive with those obtained from the more complicated flap systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address a {{preliminary}} assessment of the performance effects of swirl recovery vanes (SRVs) in a installed and uninstalled tractor propeller arrangement. A numerical analysis was performed on a propeller and a propeller-wing configuration after the SRVs were optimized first in a separate process. The SRVs are essentially designed to recover the swirl in the rotor slipstream, thereby increasing the propulsive efficiency. To confirm the main flow effects of the SRVs, a separate windtunnel study was performed on a single-rotating <b>propeller</b> model <b>in</b> the large low-speed windtunnel. A steady RANS-based numerical analysis showed that the application of SRVs in a propeller-only model may lead to an increase of propulsive efficiency in the order of 2 %. In case of the SRVs in a representative tractor propeller-wing configuration, the positive effects are reduced due to the swirl recovery effect of the wing and the upwash effect in the SRV plane. The latter requires an optimization per SRV blade which was not performed in this particular study. In de experimental study performance data of the propeller were acquired with a rotating shaft balance. Furthermore, Particle Image Velocimetry PIV measurements in the <b>slipstream</b> of the <b>propeller</b> with and without SRVs substantiated the efficacy of the vanes in reducing the swirl <b>in</b> the <b>propeller</b> <b>slipstream.</b> Reductions of 50 % in the swirl kinetic energy was observed at a medium thrust settings. </p...|$|R

Contra-Rotating propellers (CRP) are propulsor configurations offering higher efficiency compared to conventional single propellers by recovering the rotational energy <b>in</b> the <b>propeller</b> <b>slipstream.</b> The application of this type of propulsive device to modern ships becomes even more attractive, considering the recent developments in electric propulsion and the increased emphasis on fuel economy. Propeller design codes are therefore expected to include CRP design capabilities. This thesis describes two methods for designing CRP in the context of lifting-line theory, along with a procedure for predicting the cavitation performance of conventional propellers and CRP. All of the above methods have been implemented numerically and integrated into a computer program developed in MATLAB®. Comparisons of numerical predictions of efficiency between single and contra-rotating propellers, which confirm the superiority of the latter are presented. Physical insight into the increased {{efficiency of}} CRP is also obtained by presenting results for the velocity fields induced by these propulsor configurations.
