5000|$|The sand flow rate, {{known as}} flux, of the Nili Patera dunes is {{approximately}} {{equal to the}} flux of the dunes in Victoria Valley, Antarctica. The Nili Patera dune movement {{can be used to}} predict <b>rock</b> <b>erosion</b> rates due to sand blasting the rocks. Based on the gathered evidence, <b>rock</b> <b>erosion</b> rates are predicted to be close to the ones in Antarctica. In a paper published in the journal Nature, NASA scientists report that they have detected motion of Nili Patera dunes up to a height of 200 ft as [...] "coherent units across the Martian landscape". These discoveries have led to increased understanding of the role the wind plays in erosion phenomena of the Martian landscape. This, in turn, can lead to better planning of future Mars expeditions, both human and robotic.|$|E

50|$|Rock slope {{failures}} {{can occur}} {{due to the}} presence of water; ice jacking occurs when water between joint or fissure surfaces freezes and expands. This type of failure is progressive, resulting in incremental weakening over time, often requiring several cycles before failure. Ice jacking is one form of <b>rock</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|E

This shield volcano rose about 1,000 m and is now largely eroded, forming the Warrumbungles. The Breadknife was formed when hot magma spread through a soft rock.

His work with <b>rocks,</b> <b>erosion,</b> and fossils also led him to believe that the earth was much older than generally thought and formed part of the basis of Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|R

50|$|Knickpoints {{are formed}} by the {{influence}} of tectonics, climate history, and/or lithology. For example, uplift along a fault over which a river is flowing will often result in an unusually steep reach along a channel, known as a knickzone. Glaciation resulting in a hanging valley are often prime spots for knickpoints. If lithology of the rock varies, such as shale amongst igneous <b>rock,</b> <b>erosion</b> will occur more steadily in the softer rock than the surrounding, tougher rock.|$|E
50|$|The {{bedrock of}} the island {{consists}} of metamorphic and igneous Precambrian rocks, which {{are part of the}} Frontenac Terrane of the Central Metasedimentary Belt. This is consistent with a significant amount of the geology of Frontenac County. The metamorphic rocks, were deposited as sediments and consolidated into sedimentary rocks at least 950 million years ago. The combination of a deep burial of sedimentary rocks and the penetration of magma which resulted in igneous <b>rocks.</b> <b>Erosion</b> then revealed the metamorphic and igneous rocks. The metamorphic rocks that are found in the area include: schist, gneiss, amphibolites, quartzite, and marble.

50|$|The islands began {{emerging}} from the sea shortly after the last ice age. Due to the post-glacial rebound the process is still going on, with new skerries and islands being slowly created and old ones enlarged or merged. The current rate of rebound is between 4 and 10 millimetres a year. Because the islands are made of mainly granite and gneiss, two very hard types of <b>rock,</b> <b>erosion</b> is significantly slower than rebound. However, due to its southern location, the effect of postglacial rebound is smaller than for example than in Kvarken (Finnish: Merenkurkku) further north.|$|E

Vent clearing eruptions produced pyroclastic breccia, which linger on a mountain ridge north and east of Coquihalla Mountain.

50|$|A ribbon lake, Lake Washington is long, {{narrow and}} finger-like. Ribbon lakes are {{excavated}} by glaciers. As the Puget lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet flowed south {{near the end}} of the Late Pleistocene, it met bands of harder and softer <b>rock.</b> <b>Erosion</b> of the softer rock was faster and a linear depression was created in the flow direction. When the glacier melted, the lake filled with the meltwater, which was retained by moraine deposits. A dam can also be created by the bands of harder rock either side of the softer rock. There is usually a river at both ends of a ribbon lake, one being the inlet, and the other, the outlet—though in the case of present-day Lake Washington, inlet rivers are located at both ends, with a man-made outlet in the middle.|$|E

50|$|A {{foreland}} basin existed just to {{the east}} of the Sevier orogenic belt, which was inundated by the Western Interior Seaway. A forearc on the western side of the basin made this deeper than the eastern side, encouraging the build-up of sediment and, in time, sedimentary <b>rock.</b> <b>Erosion</b> of the Western Cordillera also contributed to the build-up of sedimentary rock on {{the western edge of the}} basin, while the more low-lying area to the east provided much less. Changes in the amount, type, rate, and other aspects of the sedimentation were caused by uplift, subsidence, sea level changes, and other factors. The water in the basin made at least two major advances and one major retreat during the Cretaceous, adding complexity to the rock and permitting the creation of riverine, marsh, and estuarine rock in addition to the principal shallow and deep marine rock.|$|E
50|$|When {{selecting}} a rope for heavy top roping use, a large diameter (>= 10mm) static rope (or low-stretch rope) {{is recommended for}} the anchors to prevent rope wear and reduce <b>rock</b> <b>erosion</b> and to ensure maximum safety {{in the event of}} a fall. A dynamic rope should be used for the climbers. It is important to arrange the anchor system such that the climbing rope touches the rock as little as possible; damage to or destruction of the rope can result if a rope is loaded or dragged across sharp rocks enough times or with enough force. For anchors which are set back from the cliff edge, extending the anchor using multiple slings, a long adjustable-length sling, or a length of static line is common. Most practitioners run the climbing rope through two screwgate carabiners attached to the anchor, to provide backup in case one becomes undone. In the interests of safety at least two separate and redundant anchor points should be used, with forces distributed as evenly between them as possible. In the photo above, it can be seen that only the two locking carabiners protrude over the cliff edge, allowing the climbing rope a relatively free run from belayer to climber.|$|E

50|$|Glaciers erode {{predominantly}} {{by three}} different processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, and ice thrusting. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood. Scientists have shown that, {{in addition to}} the role of temperature played in valley-deepening, other glaciological processes, such as erosion also control cross-valley variations. In a homogeneous bedrock erosion pattern, curved channel cross section beneath the ice is created. Though the glacier continues to incise vertically, the shape of the channel beneath the ice eventually remain constant, reaching a U-shaped parabolic steady-state shape as we now see in glaciated valleys. Scientists also provide numerical estimate of the time required for the ultimate formation of a steady-shaped U-shaped valley - approximately 100,000 years. In a weak bedrock (containing material more erodible than the surrounding <b>rocks)</b> <b>erosion</b> pattern, on the contrary, the amount of overdeepening is limited because ice velocities and erosion rates are reduced.|$|R
