25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved packing the iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box. This carburizing package is then heated to a high temperature but still under the melting point of the iron and left at that temperature for a length of time. The longer the package is held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface. Different depths of hardening are desirable for different purposes: sharp tools need deep hardening to allow grinding and <b>resharpening</b> without exposing the soft core, while machine parts like gears might need only shallow hardening for increased wear resistance.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{battalion}} in America {{had organized}} its own rifle company {{by the end}} of the war, although rifles were not formally issued to the army until the Baker Rifle in 1801. Flintlocks were heavily dependent on the weather; high winds could blow the gunpowder from the flash pan, while heavy rain could soak the paper cartridge, ruining the powder and rendering the musket unable to fire. Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring <b>resharpening,</b> while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: [...] "Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog".|$|E
2500|$|Tool {{geometry}} {{is extremely}} important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a [...] "face", which is {{the top of the}} graver, and a [...] "heel", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between <b>resharpening</b> than traditional metal tools.|$|E
50|$|Floats {{are similar}} to rasps and files. Rasps are {{generally}} coarse and cannot be <b>resharpened.</b> Files have angled ridges or teeth and cannot be <b>resharpened.</b> Floats have parallel teeth {{and they can be}} <b>resharpened</b> as many times as the thickness of the blade will allow.|$|R
50|$|The {{edge of the}} scraper that is {{extremely}} angled is the working edge. This edge {{is often used to}} soften hides or cleaning the meat off of the hides, in addition to being used for wood work. As the term scraper suggests, this tool was scraped at the hide or wood in order to reach the end goal. Scrapers tended to be large enough to fit comfortably in the hand and could be used without being mounted on wood or bone. However, it is very likely that scrapers were mounted on short handles even though it is very rare to find mounted scrapers. As scrapers are used they have to be <b>resharpened</b> in order to stay effective. This causes them to get progressively smaller as they are used, <b>resharpened,</b> used, resharpend, and used again. Consequently, the majority of the scrapers that are found on sites are ones that have been <b>resharpened</b> and used {{to the point of being}} no longer functional.|$|R
5000|$|...White steel, shiro-gane; {{a nearly}} pure steel {{that takes a}} very keen edge and <b>resharpens</b> easily. There are several types of white steel, #1 and #2 being the most common.|$|R
2500|$|As the {{distribution}} of obsidian sources in Mesoamerica is generally limited, many areas and sites lacked a local obsidian source or direct access to one. As a result, tool curation through edge-rejuvenation and/or <b>resharpening</b> was commonly used on larger-mass tools, such as bifaces, to prolong the tool’s (and the raw material’s) utility. [...] While prismatic blades were generally not curated (in the traditional sense) due to their small size, utility of the tools may have been maintained by changing their function. [...] In other words, as {{the edge of a}} blade lost its sharpness after long-term use, the blade may have been used in scraping activities, which does not require a very sharp edge, than as a cutting implement. Other curation techniques of prismatic blades involve reshaping them into other tool types, such as projectile points and awls.|$|E
50|$|In Bronze Age razors {{were known}} and in use by some men, {{but not on}} a daily basis since the {{procedure}} was rather unpleasant and required <b>resharpening</b> of the tool which reduced its endurance.|$|E
50|$|Chain mortisers, used {{to cut the}} mortice {{of large}} mortice and tenon timber framing use a number of chains, riveted side-by-side. They are used with a {{vertical}} tip-first plunge. Owing {{to the difficulty of}} <b>resharpening</b> the multiple teeth, these are usually made of long-lasting tungsten carbide.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} an area where tools were <b>resharpened</b> or replaced. In {{addition}} to the bison bones at the site, there were also butchered mammal (such as antelope, elk, deer), fish and bird bones.|$|R
5000|$|Roald Dahl {{used only}} pencils with yellow casing {{to write his}} books. He had 6 {{sharpened}} pencils ready {{at the beginning of}} each day and only when all 6 pencils became unusable did he <b>resharpen</b> them.|$|R
30|$|It is {{much more}} {{convenient}} and efficient to finish the surfaces of the nano-sized diamond coated milling cutters, and <b>resharpen</b> their cutting edges. Moreover, the AFM can avoid the graphitization and ensure the diamond purity as much as possible.|$|R
50|$|The HSS Standard core drills {{are made}} from M2 steel. These core drills {{are one of the}} most popular core drills in western {{countries}} due to its cost and <b>resharpening</b> advantage. The Standard HSS core drills are used to drill Mild and Structural steel, Aluminium, Stainless steel of lower BHN., etc.|$|E
50|$|Hoes {{fashioned}} from bison scapula were common cultivating tools among the Plains Village Indians. In particular, {{it was used}} for cultivating small garden crops. It continued to be used among these Indians until iron hoes were brought by French traders in the 18th century. Recovered bone hoes range from 40 cm to as small as 15 cm. The size variation is due, in large part, to frequent <b>resharpening.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{lies on the}} River Wye on {{the edge}} of the {{carboniferous}} limestone of the White Peak. Nearby is Blackwell Hall in the grounds of which have been found neolithic remains, including a flint <b>resharpening</b> flake for tranchet axes. There are also the remnants of a Romano-British field system, dating from around the year 400. The name is said to derive from the Norman Blacheuuelle or King's land. Jedediah Strutt had a farm there.|$|E
5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and <b>resharpen</b> and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|R
50|$|Erik rests. His pencil is {{returned}} the next day, worn {{down to a}} nub. He <b>resharpens</b> it and sets out more. They too vanish, {{as well as one}} of his cardigan sweaters. The sweater returns with a newly made twin. Two days later, Chief returns, apparently none the worse for wear.|$|R
5000|$|Ceramic blades hold an edge {{the longest}} of all, but they chip easily and may break if dropped. They also require special {{equipment}} and expertise to <b>resharpen.</b> They are sintered to shape with zirconium oxide powder. They are chemically nonreactive, so will not discolor {{or change the}} taste of food.|$|R
50|$|During the 1994 {{excavations}} of mastodon B, archaeologists identified 34 {{stone tools}} {{in association with}} the disarticulated faunal remains. These tools included prismatic blades, scrapers, gravers, and <b>resharpening</b> flakes. Subsequent examination of the bones from mastodon B revealed the presence of cut marks on a thoracic vertebra, which was recovered in direct contact with several flakes. The distinctive, linear, v-shaped profile of the cuts and their location along the thoracic spinous process indicated they were the result of butchering, and specifically, efforts to remove dorsal muscles along the backbone.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a {{traditional}} steel blade that benefits from regular honing and <b>resharpening</b> {{in order to}} keep a sharp edge, a ceramic knife will stay sharp and retain its cutting edge for much longer—up to 10x longer according to some tests. The inherent hardness of the ceramic material also makes it more difficult for the consumer to resharpen. [...] Although a ceramic knife therefore does not need regular sharpening {{in the same way as}} steel, its blade edge will eventually degrade or chip and lose its cutting edge, at which point specialized sharpening services are required for the ceramic edge.|$|E

25|$|Some Brewerton Phase {{side and}} corner-notched points (side-notched tradition) are often found <b>resharpened,</b> {{and some were}} {{modified}} as hafted end-scrapers. A few uncommon Pointed Pole Adzes {{are thought to have}} been used for heavy woodworking at one late northern Panhandle Archaic site (2000 BCE), where a dugout canoe has possibly been found.|$|R
25|$|Levanna and Yadkin {{points are}} made using antler {{percussion}} flaking (bifacial), rather than cruder flintknapping, and finalized with a pressure flaking technique. The latter technique {{is also used}} to <b>resharpen</b> earlier points, as some Madison types have been found. Both antler and bone lithic making tools are also commonly found among prehistoric West Virginia sites.|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, {{tools that}} require a sharp edge are made using cryptocrystalline {{materials}} that fracture in an easily controlled conchoidal manner.Cryptocrystalline tool stones include flint and chert, which are fine-grained sedimentary materials; rhyolite and felsite, which are igneous flowstones; and obsidian, a form of natural glass created by igneous processes. These materials fracture in a predictable fashion, and are easily <b>resharpened.</b> For {{more information on this}} subject, see lithic reduction.|$|R
5000|$|Sharpening {{straight}} edges (knives, chisels, etc.) by hand {{can be divided}} into phases. First the edge is sharpened with an abrasive sharpening stone, or a succession of increasingly fine stones, which shape the blade by removing material; the finer the abrasive the finer the finish. Then the edge may be stropped by polishing the edge with a fine abrasive such as rouge or tripoli on a piece of stout leather or canvas. The edge may be steeled or honed by passing the blade against a hard metal or ceramic [...] "steel" [...] which plastically deforms and straightens the material of the blade's edge which may have been rolled over irregularly in use, but not enough to need complete <b>resharpening.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{technological}} {{character of}} the Aterian has been debated for almost a century, but has until recently eluded definition. The problems defining the industry have related to its research history {{and the fact that}} a number of similarities have been observed between the Aterian and other North African stone tool industries of the same date. Levallois reduction is widespread across the whole of North Africa throughout the Middle Stone Age, and scrapers and denticulates are ubiquitous. Bifacial foliates moreover represent a huge taxonomic category and the form and dimension of such foliates associated with tanged tools is extremely varied. There is also a significant variation of tanged tools themselves, with various forms representing both different tool types (e.g., knives, scrapers, points) and the degree tool <b>resharpening.</b>|$|E
50|$|Known as the tranchet {{technique}} {{that makes the}} tranchet flake, this term can be defined in two ways: first, it is the forming of a straight edge used to cut {{from the edge of}} the tranchet flake by taking off a large flat flake from the tip. Second, it can be defined as the method one uses to <b>resharpen</b> or form the cutting edge of either an ax or an adze.|$|R
50|$|The {{guillotine}} {{cutting process}} dulls the blade over time, requiring {{that it be}} <b>resharpened.</b> Coated paper such as slick magazine paper dulls the blade more quickly than plain book paper, due to the kaolinite clay coating. Additionally, removing the binding of an entire hardcover book causes excessive wear due to cutting through the cover's stiff backing material. Instead the outer cover can be removed and only interior pages need be cut.|$|R
25|$|In addition, as hand axes can be recycled, <b>resharpened</b> and remade, {{they could}} have been used for varied tasks. For this reason it is {{misleading}} to think of them as axes, {{they could have}} been used for tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, piercing and hammering. In addition, and given their mass, they may be used as a lithic core to obtain flakes that could be used as knives or transformed for specialized uses through retouching.|$|R
50|$|The {{martensitic}} {{stainless steel}} alloy used for the cutting blades is optimized for high toughness and corrosion resistance and has a composition of 15% chromium, 0.60% silicon, 0.52% carbon, 0.50% molybdenum, and 0.45% manganese and is designated X55CrMo14 or DIN 1.4110 according to Victorinox. After a hardening process at 1040 °C and annealing at 160 °C the blades achieve an average hardness of 56 HRC. This steel hardness is suitable for practical use and easy <b>resharpening,</b> but less than achieved in stainless steel alloys used for blades optimized for high wear resistance. According to Victorinox the {{martensitic stainless steel}} alloy used for the other parts is X39Cr13 (aka DIN 1.4031, AISI/ASTM 420) and for the springs X20Cr13 (aka DIN 1.4021, but still within AISI/ASTM 420).|$|E

50|$|A {{tool bit}} is a non-rotary cutting tool used in metal lathes, shapers, and planers. Such cutters are also often {{referred}} to by the set-phrase name of single-point cutting tool, as distinguished from other cutting tools such as a saw or water jet cutter. The cutting edge is ground to suit a particular machining operation and may be <b>resharpened</b> or reshaped as needed. The ground tool bit is held rigidly by a tool holder while it is cutting.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Resharpened</b> {{and easily}} {{available}} PCB drills {{have historically been}} used in many prototyping and home PCB labs, using a high-speed rotary tool for small-diameter bits (such as a Moto-Tool by Dremel) in a stiff drill-press jig. [...] If used for other materials these tiny bits must be evaluated for equivalent cutting speed vs material resistance to the cut (hardness), as the bit's rake angle and expected feed per revolution are optimised for high-speed automated use on fiberglass PCB substrate.|$|R
