40|$|This study {{complements}} the scarce literature on growth determinants in fast emerging {{economies of the}} BRICS and MINT by assessing the determinants throughout the conditional distributions of the growth rate and <b>real</b> GDP <b>output</b> for the period 2001 - 2011. An instrumenal variable (IV) quantile regression approach is complemented with Two-Stage-Least Squares and IV Least Absolute Deviations. The instrumentation process is dynamic. The following findings are established. First, while Gross FDI has {{a negative effect on}} economic growth, the impact of Net FDI is positive, with a higher magnitude in top quantiles of the distributions. Second, the positive effect of natural resources is more apparent in countries with low initial growth levels. Third, the impact of telecommunications infrastructure is not very significant. Fourth, whereas the incidence of bank credit is positive for GDP growth, it is negative for <b>real</b> GDP <b>output.</b> Fifth, while trade openness is positive in bottom quantiles of GDP growth, but for the highest quantile in <b>real</b> GDP <b>output,</b> it is consistently negative on <b>real</b> GDP <b>output.</b> Sixth, while the incidence of political stability is negative on GDP growth, it is positive on <b>real</b> GDP <b>output,</b> with the negative (positive) effect apparent only in top (bottom) quantiles of GDP growth (<b>real</b> GDP <b>output).</b> Policy implications are discussed...|$|R

500|$|Macroeconomic {{theory has}} {{its origins in}} the study of {{business}} cycles and monetary theory. In general, early theorists believed monetary factors could not affect real factors such as <b>real</b> <b>output.</b> John Maynard Keynes attacked some of these [...] "classical" [...] theories and produced a general theory that described the whole economy in terms of aggregates rather than individual, microeconomic parts. Attempting to explain unemployment and recessions, he noticed the tendency for people and businesses to hoard cash and avoid investment during a recession. He argued that this invalidated the assumptions of classical economists who thought that markets always clear, leaving no surplus of goods and no willing labor left idle.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2007–2009 slump, corporate profits surged to new heights while real wages stagnated, but this did not lead to a full recovery of real employment, <b>real</b> <b>output</b> growth and real fixed investment. As Mohamed El-Erian of Pimco predicted fairly accurately in 2009, the number of jobless in the US economy has settled at a higher level that looks like persisting in the longer term. This result is mainly attributable to long-term unemployed people being unable to find paid work again, and dropping out of the labour force. BLS data showed that between 2008 and 2014, the US labor force (those employed for one hour per week or more + officially unemployed workers) stayed basically at the same size, although the proportion of unemployment within the labor force grew; yet according to the US Census Bureau the total US population increased by a net 13 million people at the same time (about half of whom were immigrants), and, according to the BLS, the number of US adults in the economically active population who are classified as [...] "not in the labor force" [...] increased by a net 12 million. It took seven years for the US economy to recover from the financial crash, but US senator Bernie Sanders has claimed that real US unemployment is twice the official figures. For Europe, Mario Draghi suggested an average increase in [...] "structural" [...] unemployment from 8.8% in 2008 to 10.3% by 2013. Just as in the 1970s and 1980s, the grand-average jobless rate has risen to a higher level. This creates a downward pressure on the modal average real wage, though at the top end salary packages still increase. In September 2014, Robert Reich stated that although profits were at record levels, the median US household income, adjusted for inflation, was now 8% lower than in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Purpose 9 ̆ 6 We assess growth {{determinants}} in the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) fast-developing {{nations for}} the period 2001 - 2011. Particular emphasis is laid on the bundling and unbundling of ten governance dynamics. Design/methodology/approach- Contemporary and non-contemporary Fixed- and Random-Effects regressions are employed as empirical strategies. GDP growth and <b>real</b> GDP <b>output</b> are used as dependent variables. The governance variables are bundled by means of principal component analysis. Findings- The following are some findings. First, governance is more positively significant in non-contemporary specifications as opposed to contemporary regressions. Second, there is some interesting evidence on the heterogeneity of political governance as a driver. Political governance and its constituents (political stability and voice & accountability) are significantly positive in GDP growth but insignificant in <b>real</b> GDP <b>output</b> regressions. Third, the other governance dynamics are more significant determinants of <b>real</b> GDP <b>output,</b> as opposed to GDP growth. Accordingly, they are insignificant in contemporary regressions and negatively significant in non-contemporary regressions for GDP growth. Fourth, the constituents of economic governance have the highest magnitude in {{the positive effects of}} governance dynamics on <b>real</b> GDP <b>output.</b> Practical implications- The following are some practical implications. First, lag determinants are necessary for growth targeting or timing of growth dynamics. Growth drivers for the most part are more significantly determined by past information. Second, political governance is the most important driver of economic growth, with the significance of effects more apparent in non-contemporary regressions. Third, economic governance and institutional governance are more positively predisposed to driving <b>real</b> GDP <b>output</b> than GDP growth. Originality/value- As far as we have reviewed, it is the first study to investigate growth determinants in the BRICS and MINT nations. It has strong implications for other developing countries on the contemporary and non-contemporary dynamics of governance in driving economic prosperity...|$|R
