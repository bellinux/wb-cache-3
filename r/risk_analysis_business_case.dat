40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present an {{approach}} for good practice with regards to using cost benefit analysis (CBA) as a value-adding activity in the information security investment process for large enterprises. The approach is supported by empirical data. From a MIO model perspective, this report {{is focused on the}} phase of strategic choices regarding organization, i. e. trying to find optimal investments for efficient operations. To assess, improve and monitor the operational effectiveness and management’s internal control environment is essential in today’s business execution. Executive management and boards are increasingly looking for an information security governance framework that encompasses information technology and information security: a single framework through which all information assets and activities within the organisation can be governed, to provide the optimum capability for meeting the organisation’s objectives, in terms of functionality and security. The investment decision {{is one of the most}} visible and controversial key decisions in an enterprise. Some projects are approved, others are bounced, and the rest enter the organisational equivalent of suspended animation with the dreaded request from the decision makers to “redo the business case” or “provide more information. ” The concept of cost benefit analyses of information security helps management to make decisions on which initiatives to fund with how much, as there needs to be an approach for measuring and comparing different alternatives and how they meet business objectives of the enterprise. Non-financial metrics are identified using different approaches: governance effectiveness, <b>risk</b> <b>analysis,</b> <b>business</b> <b>case</b> analysis or game theory. The financial performance metrics are driven by the main value disciplines of an enterprise. These lead to the use of formulas enabling the measurement of asset utilisation, profit or growth: ROI (ROIC), NPV, IRR (MIRR), FCF, DCF, Payback Period, TCO, TBO, EVA, and ROSI. The author shows research in the field of good corporate governance and the investment approval process, as well as case studies from two multinational enterprises. The case from Motorola demonstrates how IT governance principles are equally applicable to information security governance, while the case from Ericsson demonstrates how an information security investment decision can be supported by performing a cost benefit analysis using traditional marketing approaches of business case analysis (BCA) and standard financial calculations. The suggested good practice presented in this thesis is summarised in four steps: 1. Understand main rationale for the security investment 2. Identify stakeholders and strategic goals 3. Perform Cost Benefit Analysis (non-financial and financial performance metrics) 4. Validate that the results are relevant to stakeholders and strategic goals DISCLAIMER This report is intended for academic training only and should not be used for any other purposes.

In order to achieve this goal, this thesis challenges the theory with practice to equally reflect both perspectives. The theoretical part first reviews the literature dealing with business plan outlines and, then, presents the author's own systematic methodology to the <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> in <b>business</b> planning. The empirical part provides a real-life example of a structured business plan where the <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> concept designed by the author is applied. The conclusions from this paper are the following: The business plan outline is situational and cannot be standardized to one fixed pattern or framework. The <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> in a <b>business</b> plan increases its transparency and credibility and, therefore, it should be considered for its inherent part. The application of the <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> across the <b>business</b> plan shall follow a systematic approach, which is an adapted version of official risk management standards. In this paper, the author's own adapted framework of the <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> in the context of business planning is elaborated and applied to the real-life business plan...|$|R

Regulators have thus far failed to implement two obvious measures that would offer protection against such contamination - prohibiting the use of food organisms and requiring confinement to indoor production systems - presumably {{at least in part}} because they have been persuaded that it would seriously erode the profitability, and thus economic benefits, of biopharming.

They are complex, time-consuming, and costly, and have limitations regarding the data and assessment quality: First, security events have to be identified often without much methodological guidance, making the process prone to errors and omissions. Second, concrete probability values for these events usually have to be provided, and these are not available in practice to a satisfactory degree of precision and reliability. We propose an approach for <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> based on <b>business</b> process models enhanced with security requirements and information about critical processes as well as organizational and system boundaries. This approach bypasses these limitations: security risk events {{can be derived from}} the business process models together with the security requirements, and probabilities {{do not have to be}} provided.

If one considers the BM as a reflection of the strategy implemented by a company (Shafer et al., 2005; Casadeus-Masanell & Ricart, 2010) and the “how” an organization tailors its business model and strategy to respond to the external environment (and the relative risks and opportunities it faces) it becomes then important to understand how the BM is bound and it is linked to the mission, governance and the accountability and to what extent it is resilient. The elements of the trinomial mission-corporate governance-accountability model are in fact tied by reciprocal relations, since in every enterprise there exists an explicit and coherent coordination between mission, governance and accountability (Matacena, 2010). Mission is intended a synthesis of the company aims; corporate governance as the command structure and of the government present in the company; accountability as the company’s informative responsibility (to take into account and to give account to) of the company.|$|R

40|$|Intellectual capital (IC) of an {{enterprise}} {{refers to the}} knowledge, skills and experiences of the employees and the values like corporate culture, business processes and customer satisfaction which they create for the enterprise. IC is sometimes known as intangible or knowledge assets {{as opposed to the}} much more familiar traditional physical capital and financial capital, which are tangible in nature. Many researchers found that IC would create the majority of corporate values, especially for knowledge-intensive companies, explaining why IC has become the single most important driver of enterprise business growth, sustainability, innovation and competitive advantage in our globalized environment. Therefore proper assessment and reporting of these critical though intangible assets are essential in addition to what financial reports received by the business community for years. As there is currently much literature written on IC performance in the field already, this paper focuses instead on the risks such as knowledge loss from poor documentation or resignation of key staff. In particular, how a knowledge of IC risks can enhance the quality of credit <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> of financial institutions is also studied, as a poor credit risk management may quickly erode the capital base and accumulated earnings of any bank.
