Although the IKL/HDW design was rated highest during the initial inspection, the evaluation team found that the German proposal was less attractive than previously thought. Although IKL/HDW claimed that their boat could meet the RAN's performance requirements, the evaluators concluded from the information provided that doing so would require the deactivation of all non-essential and some essential systems. Conversely, Kockums' proposal conceded {{that they did not}} meet the requirements, although evaluators found that the figures failed by only narrow margins, and believed that these were conservative. The evaluation team recalculated the capability statistics for both submarines to a common baseline, portraying the predicted Australian operating conditions, which generally saw Kockums' figures <b>revised</b> <b>upwards,</b> and those from IKL/HDW downwards. This resulted in growing support for the Type471 bid, and outcries from the IKL and HDW groups, who questioned the validity of the recalculations and if the Australian evaluators had the experience to do this correctly.|$|E

40|$|According to {{conventional}} wisdom, a fiscal consolidation {{is likely to}} contract real aggregate demand. It has often been argued, however, that this conclusion is misleading as it neglects the role of expectations of future policy: if the fiscal consolidation is read {{by the private sector}} as a signal that the share of government spending in GDP is being permanently reduced, households will <b>revise</b> <b>upwards</b> their estimate of their permanent income, and will raise current and planned consumption. Only the empirical evidence can distinguish which view is the more appropriate, that is, how often the contractionary effect of a fiscal consolidation prevails over its expansionary expectational effect. This paper presents new evidence, drawing on the European exercise in fiscal rectitude of the 1980 s and focusing on its two most extreme cases, Denmark and Ireland.

We use the τ 2 statistic to fit the main-sequence data, but find that we must make significant modifications if we are to fit sequences which have vertical segments in the colour–magnitude diagram.

40|$|Objective. While brain–computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) {{for communication}} have reached considerable technical maturity, {{there is still}} a great need for state-of-the-art evaluation by the end-users outside laboratory environments. To achieve this primary objective, it is necessary to augment a BCI with a series of components that allow end-users to type text effectively. Approach. This work presents the clinical evaluation of a motor imagery (MI) BCI text-speller, called BrainTree, by six severely disabled end-users and ten able-bodied users. Additionally, we define a generic model of code-based BCI applications, which serves as an analytical tool for evaluation and design. Main results. We show that all users achieved remarkable usability and efficiency outcomes in spelling. Furthermore, our model-based analysis highlights the added value of human–computer interaction techniques and hybrid BCI error-handling mechanisms, and reveals the effects of BCI performances on usability and efficiency in code-based applications. Significance. This study demonstrates the usability potential of code-based MI spellers, with BrainTree being the first to be evaluated by a substantial number of end-users, establishing them as a viable, competitive alternative to other popular BCI spellers. Another major outcome of our model-based analysis is the derivation of a 80 % minimum command accuracy requirement for successful code-based application control, <b>revising</b> <b>upwards</b> previous estimates attempted in the literature...|$|R

Jehu of Israel paid tribute at the same time, as shown on the Black Obelisk.

These data {{increase our}} {{insight into the}} PPIP 5 K 2 reaction mechanism and clarify the interface between PPIP 5 K catalytic activities and cellular bioenergetic status. For example, stochiometric analysis uncovered non-productive, substrate-stimulated ATPase activity (thus, approximately 2 and 1. 2 ATP molecules are utilized to synthesize each molecule of 1 -InsP 7 and InsP 8, respectively). Impaired ATPase activity of a PPIP 5 K 2 -K 248 A mutant increased atomic-level insight into the enzyme's reaction mechanism. We found PPIP 5 K 2 to be fully reversible as an ATP-synthase in&#x 00 A 0;vitro, but our new data contradict previous perceptions that significant &#x 2018;reversibility&#x 2019; occurs in&#x 00 A 0;vivo.

40|$|The Sagittarius dwarf {{galaxy is}} the {{archetype}} of a tidally disrupting system. Both leading and trailing tails {{can be observed}} across at least 180 degrees {{of the sky and}} measurements of their luminosity density profiles have recently become available. Using numerical simulations, we explore the factors that control the appearance of such profiles. We use two possible models for the Sgr progenitor. The first is a one-component Plummer model, which may represent either a dark matter free progenitor, or one in which pre-existing dark matter has already been largely stripped. The second is a two-component model in which the stars are represented by a Hernquist sphere embedded in a cosmologically modish Navarro-Frenk-White dark halo. Disruption of the models in the Milky Way galaxy provides us with two tellings of the tale of the formation of the Sgr stream. The initial disintegration of the baryons proceeds more slowly for the two-component models because of the protective cocoon of dark matter. Once this has been stripped, though, matters proceed apace. In both cases, the profiles after ~ 6 pericentric passages provide good matches to the observational data, but the tails are more extended for the two-component models. The leading and trailing tails are symmetric at apocentre or pericentre. At other orbital phases, asymmetries are present, as tails are compressed as they approach apocentre and stretched out as they approach pericentre. There may exist density enhancements corresponding to such pile-ups which may be observable in current survey data. We re-visit the calculation of Niederste-Ostholt et al. (2010) and slightly <b>revise</b> <b>upwards</b> the luminosity of the Sgr progenitor to 9. 9 - 14. 4 x 10 ^ 7 solar luminosities based on insights from the simulations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recruitment issues {{continue}} to impact {{a large number}} of trials. Sharing recruitment information is vital to supporting researchers to accurately predict recruitment and to manage the risk of poor recruitment during study design and implementation. The {{purpose of this article is}} to build on the knowledge available to researchers on recruiting to community-based trials. METHODS: A critical commentary of the recruitment challenges encountered during the Booster Study, a randomised controlled trial in which researchers investigated the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing style intervention on the maintenance of physical activity. An overview of recruitment is provided, as well as strategies employed to recruit prospective participants and possible barriers to recruitment. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-two people, 47 % of the original target, were recruited through mail-outs, with secondary recruitment pathways yielding no additional participants. The research team encountered problems with recontacting interested participants and providing study materials in non-English languages. A lower response rate to the mail-out and a greater number of non-contactable participants in the full study than in the pilot study resulted in a smaller pool of eligible participants from the brief intervention eligible for recruitment into the randomised controlled trial. CONCLUSIONS: Despite using widely accepted recruitment strategies and incorporating new recruitment tactics in response to challenges, the Booster Study investigators failed to randomise a sufficient number of participants. Recruitment in trials of community-based behavioural interventions may have different challenges than trials based on clinical or primary care pathways. Specific challenges posed by the complexity of the study design and problems with staffing and resources were exacerbated by the need to <b>revise</b> <b>upwards</b> the number of mailed invitations as a result of the pilot study. Researchers should ensure study design facilitates recruitment and consider the implications of changing recruitment on the operational aspects of the trial. Where possible, the impact of new strategies should be measured, and recruitment successes and challenges should be shared with those planning similar studies.
