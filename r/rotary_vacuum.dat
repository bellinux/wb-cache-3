25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a <b>rotary</b> <b>vacuum</b> filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E

40|$|The present article {{refers to}} the {{implementation}} of a new technology of <b>rotary</b> vane <b>vacuums</b> pumps in a filling machine of beer. The reason why the vacuum is applied to the bottle is to remove the oxygen in its interior and thereby sustain the allowed values of TPO Total Packing Oxygen, preventing oxidation of the product and lose their organoleptic characteristics. This is a process that until now was performed with liquid ring vacuum pumps using water as a liquid sealant and that after 10 years of continuous work have lost their capacity to generate the vacuum required by the system and must be replaced necessarily. Presenting two alternatives, maintaining the same technology for the vacuum pumps, or change to <b>rotary</b> vane <b>vacuum</b> pumps.

40|$|Nuclear grade {{ammonium}} diuranate (ADU) and UO powders were produced on a pilot plant scale by the continuous single-stage precipitation of ADU with ammonium hydroxide, dewatering with a <b>rotary</b> drum <b>vacuum</b> filter or a solid bowl centrifuge, and batch-tray drying and calcination-reduction to UO powder. Precipitation at 50 ºC and pH {{values in the}} range 7. 2 to 8. 0 produced ADU materials which could be converted to UO powder by calcination and reduction at temperatures of 600 to 730 ºC, and fabricated into sintered pellets with densities of 10. 37 to 10. 77 g cm- 3. The lower the pH of precipitation the lower was the reduction temperature required to achieve a specified pellet density. Precipitation with ammonium hydroxide at 80 ºC and with ammonia gas at 50 ºC offered no advantages over precipitation with ammonium hydroxide at 50 ºC. The UO 2 powders and sintered pellets produced from ADU powders precipitated by the three methods were similar. Precipitation at pH 7. 5 and 50 ºC is recommended since a reasonably filterable precipitate can be produced reproducibly without a need for stringent control, and considerable flexibility {{is available in the}} subsequent production of a sinterable UO 2 powder.

However, a smaller design would be more economical as the maintenance, energy usage and investment cost would be less than a bigger <b>rotary</b> <b>vacuum</b> drum filter.Over the years, the technology drive has pushed development to further heights revolving around <b>rotary</b> <b>vacuum</b> drum filter in terms of design, performance, maintenance and cost. This has also {{led to the development of}} smaller rotary drum vacuum filters, ranging from laboratory scale to pilot scale, both of which can be used for smaller applications (such as at a lab in a university) [...] High performance capacity, optimised filtrate drainage with low flow resistance and minimal pressure loss are just a few of the benefits. With advanced control systems prompting automation, this has reduced the operation of attention needed hence, reducing the operational cost. Advancements in technology also means that precoat can be cut to 1/20th the thickness of human hair, thus making the use of precoat more efficient [...] Lowered operational and capital cost can also be achieved nowadays due to easier maintenance and cleaning. Complete cell emptying can be done quickly with the installation of leading and trailing pipes.Given that the filter cloth is usually one of the more expensive component in the <b>rotary</b> <b>vacuum</b> drum filter build up, priority on its maintenance must be kept quite high. A longer lifetime, protection from damage and consistent performance are the few criteria that must not be overlooked.Besides considering production cost and quality, cake washing and cake thickness are essential issues that are important in the process.
