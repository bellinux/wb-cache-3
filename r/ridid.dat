50|$|The {{causes of}} <b>Rido</b> are varied {{and may be}} further {{complicated}} by a society’s concept of honor and shame, an integral aspect of the social rules that determine accepted practices in the affected communities. The trigger of conflicts range from petty offenses, such as theft and jesting, to more serious crimes, like homicide. These are further aggravated by land disputes and political rivalries, the most common causes of <b>Rido.</b> Proliferation of firearms, lack of law enforcement and credible mediators in conflict-prone areas, and an inefficient justice system further contribute to instances of <b>Rido.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. Previous {{studies suggest}} an {{association}} between idiopathic detrusor overactivity (IDO) and high-count bacteriuria (> 105 CFU/mL). Recently, the importance of low-count bacteriuria (103 – 105 CFU/mL) in dysuric women with has been recognised. However, the optimal microbiological threshold for women with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms remains unclear. Design and Methods A 2 -year prospective cohort study, to examine the incidence of low-count and high-count bacteriuria in women with refractory IDO (<b>RIDO)</b> versus a control group without OAB symptoms. Women with dysuria, voiding dysfunction or recent urethral instrumentation were excluded. Mid-stream urine (MSU) specimens were collected during acute symptomatic exacerbation in the IDO group and cultured at the 103 CFU/mL threshold. Statistical analysis was performed using Statsdirect statistical package 2. 7. 2. Results. Between November 2007 and November 2009, 218 study MSU specimens were collected. Both the overall incidence of any significant bacteriuria ≥ 103 CFU/mL (P< 0. 0001) and the incidence of low-count bacteriuria (P= 0. 0091) were significantly higher in the <b>RIDO</b> women than the controls. There were no baseline differences in age, menopausal status or prior continence surgery between the groups. In the <b>RIDO</b> group, specimens positive for low-count bacteriuria only {{were less likely to}} be associated with significant pyuria P< 0. 0001) and were cultured from younger women (P= 0. 0009), than specimens positive for high-count bacteriuria. Conclusions The prevalence of bacteriuria in women with <b>RIDO</b> during symptomatic exacerbation is 40 %, which is significantly higher than the incidence in similarly-aged women without OAB. One-third of positive cultures show low-count bacteriuria only. The management of women with <b>RIDO</b> should include a search for bacteriuria, including low-count bacteriuria...|$|R

40|$|Edges in {{an image}} arise from {{discontinuities}} in scene variables, namely reflectance (R), illumination (I), depth (D) and surface orientation (O). Prior studies on edge classification have {{viewed it as}} a binary classification problem: each edge is assumed to arise from one of two disjoint categories (e. g., depth or not depth, shadow or not shadow). Here we suggest an alternate view in which an edge may signal discontinuities in any combination of the scene variables (<b>RIDO).</b> To explore this model, we had 4 trained observers label one randomly selected edge in each of 1, 000 randomly selected images drawn from the McGill Calibrated Colour Image Database and from Flickr; the averaged data provide {{an estimate of the}} joint distribution over the 4 binary variables <b>RIDO.</b> To model the distribution, we consider an exhaustive set of 42 undirected and 72 directed graphical models of low-order (parameters). The models first link the RI variables, capturing the constraint but also the fact that the two variables change together less often than would be predicted by independence – it’s usually one or the other. The IO variables are then linked, which captures the fact that illumination {{is more likely to be}} changing if surface orientation is changing. More subtle relations are most efficiently captured by directed models. For example, conditioning R on D captures the increased likelihood of reflectance change at occlusion boundaries...|$|R

This work aimed at exploring the various issues associated with a petroleum Refinery in kaduna metropolis of Nigeria. The Refinery was established last 30 years and without the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This therefore generated environmental stress to the host ecosystem and is causing serious concerns to the host community. The research work has used both Questionnaire survey and laboratory analysis of some selected parameters with the view to finding the factual condition of the ecosystem, so that the opposing claims of both the host community of <b>Rido</b> {{and that of the}} petroleum Refinery could be verified to know which one is correct. Samples of Soil, water and air were analyzed amongst others, the results indicated high concentration of heavy metals in both water and soil samples. The air sample also revealed high concentration of both oxides of Nitrogen and Sulfur. These findings and the others were compared to the WHO standards and were found to be above the maximum allowable levels for savanna ecosystem. The result was also corroborated by the findings from the medical and ecological studies which confirmed high degree of pollution related ailments and environmental stress of the surrounding species of flora and fauna. It was therefore recommended that bio-remediation and clean-up of contamination should be implemented together with adequate compensation for the host community of the <b>Rido</b> region. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Rido</b> {{conflicts}} are either resolved, unresolved, or reoccur. Although {{the majority of}} these cases remain unresolved, there have been many resolutions through different conflict-resolving bodies and mechanisms. These cases utilize the formal procedures of the Philippine government and/or the various indigenous systems. Formal methods may involve official courts, local government officials, police, and the military. Indigenous methods to resolve conflicts usually involve elder leaders who use local knowledge, beliefs, and practices, as well as their own personal influence, to help repair and restore damaged relationships. Some cases using this approach involve the payment of blood money to resolve the conflict. Hybrid mechanisms include the collaboration of government, religious, and traditional leaders in resolving conflicts through the formation of collaborative groups. Furthermore, the institutionalization of traditional conflict resolution processes into laws and ordinances has been successful with the hybrid method approach. Other conflict-resolution methods include the establishment of ceasefires and the intervention of youth organizations.|$|R
