40|$|For {{an exact}} {{quantitative}} description of spectral {{properties in the}} theory of synchrotron radiation, the concept of effective spectral width is introduced. In the classical theory, numeric calculations of effective spectral width (using an effective width not exceeding 100 harmonics) for polarization components of synchrotron radiation are carried out. The dependence of the effective spectral width and initial harmonic on the energy of a <b>radiating</b> <b>particle</b> is established...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A nonrelativistic {{model for}} the {{classical}} electrodynamic equations of motion for a <b>radiating</b> <b>particle</b> is investigated. This model is suitable for discussion in a beginning differential equations course and beginning physics course on particle dynamics. It is of interest as it is linear of third order and the third derivative acts as a damping term. Boundedness of the solution becomes of critical importance and conditions are determined for bounded solutions in the unforced and simple sinusoidal forcing cases. The sensitivity of numerical solutions is discussed and further investigations suitable for undergraduate research projects or small student group investigations are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Second order Newton {{equations}} {{of motion}} for a <b>radiating</b> <b>particle</b> are presented. It is argued that the trajectories obeying them also satisfy the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equations for general 3 D motions in the non-relativistic and relativistic limits. The case of forces only depending of the proper time is here considered. For these properties to hold, it is sufficient that the external force to be infinitely smooth and that a series formed with its time derivatives converges. This series define in a special local way the effective forces entering the Newton equations. When the external force vanishes in an open vicinity of a given time, the effective one also becomes null. Thus, the proper solutions of the effective equations can not show runaway or pre-acceleration effects. The Newton equations are numerically solved for a pulsed force given by an analytic function along the proper time axis. The simultaneous satisfaction of the ALD equations is numerically checked. Further, a set of modified ALD equations for almost everywhere infinitely smooth forces, but including step like discontinuities in some points is also presented for the case of collinear motions. The form of the equations supports the statement argued in a previous work, about that the causal Lienard-Wiechert field solution surrounding a <b>radiating</b> <b>particle,</b> implies that the effective force on the particle should instantaneously vanish when the external force is retired. The modified ALD equations proposed in the previous work are here derived in a generalized way including the same effect also when a the force is instantly connected.

Relativistic particles (electrons) radiate in the Weibel-produced magnetic fields in the Jitter regime. Conventionally, in this regime, the particle deflections are considered to be smaller than the relativistic beaming angle of 1 /γ (γ being the Lorentz factor of an emitting particle) and the particle distribution is assumed to be isotropic. This is a relatively idealized situation as far as lab experiments are concerned. We relax the assumption of the isotropy of <b>radiating</b> <b>particle</b> distribution and present the extension of the jitter theory amenable for comparisons with experimental data.

We report {{observations of the}} Crab pulsar made during prototype testing at the McDonald 2. 7 m telescope with a fiber-coupled transition-edge sensor (TES) system. These data show substantial (d[alpha]~ 0. 3), rapid variations in the spectral index through the pulse profile, with a strong phase-varying IR break across our energy band. These variations correlate with X-ray spectral variations, but no single synchrotron population can account for the full Spectral Energy Distribution (SED).

40|$|The Landau-Lifshitz {{equation}} {{provides an}} {{efficient way to}} account for the effects of radiation reaction without acquiring the non-physical solutions typical for the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation. We solve the Landau-Lifshitz equation in its covariant four-vector form in order to control both the energy and momentum of <b>radiating</b> <b>particle.</b> Our study reveals that implicit time-symmetric collocation methods of the Runge-Kutta-Nyström type are superior in both accuracy and better maintaining the mass-shell condition than their explicit counterparts. We carry out an extensive study of numerical accuracy by comparing the analytical and numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz equation. Finally, we present the results of simulation of particles scattering by a focused laser pulse. Due to radiation reaction, particles are less capable for penetration into the focal region, as compared to the case of radiation reaction neglected. Our results are important for designing the forthcoming experiments with high intensity laser fields. Comment: 16 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

Introduction Transition radiation occurs when a charged particle crosses the boundary between two media with different dielectric constants. It was first predicted by Ginzburg and Frank in 1946. [1] The first experimental observation of transition radiation was reported in 1959 by Goldsmith and Jelley.

40|$|Anisotropic {{distributions}} of charged particles including two-stream distributions {{give rise to}} generation of either stochastic electric fields (in the form of Langmuir waves, Buneman instability) or random quasi-static magnetic fields (Weibel and filamentation instabilities) or both. These two-stream instabilities are known to {{play a key role}} in collisionless shock formation, shock-shock interactions, and shock-induced electromagnetic emission. This paper applies the general non-perturbative stochastic theory of radiation to study electromagnetic emission produced by relativistic particles, which random walk in the stochastic electric fields of the Langmuir waves. This analysis takes into account the cumulative effect of uncorrelated Langmuir waves on the <b>radiating</b> <b>particle</b> trajectory giving rise to angular diffusion of the particle, which eventually modifies the corresponding radiation spectra. We demonstrate that the radiative process considered is probably relevant for emission produced in various kinds of astrophysical jets, in particular, prompt gamma-ray burst spectra, including X-ray excesses and prompt optical flashes.

25|$|It is {{impossible}} for food irradiators to induce radiation in a product. Irradiators emit electrons or photons and the radiation is intrinsically radiated at precisely known strengths (wavelengths for photons, and speeds for electrons).

40|$|The Silicon Transition Radiation Detector (SiTRD) {{combines}} the excellent space resolution of a silicon tracker with the particle identification capability {{of a conventional}} TRD. The detector consists of multiple modules, each composed by a radiator and a tracker plane, separated by a gap and immersed in a magnetic field. This layout allows {{the separation of the}} TR photons possibly produced by <b>radiating</b> <b>particles</b> from their trajectories. Provided that the separation in the tracker plane is larger than the granularity of the tracker, the SiTRD can identify <b>radiating</b> <b>particles</b> from non-radiating ones. Moreover, the small amount of material encountered by the particles along their path does not significantly affect the momentum reconstruction performance of the tracker. These features make the SiTRD an attractive option when designing the inner tracker of a collider experiment. We have studied a possible SiTRD layout for the inner tracker of a collider experiment at LHC. The detector parameters have been optimized taking into account the geometry constraints derived from an upgrade proposal of the ATLAS inner tracker. A Monte Carlo simulation has been also developed in which the detector performance has been investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{hard radiation}} emission in small-angle transplanckian scattering. We show {{how to reduce}} this problem to a quantum field theory computation in a classical background (gravitational shock wave). In momentum space, the formalism {{is similar to the}} flat-space light cone perturbation theory, with shock wave crossing vertices added. In the impact parameter representation, the <b>radiating</b> <b>particle</b> splits into a multi-particle virtual state, whose wavefunction is then multiplied by individual eikonal factors. As a phenomenological application, we study QCD radiation in transplanckian collisions of TeV-scale gravity models. We derive the distribution of initial state radiation gluons, and find a suppression at large transverse momenta with respect to the standard QCD result. This is due to rescattering events, in which the quark and the emitted gluon scatter coherently. Interestingly, the suppression factor depends on the number of extra dimensions and provides a new experimental handle to measure this number. We evaluate the leadinglog corrections to partonic cross-sections due to the initial state radiation, and prove that they can be absorbed into the hadronic PDF. The factorization scale should then be chose...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} Baier and Katkov {{is applied to}} {{calculate}} the correction terms to the Sokolov-Temov radiation formula due to the variation of the magnetic field strength along the trajectory of a <b>radiating</b> <b>particle.</b> We carry the calculation up to. the second order in the power expansion of &r/B, where r is the formation time of radiation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} three QED phenomena in strong electromagnetic fields: Schwinger pair production, vacuum birefringence and radiation reaction. We study electron-positron pair production {{in a variety}} of field configurations and, using complex worldline instantons, reveal new insights into the case of fields with lightlike inhomogeneities. We also find universal scaling for the pair production probability near critical points. Vacuum birefringence is the change in polarisation of a probe laser beam induced by interaction with a second electromagnetic field. We relate this macroscopic phenomena to the microscopic physics of individual photons in the probe flipping polarisation or helicity in a strong background field, and use this to make predictions for upcoming birefringence experiments, by considering the impact of realistic field geometry. Radiation reaction is the recoil effect on the motion of a <b>radiating</b> <b>particle</b> as it is accelerated by a background field. Due to the existence of unphysical solutions to the equation of motion derived in classical electrodynamics, several alternative classical equations have been proposed. We derive radiation reaction from QED and take the classical limit to test the validity of a number of these classical equations. Choosing a plane wave background allows us to treat the background field exactly and also to make general predictions about the form of a classical equation. We treat both vacuum birefringence and radiation reaction in a field theory formalism that naturally lends itself to systems with plane wave backgrounds - namely lightfront quantisation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we pay {{attention}} to the inconsistency in the derivation of the symmetric electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor for a system of charged particles from its canonical form, when the homogeneous Maxwell equations are applied to the symmetrizing gauge transformation, while the non-homogeneous Maxwell equations are used to obtain the motional equation. Applying the appropriate non-homogeneous Maxwell equation to both operations, we have revealed an additional symmetric term in the tensor, named as "compensating term". Analyzing the structure of this "compensating term", we suggested a method of "gauge renormalization, which allows transforming the divergent terms of classical electrodynamics (infinite self-force, self-energy and self-momentum) to converging integrals. The motional equation obtained for a non-radiating charged particle does not contain its self-force, and the mass parameter includes the sum of mechanical and electromagnetic masses. The motional equation for a <b>radiating</b> <b>particle</b> also contains the sum of mechanical and electromagnetic masses, and does not yield any "runaway solutions". It has been shown that the energy flux in a free electromagnetic field is guided by the Poynting vector, whereas the energy flux in a bound EM field is described by the generalized Umov vector, defined in the paper. The problem of "Poincare stresses" is also examined. It has been shown that the presence of the "compensating term" in the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor allows a solution of the " 4 / 3 problem", where the total observable mass of the electron is completely determined by the Poincare stresses and hence the conventional relativistic relationship between the energy and momentum is recovered.
