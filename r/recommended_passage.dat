As a Cold War measure, it was intended to counter and inoculate against propaganda from the Soviet Union and Communist organizations primarily in Europe. The principal purpose of the legislation was to engage in a global struggle for minds and wills, a phrase used by Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|R

50|$|Part of Massive Resistance {{involved}} {{the closing of}} public schools in various Virginia cities and counties to prevent racially integrated classrooms. Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County (1952) {{was one of the}} companion cases to Brown v. Board of Education (1954), but the Supreme Court had left enforcement to the local federal district judge. Moreover, the Gray Commission of Byrd loyalists had <b>recommended</b> <b>passage</b> of various laws to avoid or delay integration. After opinions by the Virginia Supreme Court on January 19, 1959 (the birthday of Robert E. Lee) as well as a three-judge federal panel overturned much of the new Virginia legislation, Governor James Lindsay Almond Jr. (previously attorney general) and Harrison decided not to defy those courts and allowed schools in Arlington and Norfolk to reopen. However the schools in Prince Edward County closed in 1958 and did not reopen until 1963, as white students used tuition grants to attend a private segregation academy at state expense, while black students were left to volunteer efforts. Other problematic school closures, ultimately opened pursuant to federal court orders included those in Albemarle, Warren County and later New Kent County (the subject of the 1968 Supreme Court decision in Green v. County School Board of New Kent County (1968). Harrison told the board to comply unless they were willing to risk prosecution. By this time, he, like a number of other Byrd Democrats, had concluded that obstinate resistance to integration could not continue.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the Majority Report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's {{review of}} the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No. 1) Bill 2014, which in June 2014 <b>recommended</b> <b>passage</b> of the bill by the Australian Senate. Effectively, such action by the Australian parliament would bring to an end uniform national regulation of Australian charities, which, after twenty years of debate, and with the overwhelming support of charities and their supporters, commenced two {{years ago with the}} Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012. The paper demonstrates that the Majority Committee was highly selective in its consideration of the evidence before it, preferring to ignore the largely consensus view of the charity sector, its professional advisors, knowledgeable academics and others, in favour of (in some cases poorly supported) minority views. Consequently, it raises the question: is the Coalition government's opposition to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission based on a desire to improve the efficiency of charities, or is it driven by ideology 1 and in service of narrow sectional interests?Phil Sa...|$|E

Limnological monitoring and experimental sampling protocol, designed to establish a limnological baseline and to evaluate sockeye salmon production capability of the lakes, are present:ed. Also presented are <b>recommended</b> <b>passage</b> improvements for current fish passage barriers/impediments on migratory routes to the lakes. We initiated O. Nerka population evaluations for Redfish and Alturas lakes; this included population estimates of emerging kokanee fry entering each lake in the spring and adult kokanee spawning surveys in tributary streams during the fall. Gill net evaluations of Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes were done in September, 1992 to assess the relative abundance of fish species among the Stanley Basin lakes. Fish population data ~ill be used to predict sockeye salmon production potential within a lake, as well as a baseline to monitor long-term fish community changes as a result of sockeye salmon recovery activities. Also included is a paper that reviews sockeye salmon enhancement activities in British Columbia and Alaska and recommends strategies for the release of age-O sockeye salmon that will be produced from the current captive broodstock...|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} of legality {{has been compared}} to the much more politically charged issue of flag desecration. It can be argued that the desecration of the flag is comparable to the desecration of a photograph of Legal Tender (provided it was modified as to not violate counterfeiting laws). In 1989, in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Flag Protection Act, former U.S. Attorney General William Barr testified that any regulation protecting something purely for its symbolic value would be struck down as unconstitutional. The Senate report <b>recommending</b> <b>passage</b> of the Act argued that Barr's theory would render 18 U.S.C. § 333 unconstitutional as well. In a dissent in Smith v. Goguen, Justice Rehnquist counted 18 U.S.C. § 333 in a group of statutes in which the Government protects its interest in some private property which is [...] "not a traditional property interest". On the other hand, the Government's interest in protecting circulating currency might not be purely symbolic; it costs the Bureau of Engraving and Printing approximately 5 cents to replace a note.|$|R

A swing span on the Keokuk side allowed river traffic to cross. When the bridge opened in 1871, the first locomotive to cross the bridge crushed the pivot point of the swing span. It was replaced a few days later. Ten years later, War Eagle, a river steamer sank after it collided with a fixed span of the bridge. Both the ship and bridge span were destroyed.
