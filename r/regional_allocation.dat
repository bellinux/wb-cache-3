40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} <b>regional</b> <b>allocation</b> of government funds in a two-region, two-good economy in which production of each good requires labor, capital, and a local public good. Changes in <b>regional</b> <b>allocation</b> of federal expenditures and public services are found to significantly impact the national economy {{in addition to the}} regional economies. For example, output of both regions and the national economy may decrease (or increase) as a result of such reallocation. This is because, output of a region directly depends on the fraction of federal funds spent in that region, and indirectly on output of the other region. Thus even if the proportion of government funds increases for a region, its output may actually decline if the fall in the fraction of government resources for the other region significantly decreases production there. Our results demonstrate that in addition to the amount of government expenditures and public services, an economy's capital accumulation, production, and factor returns are significantly influenced by how these government expenditures and public services are regionally allocated. ...|$|E

In Southern Finland, decisions concerning further actions for the preservation of forest biodiversity will be made in the coming years. To support policy making, we present a multi-regional model that is applicable in determining the economically optimal <b>regional</b> <b>allocation</b> of conservation sites. Three habitat quality models are evaluated to calculate habitat quality indices used as a surrogate for a biodiversity value in a forest sector model. The scenarios presented provide information about the economic impacts of conservation choices on the forest sector. The overall economic impacts of conservation depend on its scale and <b>regional</b> <b>allocation.</b> Conserving land with high biodiversity value can have less adverse impact on the forest sector than conservation of typical commercial forest sites. When optimizing conservation set-asides, we found that set-asides targeted to certain regions possessing higher/lower than average relative share of ecologically valuable land, caused lower/higher adverse economic impacts on the forest sector. Because it is expensive to search land suitable for conservation, these regions could be respectively favoured/avoided when asking forest owners to offer their land for the new conservation program in Southern Finland, which will be based on voluntariness.
