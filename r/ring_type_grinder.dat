30|$|This section {{analyzes}} {{the characteristics of}} the capacitive discharge current from a DC/DC converter in an LVDC distribution system based on both the fault location and type. First, the concept of a ring-type LVDC distribution system is introduced. The transferred AC voltage is rectified to a DC voltage by an AC/DC converter, and then the converted DC voltage is distributed to customers through distribution lines. Especially, the distribution lines form in <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> and are distributed to customers in the middle. The distributed DC voltage is lowered to the voltage level required by customers through a DC/DC converter. Especially, distribution line forms in <b>ring</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> piezoelectric actuator that combines a ring-shaped piezoelectric component {{with a thin}} metal disc. In this actuator, the ring-shaped piezoelectric ceramic produces a radial contraction or expansion, and results in a large flexural displacement {{of the center of}} the metal disc. When the PZT ring under the metal disc contracts, the unbounded portion {{at the center of the}} disc is permitted to bend with a larger curve in positive (upper) direction. Both experimental results and FEM analysis support the new concept and confirm that the <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> uni/bimorph (ring-morph) configuration has a larger displacement output than that of conventional disc type uni/bimorph actuators with comparable dimensions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} development of prediction methods for characterizing the electrical behavior of <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> central pattern generators (CPGs). A mathematical model of the prototypical bursting neuron R 15 from the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia is used, along with a simple model of the inhibitory synapse, to form a four neuron ring model of a CPG. The basic mode of a four neuron ring CPG model is able to characterize the walk, trot and bound gaits associated with quadrupedal locomotion. The phase sensitivity of neuron R 15 to an external input is investigated, and the results are expressed in terms of cophase curves that are used to formulate prediction algorithms for the behavior of <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> networks. These prediction algorithms are utilized in a Network Emulator that provides an accurate simulation of the behavior of the <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> networks at a considerable savings in computation time compared with numerical solutions of the ordinary differential equations associated with these networks. We further extend this work by examining the conditions for control of the modes of three and four neuron ring CPGs by external stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this article}} we propose the {{employment}} of an ASIC integrated control circuit to compensate the fabrication error and tuning the wavelength response in a thermally actuated <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> optical switch. Additional functionalities can also be added in this circuit by tailoring externally the roundtrip loss or coupling constants of the ring. The design concept can be easily scaled up for large array format optical switch system without much change in the terminal numbers thanks to the three dimensional hierarchy of control circuit design, which effectively reduces the terminal numbers into the cubic root of the total control unit numbers. The integrated circuit has been designed, simulated, as well as fabricated, and demonstrated a decent performance with Free Spectral Range (FSR) equal to 1. 5 nm at a wavelength of 1534 nm and center wavelength shift of the ring up to 0. 3 nm for thermal actuated <b>ring</b> <b>type</b> optical switch.

40|$|Abstract. Comparison is {{made between}} three {{different}} indices that characterise the individual rings {{of a wide}} range of condensed benzenoid hydrocarbons. Two of these ("π-electron partitions " and the six-centre delocalisation-indices that have been called "Δ 6 -values") have been introduced only recently as potential indicators of what might be called "local aromaticity", whilst the third ("topological π-electron ring-currents") was suggested as a possible discriminator in this regard nearly fifty years ago. Whilst linear correlations between ring currents and π-electron partitions within certain restricted classes of <b>ring</b> <b>types</b> are good (with correlation coefficients of up to 0. 998), agreement between the two indices over all classes of <b>ring</b> <b>types</b> is poor. Predictions arising from a consideration of π-electron partitions and Δ 6 -values seem, on the other hand, to be in somewhat better accord. It is therefore concluded that, despite its superficially intuitive appeal, the ring-current index is out of step both with π-electron partitions and Δ 6 -values as a general indicator of so-called "local aromaticity".
