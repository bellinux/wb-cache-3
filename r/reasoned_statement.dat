The debate about internalism and externalism of reasons started with Bernard Williams in "Internal and external reasons" (1979).

Through focusing on the premises that appear in the Williams "explanatory argument" and examining these in detail, I conclude that they differ depending on whether the <b>reason</b> <b>statement</b> can be used in a "distinctive sense" or whether this is not admissible...|$|R

When, for instance, the European Patent Office acts as ISA, the review body in charge of examining the protest consists of three members: [...] "the head of a directorate, normally the head of the directorate by which the invitation to pay additional fees was issued, an examiner with special expertise in unity of invention and, normally, the examiner who issued the invitation." ...|$|E

According to Reasons Internalism there is a non-trivial conceptual connection between normative reasons {{and the possibility of}} rationally accessing relevant motivation. Reasons Internalism is attractive insofar as it captures the thought that reasons are for reasoning with and repulsive insofar as it fails to generate sufficient critical distance between reasons and motives. Rather than directly adjudicate this dispute, I extract from it two generally accepted desiderata on theories of normative reasons and argue that a new theory can satisfy both.

As it is shown in lectures by I. Y.

According to the scientist, the mainstream development or the development scheme of Old Russian statehood is the Eastern Slavic Union of the X–XI century (Kievan Rus) and followed volosts (city–states in Ancient Rus).

I would like to start by describing some of my background and experience related to the topic of the forum and explain how a mathematician came to be using ideas based on art (and computers) in his teaching. 1. 1 Prism About eleven years ago, I started to develop a computer program called prism (PRogram for the Interactive Study of Maps). While the program arose out of research into symmetric dynamics [1, 5], the main use of prism was for the design, creation and colouring of symmetric planar patterns. Examples of patterns designed using prism are shown in the book Symmetry in Chaos [4] written jointly with Marty Golubitsky in 1992. Over the years, prism has continued to develop and now includes a mul-tiplicity of algorithms for all seventeen of the wallpaper (planar crystallo-graphic) patterns as well as the forty-six 2 -colour wallpaper patterns [2]. Characteristically, the designs created using prism exhibit a richly complex and (of course!) symmetric structure. Colouring – closely related to the un-derlying dynamics – is not routine and requires considerable input from the designer. Some examples of recent designs created using prism may be found in in my article in the Maubeuge Proceedings [3] 1. 1. 2 Symmetry in design: An disciplinary course for art students About four years ago, Angela Patton (Department of Art, UH) suggested that I develop an interdisciplinary course on patterns, designs and symmetry based on prism. Although I had largely developed prism for personal use, I was intrigued as to how art and design students would respond to an ‘art ’ pro-gram from a mathematician.

Dependency tracking involves maintaining the list of <b>reasons</b> (<b>statements</b> and rules) for the derivation of a new statement. In this paper, we describe our policy approach that (i) provides explanations for policy decisions, (ii) provides more efficient and expressive reasoning through the use of nested sub-rules and goal direction, and (iii) is grounded in Semantic Web technologies.

40|$|This article {{suggests}} that the argument of Bernard Williams’ classic paper ‘Internal and External Reasons’ has been widely misunderstood. The first section sketches four variants of the Standard Argument, catalogs their weaknesses and observes the exegetical obstacles they face.

On this interpretation, Williams gives one consistent argument that unites his central concerns with (i) the ‘explanatory dimension’ of <b>reasons</b> <b>statements,</b> (ii) their conceptual content, and (iii) the connection between reasons and deliberation. His argument is normally thought {{to be based on}} the common claim that reasons must be capable of motivating; I argue that it rather begins from a substantive analysis of the concept of a normative reason: that to believe that R is for you a reason for action just is to believe that R is an explanation of why you would act if you were to deliberate soundly...|$|R
