50|$|The Department of Agriculture and Stock {{recognised}} {{the difficulties}} and advocated {{for a modern}} plant for the drying, treatment and storage of the grain as early as 1921. It identified {{the need for a}} centralised, modern drying and storage facility, but recognised that the financing of such a facility was an insurmountable obstacle for the farmers. This difficulty, as well as the problems inherent in the marketing of the crop, was overcome by the introduction of legislation which was part of the complete <b>reorganisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> in Queensland.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{recurrent}} {{shortcomings of}} water policy in France is {{the control of}} diffuse agricultural pollution. Numerous lacunae and incoherencies in the French Rural, Public Health, and Environmental Codes have hindered the effective implementation of efficient protection measures. In this paper, we underline {{the extent to which}} these incoherencies have hampered the emergence of cooperative agreements (CAs) between farmers and drinking water service providers. The theoretical framework of institutional resource regimes (IRRs) provides a key to understanding the failure of public policy to impose restrictions on agricultural land use rights and to encourage voluntary arrangements concerning agricultural practices. The IRR framework was applied before 2005 to 12 cases of public attempts to negotiate a reduction in polluting practices. Our study enabled us to characterise the lack of extent and coherence of the water sector's IRR in France. Since 2005, regulatory changes have extended the scope of this IRR with a view to making water, agriculture and health policies more coherent. We discuss the complexity of the new approach, and question its capacity to mobilise the actors concerned around the territorial <b>reorganisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> aimed at reducing diffuse pollution.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the construction of}} professionalism in rural partnerships in Achterhoek, a region in the east of The Netherlands, where public, private and community representatives {{are involved in the}} spatial <b>reorganisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture.</b> In contrast to the dichotomy between `professional' and `citizen' that {{can be found in the}} literature, we argue that professional identity is a multi-layered construct. Moreover, professional identity can be seen a source of political capital. Based on a qualitative case study of one partnership, we conclude that it is not just civic or community representatives who are unable to access all the relevant layers of professionalism. Partnership members from small interest organisations also lack the professionalism that stems from scientific knowledge. Even when these actors have access to scientific knowledge, only a few of them can identify with and align themselves with the dominant discourse. Community representatives are particularly prone to question the legitimacy of the professionalism that dominates such partnerships. They are proud of their experiential knowledge and draw on this to contest professionalism, which they disapprove of. If the governance of local partnerships is to be a bottom-up process more lay people and local inhabitants need to be involved. Their experiential knowledge could bring about a cultural change in governance that goes beyond the current decentralisation of decision-making to the local level...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980 s, {{the former}} USSR went through major {{economic}} and political changes. Sweeping <b>reorganisation</b> <b>of</b> the Russian <b>agriculture</b> resulted in widespread land abandonment and development of secondary forest. Here we report on this old field succession in northern European Russia where the majority of Corncrakes breed. After selecting sites through remote sensing, we ground-truthed 96 sites by collecting data on vegetation cover and composition. Combined with our knowledge of the local economy, we identified five stages of old field devel-opment from early abandonment to young forest. We recorded 22 calling Corncrakes in these abandoned fields, where total area under cultivation dropped below 50 % and number of cattle dropped below 25 % of their original 1990 levels. In contrast to early concerns about intensifi-cation <b>of</b> Russian <b>agriculture</b> and their negative effects on Corncrakes, our research discloses the opposite. Downscaling <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> and land abandonment lead to development of more abandoned fields which resulted in more potential habitat for breeding Corncrakes. We advise to address abandoned field succession in the breeding area when designing new bird surveys in Russia and other East European countries...|$|R

40|$|In agriculture, a {{changing}} {{in the structure}} of ownership also appeared in parallel with the changing of the political system. As a result, this process led to the liquidation and <b>reorganisation</b> <b>of</b> the socialist type co-operatives. However, in many cases the cooperatives managed in the traditional way, could not keep up with the changing of the economic regulators, the <b>reorganisation</b> <b>of</b> the market relations and with the more and more oppressive agricultural gap. At the same time, individual farmers - mainly because of their poor material conditions - could not meet the market requirements either in the quantity or the quality of their products. As a consequence of all these factors, a different kind of co-operation was needed. The Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and Regional Development passed a decree on the support of new-type co-operatives, too, in 1999. The statement of costs supported the establishment of companies dealing with product purchasing, processing, marketing and service. In the following years the support of these co-operatives was sometimes terminated, sometimes preferred...|$|R
40|$|In Mediterranean environments, {{changes in}} {{land use and}} climate affect the {{incidence}} of rainfall-induced landslides by modifying the antecedent moisture conditions and the net rainfall amount delivered during erratic storm events. This study aims to assess {{the influence of the}} likely changes in land use and climate on landslide activity on medium temporal scales (10 - 100 years). Because of the hypothetical nature of anticipated environmental change, a physically based model has been used to assess this influence. The model is distributed to take land use patterns and flow paths into account and couples a hydrological model to a slope stability assessment. It has been validated under present conditions and applied to static scenarios of anticipated environmental change. Landslide activity has been simulated for 30 -year periods from which changes in landslide activity have been derived. A small catchment near Alcoy (Spain) {{has been used as a}} case study. Validation of the hydrological model over the historical period has proven to be reasonably successful. Under wet conditions, favourable to landsliding, the simulated hydrology approximates the observed moisture contents adequately. Simulated groundwater levels are less accurate as they accumulate errors over space and time. The performance of the stability model has been evaluated against landslide occurrence as observed from aerial photographs. Although simulated failure does not replicate observed landslide occurrence it reflects the difference in landslide activity between land use types and can consequently be applied to assess relative differences in landslide activity as the result of environmental change. Mediterranean land use change is mainly driven by the abandonment of marginal fields and by incentives provided by EU agricultural policy. The current trend of land use change has been projected to the likely date of CO 2 -doubling. This results in three scenarios: present land use, continued abandonment and a limited <b>reorganisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Climate conditions are specified by two scenarios: a warmer, future climate at the date of CO 2 -doubling, based on downscaled GCM results, and the present one. For these scenarios a stochastic weather generator provides unbiased, synthetic timeseries of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. For the hypothetical scenarios, landslide activity decreases relative to the present conditions: after abandonment, the higher evapotranspiration by the more extensive semi-natural vegetation attenuates the hydrological response to rainfall. Under the present climate mainly the temporal activity of landsliding is affected by land use change. The maximum groundwater levels are hardly attenuated and, consequently, the decrease in the area experiencing failure is slight (circa 5...|$|E
