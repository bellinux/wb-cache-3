50|$|The dairy {{farmhouse}} {{is located}} 350m {{west of the}} settlement area. A large, rendered brick chimney is {{all that remains of}} the farmhouse, a feature that probably survives from sawmill times. The brick chimney is surrounded by a fence that was erected by QPWS to limit access to the chimney by visitors to the Park and for public health and safety. Three concrete steps are associated with the brick chimney that originally led into the house, but now go nowhere. The concrete is very coarse and of a poor quality. There is a garden associated with the farmhouse that contains a number of historic plantings including crepe myrtles, guavas and bougainvillea. Two mango trees were planted in 1924 by Vera Grady (née Crang), whose family owned and worked the property as a dairy. Near the mango trees is the original brick-lined well dating to the sawmill period. John Crang built a wooden cover for the well that was hinged in the middle in the 1920s, this has since been replaced with a metal <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and a wooden platform completely enclosing the well. A windmill, also built by John Crang is associated with the well. The four large timber posts around the windmill were erected by Cecil Potts. A plaque erected in 1993 is located at the junction of a walking track from the Elanda Point camping area to the south and tramway formation to the west.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{variable}} cross-section H-type structure, {{which is}} used in the new type of heat exchanger with longitudinal flow of shell side, could reduce the scour action of imports fluid on the tube bundle and prevent vibration of the tube bundle. It could also improve the state of the shell side fluid flow, reducing the flow dead zone, allowing for a more efficient use of the heat transfer area and improving the energy efficiency. The new structure will make the temperature and stress distribution in the heat distribution more complex, so it is necessary to analyze the stress intensity of the variable cross-section H-type structure. A three-dimensional finite element model of the variable cross-section H-type structure is established in this paper, and the surface temperature of the various parts of the heat exchanger are determined through temperature analysis. Using ANSYS Workbench software, thermal-stress analysis of the H-type structure with different structural parameters is tested, and the temperature and stress field are obtained. The results show that a <b>Ring</b> <b>plate</b> of H-type structure has a larger temperature gradient along the thickness direction. The maximum stress of the heat exchanger is 203. 13 MPa, which occurred on the connections of the <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and jacket in the lower temperature side.

Cyclic loading tests on the cross-shaped connections are carried out by using MTS servo loading system. Comparative analyses are conducted based on the experimental results including hysteretic curves, skeleton curves and stiffness degradation curves as well as ductility coefficients of cyclic loading tests. Furthermore, effects of geometric parameters of ring-stiffened plate, axial compression ratio and backing plate on the deformation performance of cross-shaped connections are analyzed. The {{results show that the}} increase of width of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and the shape change of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> from square to circle can both significantly improve the ductility and the hysteretic characteristics of connection. It is emphasized that the specimen with square ring plates is of better deformation performance but lower bearing capacity than the ones with circular ring plates. Besides, the backing plates always have positive effects on the hysteretic characteristics, ductility and energy dissipation of the CFST column connections. Conversely, the increase of axial compression ratio contributes negatively to both the bearing capacity and deformation performance of the connection specimens. It can be concluded that the presented cross-shaped connection is of good deformation performance relating to hysteretic characteristics, energy dissipation and ductility, which can provide reference towards engineering practice with potential perspective application...|$|E

After the simulation and analysis to space joints on outer concentric annular-stiffer which are processed by reduced beam section, the loading conditions of the joints are obviously improved in the following aspects: (1) the stress distribution on annular plate is smoothed obviously, the degree of stress concentration on corner is significantly decreased; (2) to assure plastic hinge firstly appear on the beam end but not the ring surface, we can change the size of <b>ring</b> <b>plate,</b> length of beam and the flange weaken degree; (3) the joint stiffness does not decrease during the stage of elastic loading; (4) under repeated loading, the joint region has little change and the plastic expansion on the ring surface is not obvious.

40|$|Neutron {{reflection}} (NR) {{and surface}} tension (ST) {{are used to}} show that there are serious limitations in applying the Gibbs equation accurately to ST data of cationic surfactants to obtain the limiting surface excess, Γ(CMC), at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Nonionic impurities in C 12 TABr and C 16 TABr have been eliminated by extensive purification to give ST - ln(concentration) (σ - ln c) curves that are convex with respect to the ln c axis around the CMC, which is characteristic of a finite micellization width. Because NR shows that the surface excess often continues to increase at and above the CMC, this finite width makes it impossible to apply the Gibbs equation to obtain Γ(CMC) without knowledge of the effect of aggregation on the activity. NR data made it possible to apply the integrated Gibbs equation to the ST below the onset of the convex region of the σ - ln c curve and show that for C 12 TABr the micellization width causes the ST to underestimate Γ(CMC) by 12 %. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium (C 16 TA) sulfate is used to show that divalent ion impurities are not a significant problem. For cationic surfactants, further errors are associated with ST methods that rely on complete wetting. Measurements using <b>ring,</b> <b>plate,</b> and bubble shape analyses indicate that with ring and plate incomplete wetting occurs at or above the CMC and may extend to lower concentrations and also causes the ST-Gibbs analysis to underestimate the surface excess. In combination with ion association and preaggregation in cationic gemini surfactants, this can cause errors as large as 100 % in Γ(CMC).

The amorphous structure of tested samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. The thermal properties of the glassy samples was measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The soft magnetic properties examination of tested material contained coercive force, initial magnetic permeability and magnetic permeability relaxation measurements. Findings: The XRD and TEM investigations revealed that the studied as-cast samples were amorphous. Broad diffraction halo is typical for metallic amorphous structures that have a large degree of short-range order. The characteristics of the fractured surfaces showed different zones, which might correspond with different amorphous structures of studied materials. The temperature interval of the supercooled liquid region (ΔTx) defined by the difference between Tg and Tx, is as large as 56 K for the rod with diameter of 3 mm. Differences in coercivity and magnetic permeability between samples with different thickness might be resulted by some difference of amorphous structure.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Thesis was {{to study}} {{genome-wide}} gene expression in colonies of A. niger and to relate this to nutrient availability, growth, and secretion. Maltose and xylose were chosen as carbon sources for this study. These compounds result in different sets of extracellular enzymes. In Chapter 2 a novel method is described, the <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> system, enabling simultaneous detection of protein secretion and environmental conditions (e. g. pH and nutrient concentration) {{in different parts of}} the colony. Colonies are grown on a porous polycarbonate membrane that is placed on a plate with 6 ring-shaped wells filled with liquid medium. Pulse labelling with radioactive amino acids showed that secretion of proteins occurs mainly at the periphery of the colony. Chapter 3 describes genome wide expression of 5 concentrical zones (i. e. from centre to periphery) of colonies grown in a thin agarose layer in between two polycarbonate membranes (sandwiched colonies) that had been placed on a nutrient agar medium containing xylose or maltose as carbon source. Protein secretion and growth mainly occurred in the outer zone of colonies. This correlated with carbon source availability but nitrate, sulphate and phosphate were not limited under the colony. Expression in each zone of the colony was strongly affected by the nature of the carbon source. However, the position within the colony also had a strong impact. The finding that expression profiles at the periphery of the colony changes in time, despite the fact that nutrient availability within this zone did not change in time, supports the hypothesis that developmental processes independently from the carbon source affect gene expression in a colony. Taken together, the results show that colonies are highly differentiated despite the fact that the cytoplasm is a continuous system. Expression profiles of A. niger were also determined in liquid shaken cultures and compared to the sandwiched culture. To this end, liquid shaken cultures were grown until the nutrient conditions mimicked those observed at the periphery of the sandwiched colony. Genome wide analysis of the mRNA obtained from the liquid culture revealed two components within the expression profile; one component shows similarity to expression at the periphery of sandwiched colonies, the other to that within the central zones. The sandwiched colony thus seems to be a good model system to study expression in liquid shaken culture. Sandwiched colonies were transferred to a fresh medium for 24 h to address whether the centre of colonies can be reactivated to secrete proteins (Chapter 4). Indeed, secretion was observed in two central zones of the colony after colonies had been transferred. Suprisingly, protein secretion in the central zones did not correlate with growth as determined by the incorporation of N-acetylglucosamine. After transfer, two zones remained inactive in secretion. These zones were shown to sporulate after the upper polycarbonate membrane was removed. Apparently, these zones were programmed to sporulate and not to secrete. These findings also demonstrate the differentiation within the colony. Transfer of colonies to fresh xylose medium also enabled us to establish whether the effect of the spatial position within the colony on global expression can be solely attributed to the availability of the carbon source (Chapter 4). Interestingly, genome wide expression showed that the availability of the carbon source had a limited effect on the spatial expression in the colony. Most variation is apparently caused by non-carbon source related developmental processes. Chapter 5 describes strategies to improve protein production by involving a larger part of the colony in the process of secretion. 6 -day-old wild-type colonies only produced laccase in the centre of the colony. Increasing the part of the mycelium secreting laccase was also accomplished by transforming A. niger with a construct encompassing the laccase gene lccA under regulation of the glaA or the gpdA promoter. Transformants not only showed laccase activity in the centre but also in middle zones of the colony. However, the spatial laccase activity did not correlate with the expression of the glaA and gpdA promoters. Results indicate that young colonies are not able to produce laccase (at least lccA). Furthermore, LccA has affinity for the cell wall resulting in a slow release into the culture medium. Results are summarized and discussed in Chapter 6...|$|E

These high intensity shocks are of a main concern for sensitive space structures, like PCBs, crystals, and fragile optical components. Testing used to be the main method for studying the effect of shocks on structures and components.
