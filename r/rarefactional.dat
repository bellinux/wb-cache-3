A total of 220 10 - to 11 -week-old 250 -g female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan) were randomly divided into 20 ultrasonic exposure groups (10 rats/group) and one sham group (20 rats). The 20 ultrasonic exposure groups (2. 8 -MHz; 10 -s exposure duration; 1 -kHz PRF; 6 -dB pulse-echo focal beam width of 470 m) were divided into four PD groups (1. 3, 4. 4, 8. 2 and 11. 6 s) and, for each PD group, there were five in situ peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressures (range between 4 and 9 MPa).

This experimental and theoretical study aims to explore the mechanism of UCA shell rupture by determining thresholds {{as a function of}} ultrasonic excitation parameters (driving frequency, pulse duration, and peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure). The experimental setup is based on a passive cavitation detection system described in previous work. However, this system has been modified to allow simultaneous acquisition of the signals received with the 13 -MHz passive receiver and the signals incident upon the lower frequency (0. 9, 2. 8 and 4. 6 MHz) transmitting transducer functioning in the pulse-echo mode. Post-excitation signals were used to detect rupture thresholds. By allowing acquisition of the signals received by the insonifying transducer (pulse-echo during the excitation and passively at post-excitation) additional information is obtained within a frequency range and a transmission/reception configuration typical of ultrasonic diagnostic imaging.

Using a passive cavitation detector, this work evaluates rupture based on acoustic emissions from single, encapsulated, gas-filled microbubbles. Sinusoidal ultrasound pulses were transmitted into weak solutions of Optison at different center frequencies (0. 9, 2. 8, and 4. 6 MHz), pulse durations (three, five, and seven cycles of the center frequencies), and peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressures (0. 07 to 5. 39 MPa).

40|$|Abstract—Characterizing {{occurrence}} of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) microbubble destruction {{is important for}} development of functional and therapeutic applications. Previously [1], it was demonstrated that post-excitation acoustic emissions detected with passive cavitation detection (PCD) result from inertial cavitation (IC) of UCA after shell rupture. That work relied on time-consuming visual inspection of PCD data to identify IC signals and characterized only minimum <b>rarefactional</b> pressure thresholds for rupture of a single OptisonTM microbubble in the sampled population. This work introduces an algorithm for automatic detection of IC signals. The algorithm {{was applied to the}} 71424 waveforms in the PCD data set. At each incident frequency (0. 9, 2. 8 or 4. 6 MHz) and pulse duration (3, 5 or 7 cycles) combination, ruptured microbubble occurrence with incident peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure (PRP) was well described by a logistic regression curve with an inflection point near 50 % occurrence and a plateau at 100 %. With a 5 -cycle pulse duration at 0. 9, 2. 8 and 4. 6 MHz the incident PRPs leading to 5 % microbubble rupture were 0. 66, 0. 83 and 1. 1 MPa; and 1. 1, 1. 6 and 2. 5 MPa for 50 %. This automatic algorithm combined with the PCD approach provides a practical tool for the characterization of UCA destruction occurrence across a significant range of incident PRPs.

This process assumes that the propagation process is linear. However for medical ultrasound systems nonlinear propagation effects can be significant. In order to explore improved methods of characterising finite amplitude fields an extensive programme of modelling has been performed with the aim of investigating the relationship between finite amplitude fields in tissue and water. This utilised a finite difference solution to the KZK equation to model 35 fields using starting conditions typical of medical ultrasound arrays. In each case the field was modelled in water and then in homogeneous tissue, assuming the specific attenuation coefficient of 0. 3 dB cm- 1 MHz- 1. This enabled the de-rated peak <b>rarefactional</b> acoustic pressure (pr,?) at specific locations, derived from water predictions, to be compared with the corresponding predictions for the peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure pr in tissue.

40|$|Abstract [...] A less {{invasive}} {{method for}} diagnosis of urinary reflux is being pursued using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Microbubbles produced in the urinary bladder, by transcutaneous application of HIFU, can be visualized with a diagnostic ultrasound system and the bubble movement can be tracked from the bladder, through the ureters, and to the kidney, if reflux occurs. Since urine is under-saturated in total gas and filtered by the kidney, {{it is necessary to}} increase the gas and/or particle content in the urine in order to produce contrast microbubbles at a minimal level of HIFU. In five canine experiments, sodium bicarbonate (0. 0128 M/kg) was infused IV at 3 ml/min for 2 hours with Lasix ®. On average for 3 of 5 canines, the infusions resulted in a 63 % increase in urine pCO 2 from the baseline (from saline infusion), with mean increase to 87 mmHg. This pCO 2 change decreased the threshold <b>rarefactional</b> pressure for imageable microbubble generation on average to 7. 6 MPa (10 s exposure at 1. 18 MHz, 25 cycles, 0. 5 % duty cycle) from 9 MPa (pvalue= 0. 004). The elevated pCO 2 after bicarbonate infusion increased generated echogenicity 16 - 21 dB higher than for pristine urine or saline infusion for the same peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure applied (p-value= 0. 002), and the longevity of the contrast was up to 12. 1 seconds. Although these urine property modifications were done with IV administration, eventually urine manipulation should be possible with equivalent bicarbonate and Lasix ® doses given orally. Therefore, manipulation of the urine gas content by intake of bicarbonate should be a safe and effective method to assist HIFU in generating copious imageable and residual microbubbles that can potentially be used for less invasive diagnosing urinary reflux.

Currently in phase III clinical trials for liver cancer, ThermoDox® (Celsion Corporation) is a drug delivery system containing doxorubicin, a common anti-cancer agent, encapsulated within a thermally sensitive liposome designed to release its contents above 39. 5 °C. Activation of such an agent with the use of HIFU, which can generate localized heating non-invasively, would combine the benefits of targeted chemotherapy and hyperthermia while minimizing undesirable systemic side-effects. To that end, the resolution and reliability with which HIFU-induced hyperthermia can achieve Thermodox® release was investigated using a novel agar-based gel embedding liposomes at clinically relevant concentrations (0. 02 mg/ml). The gel was exposed to 1. 15 MHz HIFU (Sonic Concepts H 102) using a range of clinically relevant pressure amplitudes (0 - 6 MPa peak <b>rarefactional),</b> duty cycles (10 - 100 %) and exposure durations to identify optimal insonation conditions for complete doxorubicin release. The corresponding temperature profiles were mapped with 0. 5 mm spatial resolution using an embedded needle thermocouple; drug release was quantified using fluorimetry. Complete release over the HIFU focal area was obtained for 6 -s continuous wave exposure at 5. 2 MPa peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure, i. e. under exposure conditions for which the temperature exceeded 43 °C throughout the focal volume. For a given HIFU energy input, both the final temperature reached and the rate of heating were found to affect release significantly.

40|$|As a {{minimally}} invasive alternative to current cancer treatment, {{the use of}} encapsulated, superheated liquid perfluorocarbon droplets has been proposed to treat cancer by occlusion therapy. In response to an acoustic field, these droplets, which are small enough to pass through capillaries, vaporize into large gas bubbles that subsequently lodge in the vasculature. This research investigates strategies to reduce the pressures necessary to achieve acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV), what implications they may have on efficiency, and how the resulting location of bubbles may alter the acoustic field. Two methods to lower the ADV threshold were explored. The first investigated the role of pulse duration on ADV. The second investigated the role of inertial cavitation (IC) external to a droplet by adding ultrasound contrast agent (CA), which has a low IC threshold. At 1. 44 MHz, the threshold {{was found to be}} 5. 5 - 5. 9 MPa peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure (Pr) for short microsecond pulses and decreased for millisecond pulses to 3. 8 - 4. 6 MPa Pr. When CAs were added and long millisecond pulses were used, the ADV threshold decreased to values as low as 0. 41 MPa Pr. With the help of CA, the same amount of power was necessary to achieve ADV through an attenuating tissue mimicking (TM) phantom as it was without attenuation and with only droplets. When comparing ADV pressure thresholds, where in situ pressures were used when a TM phantom was present, <b>rarefactional</b> pressure appeared to be the salient determinant. However, careful consideration must be taken when choosing pulse repetition frequencies and amplitude as inertial collapse of both ADV and IC bubbles appears to affect efficient droplet conversion. During in vivo application, treatment planning may be important as backscattering properties of microbubbles created by ADV can augment or obstruct the sound field in the affected area. With strategic targeting and subsequent conversion of droplets into microbubbles, constructive interference due to these effects reduces the transmitted pressures required for proximal ADV, and the attenuation from these bubbles can create a protective boundary for distal areas. The potential result can be a confined area for further ADV where lower pressures are required to cause vaporization...|$|E

To maximize drug release and distribution within the tumor, co-localization of the drug carrier and cavitation nuclei is necessary.

We now report on the underlying mechanisms that these nanoparticles, which are orders of magnitude smaller than the acoustic wavelength, can instigate inertial cavitation.

The objective of this study was twofold: (1) to characterize the stability of liposome echogenicity after reconstitution and (2) to quantitate the acoustic destruction thresholds of liposomes as a function of peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure (Pr), pulse duration (PD) and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The liposomes were insonified in an anechoic sample chamber using a Philips HDI 5000 diagnostic ultrasound scanner with a L 12 - 5 linear array. Liposome stability was evaluated with 6. 9 -MHz fundamental and 4. 5 -MHz harmonic B-mode pulses at various Pr at a fixed PRF. Liposome destruction thresholds were determined using 6. 0 -MHz Doppler pulses, by varying the PD with a fixed PRF of 1. 25 kHz and by varying the PRF with a fixed PD of 3. 33 �s.

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to enhance the {{findings}} of an earlier ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage study (Ultrasound Med Biol 2003; 29 : 1625 – 1634) that estimated pressure thresholds as a function of pulse duration (PD: 1. 3, 4. 4, 8. 2, and 11. 6 µs; 2. 8 MHz; 10 -s exposure duration [ED]; 1 -kHz pulse repetition frequency [PRF]). In this study, the roles of PRF and PD were evaluated at 5. 9 MPa, the peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure threshold near that of the ED 50 estimate previously determined. Methods. A 4 × 4 factorial design study (PRF: 50, 170, 500, and 1700 Hz; PD: 1. 3, 4. 4, 8. 2, and 11. 6 µs) was conducted (2. 8 MHz; 10 -s ED). Sprague Dawley rats (n = 175) were divided into 16 exposure groups (10 rats per group) and 1 sham group (15 rats); no lesions were produced in the sham group. Logistic regression analysis evaluated significance of effects for lesion occurrence, and Gaussian tobit analysis evaluated significance for lesion depth and surface area. Results. For lesion occurrence and sizes, the main effect of PRF was not sig-nificant. The interaction term, PRF × PD, was highly significant, indicating a strong positive dependence of lesion occurrence on the duty factor. The main effect of P...|$|E

However, the effects of fluid velocity and ultrasound exposure parameters peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure (Pr), pulse duration (PD), and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) on the spatial distribution, type, magnitude, and number of acoustic cavitation events for each nuclei remains poorly understood. In this study, a 1. 6 -mm diameter tunnel phantom (3 % agar) was perfused (fluid velocity: 10 - 40 mm/s) with either microbubbles (SonoVue) or hydrophobic solid microparticles (TALC) and exposed to 74 different acoustic parameter combinations (frequency: 0. 5 MHz, Pr: 150 - 1500 kPa, PD: 1 - 100, 000 cycles, PRF: 1 - 50 Hz, number of pulses: 10 - 250). Spatial mapping of passively acquired acoustic cavitation emissions was performed with a 64 -element array coaxial to the focused ultrasound transducer. At pressures above the cavitation threshold, cavitation activity generated from microbubbles was significantly reduced and spatially biased upstream after the first pulse at high PRFs relative to the fluid velocity. On the other hand, solid microparticles had no spatial bias and no significant reduction in the energy of acoustic emissions after the first pulse. Whereas microbubbles may be destroyed, and therefore, cease to act as cavitation nuclei, solid microparticles do not suffer from depletion of energy with high PRFs...|$|E
40|$|Contrast {{enhanced}} diagnostic ultrasound CEDUS {{has been}} shown to induce capillary hemorrhage in heart and kidney. This study characterized the capillary hemorrhage induced in rat pancreas. The pancreata of anesthetized hairless rats were accessed by laparotomy. A 1. 5 MHz diagnostic ultrasound probe with 2. 3 MPa peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure amplitude and 1 s intermittent trigger was used to scan the pancreas, located at the focus (3. 8 cm), through saline coupling. The probe was swept to expose the entire organ in 5 min during infusion of Definity® contrast agent at 10 µL/kg/min, and this was repeated in a reverse sweep. The entire pancreas was removed, spread flat for fixation and histological slides were prepared from the mid-plane. Slides were scored blind for islet hemorrhage over the entire area of the organ. Intra-islet microlesions were evident and hemorrhage surrounded many islets. The hemorrhage often impacted nearby acini, and expanded into inter-lobular septa. In CEDUS pancreata removed soon after scanning, 76. 2 ± 11. 8 % (n =  6) of islets had evidence of hemorrhage and/or islet microlesions compared to 1. 1 ± 2. 5 % (n =  5) for sham CEDUS (P< 0. 001). In pancreata removed after 4 hr, fibrin formation was detected by immunohistology in the hemorrhage and intra-islet microlesions. Diagnostic ultrasound with contrast agent induced substantial capillary hemorrhage in rat pancreas, concentrated particularly in the islets...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{ability of}} {{ultrasound}} (US) and ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) to induce angiogen-esis has been explored {{as a means}} of restoring blood flow to ischemic muscle. Because UCAs demon-strate an increasing percentage of collapse cavitation with increasing US pressure (Pr), this study sought to explore the effects of a US Pr that produces 100 % collapse cavitation, determine the capillary den-sity changes, and determine the time point of angiogenic rebound in a normal animal model. Methods. Using a 1 -MHz focused transducer and a peak <b>rarefactional</b> US Pr of 3. 8 MPa, rat gracilis muscles were exposed to US, and bioeffects were assessed. Capillary density, as a measure of angio-genesis, was examined. As an additional measure, inflammatory cells were quantified via a color threshold analysis to detect the presence of CD 31 and CD 34 {{as a percentage of the}} total section on stained slides. Six groups (0, 3, 6, 13, 20, and 27 days postexposure [DPE]; n = 3 each) and 5 cage con-trols were used to characterize the angiogenic response. Results. Ultrasound-UCA treatment caused the capillary density to decrease acutely (0 DPE) by 70 % and inflammatory cells to increase by up to 250 %. The angiogenic rebound was observed at 3 DPE but did not return to control levels by 27 DPE, suggesting an incomplete healing response. Conclusions. Capillary destruction and inflammation played an important role in the angiogenic response induced by US-UCA. Exposure that causes 100...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Ultrasound {{myocardial}} cavitation enabled treatment (MCET) is an image-guided {{method for}} tissue reduction. In this study, {{a strategy of}} fractionated (multiple) treatments was tested for efficacy. Methods Dahl SS rats were anesthetized and prepared for treatment with a focused ultrasound transducer in a warm water bath. Aiming at the anterior left ventricular wall was facilitated by imaging with a 10  MHz phased array (10 S, GE Vivid 7, GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway). MCET was accomplished at 1. 5  MHz by pulse bursts of 4  MPa peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure amplitude, which were intermittently triggered 1 : 8 from the ECG during infusion of a microbubble suspension for cavitation nucleation. Test groups were sham, a 200  s treatment, three 200  s treatments a week apart, and a 600  s treatment. Treatment outcome was observed by plasma troponin after 4  h, echocardiographic monitoring and histology at 6 wk. Results The impacts of the fractionated treatments summed to approximately {{the same as the}} long treatment; e. g. the troponin result was 10. 5  ±  3. 2 for 200  s, 22. 7  ±  5. 4 (p <  0. 001) for the summed fractionated treatments and 29. 9  ±  6. 4 for 600  s (p =  0. 06 relative to the summed fractionated). While wall thickness was not reduced for the fractionated treatment, tissue strain was reduced by 35 % in the target area relative sham (p <  0. 001). Conclusion The ability to fractionate treatment may be advantageous for optimizing patient outcome relative to all-or nothing therapy by surgical myectomy or alcohol ablation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective Ultrasound (US) and {{ultrasound}} contrast agents (UCAs) {{provide a}} way to noninvasively induce targeted angiogenesis. However, there exists {{a lack of understanding}} regarding the mechanisms of this process that has impeded progress. This study sought to characterize the angiogenic response, by both exploring the role of UCA concentration ([UCA]) in bioeffect induction at 0 [*]days post exposure (DPE) and assessing the bioeffect as a possible potentiator of angiogenesis at 5 DPE. Methods A 1 -MHz ultrasonic transducer was used to expose the gracilis muscles of Sprague Dawley rats for 5 min with a 10 -μs pulse duration, 10 -Hz pulse repetition frequency, and 0. 7 -MPa peak <b>rarefactional</b> acoustic pressure (p r). Four [UCA]s were tested: 0 x (saline), 1 ×, 5 ×, and 10 ×, where 1 × is 5 % Definity by volume of solution. Evans blue dye (EBD) was used to quantify changes in acute vascular permeability (0 DPE), and VEGF expression was quantified at 5 DPE to support that angiogenesis had occurred. CD 31 staining was used to assess capillary density at both time points. Results [UCA] was a significant parameter for determining EBD leakage (permeability) and VEGF expression (p [*] Conclusions This study suggests that [UCA] was a significant parameter in the induction of an angiogenic response with US and UCAs. It also suggests that rather than damage from US and UCAs, as previously speculated, a nondestructive mechanical interaction between the UCAs and vascular endothelium induces bioeffects to potentiate the angiogenic response. </p...|$|E
40|$|The blood-retinal barrier (BRB) {{prevents}} most systemically-administered {{drugs from}} reaching the retina. This study investigated whether burst ultrasound applied with a circulating microbubble agent can disrupt the BRB, providing a noninvasive method for the targeted delivery of systemically administered drugs to the retina. To demonstrate the efficacy and reversibility of such a procedure, five overlapping targets around the optic nerve head were sonicated through the cornea and lens in 20 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats using a 690 kHz focused ultrasound transducer. For BRB disruption, 10 ms bursts were applied at 1 Hz for 60 s with different peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressure amplitudes (0. 81, 0. 88 and 1. 1 MPa). Each sonication was combined with an IV injection of a microbubble ultrasound contrast agent (Definity). To evaluate BRB disruption, an MRI contrast agent (Magnevist) was injected IV immediately after the last sonication, and serial T 1 -weighted MR images were acquired up to 30 minutes. MRI contrast enhancement into the vitreous humor near targeted area was observed for all tested pressure amplitudes, with more signal enhancement evident at the highest pressure amplitude. At 0. 81 MPa, BRB disruption was not detected 3 h post sonication, after an additional MRI contrast injection. A day after sonication, the eyes were processed for histology of the retina. At the two lower exposure levels (0. 81 and 0. 88 MPa), most of the sonicated regions were indistinguishable from the control eyes, although a few tiny clusters of extravasated erythrocytes (petechaie) were observed. More severe retinal damage was observed at 1. 1 MPa. These results demonstrat...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} a novel phased array transducer design rule for therapeutic focused ultrasound applications. This design rule uses the discretized Fermat's spiral to determine the positioning of the transducer elements for a given number of elements and f-number. Using this principle, three variations of Fermat's spiral were generated, aimed at 1) grating lobe minimization, 2) side lobe minimization, and 3) an optimized element packing efficiency. For each spiral, sparse layouts using identical circular elements and fully populated layouts based on additional Voronoi tessellation were evaluated numerically. Evaluation criteria included the element size distribution, beam steering capabilities, focal plane pressure distribution, prefocal pressure distribution, and practical considerations. Finally, one Voronoi-tessellated design with a focal length and aperture diameter of 16 cm and a natural frequency of 1. 3 MHz was evaluated experimentally through hydrophone measurements. The numerical evaluation showed that while sparse arrays possess superior beam steering capabilities for a given number of elements, the focal point quality and prefocal pressure distribution is substantially more favorable when using the Voronoi-tessellated designs. Beam steering was shown to be feasible with the tessellated designs for lateral deflections up to 10 mm and axial deflections up to 20 mm. The experimental evaluation showed that such a transducer is capable of inducing 40. 00 MPa <b>rarefactional</b> and 237. 50 MPa compressional peak pressure levels at 800 W instantaneous acoustic output power under free-field conditions, making the system potentially relevant for thermal ablation therapy, histotripsy applications, and shockwave-enhanced heating...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{motivated}} {{by the fact that}} there are no published studies quantifying cavitation activity and heating induced by ultrasound in adipose tissue and that there are currently no reliable techniques for monitoring successful deposition of ultrasound energy in fat in real time. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) exposures were performed in excised porcine fat at four different frequencies (0. 5, 1. 1, 1. 6 and 3. 4 MHz) over a range of pressure amplitudes and exposure durations. The transmission losses arising from reflection at the skin interface and attenuation through skin and fat were quantified at all frequencies using an embedded needle hydrophone. A 15 MHz passive cavitation detector (PCD) coaxial to the HIFU transducer was used to capture acoustic emissions emanating from the focus during HIFU exposures, while the focal temperature rise was measured using minimally invasive needle thermocouples. Repeatable temperature rises in excess of 10 °C could be readily instigated across all four frequencies for acoustic intensities (Ispta) in excess of 50 W/cm(2) within the first 2 s of exposure. Even though cavitation could not be initiated at 1. 1, 1. 6 and 3. 4 MHz over the in situ peak <b>rarefactional</b> (p(-)) pressure range 0 - 3 MPa explored in the present study, inertial cavitation activity was always initiated at 0. 5 MHz for pressures greater than 1. 6 MPa (p(-)) and was found to enhance focal heat deposition. A good correlation was identified between the energy of broadband emissions detected by the PCD and the focal temperature rise at 0. 5 MHz, particularly for short 2 s exposures, which could be exploited as a tool for noninvasive monitoring of successful treatment delivery...|$|E
40|$|A {{flow-through}} tissue-mimicking phantom {{composed of}} a biocompatible hydro-gel with embedded tumour cells {{was used to assess}} and optimize the role of ultrasound-induced cavitation on the extravasation of a macromolecular compound from a channel mimicking vessel in the gel, namely a non-replicating luciferase-expressing adenovirus (Ad-Luc). Using a 500 KHz therapeutic ultrasound transducer confocally aligned with a focussed passive cavitation detector, different exposure conditions and burst mode timings were selected by performing time and frequency domain analysis of passively recorded acoustic emissions, in the absence and in the presence of ultrasound contrast agents acting as cavitation nuclei. In the presence of Sonovue, maximum ultraharmonic emissions were detected for peak <b>rarefactional</b> pressures of 360 kPa, and maximum broadband emissions occurred at 1250 kPa. The energy of the recorded acoustic emissions was used to optimise the pulse repetition frequency and duty cycle in order to maximize either ultraharmonic or broadband emissions while keeping the acoustic energy delivered to the focus constant. Cell viability measurements indicated that none of the insonation conditions investigated induces cell death {{in the absence of a}} therapeutic agent (i. e. virus). Phase contrast images of the tissue-mimicking phantom showed that short range vessel disruption can occur when ultra-harmonic emissions (nf 0 / 2) are maximised whereas formation of a micro-channel perpendicular to the flow can be obtained in the presence of broadband acoustic emissions. Following Ad-Luc delivery, luciferase expression measurements showed that a 60 -fold increase in its bioavailability can be achieved when broadband noise emissions are present during insonation, even for modest contrast agent concentrations. The findings of the present study suggest that drug delivery systems based on acoustic cavitation may help enhance the extravasation of anticancer agents, thus increasing their penetration distance to hypoxic regions and poorly vascularised tumour regions...|$|E
