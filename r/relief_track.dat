Different values of dam depth and <b>relief</b> <b>track</b> depth are taken in nondimensional form in order to analyze their effect. Results are plotted for different parameters against eccentricity ratios and it is shown that the effect of pressure dam depth and <b>relief</b> <b>track</b> depth has great significance on stability and other performance parameters.

40|$|This thesis compares {{experimental}} {{static and}} dynamic force characteristics for a two-axial-groove bearing and a pressure-dam bearing without a <b>relief</b> <b>track.</b> The thesis also compares experimental results to predictions from a numerical analysis. The tested pressure-dam bearing has s ?= 130 ?, ' k = 3. 4 ~ 4. 2, and d L ? = 0. 75. The test {{results show that}} eccentricity for both bearings decreases as Sommerfeld number increases. However, the pressure-dam bearing maintains a minimum eccentricity of about 0. 5 at high speeds. The results also show that the attitude angle for both bearings increases as Sommerfeld number increases. The maximum attitude angle for the axial-groove bearing is 90 ? at noload. However, the attitude angle for the pressure-dam bearing increases above 90 ? at no-load as speed increases. A dynamic test shows that the pressure-dam bearing has higher direct stiffness and damping at high Sommerfeld number because {{of the increase in}} eccentricity. However, as Sommerfeld number decreases, the difference between stiffness and damping coefficients of both bearings diminishes. The dynamic test also shows that both bearings have significant added mass coefficients in the laminar flow region that decrease as eccentricity increases. The estimated axial-groove bearing whirlfrequency ratio (WFR) from experimental results is 0. 45. The WFR of the pressure-dam bearing reduces to 0. 41 at high Sommerfeld numbers. Numerical analysis shows that the pressure-dam bearing can have lower WFR if the dam arc length is increased to 150 ?. Numerical analysis also shows that stability can be improved further by adding a <b>relief</b> <b>track.</b> Generally, the numerical analysis under predicts the bearings? eccentricity and dynamic force coefficients with better agreement at low Sommerfeld numbers...|$|E

50|$|However, in {{the short}} term, the demand for the MS&L's {{services}} had risen {{to the point where}} it was paralysed by the density of traffic and attention had to be given to improving the existing infrastructure. The company was forced to invest heavily in extra sidings, <b>relief</b> <b>tracks</b> and station improvements. Throughout its history the MS&L had been the subject of merger proposals with other railways. In 1875, the LNWR and the Midland planned to absorb the North Staffordshire Railway, and Watkin suggested to the Great Northern that their two companies might make a counter-offer. Both schemes fell through. However, in 1877, the Great Northern suggested that it, the Midland and the MS&LR should merge, the scheme foundering, to the annoyance of the MS&LR directors, on the conditions stipulated by Watkin.|$|R

40|$|Two-lobe {{pressure}} dam bearings {{are commonly}} used in high speed rotating machineries. Their use is considered more stable than plain cylindrical bearings. Such bearings have a dam in the upper half whereas the lower half is provided with a <b>relief</b> <b>track.</b> Performance of two-lobe pressure dam bearings under micropolar fluid is evaluated. Finite element method is used to solve the modified Reynolds equation. Fluid film pressures are obtained by solving modified Reynolds equation. Thus pressure obtained is used to find performance characteristics of this bearing. The dynamic performance characteristics are studied at various L/D ratios. Three L/D ratios are considered 1. 6, 2. 0, and 2. 4 for the analysis purpose. Results obtained are presented for various micropolar parameters. Results show that stability of two-lobe pressure dam bearings increases with decrease in aspect ratio (L/D) ...|$|E
40|$|Key Words: Inverted three- lobe {{pressure}} dam bearing, {{finite element}} method, multi-lobes Abstract: Sometimes {{the line of}} action of the load does not pass through the axis of a bearing and is shifted on either side by a few degrees. The effect of load orientation on the stability of an inverted three-lobe pressure dam bearing has been studied in this paper. An inverted three lobe pressure dam bearing is produced by incorporating two pressure dams in the upper two lobes and one <b>relief</b> <b>track</b> in the lower lobe. The result shows that stability of an inverted three-lobe pressure dam bearing supporting either rigid or flexible rotor is increased for the positive values of load orientation i. e. when the load line is shifted {{in the opposite direction}} of rotation...|$|E

In this work a simultaneous localization and routing algorithm is proposed. The localization is obtained by a ranging technique, exploiting network topology provided by the routing algorithm to reduce the network signaling communication, which is the most power-consuming operation in WSN, as much as possible. To this end, Shadow Edges, a novel class of links, is considered to take into account the lack of communication among nodes...|$|R
