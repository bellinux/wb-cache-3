50|$|Moore made {{a series}} of sculptures of draped human forms in the 1950s after he was {{commissioned}} to create a sculpture for the new UNESCO Headquarters building in Paris. He wanted to create a figure in an architectural context, and turned to the seated human form. His Draped <b>Reclining</b> Figure, 1952-53 was a precursor to these later draped figures. He completed the first major work in the series in 1955, with a maquette, Draped Seated Woman: Figure on Steps (LH 427), cast in a series of 10. This became the working model for the full-size sculpture that became his Draped Seated Woman 1957-58. The <b>reclining</b> figure is a dominant theme of Moore's work, with perhaps half of his sculptures in a <b>reclining</b> position. He made a similar work in a <b>reclining</b> position, Draped <b>Reclining</b> Woman 1957-58. Moore ultimately abandoned these ideas for the UNESCO commission, and his UNESCO <b>Reclining</b> Figure 1957-58 (LH 416) is a much more abstract <b>reclining</b> form in travertine.|$|R

25|$|On 9 August 2015, Singapore Airlines {{introduced}} an all-new premium economy class, with the seats manufactured by Zim Flugsitz, {{to be installed}} on its Airbus A380, B777-300ER and Airbus A350-900 aircraft. The product was first flown from Singapore to Sydney, Hong Kong and Auckland and has been progressively rolled out to other routes. Premium Economy seats have 38-inch pitch (compared to a 32-inch pitch in standard economy), at 18.5-19.5 inches wide with an 8-inch <b>recline.</b> They also feature a 13.3 inch high-definition touchscreen LCD monitor and a Book-the-Cook Service.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Air New Zealand in {{consultation}} with US design studio IDEO, the new Premium Economy cabin uses a 2-2-2 seating configuration. The central pair of Spaceseats are slightly angled for those travelling with a colleague or partner, and the two arm rests can form a single table for shared in-flight dining. The pairs of outboard Spaceseats on either side are angled to enhance privacy for solo flyers. The seats are built around a hard shell so the passenger in front cannot <b>recline</b> into {{the space of the}} person sitting behind. Instead, the seat slides forward and angles up as it reclines into the shell, similar to an armchair.|$|E
25|$|The seating layout for the VLocity is 2+2, {{with a mix}} of club-style seats {{facing each}} other, and aircraft-style rows. The seats can't be rotated to face any {{particular}} direction, and seat backs do not <b>recline.</b> Four wheelchair spaces are provided in each set through the provision of tip-up seats. The VLocity offers economy-class seating only, although the seat width is equivalent to first class seating on V/Line locomotive-hauled services. In response to passenger feedback, the seatback angle in the intermediate carriages was made 2.5 degrees more upright than the original carriages. New deliveries from July 2010 onwards (VL42 and above) featured a changed seatback angle and new seat fabrics.|$|E

25|$|Mexico was a {{crossroads}} of {{trade in the}} colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain. It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a salon de estrado, to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to <b>recline</b> in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called biombos The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes.

25|$|The {{concept of}} Heaven in Islam differs {{in many respects}} to the concept in Judaism and Christianity. Heaven is {{described}} primarily in physical terms {{as a place where}} every wish is immediately fulfilled when asked. Islamic texts describe immortal life in Heaven as happy, without negative emotions. Those who dwell in Heaven are said to wear costly apparel, partake in exquisite banquets, and <b>recline</b> on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones. Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of their parents, spouses, and children. In Islam if one's good deeds outweigh one's sins then one may gain entrance to Heaven. Conversely, if one's sins outweigh their good deeds they are sent to hell. The more good deeds one has performed the higher the level of Heaven one is directed to. It has been said that the lowest level of Heaven, the first one, is already over one-hundred times better than the greatest life on Earth. The highest level is the seventh Heaven. Houses are built by angels for the occupants using solid gold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Reclining</b> wheelchairs are {{commonly}} used to transport elderly stroke patients in Taiwan. However, there is concern that the patient's body in the wheelchair often slides forward when they return to a seated position, increasing the sitting pressure. Therefore, a novel <b>reclining</b> wheelchair with an ergonomic "V-Seat" was designed to prevent forward sliding and pressure sores. The use of these <b>reclining</b> chairs by stroke patients {{has not yet been}} studied. Thus, we investigated the effects of V-shaped and conventional seats in <b>reclining</b> wheelchairs on the extent of forward sliding and on the sitting pressure of stroke patients with flaccid hemiplegia and of able-bodied elders. Methods We recruited 13 able-bodied elders and 11 stroke patients with flaccid hemiplegia and performed 5 <b>reclining</b> cycles in both types of wheelchair. The amount of sliding along the backrest (BS) plane and the seat (SS) plane, the mean sitting pressure (MP), and the sacral peak pressure (SPP) of the subjects were recorded. We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the BS, SS, MP, and SPP in wheelchairs with conventional and V-shaped seats, and we used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the differences in BS and SS between stroke patients and able-bodied elders in both types of <b>reclining</b> wheelchair. Results The BS, SS, and SPP of stroke patients were significantly lower in the wheelchairs with V-shaped seats than in conventional wheelchairs in most comparisons; however, the BS of able-bodied elders was higher in V-shaped seats than in conventional seats. The SS and SPP of stroke patients were significantly higher than those of able-bodied elders in both types of <b>reclining</b> wheelchair, and the BS of stroke patients was significantly higher than that of able-bodied elders only in conventional <b>reclining</b> wheelchairs. Conclusions The use of V-shaped seats in <b>reclining</b> wheelchairs can help reduce the forward sliding and sacral peak pressure of stroke patients with flaccid hemiplegia. The back displacement of able-bodied subjects when using both conventional and V-shape seats in <b>reclining</b> positions differs from the back displacement of stroke patients with flaccid hemiplegia when using such seats. These results are of paramount value and should be considered when prescribing the use of <b>reclining</b> wheelchairs to subjects with flaccid hemiplegia. </p...|$|R
