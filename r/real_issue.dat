5|$|The <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> is that {{it moves}} the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the <b>real</b> <b>issue.</b> They say the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart of}} {{strengthening}} weak nations {{must come from}} within, and that heart will fail if they deny that the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> {{is the future of}} their civilization, if they tolerate religious, cultural or separatist violence and terrorism when it strikes at unpopular targets, or if they continue to try to export the blame for their own failures to other nations, religions, and cultures.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} issue of how the Times {{obtained}} the documents (which was being investigated by a federal grand jury elsewhere) the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> for the Court was whether there was a sufficient justification for prior restraint, which would be a suspension of the newspapers’ First Amendment rights to freedom of the press. The First Amendment states that no federal law can be made abridging the freedom of the press, but a few landmark cases in the 20th century had established precedents creating exceptions to that rule.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{issue with}} the ASL had been the {{scheduling}} of the National Challenge Cup, which had been straining for the ASL season schedule. Typically, the National Challenge Cup had been played during the ASL's offseason, which {{made it difficult for}} ASL clubs to compete in the tournament. Consequently, the ASL boycotted the 1925 Challenge Cup due to scheduling conflicts, and the lack of cooperation the USFA inflicted on the ASL. American soccer historians claim that the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> was the ASL vying to be the premier soccer body in the United States.|$|E

I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E

25|$|His term over, he {{returned}} to his mother in 1838. In February he was elected president of the Philo Logos Society, which Peter Gansevoort invited to move into Stanwix Hall for no rent. Many chambers were vacant {{as a result of the}} economic crisis. In March Melville published in the Albany Microscope two polemical letters about issues in the debating societies he was engaged in; it is not entirely clear what the polemic was about. Biographers Leon Howard and Hershel Parker suggest that the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> was the youthful desire to exercise his rhetoric skills in public, and his first appearance in print would have been an exciting experience for any young man.|$|E
25|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some soft drinks (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, 2001 calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that {{the net effect of}} carbonated soft drinks, (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulant) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that carbonated soft drinks, which do not contain the nutrients needed for bone health, may displace other foods which do, and that the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> is that people who drink a lot of soft drinks also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May, seven Egyptian {{soldiers}} were kidnapped by unknown militants in the Sinai demanding {{the release of}} members of an Islamist group detained for almost two years. One week later, they were reportedly released and {{handed over to the}} army in an area south of Rafah after talks mediated by tribal chiefs in the region with president Morsi greeting them upon their arrival at Cairo's airport. The <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> though is Morsi's way of dealing with the crisis with most actions taken by the government to solve the problem receiving wide criticism. Such reactions include Morsi's call for a national dialogue instead of either fighting or negotiating with the kidnappers and for also appearing as being concerned {{for the safety of the}} kidnapped soldiers and their kidnappers equally.|$|E

25|$|The poor {{financial}} {{returns on}} investment of all small Ontario railways {{in the late}} 1870s caused severe discontent among the bondholders. Many charged that the TG's troubles were due to the narrow gauge which made freight haulage uneconomic. From 1877 there were many calls for converting the gauge to standard gauge, {{but in fact the}} line had no lack of capacity. The <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> was overcapacity during a protracted traffic slump. In any case no-one would volunteer the capital to convert the gauge. Eventually there were warnings that the line was becoming unsafe due to the deterioration of wooden trestles and iron rails, and would soon have to close. The Bondholders lost patience and seized the line. They approached the Grand Trunk Railway, which obtained control of the TG and financed the renewals and gauge conversion in late 1881. Unfortunately the GTR encountered its own financial problems in digesting the Great Western Railway, and had to cede control to the Ontario and Quebec Railway, a proxy for the Canadian Pacific Railway, on August 1, 1883.|$|E
25|$|Ellerbe's {{plan was}} not well {{received}} by the D.C. City Council or local citizens' groups. At an initial hearing in November 2012, the firefighters' union testified that paramedic vacancies led to staffing downgrades for the 14 overnight advanced life support ambulances, leaving them staffed with EMTs. An average of 4.4 advanced life support ambulances had been downgraded every night in the past year, the union said. Ellerbe dispute those numbers, but provided none on downgrades, saying that the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> was call volume and not staffing. The D.C. Federation of Citizens Associations, a coalition of neighborhood citizens' groups, testified that similar redeployment plans were tested {{three times in the}} late 1980s and did not work. At a second hearing in December 2012, city council public safety committee chair Mendelson expressed frustration with plan, noting that DCFEMS has been unable to say how many paramedics it has on staff. (Ellerbe blamed a software problem for that.) Mendelson also said Ellerbe's plan also didn't seem to take into account scheduled leave, illness, or unforeseen problems.|$|E

500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the [...] "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted [...] "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone." ...|$|E

Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been [...] "ripped out of context" [...] by [...] "far left Stalinists" [...] who want him off of the air.
