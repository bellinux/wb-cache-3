We have applied this framework to estimate several model versions for household demand for conventional and alternative fuel automobiles in Shanghai based on <b>rank</b> <b>ordered</b> data obtained from a stated preference survey.

25|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful <b>rank</b> <b>order</b> among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.|$|E

500|$|As {{long ago}} as 1937, Lewis Terman pointed out that error of {{estimation}} in IQ scoring increases as IQ score increases, {{so that there is}} less and less certainty about assigning a test-taker to one band of scores or another as one looks at higher bands. Current IQ tests also have large error bands for high IQ scores. As an underlying reality, such distinctions as those between [...] "exceptionally gifted" [...] and [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] have never been well established. All longitudinal studies of IQ have shown that test-takers can bounce up and down in score, and thus switch up and down in <b>rank</b> <b>order</b> as compared to one another, over the course of childhood. Some test-givers claim that IQ classification categories such as [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] are meaningful, but those are based on the obsolete Stanford–Binet Third Revision (Form L-M) test. The highest reported standard score for most IQ tests is IQ 160, approximately the 99.997th percentile (leaving aside the issue of the considerable error in measurement at that level of IQ on any IQ test). IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering. Moreover, there has never been any validation of the Stanford–Binet L-M on adult populations, and there is no trace of such terminology in the writings of Lewis Terman. Although two current tests attempt to provide [...] "extended norms" [...] that allow for classification of different levels of giftedness, those norms are not based on well validated data.|$|E

40|$|Rank-ordering of {{individuals}} or objects on multiple criteria has many important practical applications. A reasonably representative composite <b>rank</b> <b>ordering</b> of multi-attribute objects/individuals or multi-dimensional points is often {{obtained by the}} Principal Component Analysis, although much inferior but computationally convenient methods also are frequently used. However, such <b>rank</b> <b>ordering</b> – even the one based on the Principal Component Analysis – may not be optimal. This has been demonstrated by several numerical examples. To solve this problem, the Ordinal Principal Component Analysis was suggested some time back. However, this approach cannot deal with various types of alternative schemes of <b>rank</b> <b>ordering,</b> mainly due to its dependence on the method of solution by the constrained integer programming. In this paper we propose an alternative method of solution, namely by the Particle Swarm Optimization. A computer program in FORTRAN {{to solve the problem}} has also been provided. The suggested method is notably versatile and can take care of various schemes of <b>rank</b> <b>ordering,</b> norms and types or measures of correlation. The versatility of the method and its capability to obtain the most representative composite <b>rank</b> <b>ordering</b> of multi-attribute objects or multi-dimensional points have been demonstrated by several numerical examples. It has also been found that <b>rank</b> <b>ordering</b> based on maximization of the sum of absolute values of the correlation coefficients of composite rank scores with its constituent variables has robustness, but it may have multiple optimal solutions. Thus, while it solves the one problem, it gives rise to the other problem. The overall ranking of objects by maximin correlation principle performs better if the composite rank scores are obtained by direct optimization with respect to the individual ranking scores. ...|$|R
