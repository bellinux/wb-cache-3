People with clinical depression can develop RBD, and vice versa, and both illnesses have similar risks.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the lifetime prevalence of <b>brief</b> <b>recurrent</b> <b>depression</b> (BRD) in a general population sample and related risk factors. Subjects (n = 493, 51. 9 % females, 48. 1 % males) randomly selected from electoral registers of an urban and a rural area in Sardinia were interviewed with the Italian version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Simplified, slightly modified {{for the purposes of}} the study. We found that BRD was not uncommon in the general population; the lifetime prevalence was 6. 9 %, without any statistical difference according to age and sex. A significantly higher risk was detected in separated/widowed/divorced people. Comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders was particularly frequent, in particular major depression. BRD was associated with a significant major risk for suicide attempts and alcohol dependence. These results (the frequency of BRD in the general population and its correlation with suicide risk and alcohol consumption) justify further epidemiological and clinical studies in order to develop specific treatment and prevention strategies...|$|R

50|$|DSM-IV-TR {{excludes}} {{cases where}} the symptoms {{are a result of}} bereavement, although it is possible for normal bereavement to evolve into a depressive episode if the mood persists and the characteristic features of a major depressive episode develop. The criteria have been criticized because they do not take into account any other aspects of the personal and social context in which depression can occur. In addition, some studies have found little empirical support for the DSM-IV cut-off criteria, indicating they are a diagnostic convention imposed on a continuum of depressive symptoms of varying severity and duration: Excluded are a range of related diagnoses, including dysthymia, which involves a chronic but milder mood disturbance; <b>recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>depression,</b> consisting of briefer depressive episodes; minor depressive disorder, whereby only some symptoms of major depression are present; and adjustment disorder with depressed mood, which denotes low mood resulting from a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> (RBD) {{defines a}} mental {{disorder}} characterized by intermittent depressive episodes, {{not related to}} menstrual cycles in women, occurring between approximately 6-12 times per year, over {{at least one year}} or more fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for major depressive episodes (DSM-IV and ICD-10) except for duration which in RBD is less than 14 days, typically 2-4 days. Despite the short duration of the depressive episodes, such episodes are severe and suicidal ideation and impaired function is rather common. The majority of patients with RBD also report symptoms of anxiety and increased irritability. Hypersomnia is also rather frequent. About 1/2 of patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for RBD may have additional short episodes of brief hypomania which is a severity marker of RBD. RBD may be the only mental disorder present, but RBD may also occur as part of a history of recurrent major depressive episodes or bipolar disorders. RBD is also seen among some patients with personality disorders.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{based on}} data from {{epidemiological}} studies, the Swiss psychiatrist and researcher, Jules Angst, coined the concept [...] "recurrent brief depression" [...] (RBD) and provided diagnostic criteria for this type of mood disorder in 1985. Several other European studies independently confirmed the occurrence of RBD in the general population and clinical samples. RBD was thus included in the 10th classification of mental and behavioural disorders (ICD-10 F38.1) published by the World Health Organization in 1992 (WHO, 1992; WHO, 1993). Less frequent episodes of <b>brief</b> <b>depressions</b> were labelled infrequent <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> and not included in ICD-10. The American classification system of mental disorders, DSM-IV (1994), provided provisional diagnostic criteria for RBD, but decided to await further studies before including RBD in the classification system. The fate of RBD in DSM-5, expected to occur in 2013, is not known.|$|R

30|$|The {{strength}} of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III, DSM-III-R and DSM-IV) was to base psychiatric diagnoses on defined operational criteria, which resulted in high inter-rater reliability. A weakness, shown in relation to DSM-IV, {{was that it was}} only able to formally diagnose under half the patients actually treated (Angst et al. 2010). This clinically unacceptable situation was derived partly from the lack of operationalized subthreshold diagnoses. Now, in recognition of the fact that for a large group of patients receiving treatment doctors often had no alternative to the residual, catch-all diagnosis not otherwise specified (NOS), DSM- 5 includes defined subthreshold syndromes, which will also stimulate research and allow a more dimensional view. For depression, for example, <b>recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> and even short-duration depressive episodes (4 to 13 days), as well as 2 -week episodes with insufficient symptoms, now have their place.|$|E
40|$|Background Depressive syndromes, {{including}} <b>recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> (RBD), {{have frequently}} {{been observed in}} association with chronic diseases characterized by immune activation, such as autoimmune thyroiditis or celiac disease.

40|$|Psychotropic drugs play a {{major role}} in primary care {{management}} of mental disorders. This study expands the existing data on prescribing practices using data from a 15 -center, primary care epidemiologic survey. Questions to be addressed include the following: Which clinical and nonclinical factors are related to the prescribing of psychotropic drugs by primary care physicians? How do prescribing patterns vary across primary care centers? At each center, primary care patients were screened using the General Health Questionnaire, and a stratified random sample completed a standardized diagnostic assessment. For each patient completing the diagnostic assessment, the treating primary care physician provided data on clinical diagnosis and medications prescribed. Study results indicated that 11. 5 % of all practice attenders, 51. 7 % of cases who received a diagnosis of mental disorders by a physician, and 27. 6 % of cases who received a diagnosis using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were treated with psychotropic medication because of their psychologic problems. Anxiolytics, hypnotics, and antidepressants each accounted for approximately 20 % of all prescriptions. Prescription rates increased with the prominence of psychologic complaints, severity of mental disorder, severity of social disability, female gender, age older than 40 years, lower education, unemployment, and marital separation. Rates and type of drugs also varied among specific mental disorders; 19. 3 % of patients with <b>brief</b> <b>recurrent</b> <b>depression</b> but 55. 0 % with agoraphobia got any psychotropic drug. Antidepressant drugs were prescribed in 7. 7 % of anxiety disorders compared with 31. 9 % of depressive disorders. There were large differences between international centers. When comparing client-type centers with clinic-type centers, overall prescription rates were similar (51. 2 vs. 52. 9 %), but significant differences were observed with respect to psychotropic polypharmacy (12. 6 % client, 6. 3 % clinic), tranquilizer medication (24. 2 client, 32. 9 % clinic), and antidepressant medication (17. 3 client, 8. 9 % clinic). Psychotropic drugs have an important role in the treatment of mental disorders by general practitioners. Prescription is associated with a number of clinical but also nonclinical factors that must be recognized when guidelines for international use are to be published. Recognition of mental disorders and selection of specific drug classes are important areas in which medical practice needs improvement...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{expand the}} concept of <b>recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>{{depression}}</b> (RBD) to brief depression (BD) and to test its clinical relevance. METHOD: Subjects (N = 591) were studied prospectively six times from ages 20 / 21 to 40 / 41 years. RBD was defined according to DSM-IV as episodes under 2 weeks with about monthly recurrence and work impairment. BD embraces RBD and brief depressive episodes with a frequency of 1 - 11 per year. RESULTS: Pure BD and pure major depressive episodes (MDE) {{did not differ in}} treatment rates, family history of mood and anxiety disorders or comorbidity with bipolar spectrum and anxiety disorders but they differed in work impairment, suicide attempt rates and distress self-ratings. The combination of BD + MDE identified a very severe group of MDE, comparable with combined depression (MDE + RBD) and double depression (MDE + dysthymia).

40|$|Epidemiologie {{studies using}} the modern and widely used Composite International Diagnostic Interview, {{based on the}} DSM criteria, have {{reported}} generaUy low lifetime prevalence rates for bipolar 1 and bipolar II disorders, and cydothymia of between 1 % and 2 % (range, 0. 0 - 2. 4 %). These low rates require serious investigation as there is growing evidence from epidemiologie studies in {{adolescents and young adults}} of clinically very relevant subdiagnostic hypomanic morbidity. As a consequence of the under-recognition of hypomania, major depressive disorders are over-diagnosed at the expense of bipolar II disorders. There is a similar over-diagnosis of dysthymia, and minor and <b>recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>depression,</b> and under-diagnosis of minor bipolar disorder.

40|$|The current subtyping of {{depression}} {{is based on}} the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th ed.

40|$|Background: Twenty {{percent of}} the United States (U. S.) adult {{population}} is affected by mental illness each year of which depression {{is the most common}} cause of disability and suicide. Each year, one in four young adults between the ages of 18 – 25 will experience at least one depressive episode. This demographic propensity for young adults to suffer depression has implications for college campuses where young adults congregate and high rates of depression have been noted. In addition to the impact of depression on health and quality of life, depression has been linked to a decrease in students’ academic performance. Thus from a health perspective as well as its potential impact on academic success, depression is a major health concern on college campuses. Objectives: The purpose of this quality improvement project is to evaluate whether integrating a <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> screening tool into an electronic health record (EHR) and providing decision support increases the proportion of students screened and diagnosed for depression. Participants: Data were drawn from a convenience sample of 130 student patient scheduled visit notes in the Department of General Medicine at a diverse urban University over a 4 year period. Methods: Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act method of quality improvement, the <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> screening tool was integrated into the EHR. Evaluation consisted of a pre/post implementation comparison of measures for screening for depressive symptoms and depression diagnosis. Results: Integration of the PHQ- 2 and decision support into the EHR increased the proportion of students: screened for depressive symptoms (7. 7 %: 86. 2 %); and diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (30 %: 45. 5 %). Conclusions: The integration of a valid and reliable tool to screen and diagnose depression can increase the number of students treated for depression.

40|$|Background: Patients {{with acute}} {{coronary}} syndromes (ACS) are {{at increased risk}} of further acute cardiac events. Secondary prevention aims to decrease morbidity and mortality post-ACS. Depression is related to increased risk in this population, and to poorer secondary prevention activities. However, lengthy depression assessment techniques preclude depression assessment in routine care. The present study investigated the relationship of briefly-assessed depression with secondary prevention outcomes one year post-ACS. Methods: Following ethics committee approval, hospitals recruited patients for a national survey of ACS. Consenting patients with ACS completed a <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> scale during hospitalisation.

40|$|A 44 -year-old woman {{presented}} with focal retrograde amnesia and complaints of rapid forgetting {{in the absence}} of episodes of transient cognitive disturbance. Her MRI and 2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were normal. On standard neuropsychological tests she performed within the normal range although a test of autobiographical memory confirmed impoverished recall especially involving recent life events. The electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings were suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy but no clear diagnosis was established. After 4 years the patient's <b>recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> episodes of disorientation, suggestive of transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), were corroborated by her sister. This diagnosis was confirmed by an ambulatory EEG that revealed ictal activity. Several important points emerge from this study. Focal retrograde amnesia can be a prodromal symptom of TEA which can precede the full-blown syndrome by several years. Moreover, transient attacks might not be reported if patients live alone. The ictal EEG findings further substantiate the epileptic nature of the syndrome. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> (RBD) has {{recently}} been proposed as a new subtype of affective disorder characterized by episodes of major depression which last less than two weeks. The {{aim of this study}} was to further evaluate the validity of this putative subtype by means of clinical and biological data. DST, TSH response to TRH and sleep EEG variables were compared in 25 RBD patients sex- and age-matched to 25 major depressed (MD) and 25 healthy subjects. Family history, age at onset, and psychiatric comorbidity did not discriminate RBD from MD. Recurrent unipolar depression was found to be more prevalent in MD. Although less severely depressed during the biological tests, patients with RBD did not significantly differ from those with MDD on basis of DST non-suppression, blunted TSH response and shortening of REM latency. Compared to controls, a greater sleep onset latency was observed both in RBD and MD and a lower total sleep time in MD patients only. These results suggest that RBD could be viewed as a subtype of affective disorder sharing many characteristics with MDD. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} of this longitudinal study {{was to assess the}} association between major depression and heart complaints in a population of young and healthy adults. METHODS: Starting at the age 20 / 21, participants of the Zurich Study underwent 6 structured, psychological interviews during a span of 20 years. We evaluated longitudinal data from 277 persons who participated in all 6 interviews including questions about heart complaints. RESULTS: Over 20 years, heart complaints were reported by two thirds of participants, and the frequency of depression was 11. 4 %. At the age of 40 / 41, heart complaints were significantly associated with earlier heart complaints and major depression, both more often in women. <b>Recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>depression</b> showed a tendency, but neither minor depression nor depressive symptoms were predictive for later heart complaints. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that major depression is a predictor for heart complaints at the age of 40 and that the severity of depressive disorder in younger age has an effect on subsequent heart complaints. Follow-up data will help to elucidate whether these subjective heart complaints show any correlation with a later coronary heart disease...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to compare the current and {{lifetime}} prevalences for major and subthreshold affective disorders in elderly subjects in the general population, to assess the influence of demographic variables on prevalence rates, and to examine co-morbidity between these disorders. Major and subthreshold disorders were diagnosed in 286 subjects (aged </= 60 years). Four-point-nine percent of the subjects had a lifetime diagnosis of major depression, 31. 8 % either minor or <b>recurrent</b> <b>brief</b> <b>depression,</b> 6. 6 % a major anxiety disorder, and 18. 5 % a subthreshold anxiety disorder. The risk for current and lifetime subthreshold anxiety was higher in females than in males, the lifetime prevalence for subthreshold anxiety disorders was increased in elderly subjects and subjects with low professional levels. Increased co-morbidity between major and subthreshold depressive and anxiety disorders could not be observed. In the elderly, subthreshold depressive and anxiety disorders are frequent, more so than major affective disorders. The presence of subthreshold anxiety disorders, but not subthreshold depression, is influenced by age, gender, and previous professional level.
