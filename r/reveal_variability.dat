40|$|This note {{focuses on}} a pointwise {{estimation}} of the Hurst exponent H, and on its reliability as a method to detect breaking signals inside a given financial time–series. The idea is that, although classical H can give information about the average scaling behavior of data, its estimation over proper subsamples of the original time–series can <b>reveal</b> <b>variability</b> which is perfectly compliant with sudden changes in direction that are typical of financial markets. The behavior of the pointwise estimation of H is then analyzed on different proxies of market price levels (namely: log–returns, squared log–returns, and the absolute value of log–returns), focusing on the relationships existing with bursts in the markets and those observable in such indicators as well.

Detailed and {{repeated}} measurements of nitrate across the Oregon shelf, made coincident with turbulence measurements, reveal {{the importance of}} cross-isopycnal mixing via turbulence in providing nitrate to the upper water column. Spatial distributions of vertical gradients and turbulent fluxes in the Oregon coastal ocean <b>reveal</b> <b>variability</b> {{that could not have}} been resolved with traditional sampling approaches. Nitrate-rich near-bottom waters are drawn up the shelf during upwelling and back down the shelf during downwelling. Continuous turbulent mixing in the bottom boundary layer increases nitrate on intermediate isopycnals by several μM toward the shelf. This increased nitrate is consistent with measured turbulent flux of nitrate of O(0. 1 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) for a period of 3 days, roughly the timescale for changes in the wind and hence to the upwelling circulation. Our flux estimates are consistent with high-biomass, nutrient-replete, incubation-based primary productivity estimates in this area and suggest that turbulent vertical nitrate transport plays a significant role in supporting the high productivity seen here.

By combining a bioinformatics (paired-end sequence analysis) approach and a molecular cytogenetics approach, we have refined the synteny block arrangement of the white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys, NLE) with respect to the human genome. We provide the first detailed clone framework map of the gibbon genome and refine the location of 86 evolutionary breakpoints to < 1 Mb resolution. An additional 12 breakpoints, mapping primarily to centromeric and telomeric regions, were mapped to approximately 5 Mb resolution. Our combined FISH and BES analysis indicates that we have effectively subcloned 49 of these breakpoints within NLE gibbon BAC clones, mapped to a median resolution of 79. 7 kb. Interestingly, many of the intervals associated with translocations were gene-rich, including some genes associated with normal skeletal development. Comparisons of NLE breakpoints with those of other gibbon species <b>reveal</b> <b>variability</b> in the position, suggesting that chromosomal rearrangement has been a longstanding property of this particular ape lineage.

The observed variations cannot be explained by simple inter-stellar scintillation (ISS) models where there are {{only one or two}} scintillating components and all of the ISS occurs in the Galaxy. More complicated models where there are either more scintillating components or some of the ISS occurs in the ISM of the z= 0. 3127 absorber may be acceptable. However, the variability can probably best be explained in models incorporating motion (on sub-VLBI scales) of a component of the background continuum source, with or without some ISS. All models for producing the variable 21 cm absorption profile require small scale variations in the 21 cm optical depth of the absorber. The length scale for the opacity variations is ∼ 0. 1 pc in pure super-luminal motion models, and ∼ 10 pc in pure ISS models.

Six years of SST fields from SEVIRI are validated against the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) Reprocessed for Climate (ARC) data set. The overall SEVIRI–AATSR bias is − 0. 07 K, and the standard deviation is 0. 51 K, based on more than 53 × 10 6 match-ups. Identification of the diurnal signal requires an SST foundation temperature field representative of well-mixed conditions which typically occur at night-time or under moderate and strong winds. Such fields are generated from the SEVIRI archive and are validated against pre-dawn SEVIRI SSTs and night-time SSTs from drifting buoys. The different methodologies tested for the foundation temperature fields <b>reveal</b> <b>variability</b> introduced by averaging night-time SSTs over many days compared to single-day, pre-dawn values.

40|$|The Venusian {{atmosphere}} is {{in a state}} of superrotation where prevailing westward winds move much faster than the planet's rotation. Venus is covered with thick clouds that extend from about 45 to 70 km altitude, but thermal radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere and the surface on the planet's nightside escapes to space at narrow spectral windows of the near-infrared. The radiation can be used to estimate winds by tracking the silhouettes of clouds in the lower and middle cloud regions below about 57 km in altitude. Estimates of wind speeds have ranged from 50 to 70 m/s at low to mid-latitudes, either nearly constant across latitudes or with winds peaking at mid-latitudes. Here we report the detection of winds at low latitude exceeding 80 m/s using IR 2 camera images from the Akatsuki orbiter taken during July and August 2016. The angular speed around the planetary rotation axis peaks near the equator, which we suggest is consistent with an equatorial jet, a feature that has not been observed previously in the Venusian atmosphere. The mechanism producing the jet remains unclear.

It is suggested that more comprehensive but relatively simple conceptual models, as that introduced by Kuuluvainen (2009) and discussed in this paper, are needed. Such models should be able to incorporate and visualize both long-term directional forest development as well as shorter-term cyclic forest dynamics of different kinds. Such models should also incorporate state changes and transitions from one dynamics type to another depending on changes in driving disturbance regime.|$|R

The tree topologies associated with the most highly conserved genes suggest that the endosymbionts form a sister group with Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., and Yersinia pestis. Our results indicate that deviant tree topologies result from high substitution rates and biased nucleotide patterns, rather than from lateral gene transfer, as previously suggested. A reinvestigation of the relative rate increase in the endosymbiont genomes <b>reveals</b> <b>variability</b> among genes that correlate with host-associated metabolic dependencies.

40|$|The m-AAA protease, an ATP-dependent {{proteolytic}} {{complex in}} the mitochondrial inner membrane, controls protein quality and regulates ribosome assembly, thus exerting essential housekeeping functions within mitochondria. Mutations in the m-AAA protease subunit paraplegin cause axonal degeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), but {{the basis for the}} unexpected tissue specificity is not understood. Paraplegin assembles with homologous Afg 3 l 2 subunits into hetero-oligomeric complexes which can substitute for yeast m-AAA proteases, demonstrating functional conservation. The function of a third paralogue, Afg 3 l 1 expressed in mouse, is unknown. Here, we analyze the assembly of paraplegin into m-AAA complexes and monitor consequences of paraplegin deficiency in HSP fibroblasts and in a mouse model for HSP. Our findings <b>reveal</b> <b>variability</b> in the assembly of m-AAA proteases in mitochondria in different tissues. Homo-oligomeric Afg 3 l 1 and Afg 3 l 2 complexes and hetero-oligomeric assemblies of both proteins with paraplegin can be formed. Yeast complementation studies demonstrate the proteolytic activity of these assemblies. Paraplegin deficiency in HSP does not result in the loss of m-AAA protease activity in brain mitochondria. Rather, homo-oligomeric Afg 3 l 2 complexes accumulate, and these complexes can substitute for housekeeping functions of paraplegin-containing m-AAA complexes. We therefore propose that the formation of m-AAA proteases with altered substrate specificities leads to axonal degeneration in HSP...|$|E
