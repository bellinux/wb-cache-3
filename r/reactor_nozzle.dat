40|$|Abstract: One of {{the main}} {{degradation}} mechanisms which cause risks to safety and reliability of pressurized water nuclear reactors is the primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) in nickel alloys, such as Alloy 600 (75 Ni- 15 Cr- 9 Fe), and its weld metal Alloy 182 (67 Ni- 15 Cr- 8 Fe). It can appear at several <b>reactor</b> <b>nozzles</b> dissimilarly welded with Alloys 182 / 82 between steel ASTM A- 508 G 3 and stainless steel AISI 316 L, among others. The hydrogen which is dissolved to primary water to prevent radiolysis, can also have influence on the stress corrosion cracking behavior. In this article one departs from a study of Lima based in experimental data obtained from CDTN-Brazilian Nuclear Technology Development Center, in slow strain rate test (SSRT). It was prepared and used for tests a weld in laboratory, similar to dissimilar weld in pressurizer relief nozzles, operating at Brazilian NPP Angra 1. It was simulated for tests, primary water at 325 o C and 12. 5 MPa containing levels of dissolved hydrogen: 2, 10, 25, and 50 cm 3 STP H 2 /kgH 2 O. The objective {{of this article is}} to propose an adequate modeling based on these experimental results, for PWSCC crack growth rate according to the levels of dissolved hydrogen, based on EPRI-MRP- 263 NP. Furthermore, it has been estimated the stress intensity factor applied for these tests: according with these, some another models described on EPRI-MRP- 115, and an USNRC Technical Report, have been tested.

The reactor head is relatively thick, {{which makes it}} difficult to inspect from the outside by conventional ultrasonic testing.

40|$|AbstractThe {{studies in}} boiling water in {{microchannel}} that are shaped along turbine blades has been examined since the 1970 s {{as a means to}} dissipating large amounts of heat.

This paper addresses: (a) dissipation high heat flux by two phase flow (b) how the geometry of micro channels affects their activity i. e. of circular and non-circular geometry, and (c) means to enhance this performance. It is shown that despite many hundreds of publications attempting to predict the performance of two-phase microchannel heat sinks, there are only a handful of predictive tools that can tackle broad ranges of geometrical and operating parameters or different fluids. There are a lot of complications for the development of these tools because of insufficient databases and also the drastic differences in boiling behavior of different fluids in microchannel. It is shown that cutting-edge heat transfer enhancement techniques, {{such as the use of}} nanofluids and carbon nanotube coatings, with proven merits to single-phase macrosystems, may not offer similar ad-vantages to microchannel heat sinks. The boiling flow regimes in microchannels were categorized as the confined bubble, slug flow, and annular flow depending mainly on the length of the bubble. Based on the dominant flow regimes in micro-channels, a steady slug-annular flow model is proposed to predict the pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics. As a correlation method, the homogeneous flow model with empirical correlations was applied to the boiling flow in micro-channels. In addition, this review concludes that boiling flow in microchannel can be an effective way to eliminate heat from the heat sinks...|$|R

Due {{to the difficulty of}} manufacturing these JSR’s made in quartz, existing JSR configurations were assessed with certain modifications and optimal operating conditions were suggested for each reactor. The effect of changing the <b>reactor</b> volume, the <b>nozzle</b> diameter and shape on mixing were both studied. Two nozzle geometries were examined in this study, a crossed shape nozzle and an inclined shape <b>nozzle.</b> Overall, six <b>reactor</b> configurations were assessed by conducting tracer experiments - using the state-of-art technologies of high-speed cameras and laser absorption spectroscopy- and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The high-speed camera tracer experiment gives unique qualitative information – not present in the literature – about the actual flow field. On the other hand, when using the laser technique, a more quantitative analysis emerges with determining the experimental residence time distribution (RTD) curves of each reactor. Comparing these RTD curves with the ideal curve helped in eliminating two cases. Finally, the CFD simulations predict the RTD curves as well as the mixing levels of the JSR’s operated at different residence times. All of these performed studies suggested the use of an inclined nozzle configuration with a reactor diameter D of 40 mm and a nozzle diameter d of 1 mm as the optimal choice for low residence time operation.

This thesis investigates {{probabilistic}} and stochastic {{methods for}} structural analysis {{which can be}} integrated into existing, commercially available finite element programs. It develops general probabilistic finite element routines which can be implemented within deterministic finite element programs without requiring major code development. These routines are implemented in the general purpose finite element program ABAQUS through its user element subroutine facility and two probabilistic finite elements are developed: a three-dimensional beam element limited to linear material behaviour and a two-dimensional plane element involving elastic-plastic material behaviour. The plane element incorporates plane strain, plane stress and axisymmetric formulations. The numerical accuracy and robustness of the routines are verified and application of the probabilistic finite element method is illustrated in two case studies, one involving a four-story, two-bay frame structure, the other a <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel <b>nozzle.</b> The probabilistic finite element routines developed in this thesis integrate point estimate methods and mean value first order methods within the same program. Both methods require a systematic sequence involving the perturbation of the random parameters to be evaluated, although the perturbation sequence of the methods differ.

These efficient techniques are limited to linear problems; nonlinear problems must use full perturbation schemes.

They help to reach better performances for high temperature environment but they can promote premature failure of components. Failure is often related to cracking in the heat affected zone of base materials. In this study, a literature review was conducted concerning the behavior of Inconel Ni-base alloys and LAS in DMWs for nuclear applications. It was centered on the metallurgical changes occurring with post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) at the interface of ferritic/austenitic DMWs, on the weldability of Inconel filler metals and on the narrow-gap welding (NGW) technique emerging in the NPP design. The aim was to characterize a NGW present in modern pressurized water reactor (PWR) design, which uses an Inconel filler metal to join the <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel <b>nozzle</b> to its safe-end. In addition, the behavior of Alloy 690 was studied. Eight samples were characterized.

The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F. The system piping and valves have been designed for a pressure of 1200 psig and a temperature of 570 °F. 5. 4. 1. 2 System Description The system consists of the reactor vessel and five piping loops, as shown in Drawing GE 237 E 798. Each loop comprises one motor driven pump, a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and discharge valves, a bypass valve around each discharge valve, pipe support hangers, piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the <b>reactor</b> through vessel <b>nozzles,</b> passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where bulk boiling produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the moisture separators and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping. The coolant is then returned to the vessel via the pumps and discharge piping. The continuous circulation ensures that hot spots are not created by steam bubbles, which would result in steam blanketing around fuel rods and in reduction of the heat removal capability of the coolant.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the thermochemical properties of a transient supersonic flame. Creation of the transient flame was controlled by pulsing air in 200 millisecond intervals into a combustor filled with flowing methane. The combustor was designed following well-known principles of jet engine combustors. A flame holder and spark plug combination was used to encourage turbulent mixing and ignition of reactant gases, and to anchor the transient flame. Combustion created a high temperature and pressure environment which propelled a flame through a choked de Laval nozzle. The nozzle accelerated the products of combustion to a Mach number of 1. 6, creating an underexpanded transient flame which burned for approximately 25 milliseconds. Qualitative information of the flame was gathered by two optical systems. An intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) was constructed from constitutive components to amplify and capture the chemiluminescence generated by the transient flame, as well as the spatial structure of the flame at specific phases. To gather temporal data of a single transient event as it unfolded, a z-type schlieren optical system was constructed for use with a high speed camera. The system resolves the data in 1 millisecond increments, sufficient for capturing the transient phenomenon. The transient system was modeled computationally in Cantera using the GRI- 3. 0 reaction mechanism. Experimental conditions were simulated within the zero- dimensional computation by explicit control of the reacting gas mass flow rates within the system. Results from the computational model were used to describe the ignition process. The major limitation of the zero-dimensional reactor model is homogeneity and lack of spatial mixing.

40|$|The {{problem of}} water {{pollution}} {{has been an}} environmental concern for many years. Numerous researchers are looking for an effective method to solve this issue. Heterogeneous photocatalysis, using a semiconductor as a catalyst, is a promising method {{for the destruction of}} water polluting pesticides. This method has been called the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) {{which is one of the}} techniques for water treatment. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is the most widely accepted photocatalyst because it is non-toxic, stable to photocorrosion, low cost and can potentially work using sunlight rather than artificial sources of light. When titanium dioxide is illuminated by UV radiation, the absorption of photons of energy is then equal to or greater than its band gap width. This artefact leads to the formation of conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes on the surface of TiO 2, which yield hydroxyl radicals, the primary oxidising species needed for the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. Supercritical water hydrothermal synthesis (ScWHS) is one of novel approaches for nanoparticle manufacture which involves the mixing of an aqueous metal salt stream with a supercritical water stream to produce nano-sized metal oxide particles. The engineering design for the mixing of these two fluids is critical and a novel <b>nozzle</b> <b>reactor</b> has been developed at the University of Nottingham that can produce high quality particles with an excellent control over particle size and particle size distribution. By application of this technique, titanium dioxide (TiO 2), in nanoparticle form, was produced and used for the photocatalytic treatment of wastewater. In this thesis, the photocatalytic degradation of the three pesticides - isoproturon, simazine and propazine - was measured using 3 different types of reactors: thin film fixed bed reactor (TFFBR), a stirred reactor, and a fluidised bed photoreactor. Various conditions were used: for example without UVC and UVA illumination, with commercial TiO 2, with the synthesised TiO 2, without any photocatalyst, low concentration, high concentration, and at different TiO 2 concentrations. The optimum TiO 2 concentration for the treatment of the three chosen pesticides was equal to 5 g litre- 1. The efficiency in decreasing the pesticides concentration of the synthesised TiO 2 (from ScWHS technique) with all three types of reactors was lower than that of the commercial titanium dioxide (P- 25 TiO 2). The fluidised bed reactor appeared to give the highest performance amongst three reactors. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
