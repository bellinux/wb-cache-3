As the name implies, a riometer measures the [...] "opacity" [...] of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from cosmic origin. In {{the absence of any}} ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a quiet-day curve. Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30-40 MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic synchrotron radiation and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.|$|E

We analyze as an example the Mills Cross configuration, compare its performance as a riometer with that of a filled square array of the same angular resolution and inquire about the penalty of using a sparsely filled array. We find that the susceptibility to interference from sources in the sidelobes is greater than in the filled array, that strong point sources in the sidelobes can cause both positive and negative excursions in the output and that the noise performance is inferior and requires longer integration times for a given rms error than the filled array...|$|E

40|$|The Earth’s {{magnetic}} field {{works like a}} shield against the solar wind flux of plasma, but at the polar regions, where it fails to do so, these charged particles may be guided down to low altitudes and introduce a lot of impacts on the environment, ranging from the nice colourful Aurora, to chemical changes in the atmosphere and decrease {{in the amount of}} ozone in the middle atmosphere, and from satellite damages to power line cut offs, depending on the type and energy of the particles. Extraterrestrial HF/VHF radio noise from the universe and mainly from our own galaxy is continuously coming towards our planet. Absorption of these electromagnetic waves in the Earth’s ionosphere is a well known proxy of the events which can enhance it, mainly having direct or indirect root in the solar activities, like Solar Flares, Coronal Mass Ejections, and Geomagnetic Storms and the resulted X rays, Solar Proton Events and Precipitating Energetic charged Particles. Cosmic radio noise power and the corresponding ionospheric absorption is normally measured by the riometers (<b>Relative</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Opacity</b> <b>Meters</b> for Extraterrestrial Electromagnetic Radiation), and especially in recent years by multiple narrow beam imaging riometers. In this thesis, the data obtained by the vertical beam of a narrow beam MST radar, ALWIN, at Andenes, Norway (69. 17 °N; 16. 01 °E) is used as a (narrow beam of a) riometer to estimate the incident cosmic noise power at 53. 5 MHz and its absorption, especially during solar/geomagnetic activity periods. The results are in good agreement with riometers (IRIS and AIRIS in Andenes and Kilpisjarvi Finland, 69. 06 °N, 20. 55 °E) common volume measurements and with electron density measurements of the Saura MF Radar.

40|$|A {{riometer}} (<b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>meter)</b> {{measures the}} intensity of cosmic radio noise at {{the surface of a}} planet. When an electromagnetic wave passes through the ionosphere collisions between charged particles (usually electrons) and neutral gases remove energy from the wave. By measuring the received signal intensity at the planet's surface and comparing it to the expected value (the quietday curve) a riometer can deduce the absorption (attenuation) of the trans-ionospheric signal. Thus the absorption measurements provide an indication of ionisation changes occurring in the ionosphere. To avoid the need for orbiting sounders riometers use the cosmic noise background as a signal source. Earth-based systems are not subject to the challenging power, volume and mass restriction that would apply to a riometer for Mars. Some Earth-based riometers utilise phased-array antennas in order to provide an imaging capability...|$|E

The riometer is an important radio science instrument for terrestrial aeronomy investigations. The riometer measures absorption of cosmic radio waves by the overhead ionosphere. Studies have shown the instrument should work well on Mars, which has an appreciable daytime ionosphere. There has been concern that the required radio receiver antenna (with possibly a 10 meter scale size) would be too large or too difficult to deploy on Mars. This study addresses those concerns and presents several antenna designs and deployment options. It is found that a Mars balloon would provide an excellent platform for the riometer antenna.

Several of the subsystems were implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), including the receiver detector, the control logic, and the data acquisition and processing blocks.

40|$|Cosmic noise at 40  MHz is {{measured}} at Ny-Ålesund (79 ° N, 12 ° E) using a <b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>meter</b> ("riometer"). A riometer is normally {{used to determine}} the degree to which cosmic noise is absorbed by the intervening ionosphere, giving an indication of ionisation of the atmosphere at altitudes lower than generally monitored by other instruments. The usual course is to determine a "quiet-day" variation, this representing the galactic noise signal itself in the absence of absorption; the current signal is then subtracted from this to arrive at absorption expressed in decibels (dB). By a variety of means and assumptions, it is thereafter possible to estimate electron density profiles in the very lowest reaches of the ionosphere. Here however, the entire signal, i. e. including the cosmic noise itself, will be examined and spectral characteristics identified. It will be seen that distinct spectral subranges are evident which can, in turn, be identified with non-Gaussian processes characterised by generalised Hurst exponents, α. Considering all periods greater than 1 [*]h, α[*]≈[*] 24, an indication of fractional Brownian motion, whereas for periods greater than 1 day α[*]≈[*] 0. 9 – approximately pink noise and just in the domain of fractional Gaussian noise. The results are compared with other physical processes, suggesting that absorption of cosmic noise is characterised by a generalised Hurst exponent [*]≈[*] 1. 24 and thus non-persistent fractional Brownian motion, whereas generation of cosmic noise is characterised by a generalised Hurst exponent [*]≈[*] 1. The technique unfortunately did not result in clear physical understanding of the ionospheric phenomena, and thus, in this respect, the application was not successful; the analysis could, however, be used as a tool for instrument validation...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of imaging {{riometer}} system based on a Mills Cross antenna array is currently under construction by the Ionosphere and Radio Propagation Group, Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster {{in collaboration with the}} Max-Planck-Institut für Aeronomie, Germany. The system will have an unprecedented spatial resolution in a viewing area of 300 x 300 km. It is located at Ramfjordmoen, near Tromsø, Norway. The riometer (<b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>meter)</b> determines the radio-wave absorption in the ionosphere by measuring the received cosmic-noise power. The expected variation of background noise over a sidereal day is usually referred to as the quiet-day curve (QDC). The ionospheric opacity is deduced from the difference between the QDC and the received noise power. Absorption images may be produced by utilising a number of spatially-distributed narrow beams. The Mills Cross system considered in this paper provides at least 4 times the resolution which can be achieved (with the same number of antennas) with a filled array antenna system. However, the cross correlation technique employed for producing narrow pencil beams requires information on both amplitude and phase of the signals to be cross correlated in contrast to other existing imaging riometer systems that record only signal power. This adds a considerable amount of complexity to the system which requires the use of state-ofthe- art FPGA signal processing technology. The system design and specification will be presented. While the application of correlation technique allows an increased spatial resolution—even for the same number of antennas used — it leads {{at the same time to}} an increased noise level in the measurements with adverse effect for the minimum integration time. For filled arrays the integration time can be as low as 1 / 8 s; for a correlation system the integration time will be at least some seconds to achieve comparable uncertainties. First experimental observations have confirmed this. The measurements also indicated that antenna sidelobes introduce phase delays that result in signal reduction/increase especially in the presence of a strong noise source (radio star). To what extent this has an adverse effect on the QDC is being investigated. Adaptive beam steering and tapering techniques are being analysed to minimise the effects of the sidelobes. The results of these investigations will also be presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{ionosphere}} is an atmospheric region, {{which includes}} {{a significant number of}} free thermal electrons and ions located at altitudes of 60 km to beyond 1000 km above the Earth. The ionosphere can act as the media for long-distance propagation of electromagnetic waves. On the other hand, it also simultaneously disturbs the transmission of these radio signals. Therefore, not only the features of the ionosphere need to be thoroughly studied, but also it is necessary to monitor and predict the ionosphere in near real time through effective ionospheric-detecting instruments and models. Nowadays, it is still a challenging issue to build up accurate and easy-to-use ionospheric models because of the ionospheric variability and lack of very effective instrumentation. The drawbacks of many currently used ionospheric models include: 1) they need to simultaneously combine many different data sources e. g., Global Positioning System (GPS) data, radio occultation (RO) data, data from in situ measurement (i. e., ionosondes, the incoherent scatter radar, the <b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>meter)</b> and the data from the airglow radiances, etc. However, because some of these data sources are difficult to obtain at many target locations at the expected time, it will limit the widespread use of these ionospheric models; 2) based on some special conditions and prior assumptions (or modelling parameters), some of the ionospheric models are accurate. However, when these conditions and parameters change, the model bias may become large and can make the results unsuitable; 3) some kinds of the models only express the ionospheric distribution in a wide area. It may generate a large bias when they are used in a specific location. The major contributions of this study are summarised as follows: (1) Four novel models, which can retrieve electron densities using fewer data sources, are proposed as below: a) A method is proposed to model the electron density bias (with location dependence) generated by the Abel inversion algorithm. When the calculated bias is removed, the accuracy of the retrieved vertical electron density (VED) can be improved. This method only needs a RO event data to generate a more accurate VED profile. b) The electron density is firstly modeled with the parameters of altitude and the zenith angle (with regard to the local centre), and then it is estimated by the tomographic ART (Algebraic Reconstruction Technique) algorithms using the GPS data from a RO event and a ground-based receiver. c) In the ionospheric Shape Function model, the Shape Function is proposed to be altitude and location dependence rather than only altitude dependence (as that in the classic Shape Function model). This Shape Function can be solved by using the GPS data from a RO event and a ground-based receiver. d) The electron density is firstly modeled with the parameters of altitude, the zenith and azimuth angles (with regard to the local centre, and then it is estimated separately by the tomographic ART (Algebraic Reconstruction Technique), the MART (Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique) and the Kalman Filter algorithms using the GPS data from a RO event and a ground-based receiver. (2) Two quality control methods for TEC modelling are proposed as follows: a) A method of GPS outlier detection and exclusion in TEC modelling is proposed. Also the impact of outliers on TEC modelling is numerically calculated and analysed. b) In the estimation of the unknown parameters of the TEC models by a Kalman Filter, the impacts from the modelling parameters are numerically analysed. (3) A TEC model, which uses a Kalman Filer to smooth pseudo-ranges and to solve for combined biases in the hardware and the model, is proposed. Based on this model, the TEC temporal and spatial variations, which occurred in Australia in 2006, are analysed...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{operating}} on trans-polar routes require reliable HF (3 - 30 MHz) radio communications links {{to be maintained}} throughout each flight. However, solar flares and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) can often result in enhancements of the electron density in the Earth’s ionosphere, which can strongly attenuate HF radio waves in the Polar Regions. In some cases this can result in the cancellation or diversion of flights for periods of several days. This paper describes the scientific basis for an online service for airlines that predicts HF radio coverage for polar flight routes by combining nowcast maps of HF absorption in the lower (D-region) ionosphere with ray-tracing radio propagation algorithms. The absorption maps are generated by assimilating real-time measurements of cosmic radio noise absorption from 25 ‘relative <b>ionospheric</b> <b>opacity</b> meters’ (riometers) deployed across Canada and Scandinavia. These data are combined with real-time X-ray flux and energetic (1 - 100 MeV) proton flux measurements from the NASA / NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites. The effect of geomagnetic shielding of solar protons (which limits HF absorption at lower latitudes) {{and the location of}} the auroral absorption zones (which result from magnetospheric electron precipitation) are also parameterised and optimised using indices of geomagnetic activity. The latter are determined either from ground-based magnetometers or predicted from real-time Solar Wind / Interplanetary Magnetic Field measurements from the NASA / NOAA Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) stationed at the L 1 Earth-Sun Lagrange point. The performance of the real-time HF absorption model is demonstrated using several days of data recorded during a recent solar proton event and subsequent geomagnetic storm.

40|$|The use {{of diesel}} engine has been {{increasing}} in agricultural and industrial applications. The unfavorable diesel smoke, however, discourage the wide-spread use due to health hazards. The smoke also limits the maximum power output. Reduction of diesel smoke by adaptive control was {{the ultimate goal of}} this research. The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, fuel metering rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. Step input signal was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a multipurpose interface board for signal processing, a fuel metering valve perturbing mechanism with a modified fuel metering pump, an in-line smoke <b>opacity</b> <b>meter,</b> and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages.

The concept of the project is to measure the opacity of the smoke being emitted by the PUV {{with the use of}} a predesigned sensor unit incorporated by Light Dependent Resistor Sensor and Light Source facing each other, 4 inches apart. By allowing the smoke to pass through the LDR and Light Source, the desired resistance is acquired and processed by the microcontroller to obtain the Light Absorption Coefficient. This value is the basis for being a smoke belcher (If it exceeds 2. 5 k). The system then sends the data (Plate Number and K -value) for every one (1) hour to the Database System and to the operator with the aid of GSM Microcontroller that leads to a real time monitoring. The system is possible to implement and has a potential to be used for emission testing centers since it has the features of the commercial <b>opacity</b> <b>meter</b> which is common in emission centers to measure the smoke emitted by the diesel-fueled vehicles.

40|$|Precision {{relative}} navigation is {{an essential}} aspect of spacecraft formation flying missions, both from an operational and a scientific point of view. When using GPS as a relative distance sensor, dual-frequency receivers are required for high accuracy at large inter-satellite separations. This allows for a correction of the <b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> path delay and enables double difference integer ambiguity resolution. Although kinematic relative positioning techniques demonstrate promising results for hardware-in-the-loop simulations, they were found to lack an adequate robustness in real-world applications. To overcome this limitation, an extended Kalman Filter modeling the relative spacecraft dynamics has been developed. The filter processes single difference GPS pseudorange and carrier phase observations to estimate the relative position and velocity along with empirical accelerations and carrier phase ambiguities. In parallel, double difference carrier phase ambiguities are resolved on both frequencies using the least square ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA) method in order to fully exploit the inherent measurement accuracy. The combination of reduced dynamic filtering with the LAMBDA method results in smooth relative position estimates as well as fast and reliable ambiguity resolution. The proposed method has been validated with data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) mission. For an 11 -day data arc, the resulting solution matches the GRACE K-Band Ranging System measurements with an accuracy of 1 mm, whereby 83 % of the double difference ambiguities are resolved...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} number of GNSS applications uses {{and will continue to}} use single-frequency GNSS receivers. Therefore the precise estimation of the ionospheric range error from single-frequency GNSS data is and remains to be an important issue. We describe a method which allows to autonomously determine the ionospheric range error using single-frequency GNSS data of a single GNSS receiver. The main idea is not to consider each receiver-satellite link individually, but to use all information present in each epoch and between epochs. For the ionospheric range error there is a non-zero correlation, both between different links at a given time and between links at different times. By taking into account all these correlations, we are able to determine the (absolute) ionospheric range error from single-frequency phase and code measurements only. Since the dispersive ionospheric delays affect phase and code measurements with opposite sign, it is possible to extract <b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> range errors by forming the difference of code and phase measurements. Besides the (double) ionospheric range error, this difference contains the code and phase multipath noise, the instrumentation offsets, and the phase ambiguity. In order to suppress the dominant noise contribution, the code multipath noise, we use a Hatch-type filtering with a suitably chosen time constant. Note that there is a new phase ambiguity for each data arc, i. e., a continuous range of receiver-satellite measurements. Hence, we have to determine one new constant for each new data arc in order to calibrate the <b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> range errors obtained from the filtered difference of phase and code observables. We have developed a model-assisted TEC calibration and reconstruction technique, using a simple polynomial model of the ionosphere, which approximates the ionosphere {{in the vicinity of the}} GNSS receiver by a single layer in a local, sun-fixed coordinate system. This technique is capable of calibrating the <b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> range errors in near-realtime by using a Kalman-filter-type weighted-least-squares algorithm with a priori knowledge; the input measurement errors are determined from the Hatch-type filtering, while the initial model covariances may be determined, e. g., by the start-up weighted-least-squares solution. Without using any additional information the warm-up phase is found to be at least one hour. However, it is possible to shorten the warm-up phase by using, e. g., Klobuchar-model derived vertical TEC values as initial information. After the start-up phase, new model and ambiguity estimates are computed every couple of minutes by using both, the new measurements and the last model coefficients to update the model. Along with the model coefficients describing the variation of vertical TEC around the receiver we obtain further statistical information, e. g., the relative chi 2 value of the fit which is a measure of how good the model Ansatz is consistent with the measured data, given the measurement errors and model covariances. By monitoring the chi 2 value, deficiencies in data preprocessing (cycle slips) and, more importantly, extreme ionospheric perturbations can be detected. The comparison of vertical TEC derived from single-station single-frequency data obtained by the proposed method with TEC values obtained from European TEC maps under near-solar-minimum conditions shows a good agreement. This is encouraging, taking into account that we compare TEC valued determined from a single station using single-frequency GNSS data with TEC maps which are produced using dual-frequency phase and code GNSS data from a network of 20 - 30 GNSS receivers. Since the algorithm is able to calibrate ionospheric range errors containing different phase ambiguities for each arc, we have applied the algorithm to the reconstruction of vertical TEC from dual-frequency phase-only GNSS data. Here, the relative chi 2 values are quite high, signaling that the simple single-layer polynomial ionospheric model cannot fully describe the ionospheric information contained in the low-(multipath-) noise GNSS phase observables Nevertheless, calibrated TEC can be obtained with this method. A possible continuation along the lines of this route would be to consider more elaborated ionospheric models, possibly transcending the single-layer approximation. We anticipate that the algorithm will work under other geophysical conditions, too, e. g., low-latitudes and/or high solar activity. The calibrated ionospheric range errors may be used in single-frequency point positioning. We compare the performance of our locally valid, near-real-time ionospheric corrections with the Klobuchar model, whose model coefficients are determined in intervals of days and are valid globally. The proposed algorithm is capable to derive calibrated ionospheric range errors from single-frequency GNSS data. In addition, a model describing the ionosphere in the vicinity of the receiver is provided, along with various statistical quantities. In the context of single-frequency point positioning, e. g. using low-cost GNSS receivers in quasi-static setups, this method is anticipated to provide autonomously determined, near-real-time ionospheric corrections comparable or better than the Klobuchar model. In (civil) aeronautical GBAS systems, which due to certification issues will continue to be restricted to use single-frequency GNSS equipment for some time, this method allows to detect ionospheric perturbations, including ionospheric gradient information, providing the necessary information for sigma monitors...|$|R
40|$|Many {{large-scale}} GNSS CORS {{networks have}} been deployed {{around the world to}} support various commercial and scientific applications. To make use of these networks for real-time kinematic positioning services, one of the major challenges is the ambiguity resolution (AR) over long inter-station baselines in the presence of considerable atmosphere biases. Usually, the widelane ambiguities are fixed first, followed by the procedure of determination of the narrowlane ambiguity integers based on the ionosphere-free model in which the widelane integers are introduced as known quantities. This paper seeks to improve the AR performance over long baseline through efficient procedures for improved float solutions and ambiguity fixing. The contribution is threefold: (1) instead of using the ionosphere-free measurements, the absolute and/or <b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> constraints are introduced in the ionosphere-constrained model to enhance the model strength, thus resulting in the better float solutions; (2) the realistic widelane ambiguity precision is estimated by capturing the multipath effects due to the observation complexity, leading to improvement of reliability of widelane AR; (3) for the narrowlane AR, the partial AR for a subset of ambiguities selected according to the successively increased elevation is applied. For fixing the scalar ambiguity, an error probability controllable rounding method is proposed. The established ionosphere-constrained model can be efficiently solved based on the sequential Kalman filter. It can be either reduced to some special models simply by adjusting the variances of ionospheric constraints, or extended with more parameters and constraints. The presented methodology is tested over seven baselines of around 100 km from USA CORS network. The results show that the new widelane AR scheme can obtain the 99. 4...|$|R
40|$|The Jovian ionosphere-magnetosphere {{coupling}} {{model of}} Hill (1979) was modified {{to include the}} rotational slippage of the neutral atmosphere at <b>ionospheric</b> heights, <b>relative</b> to a frame of reference corotating rigidly with Jupiter. Equations were derived for the altitude distributions of ionospheric neutral and ion velocities, and a generalized expression was obtained for the corotation lag of the magnetosphere. The results of calculations provide independent support for the expectation that vertical mixing in Jupiter's atmosphere is much more vigorous at high latitudes than near the equator. They also indicate that the observed corotation lag in the magnetosphere and the Io torus is largely attributable to the slippage of the neutral atmosphere itself, {{rather than to the}} slippage of <b>ionospheric</b> ions <b>relative</b> to <b>ionospheric</b> neutrons, as previously suggested...|$|R
40|$|Technology, Germany, {{where he}} works {{in the field of}} precise GPS applications. In order to use fast static or {{real-time}} kinematic (RTK) cm-accurate positioning over larger distances, active GPS reference receiver networks have been established in parts of Germany with station distances of 30 to 50 km. Within these networks, the distance dependent error sources, like ionospheric and tropospheric refraction and broadcast orbit errors, are modelled satellite-by-satellite and with high temporal resolution. This procedure leads to the concept of virtual reference stations whose observations are computed from the data of the surrounding real reference stations and which are located at the user’s approximate position. The modelling algorithm for distance dependent errors in GPS-networks assumes that these errors can be linearly interpolated, i. e. that their spatial wavelength is much larger than the distances between reference stations. This, however, is not the case for Medium-Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs), which have horizontal wavelengths of 100 to several hundred km. Whereas the number of observed MSTIDs over Europe was small in the solar minimum years (1994 - 1998), the situation dramatically changed with the commencement of the MSTID winter season 1998 - 1999. From October 1998 to March 1999 their occurrence produced adverse effects on classical baseline positioning and also on the quality of virtual reference stations. Proc. ION GPS 99, Nashville TN, 1419 - 1427 1419 It is found that even in the presence of MSTIDs most of the <b>relative</b> <b>ionospheric</b> errors can be modelled and corrected for in regional GPS reference networks. Nevertheless some ionospheric effects remain in the short baseline between virtual reference station and rover receiver. Ambiguity resolution and coordinate estimation of this baseline have to take these ionospheric effects into account. ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} several cases of magnetosphere compression by solar wind pressure pulses using {{a set of}} instruments located in the noon sector of auroral zone. We {{have found that the}} increase in riometric absorption (sudden commencement absorption, SCA) occurred simultaneously with the beginning of negative or positive magnetic variations and broadband enhancement of magnetic activity in the frequency range above 0. 1 Hz. Since magnetic variations were observed before the step-like increase of magnetic field at equatorial station (main impulse, MI), the negative declinations resembled the so-called preliminary impulse, PI. In this paper a mechanism for the generation of PI is introduced whereby PI's generation is linked to SCA – associated precipitation and the local enhancement of ionospheric conductivity leading to the reconstruction of the ionospheric current system prior to MI. Calculation showed that PI polarity depends on orientation of the background electric field and location of the observation point <b>relative</b> to <b>ionospheric</b> irregularity. For one case of direct measurements of electric field in the place where the ionospheric irregularity was present, the sign of calculated disturbance corresponded to the observed one. High-resolution measurements on IRIS facility and meridional chain of the induction magnetometers are utilized for the accurate timing of the impact of solar wind irregularity on the magnetopause...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} in vivo the changes of the human lens autofluorescence (AF) with aging and cataractogenesis. Measurements were performed in the blue-green AF range (495 nm/ 520 nm) using a fluorometer designed, built and now clinically tested in our department. 43 random eyes of 43 healthy volunteers aged 6 - 86 years, five of each decade, were studied for effects of aging and 84 eyes of 84 patients with cortical, nuclear, posterior subcapsular or mixed lens opacities were studied for differences of various cataract types. The results were compared with the back light scatter values obtained by the commercially available Interzeag Lens <b>Opacity</b> <b>Meter</b> 701. Also AF and back light scatter of the lens were measured from 122 smoking males aged 57 to 76 years who participated in a cancer prevention study. The results were compared with the widely used subjective lens opacities classification system, LOCS III. In addition data was collected from 30 randomly chosen eyes of as many subjects {{with varying degrees of}} yellow-brown lens coloration in an otherwise healthy eye. We studied the influence of lens yellowing expressed by means of lens AF on visibility of retinal nerve fiber layer in black-and-white images. Lens AF profile consists of anterior and posterior peaks and a central plateau. The height of the anterior peak was used as a measure of the maximum AF value. The square root of the ratio between the posterior and the anterior AF peaks was used for estimating the lens transmission. Our technique was highly reproducible. The coefficient of variation was 3. 9 % for maximum AF and 2. 9 % for the lens transmission index. Both the maximum AF and light scatter were exponentially increased with age (r = 0. 95 and 0. 94, respectively; p < 0. 0001). According to the regression line of AF begins to increase in early childhood. It appears by extrapolation to be absent at birth. In contrast light scatter in the lens was present even in young children. The lens transmission for blue-green light, determined from the lens AF curve, was almost unchanging with age up to 60 years. Thereafter it decreased rapidly and the interindividual variation increased. In cataractous lenses the mean AF and scatter values differed statistically significantly from those of age matched healthy controls. The highest AF values were measured in nuclear cataracts where AF was also related to visual acuity and an increasing yellow-brown colour of the nucleus. About half of the total variation of the transmission index values could be accounted for by changes in nuclear colour as assessed by the LOCS III grading system. The transmission index provided a more precise prediction about nuclear colour and opalescence than age or light scatter did. In cortical cataracts the AF curve was low and flattened and the maximum AF value was significantly lower than in the age matched control eyes. The highest light scatter values were measured from cortical cataracts, but the correlation between LOCS III cortical grades and light scatter values was rather weak. Posterior subcapsular cataracts cannot be quantified either with AF or with light scatter measurements. Lens yellowing, expressed as lens AF, had an actual effect on retinal nerve fiber layer visibility. AF measurements provided a better prediction about the visibility score than age or visual acuity did. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that the lens autofluorescence measurement may be a useful additional tool together with a subjective grading system in the follow-up of optical changes occurring in the nuclear region of the lens...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of 20 -second {{resolution}} magnetometer {{data from}} {{an array of}} temporary stations operated around Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland, {{during the summer of}} 1986 shows the signatures of localized ionospheric traveling convection vortices. An example of an isolated event of this kind observed near 08 local time is presented in detail. This event consists of a twin vortex pattern of convection consistent with the presence of two field-aligned current filaments separated by about 600 km in the east-west direction. This system of currents is observed to move westward (tailward) past the array of stations at about 4 km/sec. The event is associated with <b>relative</b> quiet time <b>ionospheric</b> convection and occurs during an interval of northward IMF. It is, however, associated with a large fluctuation in both the Z and Y components of the IMF and with a large sudden decrease in the solar wind number density. The propagation of the system is inconsistent with existing models of FTE current systems, but nevertheless appears to be related to a readjustment of the magnetopause boundary to a sudden change in the solar wind dynamic pressure and/or to a change in reconnection brought about by a sudden reorientation of the IMF...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuum}} oscillation of a latitudinal {{range of}} closed geomagnetic field lines or shells {{appears to be}} a basic feature of the magnetosphere. Such oscillations are observed at the ground, and have been termed transient ULF pulsations. Earlier modelling showed that the apparent mean damping rate at the ground should be much greater than that in the magnetosphere. This modelling is extended to examine the time dependence of the magnetic field of transient pulsations as seen by a latitudinal chain of magnetometers. It is found that there should be significant temporal variation of both period and damping decrement observed at a given latitude, which could help to identify transient events even when the period variation with latitude is not obvious. Time-frequency analysis and analytical signal analysis {{do not seem to be}} effective in determining temporal parameter variation for the short, highly damped data segments typical of transient events. Least squares fitting of two decaying sinusoids gives surprisingly good results, but seems to have no physical basis, is difficult to interpret, and may be misleading. Least squares fitting of a single sinusoid with time-varying period and damping rate gives reasonably good fits. The resulting parameter variations with latitude may help to determine the structures of ionospheric current systems associated with transient ULF events. In particular, the time change of the period at a single station can determine where that station is <b>relative</b> to the <b>ionospheric</b> current maximum...|$|R
