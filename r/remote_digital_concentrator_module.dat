40|$|The paper {{describes}} a proposed qualification standard for photovoltaic <b>concentrator</b> <b>modules.</b> The standard's {{purpose is to}} provide stress tests and procedures to identify any component weakness in photovoltaic <b>concentrator</b> <b>modules</b> intended for power generation applications. If no weaknesses are identified during qualification, both the manufacturer and the customer can expect a more reliable product. The qualification test program for the standard includes thermal cycles, humidity-freeze cycles, water spray, off-axis beam damage, hail impact, hot-spot endurance, as well as electrical tests for performance, ground continuity, isolation, wet insulation resistance, and bypass diodes. Because <b>concentrator</b> <b>module</b> performance can not be verified using solar simulator and reference cell procedures suitable for flat-plate modules, the standard specifies an outdoor I-V test analysis allowing a performance comparison before and after a test procedure.

40|$|Results of a {{study to}} {{determine}} the hot-spot susceptibility of concentrator cells, to provide a hot-spot qualification test for <b>concentrator</b> <b>modules,</b> and to provide guidelines for reducing hot-spot susceptibility are presented. Hot-spot heating occurs in a photovoltaic module when the short-circuit current of a cell {{is lower than the}} string operating current forcing the cell into reverse bias with a concurrent power dissipation. Although the basis for the <b>concentrator</b> <b>module</b> hot-spot qualification test is the test developed for flat-plate modules, issues, such as providing cell illumination, introduce additional complexities into the testing procedure. The same general guidelines apply for protecting <b>concentrator</b> <b>modules</b> from hot-spot stressing as apply to flat-plate modules. Therefore, recommendations are made on the number of bypass diodes required per given number of series cells per module or source circuit. In addition, a new method for determining the cell temperature in the laboratory or in the field is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1. Grid-connected {{photovoltaic}} concentrator system schematic. Photovoltaic concentrator systems use optical concentrators {{to focus}} direct sunlight onto solar cells for conversion to electricity. Figure 1 shows a PV concentrator system {{connected to a}} utility grid that eventually provides power to customers. The complete system includes <b>concentrator</b> <b>modules,</b> support and tracking structures, a power processing center, and land. PV <b>concentrator</b> <b>module</b> components include solar cells, an electrically isolating and thermally conducting housing for mounting and interconnecting the cells, and optical concentrators. The solar cells in today’s concentrators are predominantly silicon, although gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cells {{may be used in}} the future because of their high-conversion efficiencies. The housing places the solar cells at the focus of the optical concentrator elements and provides means for dissipating excess heat generated in the solar cells. The optical concentrators are generally Fresnel lenses but can also be reflectors. Except for low concentrations, below about 10 suns, optical concentrators can use only the direct normal, non-diffuse, portion of the incident solar radiation. The modules are mounted on a support structure and, during daylight hours, are oriented to face (or “track”) the sun using motors, gears, and a controller. Tracking the sun is necessary for high concentration (above approximately 10 “suns ” or 10 x) and increases the amount of energy captured daily, more than compensating for the losses due to inability to convert diffuse radiation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, development, fabrication, and {{test of a}} high performance, high voltage solar concentrator array. This assembly {{is believed to be}} the first ever terrestrial triple-junction-cell solar array rated at over 1 kW. The concentrator provides over 200 W/square meter power output at a nominal 600 Vdc while operating under terrestrial sunlight. Space-quality materials and fabrication techniques were used for the array, and the 3005 meter elevation installation below the Tropic of Cancer allowed testing as close as possible to space deployment without an actual launch. The array includes two <b>concentrator</b> <b>modules,</b> each with a 3 square meter aperture area. Each <b>concentrator</b> <b>module</b> uses a linear Fresnel lens to focus sunlight onto a photovoltaic receiver that uses 240 series-connected triple-junction solar cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use {{of static}} <b>concentrator</b> <b>modules</b> is an {{approach}} {{to reduce the cost}} of PV systems. Nevertheless, remarkable cost reductions and good performance of the PV system depend on the optimization of the concentrator. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the optimization of the static <b>concentrator</b> <b>module</b> PEC- 44 D for stand-alone systems in Brazil. This device consists of bifacial cells and of a linear asymmetrical optical system, shaped by part of a parabola, circle and ellipse. The tool used to achieve this goal was a computer program to simulate a ten year period of a stand-alone system. The results are the upper and lower acceptance angles as well as the slope of the concentrator that lead to the lowest cost of the PV array. The method was applied to optimize the PEC- 44 D module for 27 Brazilian cities. We concluded that the upper acceptance angle should be 90 o and the lower acceptance angle decreases with the increase of latitude. Based on these results, three different devices were selected as a function of lower acceptance angle and latitude. The comparison of the selected modules with the optimum design for each location results in an increase of the PV-array cost of only 2 %...|$|R
