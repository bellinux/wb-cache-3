2500|$|Coaster-brake {{bicycles}} {{are generally}} {{equipped with a}} single cog and chain wheel and often use ⅛ in (3.2mm) wide chain. [...] However, {{there have been several}} models of coaster brake hubs with dérailleurs, such as the Sachs 2x3. These use special extra-short dérailleurs which can stand up to the forces of being straightened out frequently and do not require an excessive amount of <b>reverse</b> <b>pedal</b> rotation before the brake engages. Coaster brakes have also been incorporated into hub gear designs - for example the AWC and SRC3 from Sturmey-Archer, and the Shimano Nexus 3-speed. They can have up to eight gears, like the Nexus inter-8.|$|E
50|$|The car used a single-cylinder engine, and {{was based}} on the curved dash Oldsmobile An unusual feature was the lack of brakes on the wheels. To stop the car, the driver used the <b>reverse</b> <b>pedal</b> of the {{epicyclic}} transmission.|$|E
50|$|The PCGamerBike {{appeared}} at CES in 2007 where it received an Honoree Award. It differs from other exergaming devices in that its pedal motion can be mapped to any key on the keyboard. It {{also has an}} optical encoder which detects forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>pedal</b> motion. The Fisher-Price Smart Cycle was another entry in the field.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: In the Ford Model T, {{the pedals}} control the two forward gears (left <b>pedal),</b> <b>reverse</b> (center <b>pedal),</b> and the brake (right pedal). The steering-column levers control {{ignition}} timing (left) and the throttle (right). The large hand-levers set the rear-wheel parking brake {{and put the}} transmission in neutral (left) and control an after-market 2-speed transmission adapter (right).|$|R
5000|$|Changes for the 1994 model {{comprise}} a new shift drum to improve notchy gear shifts. The second-generation CB900RR, which debuted in 1995, incorporated changes in damping rates and spring rates. The front fork was upgraded with a compression adjuster. The upper cowl stay went from steel to aluminum, and the {{cylinder head cover}} went from aluminum to magnesium. The styling of the bike also became more aggressive: The independent dual lights became irregular-shaped multi-reflector lights known as [...] "fox eyes" [...] and the bike had fewer of the RR's unique fairing holes. The foot pegs were firmer and slimmer {{like that of the}} RC45 and the <b>reversed</b> <b>pedal</b> on the original was replaced with a shift linkage. Instead of measuring speed from the front wheel the speed is measured from the countershaft sprocket with an electronic speedometer.|$|R
50|$|In the {{single-chain}} system, {{the chain}} {{runs from the}} top of a chainring attached to the cranks {{to the top of a}} sprocket attached to the rear wheel hub with a freewheel, as with most bicycle chain drives. The chain then, usually, wraps around the rear sprocket to an idler sprocket between the rear wheel and the cranks, then runs back to a second sprocket attached to the rear wheel with a second freewheel, and finally returns to the bottom of the chain ring. Other configurations are possible, including one chain for forward pedalling, and a second crossed-chain configuration for <b>reverse</b> <b>pedalling.</b> Only one freewheel is engaged at a time, while the other spins backward freely. Since the chain wraps around the second sprocket in the opposite direction to the first sprocket, the cyclist needs only to pedal backwards to engage it. The small amount of out-of-line required of the chain is easily accommodated. The rear wheel cannot rotate backwards because the two freewheels try to drive the pedals forward and backward at the same time.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: In the Ford Model T the left-side {{hand lever}} sets {{the rear wheel}} parking brakes and puts the {{transmission}} in neutral. The lever to the right controls the throttle. The lever on {{the left of the}} steering column is for ignition timing. The left foot pedal changes the two forward gears while the centre <b>pedal</b> controls <b>reverse.</b> The right <b>pedal</b> is the brake.|$|R
25|$|The first 800 {{units were}} sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in <b>reverse</b> with a <b>pedal</b> between the clutch and brake pedals. The middle pedal {{was used to}} engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal {{operated}} the transmission brake – there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the parking brake, which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.|$|R
5000|$|Reverse: The car reverses as in an {{automatic}} car. To <b>reverse,</b> depress brake <b>pedal,</b> {{and change the}} gear to R. Gradually lift off the brake pedal to allow the car to creep backwards. On a down-sloping incline, the creep function, simulated using the slipping clutch, {{is not sufficient to}} prevent the car from rolling forward. In this case, the car must not be held still using the accelerator pedal, as the excessive clutch slipping will lead to clutch damage. Handbrake should be instead applied, and the accelerator pedal should be depress slightly.|$|R
5000|$|Allora & Calzadilla's body of {{work has}} long {{explored}} the dynamic between music and power. Some of the pieces that trace this [...] "age-old sonic militarism against the contours of its relationship to contemporary culture and political ideology" [...] are Clamor (2006), Sediments, Sentiments (Figures of Speech) (2007), Wake Up (2007) and Stop, Repair, Prepare: Variations on Ode to Joy for a Prepared Piano (2008). The first three feature [...] "massive sculptural installation, live performance, collaboration, and, of course, extensive sound tracks." [...] Stop, Repair, Prepare is a complex hybrid of sculpture, performance and experimental musical practice. It consists of an early 20th century Bechstein piano that has been put up on wheels and ‘prepared’ by cutting a round hole {{in the center of}} the body and <b>reversing</b> the <b>pedals,</b> which allows a series of performers to play variations on the Ode to Joy (as transcribed for piano by Franz Liszt) from inside of the instrument. During the performance, the pianist, girdled by the absurd skirt of the instrument, periodically trudges with it through the performance space, dragging its weight as he or she plays.|$|R
40|$|A small pedal-powered {{machine that}} can treat {{a wide variety}} of seeds has been {{developed}} by ICI. Batches of up to 10 kg can be treated in just a few minutes. The machine consists of a drum that replaces the handle bars of a bicycle. Inside the drum is a rotating disc that is driven from the pedals. Seed is then placed in the drum, the dressing added, and the disc rotated for ten seconds. The spinning action folds the dressing into the seed and coats each grain far more thoroughly than manual mixing. <b>Reversing</b> the <b>pedals</b> discharges the treated seed through a side chute in just a few seconds. All types of seed can be treated, except cotton seed which has not been de-limed. Two machines are now being tested in Kenya and Ethiopia. ICI expect that machines will be owned by cooperatives, where menbers can treat their own seed in a very short time. There is no reason why the same machine could not be used to treat fo,od grains with suitable protectants before they are put into store.
