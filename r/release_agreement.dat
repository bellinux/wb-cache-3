25|$|By 1975, Jimmy Hoffa was {{planning}} to seize {{the presidency of the}} Teamsters again. Hoffa had been released from prison on December 23, 1971, when President Richard Nixon commuted his sentence to time served. According to the United States Department of Justice and White House officials, Hoffa's release was granted on the condition that he not participate directly or indirectly in union activities until 1980. But Hoffa contended that he had never agreed to any such condition, and unsuccessfully sued to have the restriction overturned. But Fitzsimmons supported the government's position, and Charles Colson, special counsel to President Nixon who helped negotiate Hoffa's release, backed Fitzsimmon's interpretation of the <b>release</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

50|$|Any {{unpaid balance}} owed to {{creditors}} above the pay off they receive at short sale {{is known as}} a deficiency.

In those states allowing deficiency judgments after short sale, it is imperative that the Short Sale Agreement between the borrower and the lien holders include a clear deficiency <b>release</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} if there were significant associations between selected student demographic characteristics and the mean student ratings of teachers in the Lincoln County Wyoming School District. A major goal was to assist teachers in understanding the relationship, if any, between mean student ratings of teachers and the student demographic profiles of teacher classrooms. The selected student demographic characteristics studied included; student gender, special education designation, honor roll status, low socioeconomic status and average class attenDance;;The student demographic characteristics and the student rating of teacher data were collected in the spring of 1996. Teacher and student data were coded to protect individual information in accordance with the Iowa State University Human Subjects <b>Release</b> <b>agreement.</b> The achievement data were converted to standardized scores to allow comparisons across grades, classrooms and course examinations. Statistical tests were used to analyze the student demographic data and the student ratings of teachers to ensure that variability existed between classrooms and teachers. Statistical tests were then run on each selected student demographic characteristic to determine if there were significant associations with student ratings of teachers. Finally a statistical regression was performed to determine if any associations existed between groups of demographic characteristics and the student ratings of teachers. This study found no significant associations between student ratings of teachers and selected student demographic characteristics in the Lincoln County Wyoming School District;Teachers and administrators should not be concerned about possible associations between gender mix, included special education students, low socioeconomic status students, the average number absences in their classes and the mean student rating of teachers. Variations in student ratings of teachers should not be attributed to unusual distributions of the five student demographic characteristics analyzed in this study. This study has illustrated the value of confronting myths and misconceptions about student demographic characteristics and their possible association with student ratings of teachers. The statistical measures used in this study did not confirm the assumptions of popular, opinion-based literature...|$|E
40|$|Self-harm is {{prevalent}} in prison populations {{and is a}} well-established risk factor for suicide. Researchers typically rely on self-report to measure self-harm, yet the accuracy and predictive value of self-report in prison populations is unclear. Using a large, representative sample of incarcerated men and women, we aimed to examine the level of agreement between self-reported self-harm history and historical medical records, and investigate the association between self-harm history and medically verified self-harm after release from prison. During confidential interviews with 1315 adults conducted within 6 weeks of expected release from 1 of 7 prisons in Queensland, Australia, participants were asked about the occurrence of lifetime self-harm. Responses were compared with prison medical records and linked both retrospectively and prospectively with ambulance, emergency department and hospital records to identify instances of medically verified self-harm. Follow-up interviews roughly 1, 3 and 6 months after release covered the same domains assessed in the baseline interview as well as self-reported criminal activity and contact with health care, social and criminal justice services since <b>release.</b> <b>Agreement</b> between self-reported and medically verified history of self-harm was poor, with 64 (37. 6 %) of 170 participants {{with a history of}} medically verified self-harm disclosing a history of self-harm at baseline. Participants with a medically verified history of self-harm were more likely than other participants to self-harm during the follow-up period. Compared to the unconfirmed-negative group, the true-positive (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 6. 2 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 3 - 10. 4]), false-negative (adjusted HR 4. 0 [95 % CI 2. 2 - 6. 7]) and unconfirmed-positive (adjusted HR 2. 2 [95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 9]) groups were at increased risk for self-harm after release from prison. Self-reported history of self-harm should not be considered a sensitive indicator of prior self-harm or of future self-harm risk in incarcerated adults. To identify those who should be targeted for preventive strategies, triangulation of data from multiple verifiable sources should be performed whenever possible...|$|E

[...] School of Education. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 This study explores {{the perceptions of}} underachieving African American male students about their schooling experiences and their relationships with teachers. Using narrative analysis, portraiture, and heuristic inquiry, data were collected to examine whether factors exist that circumvent relationship building between African American male students and their teachers and have some bearing on learning. Data collection included interviews of six African American male students, analysis of documents such as their grades and discipline referrals, and classroom observations of them. These six African American male students were questioned about their schooling experiences, their perceptions of relationships developed with teachers, and how those relationships influenced the way they feel about themselves. Overall, the panelists had positive feelings about school. They realized schooling was an essential element for their success in life. The panelists sought affirmation by their teachers and wanted their teachers to care about {{them as well as}} their schoolwork. The students enjoyed attending classes where positive relationships existed with teachers. In those classes, the students were recognized and had a sense of purpose. Panelists did not necessarily do all assignments in classes where positive relationships existed, but they felt they were learning. Often, they submitted assignments all at once in order to make up grades. When attending classes where negative relationships prevailed, the students would often sabotage their own learning in order to misbehave and give back the pain they believed they received from the teachers. Panelists determined {{whether or not they were}} successful in school based largely on whether they were sent out of class or out of school, not on their learning. The use of learning as a measure was second. This was largely because for schools, in many cases, the adherence to rules outweighed learning. Even though some rules may have been trivial, their disregard was deemed large enough to have panelists removed from the learning environment or inhibit learning in some manner. This research did not offer remedies for the panelists; however, they were able to reflect and identify actions they could perform or not perform that would increase their chances of remaining in class to learnIntroduction [...] Literature review [...] Methodology [...] They let me enter their world: findings and discussion [...] Conclusion [...] Appendix A.

She received considerable support, sometimes financial, from Helen Phillips Levin (herself paraplegic, and an MSW from USC) in her various activities in the community aimed at improving conditions and acceptance of individuals with disabilities. Mrs. Kailes worked for several years, becoming director of the Westside Center for Independent Living, where the interviewer {{was a member of}} the board of directors. After seven years, dissatisfied with having to concentrate on administrative and fundraising tasks rather than working directly with people confronting their disabilities, Mrs. Kailes left the agency to become a private disability consultant. She consults with agencies around the country, with firms seeking ways to deal with disability needs, and with individuals.
