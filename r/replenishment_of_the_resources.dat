40|$|This paper uses an {{economic}} framework to investigate <b>the</b> depletion <b>of</b> heavy metal absorption capacity <b>of</b> soil. Specifically, <b>the</b> Hotelling model for <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> exhaustible <b>resources</b> across time {{is applied to}} Cadium deposition onto agricultural soil in the Rhine basin. The Hotelling model requires a knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> {{as well as the}} demand function for <b>the</b> <b>resource.</b> <b>The</b> <b>resource</b> <b>of</b> absorption capacity is limited because above a certain Cd concentration in soil agriculture is not allowed; accumulation of Cd above this maximum acceptable soil concentration is not allowed. The demand function for absorption capacity corresponds to <b>the</b> cost function <b>of</b> avoiding deposition of heavy metals. According to the Hotelling model calculations, 0. 2 DM should be spent to avoid <b>the</b> deposition <b>of</b> 1 kg Cd at a discount rate of 5 % and 600 DM at 1 %. <b>The</b> optimal level <b>of</b> Cd control expenditure increases at the discount rate. The paper also presents a modified Hotelling model that takes <b>the</b> <b>replenishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> by removal <b>of</b> heavy metals from the soil (leaching and plant uptake) into account. Using a simple donor-controlled outflow model of Cd behavior in soil and a residence time <b>of</b> 1000 years, <b>the</b> optimal initial expenditure level for Cd control in the Rhine basin is determined to be 0. 0006 DM/kg (3 % discount rate). For the Katowice district, the optimal level is 20 DM/kg. A net input <b>of</b> Cd into <b>the</b> soil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhine basin is allowed for 400 years in the Rhine basin and for 200 years in Katowice. This paper finds the modified Hotelling model to be a useful heuristic for understanding <b>the</b> time dimension <b>of</b> absorption capacity; specific recommendations cannot be derived, however, because they depend on tenuous inputs such as the cost curve for pollution control, the discount rate, and the maximum acceptable soil concentration...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{article is}} a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel “Kunigas” by J.  Kraszewski in line with poetics of intermediality: methods, receptions of creation complete polyartistic space through <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> artistic references. Chosen for art comprehension by the author <b>the</b> era <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages was based on experiments in genre specific <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical novel, a stylistic variety, structuring a material, personsphere and ways of its creation. Research methodology: historical- functional, structural-functional, descriptive (partially). In article <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> “intermedial incorporation” is revealed and analysed: the coexistence in <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novelist <b>of</b> multi-style signs assumes their incorporation and different manifestations at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text that first of all it is peculiar to portrait and landscape elements. <b>Replenishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> portrait <b>resource</b> which has been set in the first portrait, is going on throughout all narration. <b>The</b> talent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painter Krashevsky is shown and in landscape pictures. “Sculpturnost” is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main features <b>of</b> his portraits of people and images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flora world. In the historical novel {{it is especially important}} to convey colouring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remote past in architectural preferences, suits, customs, the ritual sphere and sphere of morals and manners, etc. The novel shows Litvins' life inseparably linked with folk art. The songs captured centuries-old experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, <b>the</b> moods <b>of</b> today projected to <b>the</b> past <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region. Songs in the novel serve as <b>the</b> comment <b>of</b> what is happening or what happened and also precede events. J.  Kraszewski's main creative task consisted in creating artistically convincing picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval era with historical events, persons who have played an important role at <b>the</b> moments <b>of</b> a historical choice, who find <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> authenticity, due to colour of an era, transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> visual, spatial, sound and other characteristics in the narration allows the author to create multidimensional structure...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a government for which success requires high performance by talented ministers. A leader provides incentives to her ministers by firing those who fail.

40|$|International audienceThe {{molecular}} {{mechanisms by}} which aging affects stem cell number and function are poorly understood. Murine data have implicated cellular senescence in <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> muscle stem cells with aging. Here, using human cells and by carrying out experiments within a strictly pre-senescent division count, we demonstrate an impaired capacity for stem cell self-renewal in elderly muscle. We link aging to an increased methylation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPRY 1 gene, a known regulator of muscle stem cell quiescence. <b>Replenishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reserve cell pool was modulated experimentally by demethylation or siRNA knockdown of SPRY 1. We propose that suppression of SPRY 1 by age-associated methylation in humans inhibits <b>the</b> <b>replenishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscle stem cell pool, contributing to a decreased regenerative response in old age. We further show that aging does not affect muscle stem cell senescence in humans...|$|R

30|$|At <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{groundwater}} basin, {{we observe}} that <b>replenishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carbonate mountain aquifer sufficiently compensates withdrawals, while <b>replenishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shallow aquifer {{system in the}} Jordan Valley is limited due to high evaporation and low rainfall rates (less than 250  mm/year). Groundwater flow regimes of both aquifers are eastwards and to the southeast (Dead Sea) direction. From <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain aquifer system, natural springs are channelled for domestic use and irrigation while deep groundwater boreholes with depth range between 400 and 600  m mostly serve Israeli settlers. Water quality in this aquifer is excellent with electrical conductivity of less than 1.5  dS/m (Wolf and Hötzl 2011). The shallow aquifer system consists of alluvial deposits where lateral replenishment {{is limited by the}} few contact zones along the fault system. This aquifer is used mainly by Palestinians for agricultural activities. Overall, recharges are lower than abstraction causing declining water tables and increasing salinity levels reaching 4.5  dS/m (Wolf and Hötzl 2011).|$|R
5000|$|Fresh magma changes <b>the</b> {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melt, changing <b>the</b> chemistry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phases {{which are}} being precipitated. For instance, plagioclase conforms to <b>the</b> liquid line <b>of</b> descent by forming initial anorthite which, if removed, changes the equilibrium mineral composition to oligoclase or albite. <b>Replenishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magma can see this trend reversed, so that more anorthite is precipitated atop cumulate layers of albite.|$|R
