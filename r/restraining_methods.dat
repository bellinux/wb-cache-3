40|$|International audienceInternal {{stresses}} in soils evolve as {{a result}} of the various interactions among soil particles and the pore fluids in response to natural or human-induced activities. Whether attributed to suction, structure, or the various physicochemical forces that may develop, assessing the internal stresses in soils has been an active area of research in soil science and engineering. This paper presents the <b>restrained</b> ring <b>method</b> as an experimental tool for measuring the stresses that develop in a drying soil when it is restrained from shrinking freely. The internal stress that develops can be related to the water content of the soil. This method is validated using results for both silty clay loam and lay loam soils. Tensile stress at failure (estimated from the <b>restrained</b> ring <b>method)</b> was compared to tensile strength ranges of similar soils, and a good correlation was observed.

Its prevalence among hospitalized patients fluctuates between 25 and 60 %. Aim: To assess the prevalence and features of delirium in an intermediate care unit. Patients and methods: All patients admitted to intermediate care unit {{during a period of}} two months were assessed and followed. Delirium was assessed daily during the stay in the unit, using the Inouye Confusion Assessment Method. Delirium was classified as hyperactive if the patient required pharmacological or physical <b>restraining</b> <b>methods.</b> Results: Sixty four patients, 32 female, aged 19 to 90 years old were assessed. Forty one percent had delirium. Of these, delirium started after admission in 46 % and was hyperactive in 35 %. Cognitive disturbances were ascertained by the health care team in 69 % of patients with delirium. Age over 70 years old and a history of dementia were defined as predisposing factors for delirium.

Before being stunned, the broilers were restrained either by shackling them by the feet, restraining their heads while they were standing, or placing them in a cone. Convulsions during and after stunning were subjectively scored. At 1 d post-mortem, the pH, color, and the intensity and number of hemorrhages, of breast and thigh muscles were measured. Convulsions were, in order of increasing intensity, observed after whole-body stunning using 50 Hz, whole-body stunning using 200 Hz, head-only stunning, and captive bolt stunning. No differences in ultimate pH were measured. A consistent difference in color was observed between whole-body and head-only stunning. Head-only stunning resulted in darker and more red (P ≤ 0. 01) breast muscles. Head-only and captive bolt stunning resulted in hemorrhages that were located more distal in the breast muscle than those observed after whole-body stunning.

This includes distributing the goods {{to the right place}} within a certain time window, in a cost-effective way and without potential damage to the vehicle, to the cargo itself or to other road users. An important measure in achieving higher performance and reliability, besides better routing, is safer and more efficient container loading. In order to ensure cargo safety, load units should be prevented from causing high impact forces on other structures in their proximity. Therefore, shifting or tilting of load units during sudden manoeuvres of the vehicle should be avoided or at least highly limited. As the use of additional <b>restraining</b> <b>methods</b> is often costly and time consuming, cargo safety is preferentially inherent to the loading scheme.

The approach presented in this talk consists of a simulated annealing procedure for solving the vehicle routing problem and a GRASP-based heuristic for solving the container loading problem.

GRUBER MARCH 2012 Advisor:	Dr. Gongkang Fu Major:		Civil Engineering Degree:	Doctor or Philosophy The {{prescriptive}} {{design of}} the most widely used residential building code in the United States, the IRC, allows the use of partially restrained wood shear walls to resist wind and seismic loads. Wind load is the most common controlling lateral design load for these structures. In contrast, the complimenting building code, the IBC, requires either a restraining dead load or a mechanical hold down device to resist overturning. To prescribe a safe structure, {{it is important to know}} the effect of partial restraint on the overturning resistance of wood shear walls constructed in accordance with the IRC and equally important whether the partially restrained wood shear walls provide the same level of reliability as fully restrained wood shear walls for wind load. This is the focus of this research. Twenty five Monotonic tests were conducted of 42 ̆ 7 x 82 ̆ 7 wood shear walls with five varying <b>restraining</b> <b>methods</b> (wall types). There were five sets of five wall types. One of the sets had only an anchor bolt, three sets had different dead loads with one anchor bolt, and one set had a mechanical hold down. The results of the test program were used to determine the partial restraint effect, create a nonlinear finite element model, and to determine the statistical data required to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the wall behavior. The Monte Carlo simulation result was used to calibrate a nonlinear partial restraint factor to a target reliability index of 3. 25. The calibration was performed for both ASD and LRFD load combinations as required by the IBC. The research concludes with a closed-form solution, including the calibrated nonlinear partial restraint factor developed, to determine the unit shear capacity of a partially restrained or fully restrained (with dead load or mechanical hold down) wood shear wall constructed in accordance with the IRC by utilizing the fully restrained nominal unit shear values of AF 2 ̆ 6 PA 2 ̆ 7 s Special Design Provisions for Wind and Seismic...|$|E

Mre 11 -Rad 50 is believed to restrain repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) while other repair pathways can operate. Mutants of mre 11 rad 50 cannot utilise this restraining mechanism so HR is believed to solely repair DSBs, leading {{to an increase in}} DNA damage resistance.

The CNT-confined TiO 2 exhibited improved visible-light activity in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) relative to the outside titania and commercial P 25, which is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of TiO 2 induced by the unique confinement inside CNTs. These results provide further insight into the effect of confinement within CNTs, and the composites {{are expected to be}} promising for applications in visible-light photocatalysis. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of Lys- 7 -(dinitrophenylene) -Lys- 41 -cross-linked ribonuclease A {{has been determined}} by molecular replacement and refined by <b>restrained</b> least-squares <b>methods</b> to an R factor of 0. 18 at 2. 0 -A resolution. Diffraction intensity data were collected by using a conventional diffractometer and an x-ray area detector. Comparison of the thermostable cross-linked protein and the native enzyme shows them to be structurally similar, with a rms difference in backbone and side-chain atoms of 0. 52 and 1. 34 A, respectively. Native and modified proteins additionally show 35 common bound solvent sites and similar overall temperature factor behavior, despite localized differences resulting from cross-link introduction, altered crystal pH, or lattice interactions with neighboring molecules. These results {{are discussed in the}} context of proposals on the origins of thermostability in the cross-linked enzyme...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe crystal {{structure}} of carp parvalbumin 4. 25 containing a 1 : 1 molar ratio of ytterbium chloride to protein has been refined at 1. 5 Å resolution by <b>restrained</b> least-squares <b>methods</b> to a crystallographic R value of 0. 199. The {{crystal structure}} confirms the NMR studies, which suggest that low concentrations of ytterbium cause an extensive displacement of calcium from the EF metal binding site. A {{comparison of the}} ytterbium-substituted model with the native and cadmium-substituted structure show no significant differences, except around the substituted EF metal-binding region. The displacement of calcium by ytterbium at the EF site has caused a movement in the polypeptide backbone of Ser- 91 and Asp- 92. This movement resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of oxygen ligands bound to ytterbium in the EF site from seven to eight...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe crystal {{structure}} of cytochrome c 2 from Rhodopseudomonas viridis has been refined using molecular dynamics and <b>restrained</b> least-squares <b>methods</b> to a crystallographic R-factor of 0. 216 at 2. 7 Å resolution. A structural comparison between Rps. viridis cytochrome c 2 {{and the other}} bacterial cytochromes C 2 or mitochondrial cytochromes c indicates that the overall protein foldings {{are very similar to}} each other {{with the exception of the}} surface loop and terminal region of the polypeptide chain. However, the position and hydrogen-bond pattern of the evolutionarily conserved water molecule buried within the heme binding pocket in Rps. viridis cytochrome c 2 are common to those in the mitochondrial cytochromes c. This fact indicates that Rps. viridis cytochrome c 2 is structurally more similar to mitochondrial cytochromes c than to the other bacterial cytochromes c 2...|$|R
40|$|SummaryDynamic {{macromolecular}} assemblies, such as ribosomes, viruses, {{and muscle}} protein complexes, {{are often more}} amenable to visualization by electron microscopy than by high-resolution X-ray crystallography or NMR. When high-resolution structures of component structures are available, {{it is possible to}} build an atomic model that gives information about the molecular interactions at greater detail than the experimental resolution, due to constraints of modeling placed upon the interpretation. There are now several competing computational methods to search systematically for orientations and positions of components that match the experimental image density, and continuing developments will be reviewed. Attention is now also moving toward the related task of optimization, with flexible and/or multifragment models and sometimes with stereochemically <b>restrained</b> refinement <b>methods.</b> This paper will review the various approaches and describe advances in the authors’ methods and applications of real-space refinement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe crystal {{structure}} of an alkaline protease from Bacillus alcahphilus {{has been determined}} by X-ray diffraction at 2. 4 Åresolution. The enzyme crystallizes in space group P 212121, with lattice constants a = 53. 7, b = 61. 6, c = 75. 9 Å. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of subtilisin Carlsberg as search model. Refinement using molecular dynamics and <b>restrained</b> least squares <b>methods</b> results in a crystallographic R-factor of 0. 185.

The detection rate of IHNV from artificially infected rainbow trout (O. mykiss) was also compared by using tissue culture and RT-PCR combined with tissue culture. IHNV-infected salmonid fish were detected highly using RT-PCR combined with tissue culture. This <b>method</b> <b>restrained</b> inhibition of IHNV RNA extraction, because IHNV was replicated in the inoculated cells and inhibition of IHNV RNA extraction was diluted.
