40|$|Active {{ripple current}} {{reduction}} method is proposed for isolated DC/AC dual active bridge (DAB) converter {{to reduce the}} double grid frequency ripple in the DC current. Unlike those active methods that require extra switches to construct separate ripple reduction circuit, in this method, one or two branches of LC <b>ripple</b> <b>steering</b> circuits are used along with existing full bridge switches in a multiplexing manner. For {{the purpose of the}} ripple elimination, unsymmetrical phase shift modulation and duty cycle regulation methods are proposed and applied to both legs of the converter on the primary side of DAB converter. Also a current sharing (CS) scheme is presented to balance the current on both LC <b>ripple</b> <b>steering</b> circuits...|$|E

Device stresses {{are the same}} as for a buck converter, and input current is continuous. A suitable auxiliary network provides zero voltage switching for both power switch and diode. The <b>ripple</b> <b>steering</b> technique was applied {{in order to reduce the}} input current ripple. The converter, suitable for heating and lighting applications, was analyzed and experimentally tested on a 1 kW prototyp...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Through {{the fast}} growing technologies, design of power factor {{correction}} (PFC) circuit is facing several challenges. In this paper, a two-phase interleaved boost converter with <b>ripple</b> <b>steering</b> technique is proposed. Among the various topologies, Interleaved Boost converter (IBC) is considered as superior due to enriched performance, lower ripple content, compact weight and size. A thorough investigation is presented here for the proposed topology. Simulation study for the IBC {{has been carried out}} using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Theoretical analysis and hardware prototype has been performed to validate the results...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the SEPIC {{converter}} {{operated in}} boundary conduction mode for {{power factor correction}} applications with arbitrary output voltage is proposed, analyzed and designed. By developing an equivalent circuit model for the coupled inductor structure, the SEPIC converter with or without coupled inductors (and <b>ripple</b> current <b>steering)</b> can be analyzed and designed in a unified framework. Power factor correction under boundary conduction operation mode can be achieved conveniently using a simple commercially available control IC. Experimental results are provided to validate the circuit design...|$|R
40|$|A new {{ripple current}} {{reduction}} method utilizing a LLC type <b>ripple</b> current <b>steering</b> circuit is proposed {{in this paper}} to significantly reduce 100 Hz ripple current in an isolated DC-AC dual active bridge (DAB) converter. Unlike some of the proposed ripple reduction methods for which auxiliary circuit consists of additional switches is applied, this new method benefits from less switching components and cost while providing effective ripple current reduction performance. In this method, the existing full bridge switches on primary side are used and symmetrical phase shift modulation and duty cycle regulation for both legs are adopted. Control-oriented mathematical analysis and parameter design method for LLC circuit are presented. Due to possible variations in parameters of hardware circuit, current sharing (CS) control method is also provided in this paper to balance the current of the two inductors. Simulation and results are provided to validate the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|The {{control loop}} design {{approach}} from previous Unitrode Seminars {{is used to}} achieve optimized preregulator performance. Techniques for input current sensing and control are discussed-the usual methods don't work with the SEPIC topology. A small-signal model of the SEPIC preregulator is derived, including the coupled inductor used for <b>ripple</b> current <b>steering.</b> Design Example The SEPIC converter topology {{is more complex than}} the simple boost or flyback circuits most often used as high power factor preregulators. According-ly, control loop problems are also more complex. Fortunately, in any high power factor preregulator application, the current loop control design is simplified because there is never a right ha 1 f-plane zero associated with input current control, and because the very low bandwidth voltage control loop required to minimize line current distortion does not contribute to instability problems. The specific control loop design example used in this paper is taken from a separate topic in this Seminar Manual. £l] The power circuit parameters are...|$|R
40|$|Vane {{pumps are}} simple in {{principle}} {{and can be}} mass produced inexpensively, making them well suited to the automotive industry. They also have many other applications, {{such as in the}} chemical industry and food industry. A common type of damage to a vane pump is cavitation erosion on the side plates. If this damage is not detected in time, it could cause failure of the pump, which {{depending on the type of}} system may have safety implications, and in some cases a high cost from lost production whilst the system is shut down. This kind of damage is common on other types of pumps such as gear pumps and piston pumps. So a practical method for fault diagnosis of hydraulic pumps is required which does not necessitate removal of a pump from the working system. This paper presents a method of detecting and identifying cavitation damage on pump side plates via pump flow <b>ripple.</b> Power <b>steering</b> vane pumps are used for this study, although the principles may also be applicable to other types of vane pump, and indeed to piston and gear pumps. The investigation has been done through measurement and simulation. A numerical model of a vane pump is described, and simulated cavitation damage is introduced into the model. This damage is shown to have a clear effect on the simulated flow ripple. The pump flow ripple has also been measured experimentally using the Secondary Source Method, and artificial damage has been introduced into the pump. The damage is shown to have a clear effect on the measured flow ripple, consistent with the simulation results. Whilst the secondary source enables the measurement of flow ripple in laboratory conditions, it is generally impracticable for in-situ measurement for condition monitoring. A simplified method for calculation of pump flow ripple from in-situ pump pressure ripple measurements and system impedance is discussed...|$|R
