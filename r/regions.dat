5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic <b>regions</b> of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms.

Conversely, in the French-speaking <b>regions</b> the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking <b>regions</b> dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.|$|E
