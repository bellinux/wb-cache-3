5000|$|While {{a ground}} laser could track and engage a moving target, an {{airborne}} laser had the added difficulties of vibrations, beam propagation, and pointing a laser from an aerial platform. Development of the Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) became {{the centerpiece of}} AFWL’s laser program in the 1970s. The ALL term was coined in 1972, and the ALL program began with Cycle I testing in 1973 and ended with the completion of Cycle III in September 1983. The ALL was a modified NKC-135, and the 4900th Flight Test Group was formed for aircraft operations. Laboratory testing occurred in the 400 area of Kirtland AFB and initial ground tests in hangar 1001, while the hangar at the Advanced <b>Radiation</b> <b>Test</b> Facility (ARTF) at {{the southeast corner of}} the runway was being constructed. ARTF was used for later ground tests that aimed the APT from the ARTF test pad to a target in the atmosphere in order to calibrate aircraft instruments in preparation for flight tests. Along with the five NKC-135, the 4900th FTG operated a fleet of five F-4Ds, one RF-4C, three NC-135As, five C-130s, and several A-37s, F-100s, and helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|Total {{ionizing}} dose effects: The {{cumulative damage}} of the semiconductor lattice (lattice displacement damage) caused by ionizing radiation over the exposition time. It {{is measured in}} rads and causes slow gradual degradation of the device's performance. A total dose greater than 5000 rads delivered to silicon-based devices in seconds to minutes will cause long-term degradation. In CMOS devices, the radiation creates electron-hole pairs in the gate insulation layers, which cause photocurrents during their recombination, and the holes trapped in the lattice defects in the insulator create a persistent gate biasing and influence the transistors' threshold voltage, making the N-type MOSFET transistors easier and the P-type ones more difficult to switch on. The accumulated charge can be high {{enough to keep the}} transistors permanently open (or closed), leading to device failure. Some self-healing takes place over time, but this effect is not too significant. This effect is the same as hot carrier degradation in high-integration high-speed electronics. Crystal oscillators are somewhat sensitive to radiation doses, which alter their frequency. The sensitivity can be greatly reduced by using swept quartz. Natural quartz crystals are especially sensitive. Radiation performance curves for TID testing may be generated for all resultant effects testing procedures. These curves show performance trends throughout the TID test process and are included in the <b>radiation</b> <b>test</b> report.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / May 18 - 20, 1965 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington DCThe {{advent of}} {{requirements}} for nuclear radiation hardened telemetering components {{is accompanied by}} numerous technological problems.

This paper describes the development of a nuclear radiation hardened telemetry transmitter, designed for operation in the 1435 - 1535 MC/S band at a nominal 100 W average R. F. power. The development phases covered in the paper consist of (1) design and <b>radiation</b> <b>test</b> of three low power transmitter exciters, (2) design and test of three transmitters, including the 100 W power amplifier and circuit modifications as dictated by <b>radiation</b> <b>test,</b> and (3) change in selection of the final R.
