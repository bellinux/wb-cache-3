40|$|The {{determination}} of blood lipase {{has been proposed}} by SEABRA as a method for detecting predisposition to initial or subsequent stages of tuberculosis; normal subjects having high titers (8 - 12 units), tuberculous patients low ones (5 - 7), falling to zero in advanced stages of the disease. An assay of the method has {{been made by the}} AA. in sera of 238 non tuberculous subjects (419 tests) and 207 tuberculous ones (456 tests) following the technical procedures described by SEABRA. All of them had their <b>Roentgenographies</b> taken at the same day of blood collection. Factors interfering with blood lipase values in tuberculosis are discussed. A relationship between the course of the disease and the serum lipase could not be confirmed. High and low values were found in initial as well as in advanced cases. Our results are in agreement with those recorded in the literature (Figs. I and II). It seems that the general condition, rather than pulmonary lesions are responsible for the blood lipase values. There was no direct relationship between blood lipase titer and severity of pulmonary tuberculosis; however the data presented in this paper do not agree with such correlation, stated by SEABRA, FERNANDES and VICENTE...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA {{total of}} 119 {{patients}} {{were included in}} a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial {{in order to assess}} the S/DMOAD properties in OA of chondroitin sulfate (CS 4 & 6, 3 × 400 mg/day, CondrosulfR IBSA, Lugano, CH). Posteranterior <b>roentgenographies</b> of the interphalangeal (IP) joints were carried out {{at the start of the}} study and at yearly intervals. This enabled the investigators to document the radiological progression of the anatomical lesions in the pathological finger joints over a 3 -year period. It was shown that the progression of OA in the IP finger joints in an individual can be determined by the evolution of his finger joints through previously described anatomical phases: ‘N’ (not affected), ‘S’ (classical OA), ‘J’ (loss of joint space), ‘E’ (erosive OA) and ‘R’ (remodeled joint). Structure/disease-modifying anti-OA drug (S/DMOAD) properties were searched for by assaying the number of patients developing OA in previously normal IP joints (‘N’>‘S’), or progressing through the described anatomical phases of the disease (‘S’>‘J’, ‘S’>‘E’, ‘J’>‘E’, ‘S’>‘R’, ‘J’>‘R’, ‘E’>‘R’). In the CS 4 & 6 group we observed a significant decrease in the number of patients with new ‘erosive’ OA finger joints. This result is particularly important since OA of the finger joints becomes a clinical problem (pain, functional loss) when ‘S’ joints progress to ‘J’ and especially ‘E’ phases During and after these ‘E’ phases, joints will remodel and show the nodular deformities characteristic of Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes. Treated patients were protected against erosive evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{vegetative}} nervous drugs upon in t ravenous excretory urograms {{were observed in}} experimental animals, rabbits. In few minutes or {{at the same time}} w ith the injection of contrast media, certain kinds of such drugs were given intramusculary or intravenously. <b>Roentgenographies</b> were undertaken (at 3, 15 and 30 min. thereafter). Immediately after the last one, urine excreted into the bladder during the examination was catheterized in every rabbit for measurements of volume and amount of excreted contrast media. The grades of sharpness, or visibility of urograms were rated in accordance with certain criteria. The cerrelations between the grades of visibility and the conditions of renal excretions of contrast media were analysed stochastically. The various experimental groups were compared on the grades of sharpness of urograms as well as the shapes of pyeloureterograms. For clinical application of such drugs, they were tried for improvement of excretory urograms, and for interpretation of the autonomic nervous conditions of the. urinary tracts. Histological examinations of renal parenchyma of the rabbits were performed to study a possibility of any pathological changes due to the large amount of contrast media given with autonomic nervous. drugs. A series of 154 patients with neurosis were subjected to search complicated urol o gical diseases, especially, urolithiasis. The main points o f the results are as follows : 1) Rating the grades of sharpness of urograms based on accurately defined criteria, it is possible to prove stochastically the correlation between the visibility and the condition of renal excretions of contrast media. 2) It is suggested that ce rtain kinds of autonomic nervous drugs, such as pilocarpine mecholyl and triomin-finalin, are able to imorove the sharpness of excretory pyelograms in rabbits when a sufficient dose of contrast media is given to exceed the maximal tubular secretory capacity(Tm), although the mechanism of them is widely varied according to the sort of drug. 3) A s a rule, visibility of excretory urograms depends on the concentration of excreted contrast media, and therefore, a positive correlative coefficient is calculated between them. However, especially in the upper urinary tracts, the visibility may be influenced more remarkablly by the activity of the ureter, because the value of the coefficient is somew hat too small to be said "strictly significant" On the contrary, if given with diuretic, neophyllin, the visibility is completely dependent upon the excreted amount of contrast media. Hence, a positive, strictly significant coefficient is calculated between them in the neophyllingroups. 4) Comparing the results presented in mecholyl-group and neophyllin-groups, it is assumed that {{there are at least two}} types of mechanism to promote tubular excretion of contrast media, and that it is not always necessary to have innervation of tubular excretion as the mechanism considering on dynamic aspects of biochemistry. 5) The most promising drugs to improve urograms of r abbits are pilocarpine, mecholyl and atropine; however, atropine must be given with neophyllin, and it may distort the shape of pyelogram causing dilatation. 6) Performing pilocarpine- or mechlyl-test simultaneously with I. V. P., correlations between the conditions of the vegetative nerves localized in the urinary tract and of systemic ones are obviously recognized to some extent. But in these cases, organ-specificities are also recognized; namely, when pilocarpine is used both salivary hypersecretion and hypertonic state of the ureters are observed, and when mecholyl is given both salivary hypersecretion and higher concentration of excreted contrast media appear. 7) No neurotic patient subjected here has ever suffered from urolithiasis. However, of course, it is entirely unreasonable to decide that neurotic patients are not apt to urolithiasis, because the number of the patients inquired is too small, and more extensive investigations are necessary. 8) Histological findings of renal parenchyma are almost essentially normal, and there are not found any irreversible changes...|$|R

In this study we investigated the impact of routine postoperative chest <b>roentgenography</b> on treatment instituted in the cardiovascular intensive care unit immediately after heart operations done via median sternotomy. A total of 404 random patients admitted to the cardiovascular intensive care unit underwent clinical (positioning of endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and pulmonary artery catheter) and laboratory (oxygenation) assessment by a cardiovascular intensive care unit physician according to a strict protocol.

Chronic diseases are classified into two separate categories depending on the clinical entity. Comparative analysis of the ultrasound and <b>roentgenography</b> findings was conducted for both, while the status of the maxillary sinuses obtained by sunusoscopy provided the gold standard. Results: Generally speaking, the reliability of the A-mode ultrasonography in diagnosing chronic nonpolypoid diseases in maxillary sinuses was of a somewhat greater degree in comparison to <b>roentgenography,</b> amounting to 72. 15 % in relation to 60. 76 %. There is no statistically significant divergence in relation to the foregoing methods. A-mode ultrasonography is more helpful in the process of identifying liquid contents, and can be less utilized in identifying hypertrophic mucous membrane. Conclusion: Ultrasonography is efficient, economical and quite simple for the implementation. Its chief advantage is to be perceived in the fact that both the patient and the examiner avoid being exposed to ionized radiation.

After reviewing our collected cases of renal tuberculosis (TB), we observed a great diversity in staging and outcomes. The aim {{of this study was to}} classify different imaging presentations and clinical outcomes in the ethnic communities represented by these cases (non-aboriginal and aboriginal). We retrospectively reviewed 22 cases from 1991 to 2001. We reviewed laboratory data, radiologic reports, and clinical outcomes.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} study was {{performed}} to evaluate the accuracy of intravascular ultrasound imaging compared with <b>roentgenography</b> for determining the cross-sectional area of a lumen; and {{to determine if the}} functional significance of an irregular stenosis is predicted more accurately by intravascular ultrasound than <b>roentgenography.</b> Varying degrees of stenosis were made in 17 rubber tubings by adjusting a plastic constrictor. The cross-sectional areas at the normal and the stenotic segments were determined by intravascular ultrasound, <b>roentgenography,</b> and then measured directly from an acrylamide gel cast of the lumen. To evaluate the functional significance of a stenosis, the pressure drop across the stenosis was measured using a fluid pumping circuit. The actual pressure drop was then compared with the predicted pressure drop derived from hydrodynamic equations using cross-sectional areas obtained by intravascular ultrasound or <b>roentgenography.</b> There was an excellent correlation between the cross-sectional areas at the tightest stenosis measured by intravascular ultrasound compared with the area from the acrylamide cast (7. 2 +/- 2. 6 v 6. 6 +/- 2. 4 mm 2, mean +/- SD, r =. 93). Measurements of cross-sectional area from the roentgenograms (10. 9 +/- 3. 9 mm 2) also provided a relatively good correlation with those from the acrylamide casts (r =. 84); however, the roentgenograms consistently overestimated the cross-sectional area of the stenosis.

40|$|Progress {{in the art}} of {{diagnosis}} of pulmonary tuberculosis has paralleled refinements in roentgen diagnosis of pulmonary disease. The advances made in recent years have resulted in widespread extensions of roentgenological service in tuberculosis case-finding, not only in clinics, schools, hospitals, and induction centers for the armed forces, but also in industry. This increased demand for routine chest roentgenograms has and will continue to demonstrate many pulmonary lesions in an earlier stage of their life history. Many of the characteristic roentgen signs that simplify recognition and denote or suggest the etiologic diagnosis are lacking in the early lesions. The particular problem in thoracic roentgenology has always been the obscuring densities of the bony thorax and the thoracic viscera which prevent clear visualization of small pathological lesions. Stereoscopy is often valuable, but is subject to individual personal skill and the experience of the observer. It is not foolproof and has never been universally accepted. Sectional <b>roentgenography,</b> or <b>roentgenography</b> of the layers of the body, has proved a valuable technical method for resolving confusing superimposed shadows of structures, particularly in the chest where necessary contrast densities are found. There are several technical methods of making sectional studies which have been proved satisfactory in theory and practice. To avoid serious errors in differential diagnosis it has become necessary and desirable to utilize any or all roentgen technics as well as clinical and laboratory procedures.
