As many recent corporate collapses have shown, that trust is often misplaced. This paper reviews the legal position of employee claims to entitlements. Although it offers a useful safety net, the General Employee Entitlements Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) does not provide full security. The author argues that employee associations could work to improve recovery of lost entitlements by using the legal tools employed by commercial lenders. In this way, employees could ensure that their entitlements are held ‘in trust’, in a legal sense. ...|$|E
40|$|In Experiment 1, {{participants}} {{were presented with}} pairs of stimuli (one visual and the other tactile) from the left and/or right of fixation at varying stimulus onset asynchronies and were required to make unspeeded temporal order judgments (TOJs) regarding which modality was presented first. When the participants adopted an uncrossed-hands posture, just noticeable differences (JNDs) were lower (i. e., multisensory TOJs were more precise) when stimuli were presented from different positions, {{rather than from the}} same position. This spatial <b>redundancy</b> <b>benefit</b> was reduced when the participants adopted a crossed-hands posture, suggesting a failure to remap visuotactile space appropriately. In Experiment 2, JNDs were also lower when pairs of auditory and visual stimuli were presented from different positions, rather than from the same position. Taken together, these results demonstrate that people can use redundant spatial cues to facilitate their performance on multisensory TOJ tasks and suggest that previous studies may have systematically overestimated the precision with which people can make such judgments. These results highlight the intimate link between spatial and temporal factors in determining our perception of the multimodal objects and events in the world around us...|$|R

Generally, however, most problems arise in the future: In case of <b>redundancy,</b> unemployment <b>benefits,</b> severance pays and pension rates are lower in comparison to long-time full employment. Women in particular suffer in this context. The high part-time rate in combination with high divorce rates and the paternalistic orientation of the Austrian welfare state {{should be taken into}} account in this connection [5, 44]. Especially in Germany, {{against the backdrop of the}} Hartz IV reforms, non-standard forms of employment are criticised, as is part-time work. In statistical studies, all working contracts with 35  h or less are classified as part-time work. As a result, the variations of working hours are high, and differentiations between what is categorised under the term part-time work are essential.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} contribute to the literature on the selection and combination of media to facilitate learning. Principally, this research seeks to understand the effects of learning from four different media types concurrently presented with audio narration: (a) static text, (b) animated text, (c) static concept map, and (d) animated concept map. The inclusion of audio narration in multimedia materials introduces verbal redundancy, which is the concurrent presentation of verbatim spoken and printed words. Therefore, an additional goal of this work is to comprehensively review prior research on verbal redundancy. A meta-analysis was conducted to review experimental studies that compared verbally redundant presentations with non-verbally redundant presentations. After an extensive search for studies meeting specified inclusion criteria, data was extracted from 48 independent verbal redundancy effect sizes obtained from 32 research reports with a total of 3, 192 participants. Overall results indicated that students who learned from redundant multimedia presentations outperformed those who learned from non-redundant presentations but this effect was dependent on learners’ prior knowledge, pacing of learning materials, and inclusion of animation or diagrams. Specifically, verbal <b>redundancy</b> <b>benefited</b> low prior knowledge learners exposed to system-paced learning materials provided there were no concurrently presented images. However, heterogeneity was found in most categories of analyses. The effects on transfer, recall and comprehension of a learner-paced, concept map accompanied by redundant audio narration was investigated through a 2 X 2 factorial experiment in which an animation factor (animation versus static) was crossed with a representation factor (concept map versus text). One hundred and forty participants were randomly assigned to study one of four learner-paced multimedia presentations (animated concept map, static concept map, animated text and static text). Both concept map groups outperformed both text groups on tests of free recall and transfer. The animated concept map group outperformed the static text group on a knowledge test (p<. 05). No statistically detectable differences were found with respect to subjective evaluation of the multimedia presentations. Further analyses with sequential regression showed that time-on-task positively predicted achievement on free recall, transfer and knowledge tests. Results are discussed in the context of various theoretical frameworks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Republic of Serbia {{in the period}} of transition from a planned economy with special social, political and economic conditions towards an open economy through the inflow of FDI and their impact on the unemployment rate. Creating the conditions for an inflow of FDI started in order to increase the employment rate. Since 2000, most FDI had entered the sector of non-tradeable goods which led towards increasing unemployment. That has had negative effects on Serbia from the development viewpoint, since the country needs FDI in the sector of non-tradeable goods, as they encourage productivity, technological progress and employment. Foreign investors in Serbia were primarily interested in profiting from the privatization (brownfield investments) of former state-owned companies which led to the rationalization of the privatized companies through <b>redundancies.</b> The <b>benefits</b> that Serbia has had from the inflow of FDI are significant transfers of technology and enhancement of competition on the local market. On the other hand, negative effect is increase of the unemployment rate at the national level...|$|R

40|$|Does {{strategic}} planning enhance or impede innovation and firm performance? The current literature provides contradictory views. This study extends the resource-advantage theory {{to examine the}} conditions in which {{strategic planning}} increases or decreases the number of new product development projects and firm performance. The authors test the theoretical model by collecting data from 227 firms. The empirical evidence suggests that more strategic planning and more new product development (NPD) projects lead to better firm performance. Firms with organizational <b>redundancy</b> <b>benefit</b> more from strategic planning than firms with less organizational redundancy. Increasing R&D intensity boosts both the number of NPD projects and firm performance. Strategic planning is more effective in larger firms with higher R&D intensity for increasing the number of NPD projects. The results reported in this study also consist of several findings that challenge the traditional views of strategic planning. The evidence suggests that strategic planning impedes, not enhances, the number of NPD projects. Larger firms benefit less, not more, from strategic planning for improving firm performance. Larger firms do not necessarily create more NPD projects. Increasing organizational redundancy has no effect on the number of NPD projects. These empirical results provide important strategic implications. First, managers should be aware that, in general, formal strategic planning decreases the number of NPD projects for innovation management. Improvised rather than planned activities are more conducive to creating NPD project ideas. Moreover, innovations tend to emerge from improvisational processes, during which the impromptu execution of NPD activities without planning spurs "thinking outside the box," which enhances the process of creating NPD project ideas. Therefore, more flexible strategic plans that accommodate potential improvisation may be needed in NPD management since innovation-related activities cannot be planned precisely due to the unexpected jolts and contingencies of the NPD process. Second, large firms with high levels of R&D intensity can overcome the negative effect of strategic planning on the number of NPD projects. Specifically, a firm's abundant resources, when allocated and deployed for NPD activities, signal the high priority and importance of the NPD activities and thus motivate employees to acquire, collect, and gather customer and technical knowledge, which leads to creating more NPD projects. Finally, managers must understand that managing strategic planning and generating NPD project ideas are beneficial to the ultimate outcome of firm performance despite the adverse relationship between strategic planning and the number of NPD projects...|$|R

40|$|Common cause failure (CCF) is {{a serious}} threat to Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) reliability. It is {{therefore}} important to model and quantify CCF in reliability analysis. Diversity has long been used to protect redundant systems against CCF. Whilst there is clear evidence that diversity can bring benefits when compared with identical <b>redundancy</b> systems, these <b>benefits</b> can be difficult to quantify. Therefore, a novel CCF model which studies CCF from the viewpoint of Root Cause (RC) and Coupling Factor is proposed in this paper. The key parameters of the novel CCF model can be determined based on a stress-strength model by classifying variables of stressors and strengths according to RC categories. An application example is provided that illustrates how the proposed CCF model performs for a chemical reactor safety system (CRSS) for protection against high pressure and temperature. The results not only confirm that diversity techniques lower the CCF probability but also provide quantitative assessment of how large the improvements can be in different diversity techniques. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for high reliability, modular {{multilevel}} converters (MMCs) are designed with redundant sub-modules. Redundant sub-modules can {{be integrated into the}} converter by employing different redundancy schemes: the conventional active scheme, the load-sharing active scheme and the passive scheme. Different schemes have different impacts on the improvement of converter reliability. The contributions of this paper include that an analytical method is proposed to evaluate the reliability of MMCs under different redundancy schemes and the factors' influence on the converter reliability are analysed to determine the proper redundancy scheme. Reliability models of MMCs under different redundancy schemes are built using Markov chains and the recursive method. Based on the proposed models, the effects of redundant schemes are evaluated in terms of the converter reliability. A case study is conducted to validate the feasibility and robustness of proposed models and to specify the conditions in favour of each <b>redundancy</b> scheme. The <b>benefits</b> of sharing <b>redundancy</b> among arms are also explored from the reliability point of view. If IGBTs and capacitors are dominant components in a sub-module in terms of failure rates, the load-sharing active scheme performs better; otherwise, setting the redundant sub-modules in an idle state is more effective. It is also found that the number of required redundant sub-modules is greatly reduced by sharing redundancy among arms...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and specifically free-text patient notes presents opportunities for phenotype extraction. Text-mining methods in particular can help disease modeling by mapping named-entities mentions to terminologies and clustering semantically related terms. EHR corpora, however, exhibit specific statistical and linguistic characteristics {{when compared with}} corpora in the biomedical literature domain. We focus on copy-and-paste redundancy: clinicians typically copy and paste information from previous notes when documenting a current patient encounter. Thus, within a longitudinal patient record, one expects to observe heavy redundancy. In this paper, we ask three research questions: (i) How can redundancy be quantified in large-scale text corpora? (ii) Conventional wisdom is that larger corpora yield better results in text mining. But how does the observed EHR redundancy affect text mining? Does such redundancy introduce a bias that distorts learned models? Or does the <b>redundancy</b> introduce <b>benefits</b> by highlighting stable and important subsets of the corpus? (iii) How can one mitigate the impact of redundancy on text mining? Results: We analyze a large-scale EHR corpus and quantify redundancy {{both in terms of}} word and semantic concept repetition. We observe redundancy levels of about 30 % and non-standard distribution of both words and concepts. We measure the impact of redundancy on two standard text-mining applications: collocation identification and topic modeling. We compare the results of these methods on synthetic data with controlled levels of redundancy and observe significant performance variation. Finally, we compare two mitigation strategies to avoid redundancy-induced bias: (i) a baseline strategy, keeping only the last note for each patient in the corpus; (ii) removing redundant notes with an efficient fingerprinting-based algorithm. aFor text mining, preprocessing the EHR corpus with fingerprinting yields significantly better results. Conclusions: Before applying text-mining techniques, one must pay careful attention to the structure of the analyzed corpora. While the importance of data cleaning has been known for low-level text characteristics (e. g., encoding and spelling), high-level and difficult-to-quantify corpus characteristics, such as naturally occurring redundancy, can also hurt text mining. Fingerprinting enables text-mining techniques to leverage available data in the EHR corpus, while avoiding the bias introduced by redundancy...|$|R

40|$|SummarySafety {{instrumented}} {{systems are}} vital safety barriers {{to reduce the}} probability of the hazardous events and mitigate the consequences. Safety instrumented systems {{have been widely used}} in many kinds of industries. Redundancy is often introduced in safety instrumented systems for higher reliability. Although <b>redundancy</b> has many <b>benefits,</b> the negative effects cannot be ignored. Redundancy induces common cause failures to safety instrumented systems. The common cause failures are a big threat to the reliability of systems, which contributes to many major accidents. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} take common cause failures into consideration in risk and reliability assessment for the whole life cycle, especially in the design phase. There are two common cause failure modeling methods: explicit modeling and implicit modeling. The Beta-factor model belongs to implicit modeling and it is the simplest and widely used model. Many common cause failure models have been developed based on the beta-factor model. Three methods for the determination of beta-factor demonstrated in this master thesis: two IEC checklists (IEC 61508 - 6 and IEC 62061) and unified partial method (UPM). The procedures for beta-factor determination of these three methods are presented, the critical evaluation is performed for the IEC 61508 - 6 checklist, discussions on the effectiveness of questions are conducted, and a recommended question list of IEC 61508 is provided. Next, a detailed comparison between two checklists (IEC 61508 - 6 and IEC 62061) is carried out. As well the comparison between the checklist methods and the unified partial method is also demonstrated. Finally, some suggestions for the further work are provided at the end of this master thesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Most animals host {{communities}} of symbiotic bacteria. In insects, these symbionts may have particularly intimate interactions with their hosts: many are intracellular and can play {{important roles in}} host ecology and evolution, including protection against natural enemies. We investigated how interactions between different species or strains of endosymbiotic bacteria within an aphid host influence the outcome of symbiosis for both symbiont and host. We first asked whether different combinations of facultative symbiont species or strains can exist in stable co-infections. We then investigated whether the benefits that facultative bacteria confer on their hosts (protection against natural enemies) are enhanced, reduced or unaltered {{by the presence of}} a co-infecting symbiont. We asked this both for co-infecting symbionts that confer different phenotypes on their hosts (protection against fungal pathogens vs. parasitoid wasps) and symbionts with overlapping functions. Finally, we investigated the additional survival costs to aphids of carrying multiple infections of symbiont species or strains, and compared symbiont titres in double and single infections. We found that stable co-infections were possible between all of the combinations of facultative symbiont species (Regiella insecticola + Hamiltonella defensa, Regiella + Rickettsiella sp., Regiella + Spiroplasma sp.) and strains (Hamiltonella) that we studied. Where symbionts provided protection against different natural enemies, no alteration in protection was observed in the presence of co-infections. Where symbionts provided protection against the same natural enemy, the level of protection corresponded to the higher of the two symbionts present. In some instances, aphid hosts suffered additional survival costs when hosting double infections. In the case of Hamiltonella, however, infection with multiple strains of the same symbiont led to lower symbiont titres than single infections, and actually improved aphid survival. We conclude that the long-term maintenance of symbiont co-infections in aphids is likely to be determined primarily by costs of co-infections and in some instances by <b>redundancy</b> of symbiont <b>benefits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey (MWSS) is {{the main source of}} information for three key indicators of Short-Term Earnings generated by the Office for National Statistics: the Average Earnings Index, the Average Weekly Earnings and the Index of Labour Costs per Hour. The MWSS is distributed monthly to approximately 8, 800 businesses and covers around 12. 8 million employees. Companies are required to respond under the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. Businesses are selected from the Inter-Departmental Business Register. Every company with more than 1, 000 employees is surveyed. Sampling is random for businesses with fewer than 1, 000 employees. The MWSS does not cover businesses with fewer than 20 employees, and so the very smallest businesses in the economy are not represented. The self-employed and government-supported trainees are also not surveyed. The major strength of the MWSS is that it provides comprehensive information on earnings, by industry. In terms of industrial coverage, information on all industries is collected, as defined by the Standard Industrial Classifications (1992). Information on both {{the public and private sectors}} is available. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. For the seventh edition (July 2016), a data file for December 2015 has been added. Main Topics : The survey measures commission, bonuses, overtime and pay award arrears, in addition to pay. The survey also collects data on the number of employees on the payroll. The measures are the sums for each company, and are not subdivided by occupation or by individual workers. The survey excludes <b>redundancy</b> payments and <b>benefits</b> in kind. The data files have been processed to include average weekly pay data and all of the processing variables such as grossing factors and grossed values. <br...|$|R
