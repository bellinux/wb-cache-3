5|$|Chopin {{published}} his music in France, England and the German states {{due to the}} copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition {{is different from the}} other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E
5|$|The film also rescues {{a central}} concept in the comics, {{the fact that}} {{radiation}} {{is one of the}} causes of genetic mutation in the X-Men fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are found}} in the west, north, and east of Madagascar, but their {{distribution}} is discontinuous. Their habitat ranges from dry deciduous forests on the western coast of the island to rainforest in the east. They are also commonly found in secondary forest, but not in areas lacking continuous forest cover. They are most common in the west of the island. Fork-marked lemurs are not found in the southern spiny forests in the dry southern part of the island, and only <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> been reported from the southeastern rainforest at Andohahela National Park, though this has not been confirmed. A team led by E.E.Louis Jr. has suggested that undescribed varieties may also exist elsewhere on the island.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{retired as}} a player {{following}} the 1981 season. He finished his career having played in 181 {{out of a possible}} 190 games, and recorded 78.5 sacks (unofficially, as sacks were not an official statistic until 1982) and 16 fumble recoveries. His spot in the lineup was technically not replaced; the Steelers switched to a 3–4 defensive alignment for the 1982 season, which has only one nose tackle as opposed to two defensive tackles. The team has used the 3–4 as its base alignment continuously in the years since Greene's retirement, and more <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> used alignments that deploy only two true linemen.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E

5|$|Only <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> {{attempts}} to improve {{health in the}} developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common {{in the developing world}}. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E

Fluxgate magnetometer sensors are manufactured in several geometries and <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> made significant improvements in noise performance, crossfield tolerance and power utilization.

25|$|Mass extinctions are {{relatively}} rare events; however, isolated extinctions are quite common. Only <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> extinctions been recorded and scientists have become alarmed {{at the current}} high rate of extinctions. Most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented. Some scientists estimate that {{up to half of}} presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct by 2100.|$|E
25|$|An android is a {{humanoid}} robot or synthetic organism {{designed to look}} and act like a human, especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance. Historically, androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction where they are frequently seen in film and television. Only <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> advancements in robot technology allowed the design of functional and realistic {{humanoid robot}}s.|$|E
25|$|State and {{national}} elected officials in New England <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> been elected {{mainly from the}} Democratic Party. The region is {{generally considered to be}} the most liberal in the United States, with more New Englanders identifying as liberals than Americans elsewhere. In 2010, four of six of the New England states were polled as the most liberal in the United States; Maine and New Hampshire also were more liberal than the bottom-half.|$|E

It was also used as a training area for the British Army. It might have been released earlier, but due to the period of unrest known as the Troubles, the British Government and military viewed the area as a useful vantage point, overlooking Belfast.|$|E
25|$|Gifts {{from the}} Gulf States made it {{possible}} to build a new university library in 1983 and more <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> allowed {{for the creation of a}} new Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies. A further major donation enabled the completion of the Xfi Centre for Finance and Investment. Since 2009, significant further investment has been made into new student accommodation, new buildings in The Business School, and the Forum: a new development for the centre of Streatham Campus.|$|E
25|$|Some locks are {{operated}} (or {{at least}} supervised) by professional or volunteer lock keepers. This {{is particularly true}} on commercial waterways, or where locks are large or have complicated features that the average leisure boater {{may not be able}} to operate successfully. For instance, although the Thames above Teddington (England) is almost entirely a leisure waterway, the locks are usually staffed. Only <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> boaters been allowed limited access to the hydraulic gear to operate the locks when the keeper is not present.|$|E

25|$|The first {{alternate}} uniform {{is believed}} to have been a squared jersey, similar to the club's first main shirt but with orange instead of yellow. In 1984 a jersey with horizontal stripes (instead of vertical) was worn, and 1987 featured a yellow jersey with black shorts. Other alternate uniforms (used <b>recently)</b> <b>have</b> been completely black, grey or yellow. Special jerseys have been worn for international friendlies, especially during the 1960s. The CURCC's main uniform (with two-halves, one plain and one striped) is used as a third uniform. On 4 February 2013 all-black and all-yellow alternate uniforms were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Twain's {{wife died}} in 1904 while {{the couple were}} staying at the Villa di Quarto in Florence. After some time had passed he {{published}} some works that his wife, his de facto editor and censor throughout her married life, had looked down upon. The Mysterious Stranger is perhaps the best known, depicting various visits of Satan to earth. This particular work was not published in Twain's lifetime. His manuscripts included three versions, written between 1897 and 1905: the so-called Hannibal, Eseldorf, and Print Shop versions. The resulting confusion led to extensive publication of a jumbled version, and only <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> the original versions become available as Twain wrote them.|$|E
25|$|Recently, probiotics {{have become}} a new {{ingredient}} in many of our foods, and studies have been completed {{regarding the use of}} probiotics in infant formula Several randomized, controlled trials completed <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> shown limited and short term clinical benefits for the use of probiotics in infants’ diet The safety of probiotics in general and in infants, especially preterm infants, has been investigated in a limited number of controlled trials. The findings thus far suggest probiotics are generally safe. Therefore, the study suggested more scientific research is necessary before a conclusion can be made about probiotic supplementation in infant formula, since the research is still quite preliminary.|$|E
