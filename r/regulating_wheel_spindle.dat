Ferrule is a significant element that determines transmission efficiency and quality of information in the optical communication area. Most ferrule machining entails grinding and this requires high processing precision. Therefore, the ultra precision centerless grinding machine for ferrule grinding was designed.

5000|$|Bearing casings are {{introduced}} to the grinding action via means of a transfer from the delivery system {{to a pair of}} infeed rollers, these infeed rollers are tapered to a certain angle so that the casings are driven forward until the <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> and grinding wheel catch them and slow them to their grinding speed which can be altered by speed control of the <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel.</b> The casings are constantly rotating and are fed into the grinding area to prevent separation which can cause finish/size problems or even a [...] "bump" [...] that can potentially crack or destroy casings and will damage the grinding and <b>regulating</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

50|$|Centerless {{grinding}} {{is a form}} of grinding {{where there}} is no collet or pair of centers holding the object in place. Instead, there is a <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> positioned {{on the opposite side of}} the object to the grinding wheel. A work rest keeps the object at the appropriate height but has no bearing on its rotary speed. The workblade is angled slightly towards the <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel,</b> with the workpiece centerline above the centerlines of the regulating and grinding wheel; this means that high spots do not tend to generate corresponding opposite low spots, and hence the roundness of parts can be improved. Centerless grinding is much easier to combine with automatic loading procedures than centered grinding; throughfeed grinding, where the <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> is held at a slight angle to the part so that there is a force feeding the part through the grinder, is particularly efficient.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{hydrostatic}} {{seal rings}} {{are one of}} the most important components used in reactor coolant pumps. They are generally made of hard materials such as silicon nitride, alumina, silicon carbide and tungsten carbide. Meanwhile, the form error should be within the length of one to two helium light bands and the surface roughness should be in the scale of nanometers, which make them difficult to machining. In order to solve this problem, a high accuracy grinding method using a large cup wheel had been proposed and the tilt angle of the cup <b>wheel</b> <b>spindle</b> become a crucial factor affecting the ground form errors. This paper addresses a novel method for high-accuracy calibrating the tilt angle of the cup <b>wheel</b> <b>spindle</b> to fit the extremely shallow taper angle of the seal ring conical surface, and the mathematical model is established incorporating a standard optical flat with a high-accuracy laser displacement sensor. The practicability of this method is verified by grinding a seal ring sample with the outer diameter is 200 mm and the taper angle is 700 µrad. It is found that the taper angle error is only 1. 72 µrad and the radical profile error of the conical surface is about 0. 22 µm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{fuzzy logic}} traction controllers and {{their effect on}} longitudinal vehicle platoon systems. A fuzzy logic approach is appealing for traction control because of the non-linearities and time-varying uncertainties in traction control systems. One fuzzy controller estimates the "peak slip" corresponding to the maximum tire-road adhesion coefficient and <b>regulates</b> <b>wheel</b> slip at that value. The other fuzzy logic controller <b>regulates</b> <b>wheel</b> slip at any desired value. The controllers' performance and robustness against changing road conditions and time- varying uncertainty is evaluated by simulation. The effect of traction control on longitudinal vehicle platoon systems is studied by simulation also.

40|$|A new {{centerless}} grinding method without <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> is proposed. Instead {{of using a}} <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel,</b> this method employs an ultrasonic vibrating shoe to support the workpiece. The end of the vibrating shoe is in elliptic motion at a high frequency, while the rotational speed of the workpiece {{is controlled by the}} elliptic motion of the shoe. An experimental apparatus has been designed and constructed. Tests involving the rotational driving of a workpiece were then conducted on the apparatus, which showed that the workpiece rotational speed depended on the AC voltage and its frequency. Finally, grinding tests involving pin-shaped workpieces with an initial roundness of 20 &# 61549;m were performed.
