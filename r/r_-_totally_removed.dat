40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary {{intracranial}} {{squamous cell}} carcinomas are extremely rare, and commonly manifest as malignant transformations of intracranial epidermoid cysts. METHODS: A case of primary {{squamous cell carcinoma}} invading the ventral brain stem and the trigeminal entry zone is described. The tumor was microsurgically <b>totally</b> <b>removed</b> via a paramedian supracerebellar approach. Three years after the operation the tumor recurred, and was again <b>totally</b> <b>removed</b> using the same approach. RESULTS: The patient showed no postoperative neurologic deterioration except for a transient deterioration of gait disturbances. The pathologic diagnosis was a recurrence of the squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Since primary intracranial squamous cell carcinomas grow slowly and have a well demarcated capsule, total removal should be considered whenever possible...|$|R
