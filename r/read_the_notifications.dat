40|$|This study {{examined}} the response of parents of elementary school-aged children to a school-based body mass index (BMI) screening and parent notification program conducted in one Minnesota school district in 2010 – 2011 and whether parent’s response was moderated by child’s weight status. Randomly selected parents (N 122) of second- and fourth-grade students completed a mailed self-administered anonymous survey. Child’s weight status was determined using measured height and weight. Most parents <b>read</b> <b>the</b> BMI <b>notification</b> letter and considered it helpful, independent of child’s weight status. Parents of overweight children {{were significantly more likely}} than parents of normal weight children to report healthy lifestyle changes. This low-intensity intervention has the potential to support children, especially overweight children, and their parents to make healthy lifestyle changes. Future studies should investigate whether parent’s response contributes to improved short- and long-term health outcomes for children...|$|R

The App Store received a visual overhaul, bringing a card-based app layout as well as tweaks to search algorithms. Facebook was integrated into the operating system, incorporating status messages, like buttons, and contact and event synchronization to several of Apple's apps. New privacy controls allow users more fine-grained app permissions, {{as well as an}} option to prevent targeted advertising. Siri was added to more devices, and updated with more functionality, including the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, retrieve movie reviews and sports statistics, and <b>read</b> items from <b>the</b> <b>Notification</b> Center.|$|R

40|$|Title: Notification {{of animal}} welfare Author: Helen Öhlund The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the {{routines}} of the county administrations in Sweden when it comes to receiving <b>notification</b> from <b>the</b> public about the welfare of animals. According to Jordbruksverket at least 50 % of the screening of animal welfare should be based on routine controls on existing farmers. Today the routine controls only reach a 43 % average for the whole country. A big part of today’s result depends on the amount of time it takes the administrators of animal welfare to process <b>the</b> <b>notifications</b> from <b>the</b> public. To examine why <b>the</b> <b>notifications</b> from <b>the</b> public take too long time, the county administrations were interviewed through phone and e-mail. The interviews were made to see what routines the county administrations had and if the routines could be made more efficient. Jordbruksverket have developed aid to the county administrations in form of simpler checklists for pets and control cards to ease <b>the</b> burden in <b>notification</b> controls. This study shows that a lot of work can be done when it comes to receiving <b>the</b> <b>notification.</b> When receiving <b>notification</b> <b>the</b> administrators can decide if <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> is severe or not. Too little information makes it difficult to determine the gravity of <b>the</b> <b>notification.</b>   Key words: animal welfare, legislation, county administration, notification, Jordbruksverket...|$|R

Method: an observational cross-sectional study as conducted. Data collection was done through referrals made to the Social Service of Clinics Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco (HC/UFPE), by reports of professional by itself, a recording instrument from the hospital and copies of <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> form of cases. The project was approved by the Ethics Research Center of Health Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco/UFPE with protocol number 13 / 10. All cases were considered of September 2006, when began using <b>the</b> <b>Notification</b> Form from <b>the</b> Ministry of Health until December 2008. Results: <b>the</b> most <b>notification</b> was cases against the child (n= 20, 46, 51 %), while there isn’t registration of cases against the elderly.
