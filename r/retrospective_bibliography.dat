The {{progress}} of the novel in the 18 th century was extremely varied {{in different parts of}} Europe : rapid and impressive in the Western countries, slower and more sparse in the East, the North and the South. An analysis of the <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliographies</b> of the genre undertaken to date for a number of national literatures enables us to make a first attempt at a quantitative estimation of this development. A closer examination of the data available for France, England and Germany during the decade 1750 - 59 leads both to conclusions concerning the output of novels in these three countries and to a comparative thematic study based on the vocabulary in the titles.

5000|$|Data from {{citation}} indexes can {{be analyzed}} to determine the popularity and impact of specific articles, authors, and publications. Using citation analysis to gauge the importance of one's work, for example, is {{a significant part of}} the tenure review process. Information scientists also use citation analysis to quantitatively assess the core journal titles and watershed publications in particular disciplines; interrelationships between authors from different institutions and schools of thought; and related data about the sociology of academia. Some more pragmatic applications of this information includes the planning of <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliographies,</b> [...] "giving some indication both of the age of material used in a discipline, and of the extent to which more recent publications supersede the older ones"; indicating through high frequency of citation which documents should be archived; comparing the coverage of secondary services which can help publishers gauge their achievements and competition, and can aid librarians in evaluating [...] "the effectiveness of their stock". There are also some limitations to the value of citation data. They are often incomplete or biased; data has been largely collected by hand (which is expensive), though citation indexes can also be used; incorrect citing of sources occurs continually; thus, further investigation is required to truly understand the rationale behind citing to allow it to be confidently applied.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to examine the {{disputes}} from three meetings held in order to initiate a general Yugoslav <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography.</b> The conferences took places in Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana during 1955. The investigation focused on criteria how to choose materials for the general Croatian <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography</b> of books. Differences between the participants of the meeting, in author's opinion, come from the various interpretations of Yugoslavism. The idea of Yugoslavism is here considered as an ideological substratum, which could support the political and cultural unity of Yugoslavia. Disagreements are mainly the result of a conflict between the unitary and the federal options of Yugoslavism in culture. The status of a national bibliography within the multinational federal state represents the main problem. On the political level, the problem is seen as an unsolved national question, which, in the general opinion, led to the break-up of the state of Yugoslavia. We pay special attention to the views of Mr. Matko Rojnić, who at that time was the editor of the Croatian <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography,</b> and who defended the traditional Croatian bibliographic criteria: Croatian author, Croatian language, and actual Croatian territory. His opinion has been described as national federalism, which, {{in the case of a}} <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography</b> of Croatia, as a Yugoslav federal unit, demands criteria that are equivalent to those of the retrospective bibliographies of independent countries...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} to outline {{the present state}} o f <b>retrospective</b> apiculture <b>bibliography.</b> Bibliography in this held has not been worked out consistently and uniformly so far and still remains very patchy. The basis for the bibliography is formed by the listings made by Tadeusz Grochowski, Antoni Jakubski and Wacław Kranowski, partly complementing one another. The initiatives o f creating a comprehensive bibliography {{that have been taken}} to date were not successful. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons behind those failures is the very wide t hematic scope that has to be included. The tradition of Polish apiculture has created it own bibliographical canon. According to this canon regarding publications, basically books and periodicals published in the Polish language are only entered in bibliographies. The range of the bibliography covers thus a limited area of interest and results in its constraints and drawbacks. The article discusses the beginnings of the periodical press covering problems of apiculture and points out at {{the fact that there is}} no full and comprehensive listing of titles published in the areas historically or ethnically related to or associated with Poland. The article also recalls apicultura] periodicals that have been published locally in the Wielkopolska region. Apart from the need for compiling a full and comprehensive bibliography of publications and more important texts from periodicals as well as a complete listing o f periodicals, the absence of the subject bibliography of The Rev. Dr. Jan Dzierżoń is additionally mentioned in the article. The author proposes working out separate apicultural bibliographies covering material produced in Silesia, Western Pomerania and parts of Eastern Prussia. A modern bibliography that would record the entire output of broadly-understood Polish apicultural literature in line with current research standards still needs to be worked out...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Saudi Arabia has, in recent years, experienced a remarkable development in publishing, due {{to the expansion of}} education, the encouragement of writers and publications by the government, and the Islamic heritage. In this context, a National Bibliography is a vital ingredient in promoting publications and encouraging their wider use. The objective of this study is three-fold: to find a model for National Bibliography in the KSA; to consider this proposal in the context of Arab national bibliographies and in the light of broader international aspects. The method of study involved reading a wide range of works on the subject, including papers and conference documents as well as books. Interviews were conducted with individuals and organisations connected with the subject. Description and analysis of works in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Tunisia were made according to the following plan: publisher; need and aim; scope of coverage (period, subject, type and number); organisation; bibliographical description; and depository law. Most of the bibliographic works produced in the KSA have been for specific purposes, appearing at different periods and often overlapping. They cannot themselves be regarded as a <b>retrospective</b> national <b>bibliography</b> but could be useful in producing one. Egypt and Tunisia are chosen for study as both have experienced similar problems to the KSA and both have a tradition of regular national bibliography. In both countries, the National Library produces the National Bibliography. Their experiences are considered useful for positive adoption of successful features and avoidance of shortcardngs in setting up a Saudi National Bibliography. In addition, a wider examination of Arab Bibliography and international definitions and practices has been made. Deposition law, as a vital feature of successful bibliography production, has also been considered for the main countries studied and for others. The National Library of Saudi Arabia should be the body to publish the prospective National Bibliography, benefiting fron the examples given above. Recarmendations are made for the administration and working of the New Bibliography...|$|R

In 1993 a concept for a national bibliographic data bank was prepared and approved. Analysis of the UBC and UBCIM international programmes, the ICBNS recommendations and other normative documents drafted for the purposes of national bibliographic agencies shows that the function of the Lithuanian bibliographic control fully complies with the essential provisions of these documents, ensuring comprehensiveness of the scope of both current and national retrospective bibliographies and creation of bibliographic and authority records of all types including publications in different languages and scripts; preparation of bibliographic and authority records in compliance with international standards and other normative documents making the basis of the LIBIS linguistic supply; and long-term preservation of bibliographic and authority records.

40|$|The article {{presents}} statistical {{data on the}} publications of belles-lettres in Estonia in 1900 – 1940 – a period when the country developed into a modern European society and gained independence. The topic is treated {{in the context of}} book history, which uses publishing statistics to provide a broader context for individual case studies. The research on the quantity and share of translated literature in book production comes close to the statisticalsociological approach in translation history, characterised by Peeter Torop as one of the aspects of the study of translation culture. The statistical indicators have been elaborated on the basis of <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliographies</b> and on the data, obtained from National Library of Estonia. The analysis includes the share of belles-lettres in book production, the balance of original works and translations, the changes in the quantity of translations during different decades and the share of source literatures. The Estonian statistics have been presented in comparison with corresponding data from Finland, which has been published in the collective monograph on Finnish translation history, issued in 2007. As the Finnish data is organized by decades, the same principle is used for statistics on Estonia. This approach corresponds generally to the political history of the two countries – both belonged to the Russian Empire during the first two decades of the 20 th century and existed as independent states during the following two decades. Both nations had passed through the first stage in the development of literary culture, characterised by extensive publication of adaptations and free translations {{by the beginning of the}} century. Thus the share of original works started to increase and slightly exceeded the share  of  translations  in  E stonia  as  well  as  in  Finland.  The  selection  of  translated  works  in both countries was varied and their level was unstable. Despite the longstanding plans of developing translation culture in Finland, the choice of works was influenced by international acclaime and the activitiy of translators. The immaturity of Estonian publishing manifested itself, among other things, as inadeaquate paratexts of the translations. Due to the differences in historical development and cultural background, the structure of  source  literature s  of  translated  belle s-let tre s  in  the  two  countrie s  dif fered  in  many  ways – translating from the English language increased considerably in Finland, fending the traditional German and Scandinavian domination. The importance of translations of German literature, which maintained the leading role in Estonia, is a common feature of both countries. At the same time, the interest in Scandinavian literature only started to emerge in Estonia. The  translations  of  Rus sian  literature,  however,  were  much  more  numerous  in  E stonia  thanin Finland. In general, the period of 1900 – 1919 is characterised by a notable increase in the quantit y of translated belles-lettres as well as their uneveness. However, the growing number of translations provided greater diversity, introducing new authors, styles and trends. The existence of an independent Republic of Estonia (since 1918) opened utterly new perspectives for the development of national culture – for the first time it could be done without external control and using the Estonian language in all levels of administration and education. These circumstances fostered publishing, the demand for books was especially great during the first years after the War of Independence (1918 – 1920), later the declines and increases in book production were connected to the economic conditions. Belles-lettres formed about 20 per cent of the title production, which in turn was almost equally divided between original works and translations. In contrast to Estonia, the number of translations started to decrease in Finland in the 1930 s due to economic and political factors, idealising conservative national values. The hierarchy of source languages underwent a major change in Estonia where the English language ascended to the leading position, exceeding the translations from German and French. The importance of translations from Russian language remained a characteristic feature of Estonian publishing, unknown in Finland during the 1920 s- 1930 s. Estonians were also active in translating Finnish literature. The Estonian publishing houses issued ten times more translations from Finnish than vice versa – a disproportion explained with the lack of interest among the Finnish publishers. Although the output of  translations  included  a  wide  variet y  of  high-qualit y  works,  they  were  outnumbered  by genre fiction, preferred by the large audiences both in Estonia and in Finland. The Writer’s Unions of Estonia and Finland attempted to suppress their proliferation without success. However, on the whole, the corpus of translations issued in the 1920 s and 1930 s presents a rather balanced selection oriented to different strata of the audience...|$|R

40|$|Mate Ujević, Croatian writer, {{lexicographer}} and encyclopaedist {{contributed significantly}} to the development of bibliographical work in Croatia. As his role as a meritorious Croatian bibliographer has not been worthily evaluated, on the occasion of his birth's centenary the author intended to investigate the available published and other sources and attempt to evaluate his main bibliographic achievements and merits. In the field of bibliography Ujević acted as a moving force, organiser, performer of activities and educator, especially during his riper years. He encountered the necessity of recreating the missing Croatian retrospective bibliographies as a young man in his late thirties, while preparing the edition of the Croatian Encyclopaedia. Then he immediately pleaded for the organizing of a systematic compilation of retrospective and current bibliographies of printed books. Although during a shorter period he himself actively took part in the preparation of the Croatian <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography</b> of books and the current bibliography of articles in Croatian periodicals, his main bibliographic work is the great retrospective "Bibliography of studies, articles and literary works of the Lexicographic Institute" which he founded and edited from 1951 to his death in 1967. This rich <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography</b> of articles published in the South Slavic serial publications {{from the end of the}} 18 th century to 1945 is, due to a wide selection of serial titles and its excellent indexes, almost unique in the world. In its realisation Ujević managed to accumulate an outstanding quantity of high quality bibliographic material. As an excellent organiser he distributed the collection of data in major libraries in Zagreb, Ljubljana, Belgrade, Dubrovnik, Split, Zadar, Rijeka, Pula, Sarajevo, Subotica, Novi Sad and Skopje. The main editor's office was in Zagreb, and the two additional major co-ordinating centres in Ljubljana and Belgrade. The published 15 volumes of the Bibliography include to this day: literature (7 vols.), history (4 vols.), fine arts (1 vol.) and music (2 vols.) and are irreplaceable sources of bibliographic data to numerous researchers in Croatia and abroad. 1 n the last decade of his life Ujević was engaged in teaching bibliography within the postgraduate programme in library and information studies of the University of Zagreb.

40|$|The National Bibliographic Data Bank (NBDB) {{is part of}} the Lithuanian Integrated Library Information System (LIBIS). The {{main purpose}} of {{creating}} LIBIS was ensuring bibliographic control of all documents of Lithuania and avoiding duplication of cataloguing processes within the National Library and the whole of Lithuania. During the creation of NBDB, activities of all the structural units of the Centre of Bibliography and Book Science were reorganized in such a manner that both bibliographic and authority records had to be created for every document acquired by the Centre. These records are subsequently reused by all units for the realization of their functions and preparation of publications. This reorganization became possible due to the earlier drafted concept {{for the creation of a}} national bibliographic data bank and software applications of LIBIS, which ensured setting up of databases of bibliographic records, authority records and factographic data, which make the basis of LIBIS. Data of NBDB not only allow rendering information services for different user categories, but also make it possible to broaden the scope of publications by including those of the current and <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography</b> and catalogues of general use, such as Parduodamų knygų katalogas (“The Catalogue of Books in Print”), Lietuvos leidėjų katalogas (“The Catalogue of Lithuanian Publishers”) and many others...|$|E
40|$|This {{text was}} {{presented}} on 9 th May 2012 at the Department of Library and Information Science, Faculty of Philosophy, Comenius University in Bratislava. The lecture was arranged by this Department, the Book Culture History Section at the Slovak National Library in Martin and the Slovak Academy of Sciences History Institute in Bratislava. The lecture {{demonstrates that the}} bases of Czech bibliological research are very closely interconnected with national <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography</b> and that this continuity carries on to this day due to personnel restraints. Hence even nowadays no difference is felt between historical bibliography and bibliology. However, historical bibliography is lacking a modern national plan for historical book collections and ways to process them and make them digitally available. New bibliological {{research needs to be}} conceived separately and emancipated from routine bibliographical procedures. Bibliology should not be understood as static and positivistically oriented, but as an interdisciplinary field with links to literary history, art studies, musicology and so forth. The sociocultural functions of the book should also be foregrounded, as should research into reading and the readership community from the standpoint of historical development. The pedagogical process should also be motivated by these considerations, which will help it begin to attain a higher standard with regard to bibliology and the history of book culture.

40|$|The Short Title Catalogue, Netherlands (STCN) is a <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography</b> {{containing}} {{descriptions of}} over 200. 000 Dutch publications {{from the period}} 1540 - 1800. The STCN is compiled by the National Library of the Netherlands. In order to facilitate more complex querying capabilities than is possible via the Picarta search interface, we have converted the STCN dataset to Linked Open Data (LOD). Here we report on how {{we were able to}} enrich the STCN dataset by linking it to other datasets. Semantic Web techniques for Digital Humanities The Semantic Web (SW) approach and the Linked Open Data (LOD) paradigm provide a way for existing structured datasets to be interlinked. It has been argued that the SW approach has specific advantages in the Digital Humanities (DH) domain. Since existing datasets in the humanities are fragmented over a large number of institutions and are often stored in idiosyncratic ways, the combined DH datastore is very heterogeneous. Traditional database techniques require data to be regimented into a uniform format before data is to be meaningfully integrated. The LD paradigm, however, was designed for linking between heterogeneous sources, relating without integrating them. In converting the STCN to LOD we had the following goals: - Extend the STCN with relevant related information from other datasets. - Standardize the vocabulary that is used by the STCN in order to improve the quality and interoperability with other datasets. - Allow queries to be answered that could not be asked before. We have linked the STCN to the lists of prohibited books by Knuttel and Weekhout, thereby allowing queries to be performed over these heterogeneous data sources. We have also used alignment tools to create fully automated links between authors and their pseudonyms. For the latter alignment tasks we have found 445 such pseudonyms by relating the STCN authors to DBpedia entries. Since LOD has an explicit schema and a formally defined, model-theoretic semantics, it is possible to perform more complex queries over the LOD-version of the STCN. For this we have written a query layer called humR in SWI-Prolog that uses R in order to perform statistics processing on the data in terms of the domain vocabulary. It is possible to use domain vocabulary terms in formulating the query. For example, one can ask how a certain genre's popularity changes over time. Complex query results can be visualized using standard data visualization tools. Our research shows that the use of LOD technologies has the potential to transform both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of querying a DH dataset...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{constraints}} to agricultural research in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, is access to current and relevant information {{in the form of}} primary documents, secondary services, machine-readable databases, etc. Progress is hindered or prevented by a variety of factors such as shortage of foreign exchange to purchase primary literature or photocopies, poor communication and resource sharing within national agricultural research systems, lack of awareness of existing information resources and scarcity of qualified information specialists to use information services and resources adequately, and the general low priority given to information-related activities in research budgets. To keep researchers updated on the literature available in their field of research, the target of any information service should be for each researcher or team of researchers to receive current awareness bibliographies with abstracts on a regular basis and, if they do not already have this, a <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography</b> in their field of research. The challenge is to make the distribution of this information as effective and efficient as possible. In recognition of the problems and requirements described, CTA launched an SDI pilot project in 1988 together with the Centre de Coop 9 ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D 9 veloppement (CIRAD) in ACP countries in Africa. In 1991 it was extended to all 69 ACP countries with the additional support of CAB International (CABI). This service took off slowly because of difficulties in obtaining specific information about the latest research activities at the national level, the researchers in charge, and existing information resources. The objective of the SDI programme is to allow a researcher to keep abreast with the latest scientific and technical information relevant to his or her field of research by regularly providing information of specific interest. Each potential beneficiary fills in specially designed forms outlining his or her own research programme, a list of 'KEYWORDS' to describe the subject of interest and the subscriber's address. The service aims at providing a minimum of four personal (individual) profiles per country. In addition, ACP countries are divided into six regions and each region is targeted to receive a minimum of 100 profiles on at least 10 subjects of broad interest. As it is beyond the resources of most researchers in the ACP countries to purchase all the documents they identify, the service allows each beneficiary to receive a limited number of selected publications from the bibliographies. This acts as a starting point from which the researchers can trace the latest scientific and technical publications relevant to their work. To ensure the success of the service in terms of timeliness, appropriateness and usefulness, it is monitored continuously by means of quick-response reply cards supplied to the beneficiaries. This allows adjustment and improvement of the project in order to prepare the general evaluation which will be done in 1994. The day-to-day management of the SDI services is handled by the Centre International de Documentation en Agronomie des R 9 gions Chaudes (CIRARC/CIRAD) and CAB International (CABI). CIRAD covers countries in Eastern, Central and West Africa and CABI covers Southern Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific countries. Enquiries are welcome and should be addressed to the Director, CTA.

40|$|Bosnian Franciscan Ivan Franjo Jukić (1818 - 1857) died {{a hundred}} and fifty years ago. He {{was one of the most}} {{prominent}} figures in the 19 th century cultural life of Bosnia and Herzegovina, credited with the development of a wide-ranging set of aspects of cultural life in Bosnia and Herzegovina, organised in the unpropitious conditions of the Turkish occupation. Among other things, he studied the non-religious cultural history of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, in particular, the literary work of his Franciscan predecessors who were active in pastoral work for many years on the entire Croatian cultural territory and, in some periods, outside this territory. Preaching in the tongue of the people, they contributed greatly to the standardisation of the Croatian language and to the development and use of bosanica as a specific form of the Croatian Cyrillic script. Jukić was one of the first, if not the first Croatian student of this script. The study of bosanica was an inspiration to him to collect and bibliographically describe books written in this script and, also, books written in the Latin script. Thus emerged the core of his text, Bosnian Literature, which is in fact a general bibliography of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was the first book to set as a criterion the secular and not the religious borders of Bosnia. The text was published in two installments in the first literary journal in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosanski prijatelj, started and edited by Jukić. The paper is to commemorate the anniversary of his death. It provides an insight into the results of the bibliographic, cultural and historic study of Jukić’s text. The bibliographic study focuses on the bibliographic structure, bibliographic descriptions and on the criteria applied in the selection of the material. The bibliographic features are analysed as part of the cultural and historic context, in the synchronic and diachronic sense of the word. The method applied in the contextualised bibliographic analysis provides background for the study of some of Jukić’s less well known standpoints, relevant for the criteria employed in the selection of the materials for the national <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography.</b> The need to approach the matter from cultural and historic aspects is in correspondence with Jukić’s devout support of the Illyrian movement. This movement promoted the unity of the Southern Slavs, calling them all Illyrians and regarding them as basically a single people speaking the same language. As one of its focuses, the movement also promoted bibliographic work. Tracing back this orientation leads us to its source, the German Romanticism, which relied on the common language for the building of unity of the disunited German lands, and promoted the primacy of culture over the primacy of politics. With the German people this unity was successful, whereas the political reality, in part shaped by bloody wars, was a vivid proof of the failure of the Illyrian, and later, of the Southern Slavic idea. The course of research done for this paper was greatly affected by this historical fact, especially evident in the criteria for the selection of the bibliographic material. Starting off with the Illyrians’ understanding of what ”the regional’’ denotes, Jukić not only accepted the identification of the Illyrians and the Southern Slavs as one and the same entity, but he also treated Bosnia’s Muslims as the ”glorious Illyrian people’’, not only territorially but also ethnically. Students of the cultural and political history of Bosnia did not agree with Jukić’s arguments, and the cultural and historical processes proved him wrong by developing in directions that Jukić could not have foreseen or expected. The outcome of the Turkish siege of Bosnia was, namely, in the identification of the religious with the national. So it happened that Jukić, as a Catholic, is thought of as a Croatian culturalist and bibliographer, and a member of the Croatian ethnic group, irrespective of the fact that, territorially speaking, he belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is a member of that state’s cultural elite. A bibliographic analysis makes up the core of the paper, and the core is framed by a methodologically immanent, modern cultural and historical context. Furthermore, inspired by Jukić’s Illyrian orientation, the analysis is also evaluated briefly from the point of view of the post-modern cultural and historic constructivism.   Keywords: Ivan Franjo Jukić; bibliography; bibliographic analysis; Bosnian Franciscans; Bosanski prijatelj; Illyrian movement </table...|$|E
40|$|African {{continent}} is full {{of written}} culture and activities being produced and preserved by her people, not only for posterity but for academics, students and the larger bibliographic communities. That information is generated {{on the face of}} African continent on daily bases is not in doubt as printing and publishing has become the order of the day. Libraries and information centers are expected to record and make available all that is written on request. Bibliographic control has become a major determinant of book accessibility and utilization and a key factor to information search. In many countries of the world, individuals are the chief initiators of this project and because of its place in enlightened societies, nations and international bodies have tackled this problem with all seriousness it deserves. UNESCO, for instance, has taken the bull by the horn and even formed other sub-bodies such as universal availability of publications, (UAP); universal availability of information (UAI) among others, to tackle the problem of universal bibliographic control (UBC) and Africa is not left out. According to Fourie and Burger (2007), the bibliographic control project is very important, fundamental and indispensable to countries like South Africa that the effort put forward by her is currently unmatchable by any African country. The fact that a book is recorded in the library, internet, or the information centre is enough to give hope to the needful potential user that {{it may be possible to}} access and utilize it. Informational materials like books, journals, manuscripts, theses, dissertations, magazines, newspapers and a host of others are written, printed and published. As time goes on, precise data about these materials begin to wane. Their existence are usually ignored or forgotten by many, except they are included in the bibliography- the listing of the materials But the listing must be in a particular pertain which must be systematic to accommodate essential bibliographic elements which could enable a potential user to decide to trace it when in need This calls for a pattern of effective recording and arrangement which result from systematic listing of the records of human communication. One current type of bibliography, according to World Book Encyclopedia (2002) presents a systematic description of books as well as list them, summarizing what each book is about as well as its currency, binding publisher and its value. When each country seriously undertakes this task of ensuring that every book is captured under this scheme, it becomes a national bibliography; and the collective effort by various nations of the universe is the UBC. The efforts put up by individual countries in Africa will be the focus of this work. The author will consider this article under the following headings: a} Bibliographic control activities on Africa c} Problems with the compilation of Bibliographies in Africa d} Ways of enhancing Universal Bibliographic Control in Africa Bibliographic control activities on Africa Bibliographic control activities have generally developed in Africa randomly over the years. A few African countries are lucky to have gotten retrospective national bibliographies before 1940, and it was individuals who made personal effort to compile national bibliographies for these countries. According to Musiker (2005) Mendelssohn’s South African Bibliography was published in 1910 making South Africa the first African country to have a national bibliography. This was the conceit effort made by South African Librarians towards the attainment of universal bibliographic control According to Aje (1977 : 16 (3), Sierra Leone was the first West African country to have a national bibliography. It was compiled by Sir Harry Charles Luke and published in 1925. H. C. Luke was a colonial secretary for Sierra Leone and apparently had searched important libraries in London and the secretariat library in Freetown and came out with his work entitled “A Bibliography of Sierra Leone” Another individual named Cardinell, (Aje 1977; 21 (7)) concentrated on Ghana for a national <b>retrospective</b> <b>bibliography,</b> entitled “A Bibliography of the Gold Coast 1496 - 1931 ” published in 1932. Sources of his information are said to be 19 th century work was pioneered by the Basel mission who set up printing and publishing enterprise in the field of religious publications. On the government side where activities commenced earlier than the Bassel Mission, Cardinell recorded that government printing press started functioning after 1875, producing government gazettes and reports. Thus, the first listing of government publication was part of the colonial report on the Gold Coast. All these were precursors of the monumental work produced by A. W. Cardinell. A UNESCO document by Beaudiquez (1977 : 99) also named Burundi as another country with retrospective national bibliography compiled by individual effort. Daniel Nyambarize, librarian at Universite du Burundi institute universitaire des sciences de L’ Education centre Recherche’s et de Documentation, pedagogique, compiled a bibliography “Le Burundi: essai d” une bibliographic 1959 – 1973. This was a list of publications, research reports and periodicals published between 1959 and 1973 and held in Burundi National Library. The UNESCO document by Beaudiquez (1977 : 419) states further that Benin Republic is another country with retrospective national bibliography compiled by an individual called Guillaume Da Silva. It was published by the Institute de Recherche Applique es du Benin (IRAB). No date of publication was given by this source. Other African countries with retrospective national bibliographies by individuals include Chad (1968); Costa Rice (1958); Guinea (1964); Ivory Coast (1972 - 1974); Libya (1951 - 1971); Madagascar (1952); Morocco (1970); South Africa (1910) and Zambia (no date). These retrospective bibliographies are attempts to compile all the works published in these individual countries. A close look at this same UNESCO document (1977 : 419) shows that eighteen (18) other African countries, apart from the thirteen (13) mentioned here have national bibliographies compiled by depository centers. And some of these countries have legal deposit decrees backing them up from the central government. These show a great progress made in the development of Africa’s Continental Bibliography. Another study by Samuel Kotie (1971 : 14), on the development of library studies, University of Ghana identified thirty two current national bibliographies for African countries by 1969. Whereas, at the time the International Conference on African Bibliography (1970 : 1) was held in Nairobi, Kenya from December 4 - 8, 1967, only nine African countries were listed as having national bibliographies in the true sense of the word. These include, Ethiopia Madagascar, Malawi, Nigeria, Rhodesia, Senegal, South Africa, Sierra Leone and Tanzania. Another writer on bibliography, Amosu (1968 : 14 - 18), explained the issue of the availability of bibliographies of all types on Africa subject and national bibliographies produced on Africa. She also explored methods of bibliographic control of materials on Africa, the problem of coordination for complete coverage and avoidance of serious duplication amongst other considerations. In Nigeria, the National Library of Nigeria has been charged with these responsibilities of compiling; coordinating and publishing the bibliography of all published materials on Nigeria...|$|E
