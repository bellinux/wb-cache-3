60|$|Half-way between Willebroek and Villevorde, in a {{beautiful}} <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> like a squire's avenue, we went ashore to lunch. There were two eggs, a junk of bread, {{and a bottle of}} wine on board the Arethusa; and two eggs and an Etna cooking apparatus on board the Cigarette. The master of the latter boat smashed one of the eggs in the course of disembarkation; but observing pleasantly that it might still be cooked a la papier, he dropped it into the Etna, in its covering of Flemish newspaper. We landed in a blink of fine weather; but we had not been two minutes ashore before the wind freshened into half a gale, and the rain began to patter on our shoulders. We sat as close about the Etna as we could. The spirits burned with great ostentation; the grass caught flame every minute or two, and had to be trodden out; and before long, there were several burnt fingers of the party. But the solid quantity of cookery accomplished was out of proportion with so much display; and when we desisted, after two applications of the fire, the sound egg was little more than loo-warm; and as for a la papier, it was a cold and sordid fricassee of printer's ink and broken egg-shell. We made shift to roast the other two, by putting them close to the burning spirits; and that with better success. And then we uncorked the bottle of wine, and sat down in a ditch with our canoe aprons over our knees. It rained smartly. Discomfort, when it is honestly uncomfortable and makes no nauseous pretensions to the contrary, is a vastly humorous business; and people well steeped and stupefied in the open air are in a good vein for laughter. From this point of view, even egg a la papier offered by way of food may pass muster as a sort of accessory to the fun. But this manner of jest, although it may be taken in good part, does not invite repetition; and from that time forward, the Etna voyaged like a gentleman in the locker of the Cigarette.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The Rideau Canal in Canada was {{constructed}} in the 1800 s to enable strategic military and commercial transport in eastern Ontario between Lake Ontario and the Ottawa River. Today, the Rideau Canal is managed by Parks Canada and remains an engineered ecosystem, particularly in the urban Ottawa reach (7 km long) where it is largely channelized and is partially drained during the winter to protect canal infrastructure (i. e., locks) and provide recreational opportunities (i. e., skating). Interestingly, the Ottawa <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the Rideau <b>Canal</b> supports one <b>of</b> the few wild urban muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) fisheries in North America supported by natural reproduction. However, {{little is known about}} the spatial ecology, residency patterns or survival of this apex freshwater predator in urban environments or canal systems. Radio-telemetry was used to study adult (N = 10; total size range of 64 to 122 cm) muskellunge in the Ottawa <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the Rideau <b>Canal</b> over a multiple year period. The seasonal movements and home range of muskellunge were greatest during spring corresponding with the period when water levels in the canal were raised and muskellunge were presumably seeking out suitable spawning habitats following ice-off. During the summer fish ranged throughout the entire 7 km urban <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal</b> and by early fall muskellunge moved to the deeper parts <b>of</b> the <b>reach</b> and became largely restricted to an embayment known as Dow’s Lake prior to the lowering <b>of</b> the <b>canal</b> wher...|$|R

50|$|The {{specific}} features {{and complexity of}} the internal anatomy of the teeth have been thoroughly studied. Using a replica technique on thousands of teeth, Hess made clear as early as 1917 that the internal space of dental roots is often a complex system composed of a central area (root canals with round, oval or irregular cross-sectional shape) and lateral parts (fins, anastomoses and accessory canals). In fact, this lateral component may represent a relatively large volume, which challenges the cleaning phase of the instrumentation procedure in that tissue remnants of the vital or necrotic pulp as well as infectious elements are not easily removed in these areas. Thus, the image <b>of</b> root <b>canals</b> having a smooth, conical shape is generally too idealistic and underestimates the <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> root <b>canal</b> instrumentation.|$|R
40|$|We {{quantified}} {{abundance and}} biomass of the amphipod Gammarus chevreuxi Sexton from benthic cores, sampled monthly over 1 y {{in the upper}} <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Canal</b> de Mira, the southern arm of the Ria de Aveiro, Portugal. Abundance and biomass showed no clear seasonal patterns but were associated with variation in salinity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a concentration. Maximum abundance and biomass occurred at relatively low temperature and high food availability, conditions that likely increased survival and/or reproduction. The population showed a semiannual, iteroparous life cycle. Mean life span was similar to 6 mo, with overwintering individuals hatched in autumn showing higher longevity than individuals hatched in spring. Breeding was continuous, although juvenile recruitment peaked in early autumn, winter, and early spring. Sudden fluctuations in abundance and size structure of the population may have resulted from immigration during autumn and emigration during winter. Mean fecundity (8 embryos/brood) and intramarsupial loss (0 - 18 %) were low cornpared with studies of other Gammarus species. Variation in fecundity and intramarsupial loss was mostly explained by size of incubating females. The volume of the embryos was highly variable but not significantly correlated with female size or other reproductive traits. The Hynes and the Morin-Bourassa methods yielded similar estimates of annual production (similar to 46 g AFDM m(- 2) y(- 1)) and P/B ratio (11 /y) ...|$|R

The Germans expanded their attack, assaulting the British defences along the straight <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal</b> {{to the west of the}} salient.

40|$|The south valley project (Toshka) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most challenging and promising developing projects in Egypt. Due to the huge longitudinal dune belt and the arid climate conditions, a big amount of sand dunes in the region moved towards the watercourses resulted in filling the watercourses and consequently decreasing the canals efficiency and enhancing the growth of aquatic weeds. Hence, the objective of this research paper is to investigate the quantity of blown sand that precipitated inside the watercourses by conducting an extensive field data measurement in a period of one year around (June 2007 – June 2008). About 20 actual cross-sections located in El-Sheikh Zayed canal, Branch 1 canal, and branch 2 canal are conducted. In addition, about 74 sand collectors and 48 sticks were fixed around the studied canals and the readings were monthly recorded. The results have shown that some <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the studied <b>canals</b> are exposed to the risks of sand dunes movements and consequently the growth of aquatic weeds and alga. The expected amounts of sand that fill in the watercourses are ranged between 150 and 4450 m 3 /year with sand depths up to 20 cm. The sticks revealed that the last <b>reach</b> <b>of</b> main <b>canal</b> (km 35 - km 45) and Branch 3 are the most regions exposed to active sand dunes.
