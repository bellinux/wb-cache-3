50|$|In a {{reactive}} dye, a chromophore (an atom {{or group}} whose presence {{is responsible for}} the colour of a compound) contains a substituent that reacts with the substrate. Reactive dyes have good fastness properties owing to the bonding that occurs during dyeing. Reactive dyes are most commonly used in dyeing of cellulose like cotton or flax, but also wool is dyeable with reactive dyes. <b>Reactive</b> <b>dyeing</b> is the most important method for the coloration of cellulosic fibres. Reactive dyes can also be applied on wool and nylon; in the latter case they are applied under weakly acidic conditions. Reactive dyes have a low utilization degree compared to other types of dyestuff, since the functional group also bonds to water, creating hydrolysis.|$|E

However, preparation of fabrics with castor oil lubricants result in less yellowing and less fabric weight loss, {{as well as}} increased dyeing brilliance.

Once treated with an enzyme, jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be made from marigold flower extract.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Some {{patients}} with occupational asthma resulting {{from exposure to}} <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> have skin reactivity to the causative dyes and specific IgE to <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> {{have been found in}} these patients. However, the usefulness of skin prick tests (SPTs) and serological measurement of specific IgE in screening, diagnosis, and monitoring the occupational asthma resulting from exposure to <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> have not yet been assessed. In this study, the clinical validation of SPTs and measurement of specific IgE to vinyl sulphone <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was evaluated.  METHODS— 42  Patients with occupational asthma from <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> (true positive group) were enrolled. In these the causative <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> was confirmed by bronchial challenge test. 93  Asymptomatic factory workers with negative challenge to the <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> (true negative group) and 16  unexposed controls with negative challenge to the <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> were also enrolled. Skin prick tests were done with 10  mg/ml <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> in 0. 4 % phenol/ 0. 9 % saline. IgE specific to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) was measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).  RESULTS—None of the unexposed controls had a positive response to SPTs. The sensitivity (76. 2 % v 53. 7 %), specificity (91. 4 % v 86. 0 %), positive predictive value (80. 0 % v 62. 9 %), and negative predictive value (89. 5 % v 80. 8 %) of SPTs were higher than those of ELISAs. The mean weal size of reaction to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> was weakly correlated with the ELISA optical density of IgE to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> conjugate in {{patients with}} occupational asthma from <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> (n= 41, r= 0. 337, p< 0. 05). In four patients with occupational asthma from <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> and eight control subjects exposed to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye,</b> IgE specific to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> conjugated to HSA was detected with ELISA even though they showed negative skin reactivity. Six patients completely avoided the <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> for a mean (SD) 27. 8  (10. 3) months, IgE specific to <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> decreased in all six patients (p< 0. 05) during this time.  CONCLUSIONS—Both SPTs and detection of IgE specific to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> in serum samples could be valuable for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring occupational asthma resulting from exposure to <b>reactive</b> <b>dyes.</b> These two tests would complement each other.    Keywords: reactive dye; occupational asthma; skin prick tes...|$|R

Oner and Sahinbaskan [15] carried out all of the stages viz., desizing, scouring, bleaching and dyeing in a single bath without replacing the process water until the end of the dyeing.

40|$|In this study, a novel idea {{of using}} ozone {{oxidation}} {{at the end of}} <b>reactive</b> <b>dyeing</b> process was explored in order to achieve zero discharge dyeing. An advanced oxidative treatment was given during the dyeing process to remove unfixed and hydrolyzed reactive dyes from cotton substrate.

Ozone oxidation continued until the liquor was decolorized around 95 - 100 % and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) was reduced about 80 - 90 %, thus achieving zero liquid discharge dyeing process. The decolouration efficiency of wastewater was regarded as an indicative of removal of dyes from the textile materials because fabric was being washed continuously in the same liquor.

This paper reports on the treatment of cotton fabric with cationic starch (Q-TAC), a commercial product, by batchwise method and pad batch method {{for the first time}} prior to <b>reactive</b> <b>dyeing</b> process. Furthermore, three commercial reactive dyes, based on monochloro triazine, vinyl sulfone and monochlorotriazine + vinyl sulfone chemistry, was applied on the cotton fabrics by continuous (pad-dry-cure) method. The treated cotton fabric by batchwise method produced 70 % higher color yield (KIS) and 20 % enhanced dye fixation (%F) than the untreated cotton fabric. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis revealed the presence of Nls peaks in the treated cotton fabrics. The crystallinity of treated cotton fabrics was reduced in comparison to untreated cotton fabric as revealed by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) showed that the surface of treated cotton fabrics was rougher than untreated cotton fabric due to the deposition of cationic starch. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrum confirmed the existence of quaternary ammonium groups, N+(CH 3) (3), in the treated cotton fabrics. The analysis of color fastness tests demonstrated good to excellent ratings for treated cotton fabrics. In this way, cationic starch treatment of cotton fabric before <b>reactive</b> <b>dyeing</b> process has been proven potentially a more environmentally sustainable method than conventional dyeing method.
