5|$|Increase {{the supply}} of labor and {{aggregate}} compensation by about 0.8 and 0.9 percent over the 2021-2025 period. CBO cited the ACA's expanded eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies and tax credits that rise with income as disincentives to work, so <b>repealing</b> the ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more hours of labor.|$|E
5|$|The Tea Party {{movement}} has been arguing for <b>repealing</b> the Seventeenth Amendment entirely, claiming that it would protect states' rights and reduce {{the power of the}} federal government. On March 2, 2016, the Utah legislature approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 asking Congress to offer an amendment to the United States Constitution that would repeal the Seventeenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Wisconsin {{department}} of the Army and Navy Union {{announced that it was}} on record as of August 1930 as favoring the state option of <b>repealing</b> the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The department was planning to pass on their commitment to the national convention at Buffalo, New York, in October that they favored individual state laws instead on liquor control.|$|E
50|$|A <b>repeal</b> is {{the removal}} or {{reversal}} of a law. There {{are two basic}} types of <b>repeal,</b> a <b>repeal</b> with a re-enactment (or replacement) of the <b>repealed</b> law, or a <b>repeal</b> without any replacement.|$|R
50|$|The <b>repealed</b> in {{the first}} place were <b>repealed</b> by the Statute Law Revision Act 1890. The word <b>repealed</b> in the second place were <b>repealed</b> for the United Kingdom on 1 November 1995 by section 1(1) of, and Group 1 of Part IV of Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law (<b>Repeals)</b> Act 1995.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{campaign}} for the <b>repeal</b> of a particular law gains particular momentum, an advocate of the <b>repeal</b> might become known as a [...] "repealer". The <b>Repeal</b> Association in 19th-century Ireland advocated Irish independence through <b>repeal</b> of the Acts of Union 1800.|$|R
5|$|Governor Lane {{kept the}} legal {{code of the}} {{dissolved}} provisional government, only immediately <b>repealing</b> the law authorizing the minting of the Beaver Coins, as this was incompatible with the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8). The creation of the Washington Territory in 1854 removed the northern half of the Oregon Territory. Established on 14 February 1859, the state of Oregon was composed roughly the western half the territory, the remaining eastern section being added to the Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|Specter {{supported}} some LGBT rights. He {{voted to}} prohibit job {{discrimination based on}} sexual orientation, and was a co-sponsor of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Specter was opposed to same-sex marriage, but was also opposed to a federal ban and supported civil unions. He also became opposed to the Defense of Marriage Act which he once supported. Specter {{voted in favor of}} <b>repealing</b> Don't Ask, Don't Tell in the lame-duck session of the 111th Congress.|$|E
5|$|The November 2011 general {{election}} delivered a landslide victory to the People's Party, whose leader Mariano Rajoy {{said that he}} opposed same-sex marriage, but any decision about <b>repealing</b> the law could be made only after the ruling of the Constitutional Court. On 6 November 2012, the law was upheld by the Court with 8 support votes and 3 against. Minister of Justice Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón announced that the Government will abide the ruling and the law will not be repealed.|$|E
50|$|This {{section was}} <b>repealed</b> by the Statute Law (<b>Repeals)</b> Act 1976. It was <b>repealed</b> for Northern Ireland by the Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977.|$|R
50|$|The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act was <b>repealed</b> by the Discriminatory Legislation {{regarding}} Public Amenities <b>Repeal</b> Act, 1990, and the Population Registration Act was <b>repealed</b> by the Population Registration Act <b>Repeal</b> Act, 1991, but {{the racial}} classifications {{remained on the}} population register until 1992.|$|R
50|$|Council members M.C. Keegan-Ayer and Jessica Fitzwater {{introduced}} a bill to <b>repeal</b> an ordinance designating English as the county's official language. Rather than <b>repeal</b> the ordinance altogether, Chmelik suggested keeping the ordinance in place while asking Council members to only <b>repeal</b> offensive parts of it. The Council did not approve Chmelik's idea. The bill to <b>repeal</b> the ordinance passed; Chmelik voted against the <b>repeal.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{convention}} met on October 25, 1933, and adjourned that day. It elected C. O’Connor Goolrick as its presiding officer. To answer Congressional legislation, it {{ratified the}} 21st Amendment <b>repealing</b> the 18th Amendment {{so as to}} allow the sale of alcoholic beverages. The 21st Amendment is the only amendment that required state convention ratification as of that time. The Amendment was ratified nationally by three-fourths of the states on December 5, 1933.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned {{against the}} Lodge Bill, {{which would have}} {{strengthened}} voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the <b>repealing</b> of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and Giles v. Teasley, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).|$|E
5|$|In January 1976, California's {{study of}} the {{economic}} impact of its law <b>repealing</b> prohibitions of use went into effect. The law reduced the penalty for personal possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a felony to a citable misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $100. Possession of more than an ounce was made a misdemeanor, making the maximum fine $500 and/or six months in jail. After the law went into effect, the state's annual spending towards marijuana laws went down 74%. Prior to the law, the state had been spending from $35 million to $100 million.|$|E
50|$|The Act, except {{sections}} 3 and 4, was <b>repealed</b> by the Statute Law Revision Act 1867. The remaining {{sections were}} <b>repealed</b> by the Statute Law (<b>Repeals)</b> Act 1969.|$|R
50|$|A <b>repeal</b> without savings {{eliminates}} the <b>repealed</b> statute completely.|$|R
5000|$|In {{paragraph}} 2(2), {{the words}} from [...] "but nothing" [...] onwards were <b>repealed</b> by section 1(1) of, and Part XIII of Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law (<b>Repeals)</b> Act 1977. Paragraph 2 was <b>repealed</b> by Group 1 of Part IX of Schedule 1 to the Statute Law (<b>Repeals)</b> Act 1998.|$|R
5|$|The Act {{created a}} new offence for {{publishing}} obscene material, <b>repealing</b> the common law offence of obscene libel which was previously used, and also allows Justices of the Peace to issue warrants allowing the police to seize such materials. At {{the same time it}} creates two defences; firstly, the defence of innocent dissemination, and secondly the defence of public good. The Act has been used in several high-profile cases, such as the trials of Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley's Lover and Oz for the Schoolkids OZ issue.|$|E
5|$|When Singapore {{joined the}} Federation of Malaya in 1963, the Malayan ISA was {{extended}} to Singapore. The Act was retained in Singapore even after its separation from Malaysia in 1965. The current version of the Act is known as Chapter 143 of the 1985 Revised Edition. In September 2011, {{the debate over whether}} the ISA should be retained was re-opened after Malaysia announced that it was considering <b>repealing</b> the ISA. Prime Minister Najib Razak stated that the Act would be abolished and replaced by new laws to safeguard peace and order.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, {{only five}} years after its passage, the Act was repealed. Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants {{following}} the execution of King Charles I of England and {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to <b>repealing</b> the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion. Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692.|$|E
50|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to gain enough support to force a referendum, with a quorum of 25% of registered voters required - equivalent to 589,823 voters. The first attempt gained 448,265 in favour for a partial <b>repeal</b> and 21,473 for a full <b>repeal.</b> The second effort obtained 693,668 for a partial <b>repeal</b> and 14,960 for a full <b>repeal.</b> On 15 October 1992 the Electoral Court decided on a referendum on a partial <b>repeal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{the rest}} of the Act has been <b>repealed,</b> the <b>repealed</b> {{sections}} still apply to sex crimes committed before the <b>repeal,</b> such as in the Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004.|$|R
50|$|On 20 June 1990 the South African Parliament {{voted to}} <b>repeal</b> the Act, and on 15 October 1990 {{it was finally}} <b>repealed</b> by the Discriminatory Legislation {{regarding}} Public Amenities <b>Repeal</b> Act.|$|R
5|$|Lord Rockingham, {{with the}} support of Pitt and the King, {{repealed}} Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act, but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created Earl of Chatham. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in <b>repealing</b> the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in New York City. Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and the Duke of Grafton took over the government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the general election, and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. Wilkes was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner-up as the victor. Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin's {{plan was}} to unite the slave states around a set of minimum {{concessions}} {{to see if the}} North would accept them as an alternative to war. The concessions included a constitutional amendment <b>repealing</b> any state law that interfered with enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, passage of amendments to the Fugitive Slave Act ensuring that any state that would not return a fugitive slave or obstructed a slave's return would compensate the owner of the slave, passage of a law requiring extradition of anyone indicted by a grand jury for enticing the escape of a slave, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing slavery in all current and future territories south of 36 degrees north latitude, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing all states the right of using the Mississippi River, and provide protection for southern states in the U.S. Senate from oppressive slavery legislation. After the slave state governors refused Magoffin's plan, he endorsed the Crittenden Compromise, authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{voted against}} the Defense of Marriage Act, the Federal Marriage Amendment, and {{was in favor of}} <b>repealing</b> the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. He also {{supported}} gun control, voting for the Brady Bill and supporting a reinstatement of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. At different times he voted to ban flag-burning and partial-birth abortions, though he reversed his positions on both issues. On education, he expressed support for the public education system, universal pre-kindergarten, and full funding for the No Child Left Behind program. Moran was given a 100% rating by the NARAL and 0% by the National Right to Life Committee, indicating a pro-choice voting record. He also voted to expand research of embryonic stem cells and to allow minors to go across state lines to receive abortions.|$|E
50|$|Section 18(3) <b>repealed</b> {{sections}} 4 and 6 of the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888. It was <b>repealed</b> by Part XI of the Schedule to the Statute Law (<b>Repeals)</b> Act 1974.|$|R

50|$|The Act was <b>repealed</b> by section 28 of the Constitution Act 1986 in New Zealand. By {{the time}} of its <b>repeal,</b> only 18 of the Act's {{original}} 82 sections remained, of which a number were regarded as no longer effective. In the UK it was <b>repealed</b> by the Statute Law (<b>Repeals)</b> Act 1989.|$|R
5|$|The ACA's major {{provisions}} {{came into}} force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured {{share of the}} population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20–24 million additional people covered during 2016. The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to major changes to individual insurance markets. Both involved new spending, funded {{through a combination of}} new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, and that <b>repealing</b> the ACA would increase the deficit. The law also enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of <b>repealing</b> the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} checks and {{balances}} built into the state constitution that limit {{the power of the}} General Assembly. Other clauses allow the General Assembly to balance and limit the authority of the other branches of the government. Among these {{checks and balances}} is the governor's authority to veto any bill passed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may in turn override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a super majority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively <b>repealing</b> the law. The General Assembly could then override the court's decision by amending the state constitution to include the law. The General Assembly has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor's office. Although the governor has gained more power in the past fifty years, the General Assembly still retains the power to remove much of that authority.|$|E
50|$|Section 13(2) <b>repealed</b> the Official Secrets Act 1889. It was <b>repealed</b> by the Statute Law Revision Act 1927 {{because it}} was spent {{by virtue of the}} Interpretation Act 1889 (effect of <b>repeal).</b>|$|R
50|$|Section 8 was <b>repealed</b> by the Statute Law (<b>Repeals)</b> Act 2008.|$|R
