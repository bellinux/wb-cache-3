40|$|International audienceIt {{is often}} assumed that {{implicit}} evaluations {{are influenced by}} early childhood experiences, whereas explicit evaluations reflect <b>recent</b> <b>experiences.</b> However, previous findings supporting this assumption remain ambiguous {{as to whether the}} differential effects of early versus <b>recent</b> <b>experiences</b> are driven by their temporal distance or their affective versus cognitive nature. Controlling for affectivity by using a predominantly affective attitude object (i. e., religion), the present study found that both implicit and explicit evaluations were related to recent, but not early, experiences. This pattern consistently emerged for self-reported experiences as well as independent reports from parents. Moreover, the relation of <b>recent</b> <b>experiences</b> to one type of evaluation remained significant after controlling for the respective other type of evaluation, suggesting that <b>recent</b> <b>experiences</b> influenced implicit and explicit evaluations independently. Implications for attitudinal dissociations and processes of attitude change are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Stress {{is known}} to {{contribute}} to and trigger psychotic states. A history of psychologically traumatic events, and the <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> of a stressful event, can both {{contribute to the development}} of psychosis. Short-lived psychosis triggered by stress is known as brief reactive psychosis, and patients may spontaneously recover normal functioning within two weeks. In some rare cases, individuals may remain in a state of full-blown psychosis for many years, or perhaps have attenuated psychotic symptoms (such as low intensity hallucinations) present at most times.|$|E

25|$|PAs are {{employed}} by the United States Department of State as Foreign Service Health Practitioners (FSHP). PAs working in this capacity may be deployed {{anywhere in the world}} where there is a State Department facility. They provide primary care to U.S. government employees and their families in American embassies and consulates around the world. An important part of their jobs is to get to know what resources are available locally that they can count on in an emergency. FSHPs have some other important roles, such as advising their ambassadors on the health situation in the country and provide health education to the diplomatic community. In order to be considered for the position of FSHP these PAs must be licensed and have at least two years of <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> in primary care.|$|E
25|$|The Phantom's {{service as}} a {{frontline}} fighter would be short-lived. Its limited range and light armament– notably, its inability to carry bombs– made it best suited for duty as a point-defence interceptor aircraft. However, its speed and rate of climb were only slightly better than existing propeller-powered fighters and fell short of other contemporary jets, such as the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, prompting concerns that the Phantom would be outmatched by future enemy jets it might soon face. Moreover, <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> in World War II had demonstrated the value of naval fighters that could double as fighter-bombers, a capability the Phantom lacked. Finally, the aircraft exhibited some design deficiencies– its navigational avionics were poor, it could not accommodate newly developed ejection seats, {{and the location of}} the machine guns in the upper nose caused pilots to be dazzled by muzzle flash.|$|E
25|$|Morale was {{considered}} to be high and the army had <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> of military operations. The Italian navy had prospered under the Fascist regime, which had paid for fast, well-built and well-armed ships and a large submarine fleet but the navy lacked experience and training. The air force had been ready for war in 1936 but had stagnated and was not considered by the British to be capable of maintaining a high rate of operations. The 5th Army with eight divisions was based in Tripolitania, the western half of Libya opposite Tunisia and the 10th Army with six infantry divisions, held Cyrenaica in the east. When war was declared, the 10th Army deployed the 1st Libyan Division Sibelle on the frontier from Giarabub to Sidi Omar and XXI Corps from Sidi Omar to the coast, Bardia and Tobruk.

25|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} sleep (REM) has since its discovery been {{closely associated with}} dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common experimental method for obtaining dream reports; 80% of neurotypical people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances. Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing, and to estimate the duration of their dreams as longer. Lucid dreams are reported far more often in REM sleep. (In fact these {{could be considered a}} hybrid state combining essential elements of REM sleep and waking consciousness.) The mental events which occur during REM most commonly have dream hallmarks including narrative structure, convincingness (experiential resemblance to waking life), and incorporation of instinctual themes. Sometimes they include elements of the dreamer's <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> taken directly from episodic memory. By one estimate, 80% of dreams occur during REM.|$|E
25|$|January 1996: A {{listener}} from Penang {{called in}} {{during one of}} Patrick's show to relate his <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> {{with a member of}} the police force. At a roadblock, a policeman had stopped him for allegedly drinking and driving, and asked for a bribe from the listener.

When he said that he did not have a phone, the policeman allegedly offered him the use of his mobile phone. After the show, SAC Supian Amat lodged a police report against Patrick under the instruction of Rahim Noor, then the IGP of Malaysia, resulting in Patrick being called to the police station for interviews. The media went to town with this issue; famous local cartoonist Lat drew a satirical cartoon on the incident which was published in the New Straits Times.|$|E

30|$|Trust is {{modulated}} by {{features that}} affect how trusters judge outcomes, {{such as the}} satisfaction or violation of a commitment. First, trust assessment is subjective. Trusters differ in how they reward or penalize a trustee when a commitment is discharged or violated, respectively. Second, trust assessment depends on the truster’s memory: trusters with limited memory would tend to forget all but (some varying number of) <b>recent</b> <b>experiences.</b> <b>Recent</b> <b>experiences</b> {{may turn out to}} be more predictive of future experiences (that trust is about) than past experiences. Third, the effect on trust of a commitment’s outcome would be greater when the commitment is more important.|$|R
25|$|The {{assumption}} of inevitable declining volumes {{of oil and}} gas produced per unit of effort is contrary to <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> in the US. In the United States, as of 2017, there has been an ongoing decade-long increase in the productivity {{of oil and gas}} drilling in all the major tight oil and gas plays. The US Energy Information Administration reports, for instance, that in the Bakken Shale production area of North Dakota, the volume of oil produced per day of drilling rig time in January 2017 was 4 times the oil volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and nearly 10 times the oil volume per day of ten years previous, in January 2007. In the Marcellus gas region of the northeast, The volume of gas produced per day of drilling time in January 2017 was 3 times the gas volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and 28 times the gas volume per day of drilling ten years previous, in January 2007.|$|E
25|$|Command of {{the ship}} thereby devolved upon the ship's third officer, Charles Rivers, but Rivers, {{apparently}} {{in a state of}} shock, proved incapable of action. Fortunately, one {{of the ship}}'s small complement of passengers, Cornelius L. Brady, was a ships' master himself with <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> of such a crisis. Brady had been the hero in the shipwreck of the SS Atlantic less than a year prior, where his courageous action in personally establishing a rope to shore was credited with saving as many as 250 lives. Now he was now about to lead another rescue effort. Brady quickly ordered the crew to secure the damaged upper forward hatches with hatches from the lower deck, in order to stop the further flow of water into the ship. A delegation of the crew then implored Brady to take command, a proposal which he accepted. Brady made his way ondeck to the midships wheelhouse, where he ordered the helmsman to turn the ship into the wind. He then rang the engine room to reduce the ship's speed to dead slow.|$|E
25|$|From {{an early}} stage, the GLC and its leader Ken Livingstone and finance chair John McDonnell were heavily {{involved}} in planning the campaign to defy rate-capping. Their involvement also took in the Inner London Education Authority which was technically a special committee of the Greater London Council, consisting of members elected to the GLC from inner London, plus one member {{from each of the}} inner London boroughs. As both the GLC and ILEA set a precept rather than a rate, both were under a legal requirement to set a budget by 10 March. Livingstone was conscious that the Labour group on the GLC had <b>recent</b> <b>experience</b> of deciding whether to defy the law, having split 23 to 22 to vote in 1981 not to comply with a House of Lords judgment ordering it to raise public transport fares. He was not confident of persuading more councillors to support defying the law on budgeting, but because the Government was intending to abolish the GLC on 31 March 1985, he went along with supporting the campaign.|$|E

25|$|On {{the whole}} {{the people of}} the Crown of Castile had rallied to support Philip V, but in the {{autonomous}} Crown of Aragon there had arisen centres of discontent. In the Principality of Catalonia, as {{in other parts of the}} peninsula, the people had differing opinions about supporting the Duke of Anjou or Archduke Charles, but there was a strong anti-French feeling rooted in <b>recent</b> <b>experience,</b> especially the attack on Barcelona in 1697. In early June 1705 a small number of Catalans – in return for men, weapons, and support for their own constitutional liberties, or Catalan constitutions – committed themselves to support Charles and the Allied cause. This new allegiance encouraged the English to prepare an expeditionary force to Spain's Mediterranean provinces, thereby opening a two front war in the peninsula: Das Minas, the Huguenot Earl of Galway (Schomberg's replacement), and Baron Fagel attacking from Portugal; and the Earl of Peterborough and Charles III campaigning in the north-east. The arrival of the Allied fleet off the Mediterranean coast not only influenced disaffected Catalans, however. In the Kingdom of Valencia there was strong anti-French feeling based on trade rivalry, but there was also repercussions of a recent peasant rebellion against the Valencian nobility, which was never fully extinguished and which the Allies were able to exploit. In the Kingdom of Aragon there was also strong Francophobia, based largely on commercial rivalry and proximity, but Philip V's attempts to raise taxes for the war effort without the approval of the Catalan Courts, to appoint a Castilian viceroy, and to move and quarter French and Castilian troops within the kingdom, were also causes of friction, which went against the spirit of their own Constitutions.|$|E
