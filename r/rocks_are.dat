5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks {{are part of the}} Franciscan Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as greenstone. For the most part, these <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of the}} creek, schist and other metamorphic rocks {{can be found}}, while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very fossiliferous, and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that existed {{at the time of}} their creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Metagreywackes and metapelites {{from two}} areas {{traversing}} {{one of these}} aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied. Most of the Slave province <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> granitic with metamorphosed Yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic rocks. Isotopic ages of these rocks is around , {{the time of the}} Kenoran orogeny. Rocks comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism, intrusion and basement remobilization typical of Archean terranes. Migmatites, batholithic intrusive and granulitic metamorphic rocks show foliation and compositional banding; the <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists. Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded (isoclinal) or occur in plunging anticlines.|$|E
50|$|In geology, metavolcanic <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} {{metamorphic}} rock. Such a <b>rock</b> <b>was</b> first {{produced by}} a volcano, either as lava or tephra. Then, the <b>rock</b> <b>was</b> buried underneath subsequent <b>rock</b> and <b>was</b> subjected to high pressures and temperatures, causing the rock to recrystallize. Metavolcanic <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> commonly found in greenstone belts.|$|R

5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{found on}} western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain. Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney.|$|E
5|$|Most caves {{created from}} {{dissolved}} <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> formed in limestone or dolomite, but Oregon Caves {{was formed in}} marble. Of the more than 3,900 cave systems managed by the NPS, only those in Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve, Kings Canyon National Park, and Great Basin National Park have marble caves.|$|E
5|$|On the {{submarine}} {{portion of the}} island, many marine species are found. Starfish are abundant, as are sea urchins and limpets.

5|$|Some {{chemical}} {{differences exist}} among the Negriales rocks, the Lastarria lavas, and the Lastarria pyroclastics. The Negriales <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> the richest in silicon dioxide, and their trace element composition sharply diverges as well. The Negriales rocks may originate from parental magmas {{that are different}} from the main Lastarria magmas.|$|E
5|$|The Wabigoon subprovince is a {{formerly}} active volcanic island chain, {{made up of}} metavolcanic-metasedimentary intrusions. These metamorphosed <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> volcanically derived greenstone belts, and {{are surrounded}} and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths. The subprovince's greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics, felsic batholiths and felsic plutons aged from 3,000 to 2,670 million years old.|$|E
5|$|The {{characteristics}} of boulder problems depend {{largely on the}} type of rock being climbed. Granite, for example, often features long cracks and slabs. Sandstone <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. Other common bouldering rocks include limestone and volcanic rock.|$|E
50|$|In geology, {{metasedimentary}} <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} metamorphic rock. Such a <b>rock</b> <b>was</b> first {{formed through}} the deposition and solidification of sediment. Then, the <b>rock</b> <b>was</b> buried underneath subsequent <b>rock</b> and <b>was</b> subjected to high pressures and temperatures, causing the rock to recrystallize. The overall composition of a metasedimentary <b>rock</b> can <b>be</b> used to identify the original sedimentary rock, even {{where they have been}} subject to high-grade metamorphism and intense deformation.|$|R
50|$|Danish <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> <b>rock</b> {{music played}} in Denmark. Starting in the 1950s, <b>rock</b> music <b>was</b> {{imported}} from the United States of America, where it was becoming extremely popular. Danish jazz artists began adopting the rock genre. Towards {{the end of the}} 1950s and throughout the 1960s, Danish <b>rock</b> <b>was</b> heavily influenced by British music, one of the genres being R&B. By the end of the 1960s, Danish <b>rock</b> <b>was</b> again being influenced by American rock. During the 1980s, Danish rock consisted mainly of pop-rock bands. In the current Danish rock scene, Indie <b>rock</b> <b>is</b> very popular.|$|R

5|$|The {{ecology of}} the area {{includes}} ancient woodland and calcareous grassland which supports nationally rare species including the Cheddar pink. The underlying <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> Carboniferous Limestone containing phreatic caves at Shute Shelve Cavern and Picken's Hole from which fossils dating from the Middle Devensian have been recovered.|$|E
5|$|The oldest <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> of Silurian age (443–419 {{million years}} ago), the most southerly known outcrop of rocks {{of this age}} in Britain. They make up a {{sequence}} of lavas, tuffs (volcanic ash), shales and mudstones in a narrow outcrop to the northeast of Shepton Mallet, in the eastern Mendip Hills.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the {{granitic}} rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E
50|$|Cook's Head <b>Rock</b> <b>is</b> a {{phonolite}} basalt rock {{standing on}} the Chrystall's Beach expanse closely north of the rivermouth settlement Toko Mouth of South Otago, New Zealand.

5|$|Few fossils {{have been}} found in the Ringbone Formation, the only {{significant}} one being a specimen that is either Albertosaurus sp. or Daspletosaurus sp., known from a tooth and vertebrae. The only reason the Ringbone Formation is assigned to the Kirtlandian age is because the <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> the same age as the Fort Crittenden Formation, which contains one of the index taxa of the Kirtlandian.|$|E
5|$|Fumarolic {{activity}} affects {{surrounding rocks}} and pyroclastics. Carbonates, opal, and white covers of possibly aluminum sulfate and calcium sulfate have been formed. Gypsum formed from the sulfur {{of the volcano}} {{is found in the}} form of crystals in the upper valleys of Taftan. Sinter and hydrothermally altered <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> found farther down. Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and tridymite. Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of diabase rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.|$|E

5|$|Licancabur has erupted {{primarily}} andesite, but basaltic andesite and dacite {{have also}} been found. The <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> dark and grey-coloured. Basaltic andesite {{was found in the}} older lavas, and dacite in the more-recent ones. Although the rocks have a seriate texture, the groundmass is hyalopilitic. Phenocrysts include amphibole, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite; olivine is found in andesite, and biotite in dacites. Plagioclase is the most common. The amount of phenocrysts in Licancabur's rocks is smaller than that in other Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes, such as Lascar.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Loa has {{probably}} been erupting for at least 700,000years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000years ago. The oldest-known dated <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> not older than 200,000years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which {{has been responsible for}} the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years. The slow drift of the Pacific Plate will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the hotspot within 500,000 to one million years from now, at which point it will become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} <b>rocks</b> <b>are</b> {{found on}} western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain. Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney. Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E
