5|$|Extreme <b>reluctance</b> to {{initiate}} or accept comfort and affection, even from familiar adults, especially when distressed.|$|E
5|$|On the fifty-fourth {{anniversary of}} D-Day, June6, 1998, then Transportation Minister Tony Clement {{unveiled}} two signs in Ottawa and formally declared {{the entire length}} of Highway416 as the Veterans Memorial Highway, despite earlier <b>reluctance</b> from previous minister Al Palladini.|$|E
5|$|Pietro Colonna {{and three}} bishops brought {{the news of}} Morrone's {{election}} to his mountain-top hermitage. Contemporary sources are emphatic in noting Morrone's <b>reluctance</b> to accept his election; for example, Petrarch recounts his attempt to flee.|$|E
5|$|Rapoport {{has argued}} that Sorabji's <b>reluctance</b> to make {{commercial}} recordings of his music stemmed from a fear of losing control over the making of future recordings of it, because of UK copyright laws of the time.|$|E
5|$|A staunch {{republican who}} deplored {{all forms of}} social privilege, {{including}} hereditary peerages, he accepted Kinnock's offer of {{a seat in the}} House of Lords with some <b>reluctance,</b> receiving a life peerage as Baron Dormand of Easington, of Easington in the County of Durham on 13 October 1987.|$|E
5|$|An {{enduring}} theme {{during and}} after the oil boom has been a <b>reluctance</b> among Texans to relinquish their identity and a stubbornness in maintaining their cultural heritage in the face of drastic changes to the state brought by the sudden wealth. Despite its growth and industrialization, Texas culture in the mid-20th century remained distinct from the other industrial centers of the nation.|$|E
5|$|Attendance was low, in {{part due}} to Tech fans' <b>reluctance</b> to travel across the country and pay high prices for the chance to do so. Travel agents {{indicated}} low business in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game, and Tech sold approximately 5,000tickets—a far lower total than the Hokies' two previous bowl games, when 25,000tickets each were sold to games in Florida and Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|By 1897, {{the year}} of the launch of Spinks & Company, he had evidently {{overcome}} his seeming <b>reluctance</b> to face World Champions again (perhaps from having several years' experience with his own product prototypes). Spinks competed in (but did not win) a December 3 open tournament.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of the MPC has {{centred on}} its {{predominant}} focus on inflation {{to the detriment}} of growth and employment, although that criticism may have been mitigated by the March 2013 revisions to the committee's remit. There have also been complaints about the <b>reluctance</b> of lenders to pass on rate changes, and {{about the extent to which}} the introduction and management of QE have risked politicising the committee.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to establish an}} officer candidate school to train an indigenous officer corps from among Haiti's educated upper class failed due to a <b>reluctance</b> among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American occupation, and by {{the perception that the}} methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, The New York Times {{reporter}} Jayson Blair {{was forced}} to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times initial <b>reluctance</b> to fire him.|$|E
5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 that he should be awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though not without some <b>reluctance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Originally, Manstein {{was promised}} four panzer divisions. Due to German <b>reluctance</b> to weaken certain sectors by redeploying German units, {{the task of}} opening a {{corridor}} to the German 6th Army fell to the 4th Panzer Army. The German force was pitted against several Soviet armies tasked with {{the destruction of the}} encircled German forces and their offensive around the lower Chir River.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{proposed}} to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, {{that he once}} again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue {{the appearance of a}} still-functional constitution. Feigning <b>reluctance,</b> he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.|$|E
5|$|The fellowship's polity is {{a hybrid}} of presbyterian and congregational models. This tension between local {{independence}} and national authority {{is seen in the}} AG's historical <b>reluctance</b> to refer to itself as a denomination, preferring the terms fellowship and movement. The national headquarters are in Springfield, Missouri, where the administrative and executive offices and Gospel Publishing House are located.|$|E
5|$|When Poland {{entered the}} Western camp in April 1939, General Gamelin {{reminded}} General Kasprzycki of the Polish {{role in the}} dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. According to historian Paul N. Hehn, Poland’s annexation of Teschen {{may have contributed to}} the British and French <b>reluctance</b> to attack the Germans with greater forces in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Willard Spiegelman, in {{his study}} of Romantic poetry, {{suggests}} that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator's <b>reluctance</b> to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation. Some critics provide other explanations, and William Ober claims that Keats's description of indolence may have arisen from the use of opium.|$|E
5|$|With {{almost no}} land left to develop for housing, Teaneck's {{population}} {{is likely to}} remain stable for the foreseeable future. A <b>reluctance</b> to permit high-rise development as a means to increase population density also places a limit on growth. Changes in family size and the possibility of zoning changes to allow denser construction are some of the few influences that may affect population over time.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the <b>reluctance</b> of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E
5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a <b>reluctance</b> by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a <b>reluctance</b> to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{allied with}} Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three {{countries}} that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate {{in the conflict}} between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. They created the Contadora support group, to support the Contadora group from South America. Both groups negotiated together, but ultimately failed because of the <b>reluctance</b> of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E
5|$|Comedy Central {{has decided}} not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a {{decision}} we've made with great <b>reluctance.</b> Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned numberone priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.|$|E
5|$|Considerably {{shorter than}} the average footballer at 5ft 7in, Gibbs made up for his {{physical}} disadvantage with positional play, determination, accurate tackling, and staying on his feet. Although a defender, his lack of goals (7 in 491 appearances) and <b>reluctance</b> to get forward were often remarked upon. Gibbs refuted the suggestion that he didn't attack enough, while former managers Roeder and Taylor both considered Gibbs to be an excellent crosser of the ball when he did venture forward. He scored his first professional goal during his 59th game. By comparison, Gibbs' long-term successor at right-back, Lloyd Doyley, scored his first professional goal on his 269th appearance.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{has been}} faulted for poor {{coordination}} {{and management of}} his generals. This includes his <b>reluctance</b> to resolve a dispute between Leonidas Polk, a personal friend, and Braxton Bragg, who was defeated in important battles and distrusted by his subordinates. He was similarly reluctant to relieve the capable but overcautious Joseph E. Johnston until, after numerous frustrations which he detailed in a March 1, 1865 letter to Col. James Phelan of Mississippi, he replaced him with John Bell Hood.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{years of}} heavy promotion, the Deseret {{alphabet}} was never widely adopted. This <b>reluctance</b> was {{partly due to}} prohibitive costs; the project had already cost the early church $20,000, with $6,000 going to Pratt as remuneration for his transcription effort {{and most of the}} rest going to cutting metal type featuring the new alphabet and printing costs. In 1859, Parley P. Pratt estimated that the cost of supplying all Utah Territory schoolchildren with suitable textbooks would cost over US$5,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{was born}} in Amherst, Massachusetts. Although part of a {{prominent}} family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much {{of her life in}} reclusive isolation. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her <b>reluctance</b> to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence. Dickinson was a recluse for the later years of her life.|$|E
5|$|Educators face {{considerable}} challenges {{due to the}} nation's {{dispersed population}} and {{a certain degree of}} <b>reluctance</b> on the part of parents {{to send their children to}} school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, and more than half of the population is illiterate. Higher education is provided at the University of N'Djamena. At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates of Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|Few zoos hold termites, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} in keeping them captive and to the <b>reluctance</b> of authorities to permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations– resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.|$|E
5|$|For long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's {{decision}} not to mount an immediate pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the exhaustion of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's <b>reluctance</b> to act {{could have been the}} unusual command relationship he had with Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made it quite clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.|$|E
5|$|Freda {{felt that}} I Vampiri {{did not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} <b>reluctance</b> to an Italian interpretation of the horror genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton {{to give the impression}} that the film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members would go on to direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli who directed The Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E
5|$|From January to June 2007, {{the band}} toured the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia, {{including}} a headline slot on the UK's Give It A Name festival {{and playing the}} main stage at The Bamboozle festival. Despite the band's <b>reluctance</b> towards the press {{around the time of}} the release of the album, they were featured in Alternative Press, a cover story for Rock Sound, Kerrang!, and NME. The band went on tour for the fall of 2007, with openers Thrice and MewithoutYou. In early 2008, Brand New toured Australia and New Zealand on the Big Day Out festival.|$|E
5|$|He {{is the son}} of Jeanne and Jerome Comminges, and {{has three}} brothers. Comminges was born in Les Abymes, Guadeloupe, and was raised in Petit-Canal. He states that he grew up always wanting to be a {{professional}} footballer; playing football in the streets in his hometown before playing organised football from the age of seven upwards, despite his mothers initial <b>reluctance</b> for him to pursue a career in football. Following his move to France, Comminges attended Louis Thuillier High School in Amiens.|$|E
5|$|He {{retained}} command until September 1938, when he {{was appointed}} to the Admiralty as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, although he did not actually take up this post until December 1939. He accepted this shore job with <b>reluctance</b> since he loathed administration, but the Board of Admiralty's high regard of him was evident. For six months during an illness of Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, the then First Sea Lord, he deputised for Backhouse on the Committee of Imperial Defence and on the Admiralty Board. In 1939 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), becoming known as Sir Andrew Cunningham.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the State Roads Commission, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Public Roads (the {{predecessor}} of the Federal Highway Administration) (FHWA) created tentative {{plans to}} transfer the NPS segment of the parkway {{to the state of}} Maryland, who would then rebuild it to modern freeway standards, with trucks and buses permitted throughout. The plan collapsed due to the state's <b>reluctance</b> to spend the money necessary to reconstruct the parkway, {{which was one of the}} most dangerous roads in the NPS road system.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of fertiliser subsidies, the Fertiliser Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land and boost crop production. It {{has been reported that}} this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. The FISP fertiliser subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, and farmers developed <b>reluctance</b> to purchase fertilisers and other agricultural inputs on the open markets that remained.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Sega {{noted that}} the game was {{frequently}} requested by fans as a title for re-release. The company {{has been criticized for}} their <b>reluctance</b> to do so; 1UP.com and Hardcore Gamer 101 felt Sonic Gems Collection (2005) to be incomplete as it lacked the title. In 2010, the head of Sonic Team, Takashi Iizuka, expressed interest in developing a sequel to the game. Also taking an interest was Christian Whitehead, the developer of the 2011 remaster of Sonic CD, who said in a 2014 interview that he would possibly be open to remaking the game using the Retro Engine.|$|E
