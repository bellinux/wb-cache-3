50|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was {{dedicated}} and McLouth Steel became {{able to produce}} iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton basic oxygen furnace (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in North America to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton electric arc furnaces. The reversing Steckel mill {{was replaced by a}} six stand continuous 60 in hot strip rolling mill and a <b>roughing</b> <b>stand</b> was added to compliment the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were also added along with the slitters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The slab {{edge rolling}} {{has been widely}} used in the <b>roughing</b> <b>stand</b> of hot strip mill to control {{the width of the}} slab. However, the slab edge rolling and {{consequent}} horizontal rolling will cause a significant width change in the head part and tail part of the slab, which have to be trimmed before the finishing stands. The short stroke control (SSC) technology has been developed to overcome this problem. In this paper, the finite element method (FEM) has been used to simulate the unsteady edge rolling process. Three SSC control curves have been compared in order to obtain the best width control result. The optimized SSC control curve has been applied to the industrial rolling mill...|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{width control}} is a key issue in hot strip rolling process. The edge rolling has been widely used in the <b>roughing</b> <b>stand</b> of hot strip mill to control {{the width of the}} slab. However, the edge rolling and {{consequent}} horizontal rolling will cause a significant width change in the head part and tail part of the slab, which have to be trimmed before the finishing stands. Based on the width reduction deformation curve of the head and tail along the longitudinal direction of slab, the short stroke control (SSC) technology has been developed to overcome this problem. The finite element method has been used to simulate the unsteady edge rolling process. Three short stroke control curves have been compared in order to obtain the best width control result. The optimized short stroke control curve has been applied to the automatic width control system of industrial hot rolling mill, and good performance is obtained...|$|E
40|$|Two alloys grades {{for work}} rolls {{used in the}} <b>roughing</b> <b>stand</b> of Hot Strip Mill (HSM) are compared. The first grade known as High Chromium Steel (HCS) is {{presently}} {{the most widely used}} alloy for such an application, while the second one known as semi-High Speed Steel (semi-HSS) is the new grade developed to improve the overall performance of the work roll in the roughing stands of the HSM. In the present paper, the new semi-HSS grade is studied starting from three chemical compositions closed one to another, the variation in the alloying elements is intended to assess, on one hand the effect of a small increase of the carbon content, {{and on the other hand}} the influence of the addition of a strong MC carbide forming element. The comparison of HCS and semi-HSS grades involves many fields. Regarding the metallurgical aspect, such a comparison led to the enhancement of the solidification range, the crystallization behavior and the microstructure in the as-cast condition for both grades. Furthermore, corrosion behavior and performances of the work rolls in service are compared. Various techniques are used in order to characterize both grades, such as Differential Thermal Analysis (to determine phase transformations temperatures, the crystallization behavior and the interval of solidification), hardness measurements, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy associated with energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy (to determine the nature and the composition of phases, especially matrix and carbides). Finally micro-macro relations between the nature of the microstructure and the properties of HCS and semi-HSS rolls grades in service conditions could be established. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{main objectives}} were put and realize in the article: {{to confirm the}} peculiarities {{of the process of}} loads generating inside the machine’s elastic system with regard to both the level of external action and own elastic characteristics of the machine; determine the load’s spectrum for iron and steel machines of sheet rolling mills, including useful and harmful loads, acting jointly and determining its strength and durability and also to work out the methods of reducing and limiting the loads, generated in iron and steel machines. In his previous publications the author mentioned many times that iron and steel machines possessed low «quality» (i. e. technological load in relation to general load), so for these machines the share of useful loads could evaluate but {{a small portion of the}} general load. For the field lines of these machines the «quality» can vary within 0  ≤ K ≤  1. 0. At K =  0 the entire load remains parasitic. At K =  1. 0 the entire load is useful (technological). For rolling mills their «quality» for the entire operating time in the bulk of field lines is quite high and stable. The exception is the time of transition process (metal gripping with rolls, acceleration, slowing down etc.). For sheet and plates rolling mills the «quality» value at gripping is 0. 2  ≤ K ≤  0. 5, the time of gripping being tenth fractions of a second. The «quality» can be raised by changing working characteristics of the corresponding field lines. The most promising variant of alternating the working characteristics is developing and implementing of special active appliances. The essence of the method of reduction of the rate at metal gripping, proposed by the author is in mounting of an elastic energy accumulator in the drive of the <b>roughing</b> <b>stand</b> of 1, 700 wide-strip rolling mill of «Ilyich iron and steel works» PSC, which can be rotated by 120 … 180 ° at nominal loads of the drive. It allows to reduce by two times the gripping rate 9 and accelerate), the number of mill’s engine revolutions, remaining the same. In this case the energy accumulating shaft, equipped with an elastic element, made of up-to-date polyurethane elastomers is an active part. i. e. the part, that has a sufficient influence upon the value of generated loads.

40|$|AbstractFatigue {{behaviour}} of high {{chromium steel}} (HCS) for rolls is presented. Rolls are double layered {{and they are}} predicted to be used at <b>roughing</b> <b>stands</b> in hot strip mills. Shells of rolls are made of high chromium steel and for cores a combination of pherlitic – ferritic nodular graphite iron is used. Due to compression loading of rolls, where slabs are reduced to the long stripes, special specimens have been used and tested under compression loading conditions. The tested specimens are manufactured under similar conditions (cooling after centrifugal casting, heat treatment, and rough and fine grinding) as real rolls. The residual stresses {{as a consequence of}} mechanical and thermal treatment of rolls (specimens) are considered during experimental determination of treated material parameters and are not taken into account in the subsequent calculation procedures. The tests specimens have been loaded with pure pulsating compression load (load ratio R= 0 in compression) at different load levels. Therefore, a typical S-N curve and appropriate fatigue parameters (fatigue strength coefficient σf’ and fatigue strength exponent b) are determined. The experimental results determined in this study can serve as a basis for the further determination of service life of rolls using stress-life approach...|$|R

40|$|Bimetallic rolls {{used in the}} <b>roughing</b> <b>stands</b> of the Hot Strip Mill require mixed {{properties}} as a {{high wear}} resistance for the shell material and an enhanced toughness for the core material. The bimetallic roll studied in this paper is obtained from a vertical spin casting process followed by cooling and subsequent heat treatments. Failure of the compound roll sometimes occurs during the cooling stage of the casting route or later during the thermal treatments. It requires to deeply investigate the thermo mechanical metallurgical interactions generated during cooling and heat treatment {{in order to find}} the origin of cracks. For this purpose, a thermo metallurgic mechanical finite element model is used. However these numerical simulations require a high amount of mechanical, thermal and metallurgical parameters. In order to determinate these parameters, a study of available data for estimation of mechanical parameters was performed. Thermo physical parameters were obtained by DTA and DSC methods. Metallurgical characterization by inverse numerical method based on available CCT diagrams was performed to determine the TTT diagrams. First cooling numerical simulations are presented, allowing a rough estimate of residual stresses values and the identification of key parameters for predicting accurate residual stresses by sensitivity analysis.

40|$|Thermal fatigue {{represents}} {{one of the most significant}} causes for roughing mill roll deterioration and possible failure. The materials ability to withstand thermal cycling is strictly correlated to its microstructural properties, which are the result of the solidification process and following heat treatment. Rolls for hot strip rolling mills are usually produced by centrifugal casting, without subsequent forging. A crucial role is played by the eutectic carbide network developing on solidification, which represents a preferential pattern for crack propagation. For this reason conventional highly alloyed HSS are not a popular substitute for traditional Chromium steel rolls in <b>rougher</b> <b>stands.</b> The so- called “semi-HSS”, containing less C (0. 7 - 0. 9 %C) and alloying elements are usually preferred by users requiring improved roll material. Specially developed “HSS for roughers ” are being tested in various mills, but they are out of the scope of this paper. The present work is part of a continuing effort by INNSE Cilindri (RIVA Group) and Trento University to improve the “semi HSS ” grades. In particular the thermal fatigue resistance of a new class of low-C semi HSS is evaluated. For purpose of comparison, both a conventional semi-HSS and a HSS grade were also considered. The test is based on induction heating (Tmax= 670 °C) and water cooling of cylindrical discs. Experimental results confirm the lower susceptibility towards heat checking of the new grades, containing reduced amount of eutectic carbides, the best behaviour being exhibited by a steel with a mixed martensite-bainite matrix microstructure.

40|$|Efficient work rolls for Hot Strip mill <b>roughing</b> <b>stands</b> {{are usually}} {{produced}} as bimetallic spun cast rolls with a core material made of Spheroidal Graphite Iron (SGI) and a shell material made of High Chromium Steel alloy, semi-High speed steel or adapted High Speed steel chemistry. In this paper, {{the evolution of}} stress fields and microstructure during post casting cooling and subsequent heat treatment of a standard high chromium steel is targeted. This knowledge {{is a first step}} to analyze the different events that could happen during these production stages and provides the residual stress fields as well as the final roll microstructure which are interesting data for roll service life. As far as roughing mill work rolls for roughing mills are concerned, current trends in terms of work roll design are forcing the roll producer to go towards higher usable shell thicknesses or increased residual shell thickness after scrap diameter in order to delay potential fatigue phenomena at the shell-core interface. One important parameter could not be evaluated in this study, it concerns the pollutions of the core material by alloying elements of the shell during production, which could affect to some extent the mechanical properties and microstructure of the core. The macroscopic thermo-mechanical-metallurgical Finite Element model used to perform simulations, takes into account coupled effects. Input data parameters are identified by experimental tests such as compression tests at constant strain rate and numerical procedures such as inverse method. After the model presentation, the material data set is commented. Whole experimental campaign could not be presented, however interested readers are referred to [1] where more details on the material study of High Chromium Steel alloy can be found.
