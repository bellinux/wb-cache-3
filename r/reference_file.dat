The new files represent {{a significant increase in}} the signal-to-noise ratio of these <b>reference</b> <b>files</b> over the old versions. The <b>reference</b> <b>files</b> also show that the dark current signal in the early reads of a MULTIACCUM observation can decrease with time in certain cases. This behavior is dependent upon the timing pattern used to read out the detector, highlighting the importance of read-by-read dark current subtraction.
