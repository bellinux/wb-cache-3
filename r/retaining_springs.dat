40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the experimental evaluation of performance of squeeze film dampers without centralizing <b>retaining</b> <b>springs.</b> Rotor amplitudes in the damper plane and damping coefficient {{have been considered}} to assess the system performance. Tests were conducted on two damper configurations that were {{to go in the}} rotor assembly of a certain gas turbine engine. Land width and film thickness were varied, and experiments were conducted for different values of excitation frequency, oil supply pressure, and unbalance. The test program showed that the parameters are to be individually optimized to obtain better overall performance in the damper systems without centralizing springs. The damper configurations subjected to severe dynamic conditions due to unbalance on overhung mass were also experimentally analyzed...|$|E

50|$|The Model 1770 had a {{modified}} lock plate, stronger barrel bands, and {{a modified}} ramrod <b>retaining</b> <b>spring.</b> The Model 1771 moved the bayonet lug and strengthened the barrel. The Model 1770 and 1771 are often grouped {{together as a}} single model. The Model 1773 was similar to previous models, but again modified the ramrod <b>retaining</b> <b>spring.</b> The Model 1773 is often {{considered to be a}} minor variant to the Model 1770/1771. The Model 1774 had a shorter trigger guard, and the tail of the frizzen was cut square. The ramrod design was also modified in the Model 1774, giving it more of a pear shaped head. Similarly minor changes were made for the Model 1776, which is often not considered to be a separate model.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{changes to}} the Model 68 {{generally}} paralleled the Model 67. The finger grooves in the stock were omitted starting in mid-1935, the bolt <b>retaining</b> <b>spring</b> was eliminated in August 1937, and the sear and extractor were modified in January 1938 to throw ejected cases farther when the bolt was opened. An optional [...]22 WRF chambering was added in April 1938, somewhat later than its 1935 introduction on the Model 67.|$|R
40|$|Because {{cover crop}} roots and top growth {{act like a}} sponge to capture, contain, and reuse manure nutrients, they can be an {{effective}} way to retain soil nutrients and reduce fertilizer costs. Even if only 40 pounds per acre of nitrogen are <b>retained,</b> <b>spring</b> fertilizer costs can be reduced by $ 25 per acre by planting cover crops such as oats, oilseed radish or cereal rye. This article offers a rundown on how to get the most from cover crops...|$|R

50|$|A {{referendum}} on spring hunting {{was held in}} Malta on 11 April 2015. Voters voted narrowly in favour of <b>retaining</b> the <b>spring</b> hunt, with 50.4% voting for the existing law to remain in place. Voter turnout was 74.8%.|$|R
5000|$|M7A2 1951 - 1952: The {{only problem}} with the M7A1 was that {{sometimes}} the launcher would get stuck when fired or the gas cylinder lock would break. This rendered the rifle and launcher useless and required repair by an armorer with special tools. The jamming problem was solved by using a heavier spring-loaded piston on the launcher and introduced a redesigned grenade <b>retaining</b> <b>spring.</b> The M1 Garand was then modified with a distinctive dual gas cylinder lock (marked with a 'M', for [...] "modified") dubbed the [...] "high hump lock" [...] (ordnance part No. 7265871). The launcher had a mount machined into it to take a proposed leaf-sight that was never adopted.|$|R
50|$|The warhead {{appears to}} be a shaped charge type, as a Hamas worker can be seen working a lustrous metal cone into a {{position}} inverted under the warhead nose, before final addition of the explosive. In the video the cone {{appears to be}} made of aluminum with a wide apex angle, suggesting according to the principles of shaped charge design that the warhead has low penetration but a highly destructive pyrotechnic effect. The detonator is briefly shown in the video, and {{appears to be a}} simple base-impact type using a <b>retaining</b> <b>spring</b> and weighted firing pin suspended above an explosive primer and the detonator. A safety pin holds the firing pin in place until the weapon is ready for use.|$|R
5000|$|Grease {{fittings}} are {{permanently installed}} by either a (taper) thread or straight push-fit ('hammer in') arrangement, leaving a nipple connection that a grease gun attaches to. The pressure {{supplied by the}} grease gun forces a small captive bearing ball in the fitting to move back against the force of its <b>retaining</b> <b>spring.</b> The arrangement is thus essentially a valve that opens under pressure to allow lubricant to pass through a channel and be forced into the voids of the bearing. When the pressure ceases, the ball returns to its closed position. The ball excludes dirt and functions as a check valve to prevent grease escaping {{back out of the}} fitting. The ball is almost flush with the surface of the fitting {{so that it can be}} wiped clean to reduce the amount of debris carried with the grease into the bearing.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, the Federal Government {{considered}} {{proposals to}} regulate {{the water in the}} Winnipeg River. By constructing the dam at the head of Lac Seul, the lake would become a large reservoir, <b>retaining</b> the <b>spring</b> run-off for use by power developments downstream on both the English and Winnipeg River systems. Lower Ear Falls was the selected location for the Lac Seul dam.|$|R
50|$|Some {{pullback}} motors, usually {{intended for}} racing in pairs, {{have used a}} catch and release mechanism to <b>retain</b> their <b>springs.</b> These may be wound separately, then launched together by releasing their spring triggers. Darda use such a mechanism for their Stop'n'Go motor. This is pre-wound, then releases automatically when shunted from behind. This allows relay races {{to be set up}} with multiple cars.|$|R
50|$|The Rimlock (B8A) base is an 8-pin {{design with}} a pin circle {{diameter}} close to noval, {{and uses a}} nub {{on the side of}} the envelope to engage with a guide and <b>retaining</b> <b>spring</b> in the socket wall. This provides pin registration (since the pins are equi-spaced) and also a fair degree of retention. Early tubes with this base type typically had a metal skirt around the lower ~15mm of the envelope to match the socket wall, and this offered a degree of built-in screening, but these were fairly soon replaced by 'skirtless' versions which had a characteristic widening in the glass to compensate physically for the absence of the skirt. In the European naming scheme, rimlock tubes are numbered in the ranges 40-49, 110-119 (with exceptions), and 400-499, e.g. EF40. Although virtually unknown elsewhere, this was a very common base type in European radios of the late 1940s through the 1950s, but was eventually displaced by the ubiquitous B7G and noval (B9A) base types.|$|R
40|$|A {{thermal switch}} for {{controlling}} the dissipation of heat between a body is described. The thermal switch {{is comprised of}} a flexible bellows defining an expansible vapor chamber for a working fluid located between an evaporation and condensation chamber. Inside the bellows is located a coiled <b>retaining</b> <b>spring</b> and four axial metal mesh wicks, two of which have their central portions located inside of the spring while the other two have their central portions located between the spring and the side wall of the bellows. The wicks are terminated and {{are attached to the}} inner surfaces of the outer end walls of evaporation and condensation chambers respectively located adjacent to the heat source and heat sink. The inner surfaces of the end walls furthermore include grooves to provide flow channels of the working fluid to and from the wick ends. The evaporation and condensation chambers are connected by turnbuckles and tension springs to provide a set point adjustment for setting the gap between an interface plate on the condensation chamber and the heat sink...|$|R

50|$|At low speeds, The T-lever's wing section floats freely, {{enabling}} the low-lift cams {{to operate the}} valves. The intake rocker arms contain internal pistons, which are <b>retained</b> by <b>springs</b> in a lowered position while the engine speed is below the MIVEC switchover point, to avoid contacting the high-lift T-shaped levers. At high speeds, hydraulic pressure elevates the hydraulic pistons, causing the T-lever to push against the rocker arm, which in turn makes the high-lift cam operate the valves.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{durability and}} reliability of DECtape was underscored when {{the design of the}} tape reel mounting hubs was changed in the early 1970s. The original machined metal hub with a <b>retaining</b> <b>spring</b> was replaced by a lower cost single-piece plastic hub with 6 flexible arms in a [...] "starfish" [...] or [...] "flower" [...] shape. When a defective batch of these new design hubs was shipped on new DECtape drives, these hubs would loosen over time. As a result, DECtape reels would fall off the drives, usually when being spun at full speed, as in an end-to-end seek. The reel of tape would fall onto the floor and roll in a straight line or circle, often unspooling and tangling the tape as it went. In spite of this horrifying spectacle, desperate users would carefully untangle that tape and wind it laboriously back onto the tape reel, then re-install it onto the hub, with a paper shim to hold the reel more tightly. The data on the mangled DECtape could often be recovered completely and copied to another tape, provided that the original tape had only been creased multiple times, and not stretched or broken. DEC quickly issued an Engineering Change Order (ECO) to replace the defective hubs, to resolve the problem.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 Frank Mayfield and George Kees, {{a medical}} illustrator, develop the Mayfield clip and clip applier, {{to shut off}} the blood supply to a brain aneurysm. Mayfield had the idea to develop a small, cross-legged clip and an {{applicator}} with tweezers-like dexterity to permit for trial-and-error placement of the clip across the neck of an aneurysm. The metal clip {{would have to be}} malleable enough so that it could be twisted into shape and still <b>retain</b> its <b>spring</b> recoil. If, after placement, the clip had to be removed, it could be accomplished by using the forceps as if it were tweezers.|$|R

50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension pin or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self <b>retaining</b> fastener. <b>Spring</b> pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R

40|$|A wedge {{and spring}} {{assembly}} {{for use in}} electromagnets or dynamoelectric machines having a housing with an axis therethrough and a plurality of coils supported on salient poles that extend radially inward from the housing toward the housing axis to define a plurality of interpole spaces, respectively between the housing and adjacent coils, the interpole spaces each extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge and spring assembly includes a nonmagnetic retainer spring and a nonmagnetic wedge. The retainer spring is formed to fit {{into one of the}} interpole spaces, and has juxtaposed ends defining between them a slit extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge for insertion into the slit provides an outwardly directed force on respective portions of the juxtaposed ends defining the slit to expand the slit so that respective portions of the retainer spring engage areas of the coils adjacent thereto, thereby resiliently holding the coils against their respective salient poles. Preferably, the spring retainer and wedge are self-locking wherein wedge is fabricated from a material softer than a material the retainer spring is fabricated from, so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit. The retainer spring is generally triangular shaped to fit within the interpole space and fabricated from berryllium-copper alloy, and the wedge is generally T-shaped and fabricated from aluminum. Alternatively, a wedge and spring assembly includes a wedge having divergent sloped surfaces in which each surface and the respective juxtaposed ends of the retainer spring are angled relative to one another so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit by friction existing between its sloped surfaces and the juxtaposed ends of the <b>retaining</b> <b>spring...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{deformation}} of isolation layer in base-isolated building can exceed original design during strong earthquake excitations, which will cause poundings between structure and surrounding <b>retaining</b> wall. <b>Spring</b> limiter installed in base-isolated building can protect the structure. Shaking table test of base-isolated model pounding with spring limiters were performed. The study find the {{deformation of}} isolation layer can be effectively reduced by spring limiters, and the deformation of the superstructure will increase slightly. Pounding between structure and spring limiters can arouse high frequency acceleration of building, but {{had little effect}} on velocity. Increasing the spring limiters will not change seismic total energy input on the structure, and most of the energy dissipate by the damping. Impact energy dissipation increases with reducing in the gap between structure and spring limiters...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Confederacy, <b>Spring</b> <b>retained</b> {{only a small portion of}} his estate. In order to protect it, he {{occasionally}} attended Protestant services. However, he was thought to still pose a significant threat by The Protectorate government and was transplanted to County Clare, where he had little influence, under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. This led to him being dubbed ‘The Unfortunate’ by both opponents and supporters. His remaining estates in Kerry were transferred to his son, Thomas.|$|R
