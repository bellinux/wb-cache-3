5|$|Diệm {{refused to}} hold the reunification elections, {{on the basis that}} the State of Vietnam was not a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Lorraine, Charles V {{was without}} an heir and Marguerite-Louise, as the {{daughter}} of a Lorrainer princess, delegated the right to succeed to the duchy to her elder son, Ferdinando. Grand Duke Cosimo tried to get his son international recognition as heir-apparent, to no avail. Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, supported Cosimo's claim, not wanting to see Lorraine revert to France. The Treaties of Nijmegen, which concluded the Franco-Dutch War, did not <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> Cosimo's ambitions, as he had wished. The Lorrainer question was concluded with the birth of a son to Charles V in 1679, ending Cosimo's dream of a Medici cadet branch, dreams which were to be revived in 1697 by Gian Gastone's marriage to an heiress.|$|E
5|$|The prerogatives and {{authority}} {{granted to the}} legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in {{the functioning of the}} government—it was not just a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp.</b> The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.|$|E

25|$|A Letterbox Hybrid Cache is a {{combination}} of a geocache and a letterbox in the same container. A letterbox has a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> and a logbook instead of tradable items.

25|$|After the 1890 general {{election}} {{for the lower}} house of the Diet of Japan, the elected members proved much less amenable to government persuasion than had been anticipated by Itō Hirobumi {{and other members of}} the Meiji oligarchy. Rather than docilely <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> legislation issued from the House of Peers and the genrō, the leaders of the lower house used the only leverage granted to them under the Meiji Constitution: withholding budgetary approval to show resistance. This stalemate led to earlier than anticipated dissolution of the government and new elections. Emperor Meiji expressed concern that if the same people were elected again, the same problem would recur, and suggested that regional offices encourage good people to run for office.|$|E
25|$|Between 1988 and 1990, facing {{considerable}} opposition, Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power {{away from}} the highest bodies {{of the party and}} making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them.

The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, much stronger than before. For {{the first time since the}} 1920s, it refused to <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> proposals from the party and Council of Ministers.

25|$|Micro-contact {{printing}} or {{soft lithography}} {{is analogous to}} printing ink with a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp.</b> The SAM molecules are inked onto a pre-shaped elastomeric stamp with a solvent and transferred to the substrate surface by stamping. The SAM solution {{is applied to the}} entire stamp but only areas that make contact with the surface allow transfer of the SAMs. The transfer of the SAMs is a complex diffusion process that depends on the type of molecule, concentration, duration of contact, and pressure applied. Typical stamps use PDMS because its elastomeric properties, E = 1.8 MPa, allow it to fit the countour of micro surfaces and its low surface energy, γ = 21.6 dyn/cm². This is a parallel process and can thus place nanoscale objects over a large area in a short time.|$|E
25|$|Vespasian's reign saw the {{reorganisation}} of the Senate from {{a body of}} aristocratic Romans {{to one of the}} Empire's aristocracy, {{with its}} membership and privileges given by the emperor. Domitian's reign marked a significant turning point on the road to monarchy {{and the end of the}} constitutional arrangement whereby the Senate and Emperor ruled the Empire together. After making himself consul for ten years, Domitian made himself Censor for life, and unlike his father, he used these powers to further subjugate the Senate by controlling its membership. Throughout his reign, he abrogated the rights of senators, only referred to it the most trivial matters, prevented it from acting on matters of any import, and forced it into compliance through his use of censorial powers. In effect, it became a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp.</b> While the Senate regained some authority when it elected the emperor Nerva, by this point, the powers that were theoretically held by the last remaining republican institution of any import, were clearly defined only by the will of the emperor.|$|E
25|$|The Select Committee will scrutinise the bill, {{going over}} it {{in more detail}} than can be {{achieved}} by the whole membership of the House. The public can also make submissions to Select Committees, offering support, criticism, or merely comments. Written submissions from the public to the committee are normally due two months after the bill's first reading. Submitters can opt to also give an oral submission, which are heard by the committee in Wellington, and numbers permitting, Auckland and Christchurch. The Select Committee stage is seen as increasingly important today — in the past, the governing party generally dominated Select Committees, making the process something of a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp,</b> but in the multi-party environment there is significant scope for real debate. Select Committees frequently recommend changes to bills, with prompts for change coming from the MPs on the Committee, officials who advise the Committee, and members of the public. When a majority of the Committee is satisfied with the bill, the Committee will report back to the House on it. Unless Parliament grants an extension, the time limit for Select Committee deliberations is six months or whatever deadline was set by the House when the bill was referred.|$|E
