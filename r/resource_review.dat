40|$|Within {{clinical}} proteomics, {{mass spectrometry}} analysis of biological samples {{is emerging as}} an important high-throughput technology, capable of producing powerful diagnostic and prognostic models and identifying important disease biomarkers. As interest in this area grows, {{and the number of}} such proteomics datasets continues to increase, the need has developed for efficient, comprehensive, reproducible methods of mass spectrometry data analysis by both experts and nonexperts. We have designed and implemented a stand-alone software system, FAST-AIMS, which seeks to meet this need through automation of data preprocessing, feature selection, classification model generation, and performance estimation. FAST-AIMS is an efficient and user-friendly standalone software for predictive analysis of mass spectrometry data. The present <b>resource</b> <b>review</b> paper will describe the features and use of the FAST-AIMS system. The system is freely available for download for noncommercial use.
