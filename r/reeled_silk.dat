40|$|AbstractThe forced reeling of {{silkworms}} {{offers the}} potential to produce a spectrum of silk filaments, spun from natural silk dope and subjected to carefully controlled applied processing conditions. Here we demonstrate that the envelope of stress–strain properties for forced <b>reeled</b> <b>silks</b> can encompass both naturally spun cocoon silk and unnaturally processed artificial silk filaments. We use dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) to quantify the structural properties of these silks. Using this well-established mechanical spectroscopic technique, we show high variation in the mechanical properties and the associated degree of disordered hydrogen-bonded structures in forced <b>reeled</b> <b>silks.</b> Furthermore, we show that this disorder can be manipulated by a range of processing conditions and even ameliorated under certain parameters, such as annealing under heat and mechanical load. We conclude that the powerful combination of forced <b>reeling</b> <b>silk</b> and DMTA has tied together native/natural and synthetic/unnatural extrusion spinning. The presented techniques therefore {{have the ability to}} define the potential of Bombyx-derived proteins for use in fibre-based applications and serve as a roadmap to improve fibre quality via post-processing...|$|R

The Gunma Prefecture Society for Sericulture Promotion (GPSSP), formed by the Prefecture in Japan, solicited expertise from a wide range of fields to promote silk and the artistry of sericulture and filature. Two projects stemmed from this effort, resulting in the production of contemporary silk fabric made from quality indigenous silk, for artists and designers to explore. Using Gunma silk, American artists Ana Lisa Hedstrom, Genevieve Dion, and Joan Morris have been creating new bodies of work in wearable and non-functional art. Through application of traditional and modern techniques, they exploit the unique qualities inherent in the specially designed silk fabrics, finding ways to create textures previously inapplicable to all natural fibers — particularly silk. In Japan, innovative textile designers like Jun-ichi Arai, also an advisor to the GPSSP, Yuh Okano, and Reiko Sudo of Nuno Corporation have been producing unconventional fabrics using the new technology.

40|$|Optimized by Nature for {{millions}} of years, silk {{is one of the}} strongest biomaterials with outstanding mechanical properties, it is both extensible and tough in order to ensure specific functions. In particular, protein-based Bombyx mori silkworm silk's stiffness is originated from the crystalline region of the semi-crystalline fibroin and the extensibility from the length hidden within the amorphous region. The silk fiber is coated with sericin which acts as a glue connecting fibers together and as a matrix in the three-dimensional nonwoven multi-layer composite structure of the cocoon. These properties can be engineered and enhanced with forced reeling silk: fast spun silks are stiffer and less extensible than slow <b>reeled</b> <b>silk.</b> For this study, two-dimensional single cocoon layer webs are created by silkworms and tested under an increasing wind load until failure, the deflections are recorded. To complement the experimental results, the web's structure is generated in two different models: straight fiber web and wavy fiber web models. Both models are studied under constant wind load for four type of fibers with different reeling speeds thus different mechanical properties. These tests indicate that the deflection increases with wind load for both the experiments and the simulations, but also that webs composed of fibers with different mechanical properties are not necessary stiffer and less extensible as the material they are composed of are stiffer and less extensible because of the high redundancy and randomness of the web structure. The divergence in results between the experiments and the simulations suggests the need to improve the models to be more in accordance with the real webs. by Isabelle Su. Thesis: M.

40|$|Introduction. This {{paper is}} part of a larger project that focuses on the {{historical}} sericultural industry of Connecticut, based in the town of Mansfield during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In this paper, I focus on one specific role in the production of raw silk: silk reeling. In the heyday of its sericultural industry, Mansfield was situated in Windham County, Connecticut. The particular perspective that I bring to this study of silk reeling is one shaped by my experience as an anthropologist who has conducted research on another sericultural area: Shunde County near Guangzhou (Canton) in South China. In both Windham and Shunde counties, sericulture was practiced more intensively than elsewhere in the United States and China, respectively. This fact in itself seems to invite cross-cultural comparative analysis. In the discussion that follows, I use the South China case as a lens through which to examine the development of sericulture and the practice of silk reeling in Mansfield. Of particular interest to me is the issue of the cross-cultural transmission of a skill: Is it possible to learn the highly skilled role of silk reeling from a printed manual? In Mansfield, and in New England more generally, instructional manuals, some with illustrations, and all translations from the original languages, were the means to learn an industry and a skill. I return to this interesting issue later in the paper. Mansfield Sericulture. Mansfield, Connecticut, occupies an important position in the history of silk production in the United States. It figures prominently both in the practice of “sericulture” (or raw silk culture) in this country, as well as in the development of the technology of industrialized silk thread and textile production. Mansfield was an early site of experimentation in sericulture, which was established in the 1760 ’s. Local families cultivated mulberry trees for their leaves, which they fed to the silkworms that they raised at home in attics and sheds. Each family nurtured hundreds of silkworms at once across the several weeks of their lifecycle, from newly hatched eggs, through several moultings, to mature silkworms, which at last spun their cocoons, the goal of the family enterprise. Cocoons were unwound or “reeled” by hand, by women in the family, to produce filaments of raw silk, the basic component of silk thread. Filaments from several cocoons were wound off together at hearthside onto the common reel. Later, the <b>reeled</b> <b>silk</b> underwent further processing by twisting it into thread, which was wound onto a “wool wheel” and measured off into skeins of standard length as “sewing silk. ” This was the most common product of the Mansfield sericultural industry. Some of it was refined still further, twisted into a denser product called “silk twist. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{appears to}} be an age of silk. The {{correspondent}} of a country paper, writing from New York, says that men are becoming very luxurious, and their [...] . wardrobes and repositories for personal belongings display tastes more costly than those of women [...] [as they put on] underwear of the softest, richest knitted silk. During {{the last quarter of the}} 19 th century affluent men of leisure and fashion had many hours every day to 2 ̆ 2 loiter at the various clubs and discuss matters of taste. 2 ̆ 2 Those who displayed an exceptional interest in fashion were labeled 2 ̆ 2 swells. 2 ̆ 2 This research was inspired by a fictional character in an article that examined a day in the sartorial life of Mr. Montgomery Montmorency who was 2 ̆ 2 a howling NY swell by environment and inclination. 2 ̆ 2 At the start of day Mr. Montmorency 2 ̆ 7 s butler 2 ̆ 2 makes his own selection of his master 2 ̆ 7 s suit of silk underwear and has chosen a medium weight texture in proper comport with the atmosphere. On this occasion the suit is of a fetching shade of electric blue 2 ̆ 2 - compatible with the business suit of slate-blue mixed which he wears to Wall St. The age of silk for ultrafashionable Victorian men affected their most intimate clothing: underwear. This paper will discuss the qualities of silk fibers, cloth structures and manufacturers of underwear worn by fashionable New York 2 ̆ 2 swells 2 ̆ 2 under their sturdy and sober tailored suits. Silk underwear was chosen to improve the drape of trousers as well as for warmth, hygiene and health. Trade journals and fashion industry publications were studied and etiquette books, dyers sample books and silk swatches from the textile collection of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology were examined, The American Silk Journal, 1885 reported: Silk underwear for gentlemen [...] . is coming extensively into use. A few years ago it was so rare that it was but seldom found in the furnishing stores. Many of the sex now wear it all the year round [...] . silk underwear cost 18 for a shirt and 16 for drawers, or S 34 a suit. Some gentlemen order three or four suits at a time. In the Brooks Brothers Catalogue 1901, underwear from Allen Solly and other makers in all weights and qualities including silk were offered in prices up to 15. 00. In spite of its high cost, silk had unique properties which made it the prestige fiber for underwear. It had a soft hand, good absorbency, and wicking characteristics; the fiber is strong and resilient; Because of its absorbency, it is appropriate for warm-weather wear. Silk 2 ̆ 7 s low heat conductivity makes it also suitable for cold-weather wear. Silk underwear was manufactured from both spun and <b>reeled</b> <b>silk.</b> If the filament of the cocoon can be unwound from it in a continuous fibre, it is 2 ̆ 7 reeled 2 ̆ 7 and known in commerce as 2 ̆ 7 raw 2 ̆ 7 silk [but] [...] . if the cocoon through any cause be pressed, broken or injured so that its filament cannot be 2 ̆ 7 reeled, 2 ̆ 7 then it must be 2 ̆ 7 spun 2 ̆ 7 as characterized by the American Silk Journal. Spun silk was also classed as 2 ̆ 2 waste 2 ̆ 2 and included refuse or product thrown off in the process of reeling. Samuel Lister discovered silk waste by accident in a London warehouse and the owners were happy to sell it for rubbish. 2 ̆ 2 It was neither agreeable to the feel, the smell, nor the touch; but simply a mass of knotty, dirty, impure stuff, full of bits of stick and dead mulberry leaves. 2 ̆ 2 Lister recognized the commercial viability of manufacturing spun silk fabric that could compete in appearance with material from the perfect cocoon...|$|E

The name derives from the twisting and spiralling movements of the silkworm larva as it wraps itself in its cocoon, and to the metaphorical principle of [...] "reeling the silk from a silk worm's cocoon". In order to draw out the silk successfully the action must be smooth and consistent without jerking or changing direction sharply.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the reasons for the different reactions among rural silk producers in Zhejiang and Jiangsu to agricultural modernization in the 1920 s and 1930 s:peasants in Zhejiang resisted improved silkworm eggs and continued to rear indigenous eggs, while those in Jiangsu pushed on with reforms.
