40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model is developed to capture the stress field generated in connected plates during the installation of hot-driven rivets. Clamping stress is generated when a steel <b>rivet</b> <b>heated</b> to approximately 1000 °C comes {{in contact with the}} material to be fastened at ambient temperature. As the rivet cools, thermal contraction subjects the rivet into tensile stress, while the material being fastened is subjected to compressive stress. Model characteristics and assumptions, as well as steel properties variation with respect to temperature are discussed. The thermal stresses developed around the rivet hole are assessed and reported. Results from the analysis are utilized to detect possible regions for fatigue crack propagation under cyclic loads...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{analysis of the}} inspection of reiveted plates using the thermoelastic effect is presented. Theoretically, a model is employed to estimate the thermoelastic response expected from a cracked and uncracked rivet hole. The stress invariant, which causes the thermoelastic response, is calculated for the cracked case using an FEM model and for the uncracked case using a theoretical approximation. The differences in the two thermal responses are reduced when the effects of optical spatial averaging, thermal conduction, and a concentric blind area representing the <b>rivet</b> <b>heat</b> are considered. It is suggested that discrimination between the cracked and uncracked cases for short cracks will improve with increasing frequency of stress oscillation. Measurements are shown for aerospace aluminum samples with and without fatigue cracks propagating from holes in a plate. The effect of mean stress on the thermoelastic response is illustrated, {{and the results are}} qualitatively compared with the finite element analysis...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} held {{together}} by six million Australian-made hand-driven rivets supplied by the McPherson company of Melbourne, the last being driven through the deck on 21 January 1932. The <b>rivets</b> were <b>heated</b> red-hot and inserted into the plates; the headless end was immediately rounded over with a large pneumatic rivet gun. The largest of the rivets used weighed 3.5 kg and was 39.5 cm long. The practice of riveting large steel structures, rather than welding, was, at the time, a proven and understood construction technique, whilst structural welding had not at that stage been adequately developed for use on the bridge.|$|R
50|$|CP {{developed}} the “hot dimpling machine” {{in response to}} war effort demands, a device <b>heating</b> <b>rivets</b> to 1000 °F and using 100,000 pounds/inch² of pressure to squeeze the rivet head into its final shape.In 1943, The Saturday Evening Post published a cover picture by Norman Rockwell portraying a female aircraft worker, Rosie the Riveter, eating her lunch with a CP riveting hammer in her lap.|$|R
50|$|As well as illumination, the Wells {{light was}} also used where a large {{portable}} blowlamp was required for heating. They were sometimes used for <b>heating</b> iron <b>rivets,</b> inserted red hot, during the assembly of structural ironwork. Although such <b>rivets</b> were normally <b>heated</b> in small portable coke braziers (which also used a cheaper fuel), the Wells light was favoured for some final assembly work at height, as the smaller lights were considered lighter and easier to lift into place high atop a bridge.|$|R
5000|$|While <b>riveting,</b> Larry also <b>heats</b> sausage for Moe and Curly. The foreman discovers Larry, who {{proceeds}} to toss Curly an actual rivet, who claims, [...] "It's a weenie, but it's kind of tough." [...] Curly later uses a hard {{hat with a}} screwhead to engage the rivets while Moe drills them. The Stooges do a lousy job riveting {{and part of the}} building collapses when head foreman Mr. Blake (Vernon Dent) leans against a beam. He and several men chase the stooges, who escape by parachuting off the building and landing in their wagon below.|$|R
50|$|Hardie's {{first job}} {{came at the}} very young age of seven, when he was put {{to work as a}} message boy for the Anchor Line Steamship Company. Formal {{schooling}} henceforth became impossible, but his parents spent evenings teaching him to read and write, skills which proved essential for future self-education. A series of low-paying entry-level jobs followed for the boy, including work as an apprentice in a brass-fitting shop, work for a lithographer, employment in the shipyards <b>heating</b> <b>rivets,</b> and time spent as a message boy for a baker for which he earned four shillings and sixpence (4'6) a week.|$|R
2500|$|On 29 February 2008, the Garden Bridge {{was closed}} to all traffic, in {{preparation}} for its removal. On 1 March 2008, {{as part of the}} Bund Refurbishment Project, an extensive reconfiguration of traffic flow along the Bund, and in preparation for World Expo 2010 to be held in Shanghai, Waibaidu Bridge was cut into two sections, detached from its abutments, and moved by boat into a shipyard in Pudong for extensive repairs and restoration. On 6 April 2008, {{the southern part of the}} bridge was removed and on 7 April 2008, the northern part was removed as well. The restoration work was undertaken by Shanghai Shipyards at its Minsheng Road docks in Pudong, and formally started on 5 April 2008. According to the project engineers, [...] Almost 160,000 rivets hold China's first steel bridge together. Once common practice in the construction industry, the use of rivets has been replaced by welding. Riveting, a dying art, is now only used on a small scale for building railway bridges and ships. Bridge repairers Shanghai Shipyard found and recruited nearly 60 riveters from two factories in Shanhaiguan of Hebei Province and Xi'an of Shaanxi Province and flew them to Shanghai. They worked in four-man groups, <b>heating</b> <b>rivets</b> to between 900 and 1,000 degrees Celsius before hammering them into the structure. [...] "At night, it was like watching a meteor flying across the sky as one worker cast a <b>heated</b> <b>rivet</b> high and the other quickly took it with tools and hammered it on the bridge without a second's delay, a Shanghai Shipyard engineer said.|$|R
40|$|The {{labor costs}} and {{techniques}} {{associated with the}} maintenance of a bonded-on ablator thermal protection system (TPS) concept, suitable for Space Shuttle application are examined. The baseline approach to TPS attachment involves bonding reusable surface insulation (RSI) and/or ablators to the structural skin of the vehicle. The RSI and/or ablators in the form of either flat or contoured panels can be bonded to the skin of the primary structure directly or by way of an intermediate silicone foam rubber pad. The use of foam rubber pads permits the use of buckling skins and protruding <b>heat</b> <b>rivets</b> on the primary structure, minimizing structural weight and fabrication costs. In the case of the RSI, the foam rubber pad serves as a required strain isolator. For purpose of comparison, test data were obtained for an installation with and without the use of a strain isolator. The refurbishment aspects of a bonded-on RSI concept (without a strain isolator) were examined experimentally along with several externally removable panel concepts employing both ablator and RSI TPS. The various concepts are compared...|$|R
40|$|This project {{attempts}} to reduce manufacturing costs incurred to Cherry Aerospace by variance in material properties. To track and predict the shear strength of PH 15 - 7 Mo stainless steel rivet stems throughout the heat treatment process, samples {{were taken from}} several steps in the manufacturing process and experimental heat treatments were performed {{across a range of}} temperatures. The supplied <b>rivet</b> stems were <b>heat</b> treated for four hours at temperatures from 520 °C to 560 °C, in increments of 10 °C. Double shear testing in accordance with ASTM 1312 - 13 A revealed that there is no apparent correlation between the strength of the supplied wire and final shear strength of the wire. It is recommended that samples be tested for impact toughness to better understand the shear behavior of the rivet stem due to the break notch. When examining the effects of composition on mechanical properties, {{there is a lack of}} evidence to suggest that any correlation can be made. Even with constant composition, different lots of wire exhibit variances in shear strength in the fully heat treated condition. It is concluded that the variances in mechanical properties of the rivet stems are influenced by other factors. These could include manufacturing operations that are not included in the scope of this project, such as stackup of tolerances in the rivet assembly or effects of cold work of the wire prior to procurement by Cherry Aerospace...|$|R
40|$|The story {{involves}} a construction foreman who fires {{one of his}} crew for fighting, which leads the disgruntled employee to steal. He then cause the blame {{to be put on}} the foreman, who is finally exonerated when the thief is exposed. All of this conflict is woven in and around the actual construction of the building as the work is in progress. There is even one scene of a hand-to-hand fight between the foreman and the villain that takes place on the unprotected ledge of the steel framework of the building.
