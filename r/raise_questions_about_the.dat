5|$|Feduccia's frill {{argument}} was followed up {{in several other}} publications, in which researchers interpreted the filamentous impressions around Sinosauropteryx fossils as remains of collagen fibres rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the fibres formed a frill {{on the back of}} the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would refute the proposal that Sinosauropteryx is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> current theory of feather origins itself. It calls into question the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.|$|E
5|$|In 1513, Gasparem de Cayrano de Mediolano lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum {{signed the}} {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a new entrance to the Duomo of Chiari. The document, a reconfirmation of an earlier negotiation, shows that the artist and the municipality had agreed terms two years earlier, but the plans hadn't been executed because of the war in the Brescia area. The contract provided for the fulfilment of the entire project - from the architectural parts to the figurative sculptures, including a group with the Madonna between the Saints Faustino and Giovita. These are now missing, so it's impossible to assess the evolution of Cairano's art after the completion of the ark of Sant'Appollonio. The rest of the work, moreover, again <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> architectural skills of the artist that are still unanswered.|$|E

However, in June 2015, and despite the Interpol notice, Modi took a picture with ex-Interpol Chief Ronald Noble and uploaded it to his Instagram account while attending the El Clasico match in Barcelona. In the post, he referred to Noble as his “brother”.

500|$|Although Martin Marietta {{completed}} its AEC contract and its lease expired on December 21, 1966, {{it had to}} stay at the reactor site [...] "until radiation contamination was brought to acceptable levels". Martin Marietta partially decontaminated the site, and in April 1967 undertook a joint radiological survey with Penn State and the AEC. The survey found [...] "licensable [...] quantities of strontium-90 stayed behind as structural contamination and residual radioactivity in piping and tanks, estimated at about 0.2 curies". This met the standards for that day, although Penn State did <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> contamination remaining. Strontium is chemically very similar to calcium (both are alkaline earth metals) and can be absorbed by the body, where it is chiefly incorporated into bones. Strontium-90 decays by beta decay and has a half-life of 29 years; when it is in the body, its radioactivity can lead to bone cancer and leukemia.|$|E

The conflict is particularly intense between the idealistic Communications Director Toby and the more pragmatic Doug Wegland (Handler).

500|$|Alpha Theta {{was founded}} {{as a local}} {{fraternity}} named Iota Sigma Upsilon on March 3, 1920, {{by a group of}} seven students. [...] In 1921 the fraternity received a charter as the Alpha Theta chapter of Theta Chi. [...] John Sloan Dickey, later president of the college, joined the fraternity in 1928 and was elected house president only two weeks later, while still a pledge. [...] Nine brothers of Theta Chi died in a tragic accident on the morning of February 25, 1934, when the metal chimney of the building's old coal furnace blew out in the night and the residence filled with poisonous carbon monoxide gas. [...] Alpha Theta {{was one of the first}} collegiate fraternities in the United States to break from its national organization over civil rights issues. [...] In 1951, while Dickey served as president of the college, the student body passed a resolution calling on all fraternities to eliminate racial discrimination from their constitutions. [...] The Theta Chi national organization's constitution contained a clause limiting membership in fraternity to [...] "Caucasians" [...] only. [...] On April 24, 1952, the members of the Dartmouth chapter voted unanimously to stop recognizing the racial clause in Theta Chi's constitution. [...] Upon learning that the Dartmouth delegation to Theta Chi's national convention later that year planned to <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> clause, the Alpha Theta chapter was derecognized by the national organization on July 25, 1952. [...] The house reincorporated as a local fraternity and adopted the name Alpha Theta. [...] Alpha Theta was also one of the first all-male fraternities to admit female members. [...] In 1972, Dartmouth admitted the first class of female students and officially became a coeducational institution. [...] Alpha Theta also voted to become coeducational. [...] After a few years, most of the women in the fraternity had become inactive and the house voted to become single-sex male-only again on November 10, 1976. [...] The house returned to a coeducational membership policy in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for {{literature}} for his [...] "realistic and imaginative writing, combining {{as it does}} sympathetic humor and keen social perception." [...] The selection was heavily criticized, and described as [...] "one of the Academy's biggest mistakes" [...] in one Swedish newspaper. The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose [...] "limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising", noting that [...] "he international character of the award and the weight attached to it <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing.... e think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age". Steinbeck, when asked {{on the day of}} the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: [...] "Frankly, no." [...] Biographer Jackson Benson notes, [...] "his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver.
