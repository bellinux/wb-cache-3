5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E

Patients are <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the control or experimental group and given random numbers by a study coordinator, who also encodes the drugs with matching random numbers. Neither the patients nor the researchers monitoring the outcome know which patient is receiving which treatment, until the study is over and the random code is revealed.|$|E

Early plans were for players to be <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> characters {{but in the}} final release, players can choose any character—provided that the character has not already been selected—or be randomly assigned an unselected character.

25|$|Some {{species have}} a sperm {{transplant}} mechanism. Crickets are one such species that can prematurely remove spermatophore after copulation, which terminates sperm transfer. In one study, males were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> females to create half-sib families {{to determine the}} heritability of spermatophore retention time in females. The researchers {{found that there was}} additive genetic variance in the timing of spermatophore removal by females. These results suggest that the timing of the spermatophore removal is determined partly by genotype and is independent of the quality of a female's mate. This shows no difference between the fitness of females who freely remove the spermatophore and the fitness of females that are forced to accept complete ejaculates.|$|E
25|$|Veteran CCPD detective Paul Rivera led {{the murder}} investigation. Originally, an unnamed man {{was hired to}} defend Saldívar but withdrew from the case on April 4 fearing {{community}} retaliation, and concerned about his children's reaction when they learned he was defending Saldívar whom they disliked. Judge Mike Westergren began searching for a defense attorney. Prosecutor Carlos Valdez was designated lead prosecutor, while Mark Skurka was appointed his legal counsel. On April 6, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict Saldívar for murder. After about an hour, the jury had returned a true bill and the indictment was <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the 214th District Court. Carlos Valdez believed that a speedy trial with Westergren presiding over the case was probable.|$|E
25|$|Stephens {{married his}} second wife, Pattie White McClellan, on November 26, 1985. The couple {{separated}} on September 1, 1990, and Stephens {{filed for divorce}} on June 1, 1992. When the case was {{assigned to one of}} Stephens' former political opponents, his lawyer, State Senator Michael Maloney, withdrew the divorce petition and re-filed it the next day. When the second petition was assigned to a different judge, Stephens' wife's lawyer accused Stephens of judge shopping, alleging the second judge had political connections to both Stephens and Maloney. On appeal, the Fayette County Domestic Relations Commissioner reinstated the original petition, saying Maloney should have asked the judge to recuse himself rather than withdrawing and re-filing the petition. Ultimately, both judges recused themselves from hearing the case, and it was <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> a third judge, who finalized the divorce on September 28, 1993.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the relative strengths {{of different types of}} research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> classes. In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments. Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods. On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective, or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real school settings.|$|E
500|$|A {{hypothetical}} randomly evolved {{genetic code}} further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for its origin. If amino acids were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> triplet codons, {{there would be}} 1.5×1084 possible genetic codes. This number is found by calculating the number of ways that [...] 21 items (20 amino acids plus one stop) can be placed in 64 bins, wherein each item is used at least once. However, the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom. In particular, the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments.|$|E

[...] Although each case was <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> a different district judge, the parties all consented to have the four cases consolidated for discovery management before Magistrate Judge Geraldine Soat Brown.

50|$|A true {{experiment}} would, for example, <b>randomly</b> <b>assign</b> children <b>to</b> a scholarship, {{in order to}} control for all other variables.

500|$|There is {{a common}} notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity, in {{particular}} in children, but studies and meta-studies question or address this issue. Some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity. The WHO FAO meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results {{are to be expected}} when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form (entirely unrefined) while others do. One study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally [...] "sugar-sensitive." [...] They were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, mothers were told that their children were fed sugar, and, in the control group, mothers were told that their children received a placebo. In fact, all children received the placebo, but mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive. This result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions.|$|E
