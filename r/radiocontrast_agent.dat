This was {{put to the test}} in 1951, dating the Grauballe Man. Autoradiography was then used by the Finsen Institute to investigate the effects of the <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> thorotrast. Levi was a consultant at the Danish National Board of Health from 1952 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> are {{substances}} used {{to enhance}} the visibility of internal structures in X-ray-based imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), radiography, and fluoroscopy. <b>Radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> are typically iodine or barium compounds.|$|R

50|$|<b>Radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> used in X-ray {{examinations}} can {{be grouped}} {{based on its}} use.|$|R
25|$|The {{catheter}} {{is itself}} {{designed to be}} radiodense for visibility and it allows a clear, watery, blood compatible <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent,</b> commonly called an X-ray dye, to be selectively injected and mixed with the blood flowing within the artery. Typically 3–8 cc of the <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> is injected for each image to make the blood flow visible for about 3–5 seconds as the <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> is rapidly washed away into the coronary capillaries and then coronary veins. Without the X-ray dye injection, the blood and surrounding heart tissues appear, on X-ray, as only a mildly-shape-changing, otherwise uniform water density mass; no details of the blood and internal organ structure are discernible. The radiocontrast within the blood allows visualization of the blood flow within the arteries or heart chambers, depending on where it is injected.|$|E
25|$|A lower {{gastrointestinal}} {{series is}} a medical procedure used to examine and diagnose problems with the human colon (large intestine). Radiographs (X-ray pictures) are taken while barium sulfate, a <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent,</b> fills the colon via an enema through the rectum.|$|E
25|$|Plain {{radiography}} generally {{refers to}} projectional radiography (without {{the use of}} more advanced techniques such as computed tomography). Plain radiography can also refer to radiography without a <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> or radiography that generates single static images, as contrasted to fluoroscopy.|$|E
5|$|As {{an element}} with high {{electron}} density and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3keV {{due to the}} photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons. Organoiodine compounds are used with intravenous injection as X-ray <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents.</b> This application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as angiography and CT scanning. At present, all water-soluble <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> rely on iodine.|$|R

50|$|<b>Radiocontrast</b> <b>agents,</b> when orally administered, are harmless. Intravenous {{administration}} of iodinated <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> can cross the placenta {{and enter the}} fetal circulation, but animal studies have reported no teratogenic or mutagenic effects from its use. There have been theoretical concerns about potential harm of free iodide on the fetal thyroid gland, but multiple {{studies have shown that}} a single dose of intravenously administered iodinated contrast medium to a pregnant mother has no effect on neonatal thyroid function. Nevertheless, it generally is recommended that radiocontrast only be used if absolutely required to obtain additional diagnostic information that will improve the care of the fetus or mother.|$|R
25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of high tensile strength clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though luminal stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> to simply escape into the blood.|$|E
25|$|Persons {{with major}} trauma {{commonly}} have chest and pelvic X-rays taken, and, {{depending on the}} mechanism of injury and presentation, a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam to check for internal bleeding. For those with relatively stable blood pressure, heart rate, and sufficient oxygenation, CT scans are useful. Full-body CT scans, known as pan-scans, improve the survival rate {{of those who have}} suffered major trauma. These scans use intravenous injections for the <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent,</b> but not oral administration. There are concerns that intravenous contrast administration in trauma situations without confirming adequate renal function may cause damage to kidneys, but this {{does not appear to be}} significant.|$|E
25|$|Coronary {{catheterization}} {{is performed}} in a catheterization lab, usually located within a hospital. With current designs, the patient must lie relatively flat on a narrow, minimally padded, radiolucent (transparent to X-ray) table. The X-ray source and imaging camera equipment are {{on opposite sides of}} the patient's chest and freely move, under motorized control, around the patient's chest so images can be taken quickly from multiple angles. More advanced equipment, termed a bi-plane cath lab, uses two sets of X-ray source and imaging cameras, each free to move independently, which allows two sets of images to be taken with each injection of <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent.</b> The equipment and installation setup to perform such testing typically represents a capital expenditure of US$2–5 million (2004), sometimes more, partially repeated every few years.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{substances}} {{have been used}} as <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents,</b> including silver, bismuth, caesium, thorium, tin, zirconium, tantalum, tungsten and lanthanide compounds. The use of thoria (thorium dioxide) as an agent was rapidly stopped as thorium causes liver cancer.|$|R
50|$|Previously, beta {{blockers}} have been assumed as {{risk factor for}} the acquisition of contrast medium-induced adverse reactions/hypersensitivity reactions. Due to recent investigations {{it became clear that}} {{beta blockers}} do not have the ability to increase the frequency of adverse reactions in concert with <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Measurement of GFR is {{important}} for the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although bolus administration of <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> is commonly used to measure GFR, the optimal duration of sampling to assess their plasma clearance is unknown. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether the duration of plasma sampling influences precision and estimation of GFR...|$|R
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent.</b> Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
25|$|An upper {{gastrointestinal}} series, {{also called}} an upper gastrointestinal study or contrast radiography {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, {{is a series of}} radiographs used to examine the gastrointestinal tract for abnormalities. A contrast medium, usually a <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> such as barium sulfate mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest. The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film. This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine such that the inside wall lining, size, shape, contour, and patency are visible to the examiner. With fluoroscopy, it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing, peristalsis, or sphincter closure. Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into barium swallow, barium meal, barium follow-through, and enteroclysis (small bowel enema). To further enhance the quality of images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging. In this case the gas {{is referred to as the}} negative contrast medium. Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain-film radiography, but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast, in which case the procedure is called CT enterography.|$|E
500|$|Barium sulfate {{has a low}} {{toxicity}} and relatively high density of ca. 4.5 g·cm−3 (and thus opacity to X-rays). For this reason it {{is used as a}} <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> in X-ray imaging of the digestive system ("barium meals" [...] and [...] "barium enemas"). Lithopone, a pigment that contains barium sulfate and zinc sulfide, is a permanent white with good covering power that does not darken when exposed to sulfides.|$|E
50|$|The old <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> caused {{anaphylaxis}} in 1% {{of cases}} while the newer, lower-osmolar agents cause reactions in 0.01-0.04% of cases. Death occurs {{in about two}} to 30 people per 1,000,000 administrations, with newer agents being safer.There is {{a higher risk of}} mortality in those who are female, elderly or in poor health, usually secondary to either anaphylaxis or acute renal failure.|$|R
50|$|In the United States half of CT scans involve {{intravenously}} injected <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents.</b> The {{most common}} reactions from these agents are mild, including nausea, vomiting and an itching rash; however, more severe reactions may occur. Overall reactions occur in 1 to 3% with nonionic contrast and 4 to 12% {{of people with}} ionic contrast. Skin rashes may appear within a week to 3% of people.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} {{pathways}} how pharmaceutical substances may enter drinking water. Predominantly, drinking water procurement comes from drinking water reservoirs, groundwater and bank filtration. If {{treated waste water}} is discharged in catchments with drinking water procurement the not eliminated pharmaceutical substances may be detected in the drinking water. The Netherlands for example gain 37% of their drinking water from surface water, mainly from bank filtration at Rhine and Meuse. Here certain {{attention is paid to}} pharmaceutical residues. In German drinking water catchments and rivers EPPPs have been detected already, especially <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents.</b> Moreover, pharmaceutical residues here partly have their origin in agriculture. An evaluation of the German Federal Environment Agency of regional investigations carried out between 2009 and 2011 showed in total 27 different pharmaceutical substances in concentrations of more than 0,1 microgram per liter in German surface waters and up to 150 substances have been detected in total. Besides the <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> especially the painkiller diclofenac showed relevant concentrations. For many micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals no threshold values in drinking water purification or waste water treatment are obligatory by now as the knowledge about effects is lacking or insufficiently proven.|$|R
2500|$|Iodized poppyseed oil (oil with iodine added) {{has several}} kinds of {{pharmaceutical}} uses. [...] The first of these uses was as a <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> used in medical radiology. [...] The origin of this use is attributed to Jean-Athanase Sicard and Jacques Forestier. [...] Two brand name formulations are ethiodol and lipiodol. [...] These are sterile formulations for medical use that commonly are injected..|$|E
2500|$|By injecting <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agent</b> {{through a}} tiny passage {{extending}} down the balloon catheter {{and into the}} balloon, the balloon is progressively expanded. The hydraulic pressures are chosen and applied by the physician, according to how the balloon within the stenosis (abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel) responds. The radiocontrast filled balloon is watched under fluoroscopy (it typically assumes a [...] "dog bone" [...] shape imposed {{on the outside of}} the balloon by the stenosis as the balloon is expanded), as it opens. As much hydraulic brute force is applied as judged needed and visualized to be effective to make the stenosis of the artery lumen visibly enlarge.|$|E

Although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution, CT can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of X-rays (higher contrast resolution). CT exposes the patient to significantly more ionizing radiation than a radiograph.|$|R
50|$|People with atopic {{diseases}} such as asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis {{are at high risk}} of anaphylaxis from food, latex, and <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> but not from injectable medications or stings. One study in children found that 60% had a history of previous atopic diseases, and of children who die from anaphylaxis, more than 90% have asthma. Those with mastocytosis or of a higher socioeconomic status are at increased risk. The longer the time since the last exposure to the agent in question, the lower the risk.|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Radio{{contrast}}</b> <b>agents</b> are a type {{of medical}} contrast material used to improve the visibility of internal bodily structures in X-ray based imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) or radiography. <b>Radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> are typically iodine or barium compounds. Extravasation of contrast is a possible complication of imaging studies performed with contrasts. Most extravasations cause minimal swelling or erythema, however, skin necrosis, ulceration and compartment syndrome may occur with extravasation of large volumes of contrast. A case report is presented in which significant extravasation of contrast was caused while injecting the contrast intravenously {{into the back of}} the hand of a 50 year old patient during computed tomography. The patient was undergoing chemotherapy. The patient developed a compartment syndrome and a fasciotomy was required. Treatment options are outlined and emphasis is made on prevention of this iatrogenic complication. Some of the preventive measures to avoid these complications include use of non-ionic contrast (low osmolarity), careful choice of the site of intravenous administration, and close monitoring of the patient during injection of contrast to minimize or prevent extravasation injuries. Clear information to patients and prompt recognition of the complication can allow for other non-surgical treatment options than the one required in this case. </p...|$|R

500|$|Barium has few {{industrial}} applications. [...] Historically, it {{was used}} as a getter for vacuum tubes. It is a component of YBCO (high-temperature superconductors) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron {{to reduce the size of}} carbon grains within the microstructure. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color. Barium sulfate is used as an insoluble additive to oil well drilling fluid, as well as in a purer form, as X-ray <b>radiocontrast</b> <b>agents</b> for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. The soluble barium ion and soluble compounds are poisonous, and have been used as rodenticides.|$|R
