25|$|A {{pedestrian}} bridge designed by BLT Architects crosses Arch Street linking the Cira Centre with 30th Street Station. The bridge connects the Cira Centre's lobby with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) regional <b>rail</b> <b>section.</b> The location {{right next to}} 30th Street Station allows {{direct access to the}} Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's regional rail, and Philadelphia International Airport.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after St Niklaus station, {{the next}} rack section starts. This leads {{up to the}} Blattbachtunnel, a 130 metre long {{avalanche}} protection structure erected in 1931. The original uncovered stretch of line at this point had to be abandoned, as the railway bridge over the Blattbach had been destroyed many times by avalanches and flooding since it was first constructed. To circumvent the problem area, a tunnel vault was created in open cut form, and then covered with earth. At the same time, and by the same means, the exit of the third rack <b>rail</b> <b>section</b> could be protected from bad weather.|$|E

2500|$|The Vika Line (...) {{is a light}} <b>rail</b> <b>section</b> of the Oslo Tramway in Oslo, Norway. It runs between Wessels plass, {{through the}} {{neighborhood}} of Vika and Aker Brygge, before arriving at Solli. The section is served by SL79 trams on line 12.

5000|$|Rail welds (where <b>rail</b> <b>sections</b> {{are joined}} by welding) may fail due to poor workmanship; this may be {{triggered}} by extremely cold weather or improper stressing of continuously welded rails, such that high tensile forces are generated in the rails.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{theoretical}} and experimental study of rail fatigue, three dimensional finite element analyses are being made {{of the distribution of}} wheel-rail contact stresses in a series of Australian <b>rail</b> <b>sections</b> in order to elucidate the particular stress distributions which give rise to shelling. One aspect of this fatigue phenomenon is that individual railway operating systems have characteristic forms of shelling in their rails. In the present work the stress distribution in the series of Australian <b>rail</b> <b>sections</b> to AS 1085, Part 1 - 1981 arising from typical forces on the contact ellipse is being investigated. The development of a self-adaptive three dimensional mesh generator suitable for automatic mesh optimisation is described...|$|R
2500|$|Where it is {{critical}} to reduce noise and vibration, the concrete slab can be supported on soft resilient bearings. This configuration, called [...] "floating slab track", is expensive and requires more depth or height in the track structure, but it can reduce noise and vibration by around 80%. GERB quote up to 35-40dB of attenuation using their steel sprung system. Alternatively, the rail can be supported along its length by an elastic material; when combined with a smaller <b>rail</b> <b>section,</b> this can provide a significant noise reduction over traditional ballasted track.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>rail</b> <b>section</b> is {{double track}} [...] {{and capable of}} speeds of up to , slower in Denmark, {{especially}} in the tunnel section. There were challenges related to the difference in electrification and signalling between the Danish and Swedish railway networks. The solution chosen is to switch the electrical system from Swedish 15 kV, 16.7 Hz to Danish 25 kV, 50 Hz before the eastern bridgehead at Lernacken in Sweden. The line is signalled according to the standard Swedish system across {{the length of the}} bridge. On Peberholm the line switches to Danish signalling, which continues into the tunnel.|$|E

The now closed station of Lysakerelven, [...] from Stortinget, was situated on the Bærum side of the municipal border between Oslo and Bærum. At Jar there are two sets of platforms, one for the metro {{and one for the}} trams. The continues past Ringstabekk, which is only served by the metro. It replaced three disused stations, Tjernsrud, Ringstabek and Egne hjem. Situated [...] from Stortinget, Bekkestua is the terminal station for the tramway, and a major transit hub for central Bærum. Like Jar, it features two sets of different platforms. The shared <b>rail</b> <b>section</b> features both third-rail power supply and overhead wires. The trams have a narrower loading gauge and shorter platforms, making it necessary to provide separate platforms for them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chassis {{frame rails}} {{in a truck}} are load bearing {{structural}} members that integrate vehicle power train with superstructure to form a complete vehicle. Large numbers of bolt holes that are cut into these frame side members act as joineries and points of attachments for various sub systems of the truck. While bolt holes are unavoidable due to its primary functional importance, the near hole residual stresses remaining from hole cutting operations may {{play a significant role}} in deciding the life of frame <b>rail</b> <b>sections</b> as they lead to early initiation of fatigue cracks around bolt hole surface. In order to assess the extent of plastic deformation and resulting residual stress pattern in near hole areas of bolt holes, experimental investigation through microstructure analysis, micro-hardness and X-ray diffraction measurements has been taken up. The hole cutting operations considered for this exercise are drilling, punching, laser cutting and water jet cutting used to cut holes on truck frame <b>rail</b> <b>sections.</b> Apart from this, an assessment of shot-peened hole surface was also taken up to understand the effect of shot-peening on structural behavior of frame <b>rail</b> bolt hole <b>sections.</b> The experimentally measured near hole residual stress profiles can be considered as initial conditions for further numerical analysis to study the influence of bolt hole residual stresses on fatigue life of frame <b>rail</b> <b>sections...</b>|$|R
2500|$|At 19.8 kilometres, {{the station}} at Kalpetran is finally reached. The actual site {{has only a}} few buildings, the main {{function}} of the station being to allow connections with the cable car linking the station to the mountain village of Embd. Behind the station, the railway line meets the Mattervispa again, and switches {{to the left side}} of the valley. The Kipfenbrücke located here has had to be rebuilt several times: the original 30 metre long steel truss structure was destroyed in 1945 by an avalanche. A subsequent temporary measure was replaced in 1947 by a steel fish belly girder bridge, which, in turn, was itself destroyed by an avalanche in 1999. A steel girder bridge erected as a replacement was replaced in autumn 2007 by a 146 metre long concrete bridge further downstream. [...] The latest bridge also serves the road to Kalpetran. With the opening of a new <b>rail</b> <b>section</b> here totalling 1.2km, the last 80 metre radius curves remaining on the open line were eliminated.|$|E
