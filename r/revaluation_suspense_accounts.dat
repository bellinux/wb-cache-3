50|$|A <b>suspense</b> <b>account</b> is {{an account}} in the general ledger in which amounts are {{temporarily}} recorded. The <b>suspense</b> <b>account</b> is used because the proper account could not be determined {{at the time that}} the transaction was recorded. When the proper account is determined, the amount will be moved from the <b>suspense</b> <b>account</b> to the proper account. It could be used when there was a difference between the debit and credit side of a closing or trial balance, as a holding area until the reason for error was located and corrected.|$|R

For example, sender sends payment from US ACH account to a BB mobile number in Japan. The customer receives an alert on their mobile to withdraw this money from any BB agent.

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{treatment of}} overhead costs {{was to bring}} them into contact with prime costs {{only at the end}} of an accounting period. Lewis proposed, that accounts containing overhead items be closed to profit and loss like ordinary expenses. At the same time, work in process and finished goods would be debited with their respective shares of overhead cost, and a <b>suspense</b> <b>account</b> in the general ledger would be credited. At the start of the next period a reversing entry was to be made, debiting suspense and crediting profit and loss. Then suspense was again debited and finished goods and work in process were credited, bringing the inventory accounts back to a prime cost basis and leaving total overhead cost as a balance in suspense.|$|R

DOD has also been unable to resolve discrepancies between its and Treasury's records of checks issued by DOD. Because documentation that would allow for resolution of these payment recording problems could not be found after so many years, DOD requested and received legislative authority to write off certain aged suspense transactions and check payment differences. The conference report (H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 107 - 772) that accompanied the legislation (Pub. L. No. 107 - 314) required GAO to review and report on DOD's use of this write-off authority. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{took the}} form of a qualitative interpretative case study focusing on the study sample of 9 municipal officials responsible for monitoring the payment of government debt as the consumer type. Data was collected through face to face interviews by means of completing the questionnaire based on the responses from the respondent. The study examined the underlying and related causes of non-payment of government debt. The study revealed that municipalities in the Eastern Cape lack support from the other spheres of government in ensuring timeous payments of outstanding debt. Growth in debtors indicated the failure by the municipalities to implement proper debt management processes and the lack of political will to collect debts. The study recommended that municipalities need to waive interest on disputed debt and the debt in that regard be reported on the <b>suspense</b> <b>account</b> to avoid over estimation or debt that might not be recovered in the long run...|$|R

During 2006, Standard & Poor's analysts wrote: [...] "Each year, for example, the U.S. Social Security Administration maintains roughly $6 billion to $7 billion of Social Security contributions in an [...] "earnings <b>suspense</b> file"—an <b>account</b> for W-2 tax forms that cannot be matched to the correct Social Security number. The vast majority of these numbers are attributable to illegal workers who will never claim their benefits. For 2010, the Social Security Administration estimated that illegal immigrants and their employers paid $13 billion in social security (OASDI) payroll taxes.|$|R
40|$|A law {{shall not}} violate its sources, {{especially}} if the sources {{are not subject to}} being overruled or ignored. However, one of the essential Islamic objectives is preserving the wealth “property. ” This preservation requires protecting wealth from being acquired in illegitimate way, which will prevent the owners from controlling and enjoying their wealth. Islam protects true owners themselves from getting harmed or facing suffering caused by engaging in a transaction that involved their property. In making the law, Islamic scholars contend that any deliberate act that creates harm or makes someone suffer is “strictly prohibited” and must be rebuked. This legal rule is founded on a statement from the prophet “PBUH” who said, “There is no injury nor return of injury. ” The law of unclaimed accounts states the following: if the current account lays dormant for a five-year period, with no transactions by the customer or his authorized agent, the account shall be considered unclaimed and the bank should transfer the balance thereof to a pooled <b>Suspense</b> <b>Account</b> reserved for these accounts inside the bank. This law of unclaimed money has given the Saudi banks unjust power over their customers, causing difficulty for heirs and third-party creditors trying to retrieve their wealth. This law should be reformed by adopting a fair law to remove this harmful practice and restore the rightful owners’ rights to control and enjoy their wealth. This law also violates some major principles of Islam, such as the inheritance law. As a result, this law violates the two primary sources of Islam, so it is unconstitutional...|$|R
40|$|Jane Eyre {{has been}} {{reproduced}} many times, in many forms. Every since its publication the novel {{has been very}} popular. Next to Jane Eyre itself this thesis will examine two novels, Rebecca and Nine Coaches Waiting which use the famous myth around Jane Eyre. The myth is: plain girl meets dark handsome and rich man {{but she does not}} marry him until she is independent herself. These elements give the novel the character of a Bildungsroman; throughout the novel the heroine develops and grows. Significant for the myth are its ending, the character of the heroine, the Gothic elements, the romantic suspense and the form of narration. These are the basic elements of the myth and they recur in the other reproductions of Jane Eyre. The combination of the myth’s high literary value and its romantic <b>suspense</b> <b>account</b> for its continuing popularity. On the one hand it is a Bildungsroman displaying the growth of a young lady fighting the system to become an independent woman. On the other hand, it is the classic romantic love story of a poor girl who wins the heart of a rich, outspoken character of a man. Despite the obstacles the novel has a happy ending and the couple marries. This thesis will be analysing the polarity of the myth by answering the following question: what causes the popularity and quality of the Jane Eyre-myth? This thesis will look at the significant elements of the myth mentioned earlier and which recur in Rebecca and Nine Coaches Waiting...|$|R
40|$|The {{calendar}} anomaly {{associated with}} negative stock returns {{over the weekend}} is investigated. It is argued that such effects {{may be caused by}} a number of institutional features. Using Datastream's daily stock returns index for the UK over the period 1980 - 1993, it is shown that after allowing for three institutional factors there is no residual weekend anomaly to be explained. These factors are: (i) financing discontinuities associated with the account settlement period; (ii) the relative scarcity of funds while finance is held in banks <b>suspense</b> and transmission <b>accounts</b> on Settlement Day; and (iii) firms reluctance to hold money during non-trading periods. ...|$|R
60|$|Throughout the <b>suspense</b> on Leonard's <b>account,</b> Aubrey {{had been}} a source of anxiety to all, {{especially}} to Tom. The boy's sensitive frame had been so much affected, that tender dealings with him were needful, and all compulsion {{had been a}}voided. His father had caused him to be put on the sick-list of the volunteers; and as for his studies, though the books were daily brought out, it was only to prevent the vacuum of idleness; and Tom had made it his business to nurse his brother's powers, avoid all strain on the attention, and occupy without exciting, bearing with his fitful moods of despondence or of hope, whether they took the form of talking or of dreaming.|$|R
