40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{corrosion}} protection methods in <b>reinforcing</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>bars</b> is the application of fusion-bonded epoxy coatings. Although considerable research has been carried out on the performance of epoxy-coated bars (ECR), there are still many uncertainties about their performance in cracked concrete. In this experimental program, reinforcing steel bars with six types of epoxy coatings embedded in concrete slabs with a 0. 4 mm wide preformed crack intersecting the reinforcing steel at right angles were tested. Results of corrosion potentials, corrosion current density, coating adhesion tests, chloride content, and visual examination after 68 months of exposure to a simulated marine environment are reported. Results revealed that under the studied conditions the ECR did not provide total protection of steel reinforcement in cracked concrete. Their use however, tended to reduce significantly the damage caused by the chloride-induced corrosion when compared with the uncoated bars embedded in concrete with similar characteristics.

The described solution is based on prof. Borcz’s mathematical model.

40|$|Object of {{the paper}} is the {{simulation}} of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>bars</b> behaviour, accounting for crack opening and concrete-rebar slippage. A macro beam element with a single uniform reinforcement is studied in details in the uniaxial case. Distinct constitutive hypotheses are formulated for the materials. The CEB-FIP Model Code 90 rules the behaviour of the materials interface that is assumed to be fully dissipative. Steel is supposed to behave elastoplastically with hardening. Crack opening in the concrete matrix is introduced by means of a strong discontinuity approach (SDA). All the relevant equations of the problem are variationally derived from a mixed energy functional. Two enhancements of the enriched kinematics, based on polynomial or exponential shape functions, respectively, are compared with the usual SDA enhancement. As an alternative approach, high-order interpolation of the displacement field based on B-splines, both for steel and concrete, is proposed. These functions appear to be adequate in reproducing rapidly varying fields, like the stress gradients occurring in the shear lag problem near the boundaries or where slips and/or cracks occur. Their use allow to use few macro-element instead of the very dense meshing required in those areas by the traditional FE interpolations...|$|R

This project aims to identify the behaviour of tension stiffening for <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> specimens with large diameter reinforcement under sustained loading.

The applicability of finite element models in the structural analysis of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> was also evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the existing conclusions for small diameter cases hold for the larger diameters. Tension stiffening, however, decays at a much higher rate than previously believed and reached a constant value within a maximum of 10 days in each case. The suggestion that only the long-term calculation methods presented in the various building codes for tension stiffening should be used for serviceability limit state calculations is supported. Additionally, a trend is identified which indicates a decrease in tension stiffening decay time with increasing bar diameter...|$|R

Excessive amounts of longitudinal and transverse reinforcement (in excess of 2 % reinforcement ratio) are required to provide essentially elastic behavior for the SSE and to resist the design demands. Additionally, conventional single-leg tie reinforcement with 90 ° and 135 ° hooks at alternate ends are required at some locations for seismic detailing. All these requirements lead to rebar congestion, and make conventional single-leg ties difficult to install in <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures. T-headed <b>bars</b> are being considered to resolve this issue. These consist of deformed reinforcing bars with T-heads {{in the form of}} welded or threaded rebar terminators with bearing area {{greater than or equal to}} four times the reinforcing bar area. To investigate the effectiveness of T-headed bars for use as single-leg ties, this type of reinforcement was used as shear reinforcement in beam specimens to investigate the anchorage ability of the T-heads to develop the yield strength of the tie bars.
