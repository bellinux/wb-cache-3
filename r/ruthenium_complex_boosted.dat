Further investigations on the sub-class of trishydride <b>ruthenium</b> <b>complexes</b> bearing NHC ligands (Cp'(NHC) RuH 3) reveal that these complexes have an unusual and great catalytic performance toward the hydrodefluorination (HDF) of fluorinated aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The combined kinetic studies, cross-over experiments and rate law analysis suggest an unusual mechanistic pathway for the Cp*(IPr) RuH 3 catalyzed HDF.

(imH) [trans-RuCl 4 (dmso-S) (im) ] (im = imidazole, dmso = dimethylsulfoxide), is a Ru(III) complex that, after {{extensive}} preclinical {{investigations that}} evidenced its remarkable and specific activity against metastases, has recently and successfully completed a Phase I trial (first <b>ruthenium</b> <b>complex</b> ever to reach clinical testing). This review article, {{after a brief}} summary of the main chemical and pharmacological aspects of NAMI-A, focuses {{on the development of}} new classes of <b>ruthenium</b> <b>complexes</b> originated from the NAMI-A frame...|$|R
40|$|Association of [60]fullerene with arene {{ruthenium}} moieties {{has been}} achieved for the first time. Two fullerenopyrrolidine derivatives (N pyr -C 60) were synthesized via a 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition, and coordinated to arene <b>ruthenium</b> <b>complexes</b> to form two half-sandwich complexes of the general formula (p -cymene) RuCl 2 (N pyr -C 60). The coordination of the fullerenopyrrolidines to the arene ruthenium unit was evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, thus confirming the formation of these novel arene <b>ruthenium</b> <b>complexes...</b>|$|R

As an attractive alternative {{of importance for}} practical applications, the in situ generation of new NHC ruthenium precatalysts, starting from the easily accessible imidazolium and imidazolinium salts, ruthenium dimer [RuCl 2 (p-cymene) ](2) and a base, is reported in detail. The new NHC family of <b>ruthenium</b> <b>complexes</b> offers great promise as metathesis precatalysts enjoying a wide application profile in organic and polymer synthesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
