The winning letter, written by a gentleman who did not particularly care for Vallee's music, said: [...] "Rudy Vallee is reaping the harvest of a seed that is seldom sown this day and age: LOVE. The good-looking little son-of-a-gun really and honestly LOVES his audience and his art. He LOVES to please listeners—LOVES it more than he does {{his name in the}} big lights, his mug in the papers. He loved all those unseen women as passionately as a voice can love, long before they began to purr and to caress him with two-cent stamps." ...|$|E
5000|$|Similar to Bittner's Boston station WJIB, WJTO {{does not}} air any commercials, but is big on local public service announcements, {{including}} fund-raising spots aimed at keeping the {{station on the}} air. WJTO's first fundraising drive in 2008 raised $29,676.11 from 657 different listeners (including a <b>radio</b> <b>fan</b> from Goshen, New York who actually hunted down Bob and the station after hearing it on vacation) over an eleven-week period that summer. Later fund-drives (contributions from listeners) in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were quite successful, thereby solidifying this method of support. Having allegiance to the listeners, as opposed to commercial interests, allows WJTO to have {{what they call a}} [...] "pro-people attitude" [...] with public service announcements and editorial opinions rarely heard on other stations http://www.wjto.com ...|$|E

50|$|It is {{not known}} for sure who played Jimmy Barton. Old time <b>radio</b> <b>fans</b> think it was either Walter Tetley of The Great Gildersleeve and The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show, or Tommy Carr of the radio show, Magic Island.

5000|$|The American radio show, {{perhaps due to}} {{the fact}} that it {{immediately}} preceded the blockbuster radio series The Man Called X, was extremely popular: [...] "The program was clearly well received, was building a loyal audience for the full-hour block of foreign adventure drama it presented", although some <b>radio</b> <b>fans</b> found the American radio series [...] "not quite overcoming the absolute predictability of the stories." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{covering}} the 1932-34 rise of Jack Pearl, Elizabeth McLeod summed up Penner's popularity:The ultimate Depression-era zany was Joe Penner. A forgotten performer today to most, and {{little more than}} a footnote to the average OTR <b>radio</b> <b>fan,</b> Penner was a national craze in 1933-34. There is no deep social meaning in his comedy, no shades of subtlety — just utter slapstick foolishness, delivered in an endearingly simpering style that's the closest thing the 1930s had to Pee-wee Herman. An added attraction was Penner's in-character singing each week of a whimsical novelty song, specially written to suit his style. Like Pearl, however, Penner was doomed to early decline by the sheer repetitiveness of his format, even though he remained very popular with children right up {{to the end of his}} radio career.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>fan</b> {{response}} to the American television show was tepid: Seven years before [...] "Mr. Lucky" [...] and the [...] "James Bond" [...] character, Donlevy donned a dinner jacket for the TV series and attempted to look suave in his exploits, including the opening sequence during which he assumed a nonchalant pose as a dagger whizzed dangerously past his head. Other than that, the series was a bit tedious, since Donlevy {{was not able to}} portray the confident nuances of the character type that was pioneered by Cary Grant and Sean Connery later, who played a dangerous situation with savoir faire (i.e., grace under pressure); one-dimensional situations and character attributes that might have gotten by on radio were a bit hard to swallow when you saw them acted out on television; and of course, as the old saying goes, perhaps [...] "the pictures are better" [...] on radio.|$|E

She tells Peter she wants her {{monitoring}} device gone but he has trouble getting it approved. Kimberly breaks her wrist to remove it so she can begin work as radio host. Eventually the device is legally removed and Kimberly moves into Melrose Place. Feeling lonely, Kimberly begins a string of one-night stands. An obsessed <b>radio</b> <b>fan</b> soon harasses Kimberly and kidnaps her but she breaks free and takes him to the police where he is jailed. Kimberly decides {{to go back to}} work at Wilshire where she begins work as a psychiatrist. Sydney becomes a patient of hers, where she regularly discusses Michael.

5000|$|Other major weekly AFRS {{shows were}} Mail Call and GI Journal, and the singer {{was a regular}} {{participant}} in these too. On March 8, 1943, Time magazine said, [...] "The best in radio—and a lot of it—goes to U.S. forces at the fighting fronts. They have received over 1,000 special programs which U.S. <b>radio</b> <b>fans</b> would give plenty to hear. Forty-odd shows a week are heard only by the armed forces." ...|$|R
50|$|KDKA's {{broadcast}} of the Pirates vs. Phillies game provided the inspiration for other radio stations across the country {{over the next few}} years to broadcast games like baseball and other professional sports. Soon after, radio baseball began its rapid ascent in American culture. Before <b>radio,</b> <b>fans</b> turned to visual displays or structures that showed the progress of a game. These structures were usually manually operated by someone who was informed about the game through telegraph.|$|R
50|$|That eulogy {{provoked}} {{hundreds of}} letters from current readers and old <b>radio</b> <b>fans</b> alike. With several hundred episodes of Easy Aces now circulating among old-time radio collectors (episodes the Aces syndicated through the Frederick W. Ziv Company in 1945), Jane Ace has been discovered by fans who weren't even alive before her own death. The National Radio Hall of Fame helped make sure of that, inducting Easy Aces and its co-stars in 1990.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1995, Emerson {{was hired}} by KCNR in Salt Lake City, where he co-hosted the {{afternoon}} drive show Drive-By Radio with Clyde Lewis. [...] In Salt Lake City, as in Spokane, Emerson worked under the stage name [...] "Rick Taylor". Salt Lake City Weekly described Rick Taylor as [...] "everything a talk <b>radio</b> <b>fan</b> under 50 could ask for: Confrontational, funny, smart, vaguely liberal, pop-culture obsessed and driven to Get Your Attention! like no one before or since on SLC's airwaves." [...] He became program director of KCNR and helped create {{one of the most}} popular radio stations in Utah. Journalist Bill Frost later wrote: [...] "From January 1995 to November 1996, KCNR AM 1320 (later 860) brought the Salt Lake Valley the most in-your-face, vibrant, talk-radio format it had ever heard. Rick Taylor, Martin Davies, Todd Herman and Clyde Lewis took back the airwaves from the old guard of creaky conspiratorialists and politicalpontificators and, at least in small part, introduced it to a younger, hipper audience. It was rock & roll radio without the music, and what they accomplished in such a short period of time is still talked about to this day." ...|$|E

25|$|Griffin {{started as}} a singer on radio at age 19, {{appearing}} on San Francisco Sketchbook, a nationally syndicated program based at KFRC.
