25|$|Deathcore {{also began}} to gain {{moderate}} popularity in the late 2000s (specifically 2006 and 2007). Notable bands that brought the genre in the highlight include Bring Me the Horizon and Suicide Silence. Suicide Silence's No Time to Bleed peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200, number 12 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 6 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart, while their album The Black Crown peaked at number 28 on the Billboard 200, number 7 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 3 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart. After its release, Whitechapel's album This Is Exile sold 5,900 in copies, which made it enter the Billboard 200 chart at position 118. Their self-titled album peaked at number 65 on the Canadian Albums Chart and also at number 47 on the Billboard 200. Their third album A New Era of Corruption sold about 10,600 copies in the United States in its first week of being released and peaked at position number 43 on the Billboard 200 chart. Furthermore, Bring Me the Horizon won the 2006 Kerrang! Awards for Best British Newcomer after they released their 2006 debut <b>record</b> <b>Count</b> Your Blessings. However, Bring Me the Horizon abandoned the deathcore genre {{after the release of}} this album. San Diego natives Carnifex, witnessed success with their first album Dead in My Arms, selling 5,000 copies with little publicity. On top of their non-stop touring and methodical songwriting resulted in Carnifex quickly getting signed to label Victory Records. Lastly, Australian deathcore band Thy Art Is Murder debuted at number 35 on the ARIA Charts with their album Hate (2012) making them the first metal band to ever reach the Top 40 of this chart.|$|E

5000|$|The Missouri River valley had {{historically}} {{been a major}} migration corridor for birds, however, the channelization {{of the river and}} destruction of wetlands has led to a marked decline. The corridor still boasts one of the best areas to view raptor migrations on the continent. As air masses move off the Great Plains, they sink into the Missouri River valley. The prevailing winds across the floodplain then hit the sharp rise of the Loess Hills, creating thermal updrafts that raptors use to make their way to and from breeding grounds. Raptors can often be viewed forming [...] "kettles", where many birds will create a funnel-like formation as they utilize the same thermal. Typical species found during the months from September to December include red-tailed hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, peregrine falcon, ferruginous hawk, Swainson's hawk, Cooper's hawk, osprey, northern harrier, American kestrel, and bald eagle. In all, 20 species of raptor have been identified in a single season since the Hitchcock Nature Center HawkWatch started, with a <b>record</b> <b>count</b> of 16,000 birds in one season in 2005.|$|E

Objectives; The study aimed to determine {{the performance of the}} {{supply chain management}} system for ARVs and HIV test kits in Dodoma region. Methodology The study was descriptive, both retrospective and prospective. Stock records, storage conditions, consumption data and Medicines fulfillment order of ARVs and HIV test kits, were assessed using designed checklists. Questionnaires were designed to collect information from health personnel about their knowledge on quantification, stock control and storage conditions of ARVs and HIV test kits. Results Stock out period of ARVs ranged from 9. 41 % to 0. 4 %, Determine reported range of 65 % to 6. 5 % and Unigold showed 8. 2 %. ARVs reported 57. 14 % of <b>record</b> <b>count</b> greater than physical count, Determine reported 0. 33 % and Unigold reported 0. 25 %. <b>Record</b> <b>count</b> less than physical count of ARVs ranged from 57. 14 % to 14. 3 %. Three facilities reported to have working monitored cold storage. Only MSD reported 100 % accurate consumption record of ARVs, seven facilities reported accurate for determine and Unigold too. One facility reported 100 % order fulfillment of request of ARVs. Seven facilities reported 100 % for determine and four facilities reported 100 % for Unigold. Of the staffs interviewed 39. 4 % showed to have good level of knowledge on quantification, storage conditions of medicines and stock keeping. Conclusion There is significant stock out period of ARVs and test kits in facilities. Records keeping of stock are not well managed. Some of the stores did not monitor cold storage and have working fire extinguishers. Incorrect consumption records were reported. The study observed that there was insufficient supply of ARVs and test kits at facilities which is not enough to facilities.
