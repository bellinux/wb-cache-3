40|$|This {{article is}} a {{conversation}} and encounter between an Indigenous and a non-Indigenous constitutional law scholar attempting {{to make sense of}} &# 039;race&# 039; as it is written and interpreted in the Australian Constitution through a close re-reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tasmanian Dams Case and the race power in s 51 (xxvi). The conversation is intended to perform a conduct of jurisprudence in which <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> law as a matter of doctrine are brought into relation. We first try to make sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> 1967 as a constitutional moment shifting <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> race in <b>the</b> Constitution, before turning to a close <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> in Tasmanian Dams on the race power. We argue that through analysis of these judgments it is possible to understand better <b>the</b> constrictions <b>of</b> Australian canons of constitutional interpretation as applied to race, with its focus on &# 039;special&# 039; characteristics, heritage and culture. We also argue that a close <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> Tasmanian Dams offers a good starting place from which to question <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> what meaning race might carry if the political and social experiences of Indigenous peoples with the Constitution are joined to more easily accepted interpretative conventions...|$|R

In this respect, <b>the</b> substantive clarification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RED is not optimal. At a more procedural level the argument is developed that the ECJ should adopt, especially in preliminary ruling procedures, broad, more systematic and thus elaborate, rather than narrow, condensed rulings. differentiation; preliminary rulings; minorities; non-discrimination; European Court of Justice; European Court of Justice; law...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic rules}} for {{interpreting}} <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> or order <b>of</b> a court {{are no different}} from those applicable to <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> documents. <b>The</b> court's intention has to be ascertained primarily from <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> or order as construed according to the usual well-known rules. <b>The</b> <b>judgment</b> or order, and the court's reasons for giving it, must {{be read as a}} whole in order to ascertain its intention. If, on such a <b>reading,</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> or order is clear and unambiguous, no extrinsic fact or evidence is admissible to contradict, vary, qualify or supplement it.

40|$|If we {{trace the}} space between an idea and its referent, between the move to judge and <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> a shadow falls within it.

This shadow names and marks the always fading subject. This Essay is broken in two parts. In the first part, my concern is with <b>the</b> written texts <b>of</b> law; in <b>the</b> second, it is with <b>the</b> visual texts <b>of</b> culture. <b>The</b> theme <b>of</b> both parts is nevertheless <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> HIV {{and its relation to}} <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> its force as a limit or liminal case in revealing <b>the</b> imaginary order <b>of</b> <b>judgment.</b> In substance, <b>the</b> Essay will concentrate upon <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> cases concerning <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gay man and, more specifically, the HIV positive gay man before the law. Although my argument focuses on <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gay man in judgment, its implications might well extend to the suffering that many groups experience as they oscillate between negation and derogation in the legal imagination. <b>The</b> intent <b>of</b> this Essay is not to advocate any kind <b>of</b> withdrawal from <b>the</b> legal sphere, any opting-out of legal discourse. Rather, my intent is to find hopefulness in paradox: it is only in <b>the</b> disappearance <b>of</b> images that <b>the</b> compassionate envisioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other can take place.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{majority}} <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> Mogoeng CJ in F v Minister of Safety and Security 2012 1 SA 536 (CC) {{purports to}} be a straightforward application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasoning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitutional Court in K v Minister of Safety and Security 2005 6 SA 419 (CC), {{in which the}} court updated and constitutionalised the "standard test" for vicarious liability in deviation cases originally set out in Minister of Police v Rabie 1986 1 SA 117 (A) by holding that constitutional and other policy norms now {{play an important role}} in deciding questions of vicarious liability. However, it is respectfully submitted that a close <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority <b>judgment</b> in F reveals that the judge misconstrues several key concepts related to <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> vicarious liability. In particular, the judge seems to suggest that there are separate and different tests for vicarious liability in instances where an employee has plainly committed a delict in the course and scope of his employment, and where he has to some extent deviated from his employment duties. In fact, there is a single overarching test for vicarious liability - the course and scope rule - but various subsidiary tests are used by the courts to address difficult or borderline cases. It is also questionable whether F truly is a "typical deviation case", as the judge asserts. The judge then applies the constitutionalised test for vicarious liability originally set out in K in a manner which is subtly, but significantly, different from how it was deployed in that case. In particular, Mogoeng CJ's implication that it is not necessary for a court to consider <b>the</b> second leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rabie test in circumstances where the employee wrongdoer has clearly subjectively intended to further <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> his employer is undesirable and should not be supported. Furthermore, the judge identifies <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> whether or not there is an "intimate link" between <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employee wrongdoer and <b>the</b> business <b>of</b> his employer as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normative issues to be canvassed in order to determine <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rabie test. In fact, the "intimate link" question is the overall one to be decided in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rabie test, which, in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach set out by O'Regan J in K, is to be answered by considering a range of factual and normative considerations in conjunction with one another. Moreover, the judge appears to construe the "intimate link" question in primarily factual terms. The discrepancies between <b>the</b> approaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courts in K and F are significant because they lead Mogoeng CJ to place a far heavier reliance on factual considerations in deciding whether <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employee wrongdoer was sufficiently closely related to the employer's business than would have been the case if he had more faithfully applied the test for vicarious liability set out in K. Although the judge devotes a considerable portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> to <b>the</b> normative issues which point to the need for the court to make a finding of vicarious liability, these do not seem to have been <b>the</b> immediate driver <b>of</b> his ultimate decision to impose vicarious liability in this instance. <b>The</b> reasoning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority in F becomes all the more problematic when one considers that the factual considerations linking the employee wrongdoer's conduct to <b>the</b> business <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SAPS are far more tenuous in this case than in K. A more compelling justification for imposing vicarious liability in F would have lain in the normative constitutional considerations that point towards the need to impose vicarious liability in this instance...|$|R
