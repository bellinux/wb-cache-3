In an effort to combat inflation and foster economic growth the Zimbabwean Dollar was suspended indefinitely on 12 April 2009.

25|$|Madison {{served on}} the Virginia governor's Council of State from 1777 to 1779, at which point {{he was elected to}} the Congress of the Confederation. The country faced a {{difficult}} war against Great Britain, as well as <b>runaway</b> <b>inflation,</b> financial troubles, and lack of cooperation between the different levels of government. Madison worked to make himself an expert on financial issues, becoming deeply involved in congressional committees, becoming a legislative workhorse and a master of parliamentary coalition building. Frustrated by the failure of the states to supply needed requisitions, Madison proposed a standing army, a permanent navy, and the ability of Congress to compel states to meet their war-time obligations. Madison also persuaded Virginia to give up its claims to northwestern territories—consisting of most of modern-day Ohio and points west—to the Continental Congress. After serving Congress from 1781 to 1783, Madison won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1784.|$|E
500|$|After the <b>runaway</b> <b>inflation</b> of {{the third}} century, {{associated}} with the production of fiat {{money to pay for}} public expenses, Diocletian had tried unsuccessfully to re establish trustworthy minting of silver and billon coins. The failure of the various Diocletianic attempts at the restoration of a functioning silver coin resided {{in the fact that the}} silver currency was overvalued in terms of its actual metal content, and therefore could only circulate at much discounted rates. Minting of the Diocletianic [...] "pure" [...] silver argenteus ceased, therefore, soon after 305, while the billon currency continued to be used until the 360s. From the early 300s on, Constantine forsook any attempts at restoring the silver currency, preferring instead to concentrate on minting large quantities of good standard gold pieces—the solidus, 72 of which made a pound of gold. New (and highly debased) silver pieces would continue to be issued during Constantine's later reign and after his death, in a continuous process of retariffing, until this bullion minting eventually ceased, de jure, in 367, with the silver piece being de facto continued by various denominations of bronze coins, the most important being the centenionalis. These bronze pieces continued to be devalued, assuring the possibility of keeping fiduciary minting alongside a gold standard. The anonymous author of the possibly contemporary treatise on military affairs De Rebus Bellicis held that, as a consequence of this monetary policy, the rift between classes widened: the rich benefited from the stability in purchasing power of the gold piece, while the poor had to cope with ever-degrading bronze pieces. Later emperors like Julian the Apostate tried to present themselves as advocates of the humiles by insisting on trustworthy mintings of the bronze currency.|$|E

This situation of lack of credit persisted until the domestic economy was stabilized in 1991 with the Convertibility Plan, and foreign debt renegotiation was completed in 1993 with the Brady Plan. Loan finance recovered to unprecedented levels since the 1950 s, and bond finance became for the first time an important financing vehicle for both the national government and large firms in the corporate sector. Credit came to a sudden stop in 2001, with widespread default on both corporate and government bonds.

40|$|The weather-cock on {{the church}} spire, though made of iron, would soon be broken by the storm-wind {{if it did not}} {{understand}} the noble art of turning to every wind. Heinrich Heine Many of us have lived through the nightmare of a project with no process to guide it. The lack of a process leads to unpredictability, repeated error, and wasted effort. Customers are disappointed by slipping schedules, growing budgets, and poor quality. Developers are disheartened by working ever longer hours to produce ever poorer software. Once we have experienced such a fiasco, we become afraid of repeating the experience. A common response to fear is to create a process that we believe eliminates what we are afraid of. We are afraid that • The project will produce the wrong product. • The project will produce a product of inferior quality. • The project will be late. • We’ll have to work 80 hour weeks. • We’ll have to break commitments. • We won’t be having fun. Our fears motivate us to create a process that constrains our activities and demands certain outputs and artifacts. We draw these constraints and outputs from past experience, choosing things that appeared to work well in previous projects. Our hope is that they will work again, and take away our fears. Chapter: But projects are not so simple that a few constraints and artifacts can reliably prevent error. As errors continue to be made, we diagnose those errors and put in place even more constraints and outputs in order to prevent those errors in the future. After many projects we may find ourselves overloaded with a huge cumbersome process that greatly impedes our ability to get projects done. A big cumbersome process can create the very problems that it is designed to prevent. It can slow the team to the extent that schedules slip and budgets bloat. It can reduce responsiveness of the team {{to the point that they}} are always creating the wrong product. Unfortunately this leads many teams to believe that they don’t have enough process. So, in a kind of <b>runaway</b> process <b>inflation,</b> they make their process ever larger. <b>Runaway</b> process <b>inflation</b> is a good description of the state of affairs of the software industry circa 2000 A.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{empirical}} calibration of equilibrium tidal theory for extrasolar planet systems, extending a prior study by incorporating detailed physical {{models for the}} internal structure of planets and host stars. The resulting strength of the stellar tide produces a coupling that {{is strong enough to}} reorient the spins of some host stars without causing catastrophic orbital evolution, thereby potentially explaining the observed trend in alignment between stellar spin and planetary orbital angular momentum. By isolating the sample whose spins should not have been altered in this model, we also show evidence for two different processes that contribute to the population of planets with short orbital periods. We apply our results to estimate the remaining lifetimes for short period planets, examine the survival of planets around evolving stars, and determine the limits for circularisation of planets with highly eccentric orbits. Our analysis suggests that the survival of circularised planets is strongly affected by the amount of heat dissipated, which is often large enough to lead to <b>runaway</b> orbital <b>inflation</b> and Roche lobe overflow.

40|$|In {{chameleon}} gravity, {{there exists}} a light scalar field that couples to the trace of the stress-energy tensor {{in such a way}} that its mass depends on the ambient matter density, and the field is screened in local, high-density environments. Recently it was shown that, for the runaway potentials commonly considered in chameleon theories, the field's coupling to matter and the hierarchy of scales between Standard Model particles and the energy scale of such potentials result in catastrophic effects in the early Universe when these particles become nonrelativistic. Perturbations with trans-Planckian energies are excited, and the theory suffers a breakdown in calculability at the relatively low temperatures of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We consider a chameleon field in a quartic potential and show that the scale-free nature of this potential allows the chameleon to avoid many of the problems encountered by <b>runaway</b> potentials. Following <b>inflation,</b> the chameleon field oscillates around the minimum of its effective potential, and rapid changes in its effective mass excite perturbations via quantum particle production. The quartic model, however, only generates high-energy perturbations at comparably high temperatures and is able remain a well-behaved effective field theory at nucleosynthesis.

50|$|The {{evening of}} August 7, 1990 {{is known in}} Peru as the D-day of the {{neoliberal}} shock therapy that the Fujimori administration imposed upon Peru and the beginning neo-liberal economic scheme that governs the Peruvian economy to this day. The term ´Fuji Shock´ was truly born in Peru after Fujimori's government successfully tackled hyperinflation in 1991, using Sach's ideas. In particular Sachs and Fujimori cited Chile as inspiration where, during a period over 1973-1976, price controls and government support were withdrawn over a very short period, kick-starting the Chilean economy and completing its transition from a soviet inspired cold war to a liberal state. Fujimori's shock terapy was a total reversal of practically all the economic policies of the previous 20 years by preceding governments, from Velasco's soviet socialism to Alan Garcia's yugoslav inspired socialism in conditions that clearly required drastic corrective action.
