5|$|The decisive {{confrontation}} between the Libyan-FAP forces and the Chadian regular forces took place at Faya-Largeau, {{the capital of the}} BET. The city, defended by 5,000 Chadian soldiers, fell on 18 February after sharp fighting to a force of 2,500 rebels, supported by possibly as many as 4,000 Libyan troops. The Libyans do not seem to have directly participated in the fighting; in a pattern that was to <b>repeat</b> <b>itself</b> in the future, the Libyans provided armor, artillery and air support. The rebels also were much better armed than before, displaying Strela-2 surface-to-air missiles.|$|E

25|$|Reform {{had also}} failed in 1997 to {{establish}} {{itself as the}} clear right-wing alternative to the Liberal Party. The Progressive Conservative Party, which had been steadily rebuilt under Charest, enjoyed a modest revival in the 1997 election.

The split in the right-wing vote between Reform and the PCs possibly aided the Liberals to win a second majority government.

25|$|By then, Bujor {{also contributed}} to several other {{literary}} magazines, including Arta, Lupta, Noua Revistă Română, and Revista Literară și Științifică (where he was editing secretary), and also to newspapers such as Opinia and Tribuna Conservatoare. His short stories were collected as Mi-a cântat cucu-n față (1910). In 1911, Bujor published the essay Foamea și iubirea în lupta pentru existență ("Hunger and Love in the Fight for Existence"), and, with Cantacuzino, Gheorghe Marinescu, and Francisc Rainer, founded the international journal Annales de Biologie. This activity was followed in 1913 by a piece advocating democratization and land reform (Reforma electorală și agrară). At the time, Bujor warned the establishment that the peasants' revolt would <b>repeat</b> <b>itself</b> unless land would be divided among the landless.|$|E

If those weapons {{were part of a}} single larger force, attacking them would require attacks on the other hosting countries as well, making the prospect far less interesting. The US also feared that other countries would want to follow the UK lead and develop their own deterrent forces, leading to a proliferation problem even among their own allies. If a deterrent was being provided by a larger international force, the need for individual forces would be reduced.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2000 season Croatia appointed former player Velemir Crljen as the successor to Pilaš. Crljen additions to the roster included several former USL A-League veterans Paul Moore, Chris Handsor, Tony Preci, Ervin Ryta, Gentian Buzali, and Roman Harapyn. Though Toronto failed in repeating their previous season performance they still managed to clinch a postseason berth by finishing third in the standings with the second best offensive and defensive records in the league. In the Canada Cup tournament Croatia won their group, and advanced to the semifinals where they faced the Olympians, where once more Croatia suffered a 3-2 defeat in a penalty shootout to the Scarborough side. Their playoff run began with a 3-1 victory over St. Catharines with Josip Draganic, Leo Marasovic, and Denny Draganic tallying the goals. The victory advanced the team to the CPSL Championship final, where history would <b>repeat</b> <b>itself</b> with their opponents being the Toronto Olympians. This time Croatia avenged their previous defeat with the Draganic brothers producing the necessary goals in a 2-1 conquest of the championship to prevent the Olympians from acquiring their second straight treble.|$|E
25|$|On 15 April 1945, while {{attached}} to the 11th Armoured Division, Hughes became the first Allied Medical Officer to enter the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. Hughes {{took control of the}} camp and the 4,600 German and Hungarian soldiers placed at his command by the German authorities. Hughes' two main issues were the control of disease, after an outbreak of typhus, and the distribution of food. To aid with the general health of the camp victims, Hughes took control of the local hospital, removing the German patients to treat his new charges. The hospital was later renamed the Glyn Hughes Hospital in his honour. The distribution of rations was a far greater problem, and with only 120 British troops, the German soldiers were ordered to assist in the control of food in the camp. On the first night of the liberation a riot broke out among the inmates over limited rations and the German guards reacted by shooting and killing several of them. To ensure this situation did not <b>repeat</b> <b>itself,</b> Hughes threatened to execute a German soldier for every inmate killed. In September 1945, Hughes {{was one of the main}} witnesses for the prosecution in the Belsen Trial. For his actions at Belsen, Hughes was awarded the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and the Legion of Merit. He also received a second Bar to his DSO, for actions during the attempted relief of Arnhem from the South, earlier in the campaign, where as the most senior surviving officer, he took command of the tanks. In 1945 he was awarded the CBE.|$|E

25|$|Like most of Europe, Spain had {{suffered}} from famine and plague during the 14th and 15th centuries. By 1500, Europe {{was beginning to}} emerge from these demographic disasters, and populations began to explode. Seville, which was home to 60,000 people in 1500 burgeoned to 150,000 {{by the end of}} the century. There was a substantial movement to the cities of Spain to capitalize on new opportunities as shipbuilders and merchants to service Spain's impressive and growing empire. The 16th century was a time of development in Spain as both agriculture and trade burgeoned. Throughout the harsh interior of Castile grain and wool production grew. The former fed an expansion of the population. The latter fed both local textile manufacturing and a lucrative trade with the Netherlands. The Castilian cities of Burgos, Segovia, Cuenca and Toledo, flourished with the expansion of the textile and metellurgical industries. Santander, on the northern Atlantic coast, grew in wealth from its traditional roles as a port linking the country's interior with Northern Europe and as a ship building centre. Southern cities like Cadiz and Seville expanded rapidly from the commerce and shipbuilding spurred on by the demands of the American colonies. Barcelona, already one of Europe's most important and sophisticated trading port cities in the Middle Ages, continued to develop. By 1590, Spain's population was far greater than what it had been in any previous period. It was during this last decade when Castile began to suffer crop failures and was struck by a plague from 1596 that brought about the first serious reversal in population numbers; a cycle that would <b>repeat</b> <b>itself</b> a number of times in different parts of the country through the 17th century.|$|E

Martyr asked Bucer for his support, but Bucer did not totally agree with Martyr's position and thought that exposure of differences would not assist the cause of reform. Unwilling to see the eucharist conflict <b>repeat</b> <b>itself</b> in England, he told Martyr he did not take sides, Catholic, Lutheran, or Zwinglian.

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Crazy for You" [...] {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning between the high note of C5 to the low note of G3. The song has a basic sequence of E–A–B–A as its chord progression. Unlike her previous singles, the chord sequence does not <b>repeat</b> <b>itself</b> and the chorus slowly unravels to the climax of the song. Lyrically, the song talks about extreme love for one another. It contains innuendos similar to The Crystals' 1963 song [...] "Then He Kissed Me". According to scholar Dave Marsh, the lyrics talk about frank sexual desire among two teenagers. He believed that the line [...] "I'm crazy for you, Touch me once and you'll know it's true" [...] was not ambiguous and it helped Madonna to capitalize on such disambiguation.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule took a {{more positive}} view of the two coins. [...] Commenting on the half dollar obverse, he praised its technical aspects, showing the Mint had learned something from earlier attempts at coin redesign. He admired the reverse, calling the bell and the lettering [...] "jewels of precision". For the quarter eagle obverse, with its figure of a robed Liberty standing on a globe, Vermeule suggested that Sinnock [...] "revert {{in part to the}} allegorical iconography of the nineteenth century." [...] He felt that the Liberty allegory is too blatant, with scroll and torch, and noted that Sinnock eventually found a more proper place for his torch on the Roosevelt dime (1946). The figure itself, despite classical robes, [...] "looks more like a 'flapper' of the 1920s. [...] Her cloth cap accentuates this," [...] according to Vermeule. The reverse, in Vermeule's view, was part of a tradition of realistic views of structures on U.S coins that would <b>repeat</b> <b>itself</b> with the Jefferson nickel (1938).|$|E
