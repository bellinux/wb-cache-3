Magnetic bearing can be categorized by inner-rotor type and outer-rotor type according {{to the position of}} the rotary disc. These two types are applicable based on application environments such as application space, required attraction force, and controllability. Magnetic bearing is generally designed based on the ratio(geometrical coefficient or geometrical efficiency) of pole width to <b>rotor</b> <b>journal</b> radius but proper ratio is only decided by the analysis. This is the difficulty {{of the magnetic}} bearing design. In this paper, proper design technology of the inner-rotor type and outer-rotor-type eight pole magnetic bearings is introduced and verified by finite element method on condition that applicable space is given...|$|E
40|$|Placing damping devices {{between the}} rotor and its frame is a {{frequently}} used engineering solution for reducing excessive vibrations of rotating machines. Their damping effect must be controllable {{to achieve their}} optimum performance {{in a wide range}} of operating speeds. This is enabled by magnetorheological squeeze film dampers, the damping force of which can be controlled by changing magnetic flux passing through the lubricating layer. The magnetorheological oil is represented in the developed mathematical model by Bingham material. The magnetic induction in the damper gap is a significant parameter that directly influences resistance against the flow of the magnetorheological oil and generates the additional magnetic force acting on the <b>rotor</b> <b>journal.</b> Therefore, three approaches (1 D, 2 D, and 3 D) to determination of the semi -analytical relations describing its distribution in the lubricating film were proposed, tested, and compared. The appropriate coefficients were determined by repeatedly solving 2 D or 3 D magneto static problems for the specified damper dimensions, design, and rising magnitude of the journal eccentricity utilizing the finite element and least square methods. In the developed computational model of the rotating machine, the rotor shaft is represented by a beam like -body that is discretised into finite elements. The magnetorheological dampers are implemented by springs and force couplings. The principal contribution of this article consists in the development of a methodology, based on three approaches, for the derivation of closed form formulas describing the distribution of magnetic induction in the damper gap as a function of the <b>rotor</b> <b>journal</b> eccentricity and angular position. The individual approaches give some differences in the results that are consequent upon the distinguishing level used for modelling the damping device. The extent of their applicability is discussed in the article. The developed computational models are intended for the investigation of the vibration attenuation of rotor systems {{in a wide range of}} rotational speeds. Web of Science 10411...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the normal}} {{operational}} {{life of a}} turbine, its <b>rotor</b> <b>journal</b> seating surfaces are wearing and therefore, repair operations, including turning and grinding of such surfaces and next rotor balancing on the balancing machines, are carried out. Traditional turbine rotors machining is provided by fixing them through the centers and demands the corresponding large size machine tools and the strategy «machine tool to rotor» is often used. To minimize mobilization and transportation cost, {{the problem of the}} turbine rotor restoration by using centerless grinding technique on the lightweight horizontal balancing machines is resolved. A computer simulation model of such grinding with workpieces located on their machining surfaces is presented. To validate the approaches, a proposed computer simulation was carried out.

40|$|The {{stability}} of a <b>rotor</b> supported in <b>journal</b> bearings is highly concerned in the practice. The change in oil temperature {{or some other}} disturbances, e. g. earthquake, fluctuations in the net voltage, can bring the rotor in unstable motion. The in{{stability of}} a <b>rotor</b> supported in <b>journal</b> bearings, however may not completely be avoided by a bearing design or choice. Hence, it is desirable to suppress the instability of a rotor at any time, when some disturbances occur. The vibration of a rotor excited by imbalance is stationary and periodic. It should be suppressed by balancing the rotor, but not by a control system. To this end, an active control method is applied to a <b>rotor</b> running in <b>journal</b> bearings, which only activates when {{the motion of the}} rotor tends to be unstable, but doesn't interfere with the stationary periodic motion resulting from imbalance. In this way both the vibration of the rotor and the forces transmitted to foundation will be reduced. In this work, at first the dynamic behaviour of the <b>rotor</b> running in <b>journal</b> bearings is summarized, so that one can easily understand the background of the problem. Then the so-called Phase-Locked Delayed Feedback control method is introduced, using a one-degree of freedom system as object. The control method is applied to a Jeffcott <b>rotor</b> supported in <b>journal</b> bearings and the control parameters are acquired according to the characteristic equation or to an optimal process. The control system will enlarge the stability boundary of the rotor, when it activates. (orig.)

40|$|Dynamic {{properties}} of a rotor supported on two passive magnetic bearings are investigated {{by means of}} the numerical solution to the mathemati-cal model of a prototype developed at the Institute of Thermomechanics ASCR. Magnetic supports always have to include the so-called retainer bearings in order to prevent the rotor from dangerous increase of oscilla-tions due to damage in magnetic bearings. Retainer bearings are rolling bearings, the inner ring of which rotates after an oblique impact by the <b>rotor</b> <b>journal.</b> This rotation introduces an additional degree of freedom to the mathematical model of the rotor support. The main aim {{of this study is to}} gain the basic knowledge about the {{properties of}} such a system, the-refore, a new model of impact motion with large amplitudes, introducing radial Hertz stiffness, material contact damping, tangential dry friction and viscous damping is developed. Dynamic properties of the system described by 6 differential equations containing strongly nonlinear terms are investi-gated, and the results are presented in form of response curves.

40|$|The magnetorheological {{squeeze film}} damping devices for {{vibration}} suppression of rigid rotors are studied in this article. The {{development of their}} mathematical model is based on assumptions of the classical theory of lubrication {{with the exception of}} lubricant. Because the magnetorheological fluids affected by a magnetic field belong to the class of liquids with a yielding shear stress, the lubricant is represented by bilinear theoretical material. The pressure distribution in the full oil film is then described by a modified Reynolds equation. In addition, the influence of cavitation and of the magnetic forces, by which the damping device acts on the <b>rotor</b> <b>journal,</b> were taken into account. The advantage of the developed mathematical model is that, unlike the Bingham or Herschel-Bulkley materials, the flow curve of the bilinear liquid is continuous. It reduces the nonlinear character of the damping forces and thus raises the numerical stability of the computational procedures. The solution convergence is reached also in cases when the procedures based on modelling the magnetorheological fluid by Bingham or Herschel-Bulkley materials fail. Application of bilinear material provides a better description of physical behavior of magnetorheological oils affected by a magnetic field during the damping process. The simulations show that changing magnetic induction in the lubricating film makes it possible to achieve optimum performance of the damping device {{in a wide range of}} the rotor operating speeds and confirms increased numerical stability of the computational procedures.

40|$|Abstract: Backup bearing {{is a key}} safety {{component}} of the rotating machinery with the active magnetic bearings (AMBs). Owing to many unexpected reasons, the AMB rotor running at the full speed may drop onto the backup bearings. Sometimes, the full clearance whirling motion is induced, which is harmful to the machine. Therefore, it is quite important to know the tran-sient behaviour of the AMB rotor and the backup bearing. Till date, a lot of works have been per-formed on the AMB rotor drop and various mathematical models were established. However, most of them took into account only {{the interaction between the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>journal</b> and the backup bearing but neglected the interaction between the shaft and the stator component. As we know, for a real AMB machinery, there should be seal components, and the clearance of the seal component is very small to avoid the leakage. If an AMB failure occurs, the interaction between the shaft and the seal component is likely to happen. Thus, it is more reasonable to include this factor into the AMB rotor drop model. The problem is addressed in this work. The previous model is extended to include the shaft–stator contact. The numerical analysis based on two sets of AMB rotor data shows that the dynamic behaviour of the AMB changes greatly, if the shaft–stator contact is considered. There is no longer an optimum support damp-ing to prevent the harmful full clearance whirling motion, and at this time, a well-balanced AMB rotor is preferred...|$|E

In order to calculate the stability domains and boundaries, the method of averaging is applied.

40|$|Journal {{bearings}} {{are used}} in many applications. An increase of their load carrying capacity and/or decrease of their losses may allow for savings of {{an enormous amount of}} energy. One way to enhance the characteristics of journal bearings is to modify the surface texture of the stator. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the influence of a textured <b>rotor</b> on <b>journal</b> bearing characteristics. Computational Fluid Dynamics is used to model the flow between the <b>rotor</b> and the <b>journal.</b> The full Navier-Stokes equations are solved under unsteady conditions with the commercial software ANSYS CFX 11. A two-dimensional geometry is used to model the bearing. In order to make a simulation, a separate rotor and stator are made and are attached to each other using a rotor-stator interface. Firstly, a single mesh for the smooth journal bearing is used to evaluate possible numerical artefacts created by the interface. The results illustrate a difference of 2. 8 % in the load carrying capacity. Simulation with a dimpled rotor followed. Comparison between a dimpled rotor and smooth rotor shows no significant increase in load carrying capacity of the journal bearing when thermal effects are not taken into account.

40|$|The driving speeds {{at which}} {{self-excited}} motions occur in rotor-bearing systems are {{commonly referred to}} as "instability threshold". These speeds and the magnitude of <b>rotor</b> (<b>journal)</b> trajectories are two important variables characterising the limits and states of a rotating machinery. The hydrodynamic lubrication in journal-bearing provides damping and reduces friction on rotor systems; therefore the journal amplitude should not exceed the bearing radial clearance. Linear bearing models are not able to accurately predict the journal trajectories for rotor-bearing system operating in conditions where the system does not have period one solutions, or when the journal motion is larger than 20 - 30 % of the bearing radial clearance. Therefore the nonlinear bearing impedance descriptions method was used to model the hydrodynamic reaction forces. Two cases were analysed: 1) a rigid non-symmetric rotor and 2) a flexible non-symmetric rotor. The two models consist of a rotor supported by two identical finite-length hydrodynamic journal bearings of length to diameter ratio L/D= 1, with same lubricant properties. The flexible non-symmetric rotor was modelled by the finite element method (FEM). Simulation results show that the instability threshold of the rigid non-symmetric rotor-bearing system (case 1) depends on the low stability characteristics of the less loaded bearing. But when the shaft flexibility and the gyroscopic coupling effect are taken into account; the instability threshold increases for the flexible non-symmetric rotor-bearing system (case 2). The gyroscopic coupling effect does not only increase the instability threshold, but the journal trajectories magnitude has also significantly increased. This is normally not a preferable condition since high vibrations will induce heat and stress in babbited bearing. Godkänd; 2010; 20100506 (jealun...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an investigation which {{was carried out}} under the Interdisciplinary Higher Degres (IHD) Scheme of The University of Aston in Birmingham. The investigation, which involved joint collaboration between the IHD scheme, the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and G. E. C. Turbine Generators Limited, was concerned with hydrostatic bearing characteristics and of how hydrostatic bearings {{could be used to}} enable turbine generator rotor support impedances to be controlled to give an improved rotor dynamic response. Turbine generator rotor critical speeds are determined not only by the mass and flexibility of the rotor itself, which are relatively easily predicted, but also by the dynamic characteristics of the bearing oil film, pedestal, and foundations. It is because of the difficulty in accurately predicting the rotor support characteristics that the designer has a problem in ensuring that a rotor's normal running speed is not close to one of its critical speeds. The consequence of this situation is that some rotors do have critical speeds close to their normal running speed and the resulting high levels of vibration cause noise, high rotor stresses, and a shortening of bearing life. A combined theoretical and experimental investigation of the effects of mounting the normal <b>rotor</b> <b>journal</b> bearing in a hydrostatic bearing was carried out. The purpose of the work was to show that by changing the oil flow resistance offered by capillaries connecting accumulators to the hydrostatic bearing, the overall rotor support characteristics could be tuned to enable rotor critical speeds to be moved at will. Testing of a combined journal and hydrostatic bearing has confirmed the theory of its operation and a theoretical study of a full size machine showed that its critical speed could be moved by over 350 rpm and that its rotor vibration at running speed could be reduced by 80 %...|$|E
40|$|Rotors of all {{rotating}} {{machines are}} always slightly imbalanced. When they rotate, the imbalance induces their lateral vibration and {{forces that are}} transmitted via the bearings into the foundations. These phenomena are significant if the rotor accelerates or decelerates and especially if it passes over the critical speeds. The vibration can be reduced if the rotor supports are equipped with damping elements. To achieve optimum performance of the damper, the damping effect must be controllable. At present time, semiactive magnetorheological squeeze film dampers are a subject of intensive research. They work on a principle of squeezing a thin film of magnetorheological liquid. If magnetic field is applied, the magnetorheological liquid starts to flow only if the shear stress between two neighbourhood layers exceeds a limit value which depends on intensity of the magnetic field. Its change enables to control the damping force. In the mathematical models, the magnetorheological liquid is usually considered as Bingham one. Application of the computer modelling method for analysis of rotors supported by rolling element bearings and magnetorheological squeeze film dampers and turning at variable angular speed requires {{to set up the}} equations of motion of the rotor and to develop a procedure for calculation of the damping force. Derivation of the equations of motion starts from the first and second impulse theorems. The pressure distribution in the thin lubricating film can be described by a Reynolds equation modified for the case of Bingham liquid. In cavitated areas, it is assumed that pressure of the medium remains constant. The hydraulic force acting on the <b>rotor</b> <b>journal</b> is then obtained by integration of the pressure distribution around the circumference and {{along the length of the}} damper. Applicability of the developed procedures was tested by means of computer simulations and influence of the control of the damping force on vibration of the rotor was analyzed...|$|E

40|$|LectureLecture 4 : The {{gas flow}} {{entering}} {{from the inlet}} flange of a centrifugal compressor may induce radial forces on the rotor, by directly impinging onto shaft or by generating asymmetric pressure fluctuations in the gas volume surrounding the shaft. This aerodynamic excitation represents a potential source of radial vibrations for the rotor; it {{is characterized by a}} broad-band, low frequency spectrum and its effects are typically observed to increase when the operating point moves towards the top right part of the operating envelope, i. e. at high operating speed and high inlet flowrate. The severity of the vibrations caused by this airborne excitation depends on the thermodynamic parameters of the inlet gas (flowrate, velocity, density) and on the mechanical design of the compressor (geometry of the suction volume, stiffness of <b>rotor</b> and <b>journal</b> bearings). While the former are generally constrained by process requirements, the latter can be optimized in order to minimize the induced vibrations. Moreover, a very effective way to mitigate this phenomenon is the adoption of Inlet Guide Vanes at compressor suction that can protect the shaft from exciting forces; on the other hand the installation of IGVs increases the cost and the mechanical complexity of the design, and may also have a non-negligible impact on performances, causing a pressure loss. For this reason it is useful to define a screening criterion to decide whether to install IGVs, based on the predicted sensitivity of the rotor to inlet gas flow excitation. Such criterion was developed basing on physical considerations and then validated through application to a set of recorded references from compressors tested in full load. The outcome allowed to build a diagram based on compressor geometry and operating data, where a boundary line separates the safe area (no significant vibration expected) from the area where the application of IGVs is suggested...|$|R

Coupled analysis of the <b>rotor</b> and the <b>journal</b> bearing is essential in the case that the rotor is flexible.

In this study, we construct three bearing models of increasing modeling comprehensiveness and use these to predict the response of two different rotor-bearing systems. The main goal is to evaluate the correlation with measurement data as a function of modeling comprehensiveness: 1 D versus 2 D pressure prediction, distributed versus lumped thermal model, Newtonian versus non-Newtonian fluid description and non-mass-conservative versus mass-conservative cavitation description. We conclude that all three models predict the existence of critical speeds and whirl for both rotor-bearing systems. However, the two more comprehensive models in general show better correlation with measurement data in terms of frequency and amplitude. Furthermore, we conclude that a thermal network model comprising temperature predictions of the bearing surroundings is essential to obtain accurate predictions. The results of this study aid in developing accurate and computationally-efficient models of flexible rotors supported by plain journal bearings. Mechatronic Systems Desig...|$|R
40|$|For {{high-speed}} applications, gas lubricated bearings offer {{very specific}} advantages over other, more conventional bearing technologies: {{a clean and}} oil-free solution, virtually wear-free operation, low frictional losses, wide operating temperature range, etc. However, the principal drawback involved {{in the application of}} high-speed gas bearings concerns the dynamic stability problem. Successful application therefore requires control of the rotor-bearing dynamics so as to avoid instabilities. After a detailed study of the dynamic stability problem and the formulation of a convenient stability criterium, a brief overview is given of the currently existing bearing types and configurations for improving the stability. In addition, three strategies are introduced: (i) optimal design of plain aerostatic bearings; (ii) modification of the bearing geometry to counteract the destabilising effects in the gas film; and (iii) introduction of damping external to the gas film as to compensate for the destabilising effects. These strategies are worked out into detail leading to the formulation of a series of design rules. Their effectiveness is validated experimentally at a miniature scale. In recent experiments a rotational speed of 1. 2 million rpm has been achieved with a 6 mm <b>rotor</b> on aerodynamic <b>journal</b> bearings, leading to a record DN-number of 7. 2 million. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} necessary to compute the transient response of multi-mass flexible rotors are formulated to include unbalance, rotor acceleration, and flexible damped nonlinear bearing stations. A method of calculating the unbalance response of flexible rotors from a modified Myklestad-Prohl technique is discussed {{in connection with the}} method of solution for the transient response. Several special cases of simplified rotor-bearing systems are presented and analyzed for steady-state response, stability, and transient behavior. These simplified rotor models produce extensive design information necessary to insure stable performance to elastic mounted rotor-bearing systems under varying levels and forms of excitation. The nonlinear journal bearing force expressions derived from the short bearing approximation are utilized {{in the study of the}} stability and transient response of the floating bush squeeze damper support system. Both rigid and flexible rotor models are studied, and results indicate that the stability of flexible <b>rotors</b> supported by <b>journal</b> bearings can be greatly improved by the use of squeeze damper supports. Results from linearized stability studies of flexible rotors indicate that a tuned support system can greatly improve the performance of the units from the standpoint of unbalanced response and impact loading. Extensive stability and design charts may be readily produced for given rotor specifications by the computer codes presented in this analysis...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stability and bifurcation of a rigid <b>rotor</b> support by <b>journal</b> and thrust active magnetic bearing (TAMB). The system is modelled as a five-axis controlled active magnetic bearing-rotor system (AMBRS), and the system equations are formulated by combining the equations of motion of the rotor and the equations of the decentralized proportional-integral-derivative controllers. For this AMBRS, the magnetic forces of the journal and TAMB are strongly non-linear with respect to control current and shaft displacement. This study focuses on the influence of non-linearities on the stability and bifurcation of T periodic motion of the AMBRS subjected to the influence of TAMB and mass eccentricity. In the stability analysis, only periodic motion is investigated. The periodic motions and their stability margin are obtained by shooting method and path-following technique. The local stability and bifurcation behaviours of periodic motions are obtained by the Floquet theory. The results indicate that TAMB and mass eccentricity have great influence on non-linear stability and bifurcation of the T periodic motion of the system and cause the spill-over of system non-linear dynamics and degradation of stability and bifurcation of T periodic motion. Therefore, sufficient attention should be paid to these factors in the analysis and design of rigid rotor systems equipped with TAMBs in order to ensure system reliability.
