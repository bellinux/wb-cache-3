40|$|Homeostatic {{maintenance}} of epithelia requires the <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of old or dying cells while sustaining a functional barrier. Imbalance between cell production and elimination are hypothesized to underlie many pathological conditions. However, {{our knowledge of}} cell turnover within living tissues remains largely restricted to static images due to the limited ability to study epithelia in their native context. Here we report that clearance of damaged basal stem cells promotes compensatory proliferation of neighboring stem cells to maintain overall population numbers in a bilayered epithelium. Time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy experiments reveal that dying cells are rapidly cleared as nearby basal cells engulf apoptotic debris. Remaining basal cells subsequently divide to replace lost cells, allowing for conservation of tissue integrity and function. Together, our data demonstrate the ability to study and visualize the dynamics of epithelial stem cell turnover during tissue homeostasis with in vivo time-lapse imaging. This approach {{has the ability to}} rapidly reveal novel mechanisms regulating epithelial tissue homeostasis and will further our understanding of how these processes become altered in disease...|$|E

40|$|Current trends {{show that}} as the demand for {{infrastructure}} <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> has increased, Federal, state, and local government funding for infrastructure projects has decreased. It has become clear {{that the government will}} need to examine the potential of and implement other delivery methods in addition to design-bid-build. In order for the government to effectively use project delivery as a variable, the role of government in the capital planning process will need to be redefined. This thesis examines the capital planning process used by public owners, i. e. the government. The identification of ideal project planning and management principles led to a new framework for capital planning, referred to as the Project Configuration Process. The proposed Project Configuration Process is {{based on the premise that}} a public owner can identify a realistic need, identify the objectives for the project, identify the project constraints or drivers, and select the most appropriate delivery strategy that aligns the project objectives with the advantages of the delivery strategy.

Facility care includes janitorial and repair and maintenance activities. Capital improvement processes include plans for determining necessary capital improvements and obtaining adequate, reliable funding for capital <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> projects. MERC owns public assembly facilities with a book value of over $ 200 million. It manages the Oregon Convention Center, the Portland Center for the Performing Arts and the Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center. The cost of maintaining and safeguarding these facilities consumes about 14 % of MERC’s operating revenues each year. The cost of MERC facilities care activities benchmark below that of other facilities across the nation. While low cost is generally a positive, some improvements in facility care practices and capital improvement processes could be made.

The progenitor or stem cell of the keratocyte remains poorly defined. The authors sought to investigate the in vivo movement of corneal stromal and epithelial cells using a chromosome in situ hybridisation (CISH) technique on human tissue. Methods Four explanted sex-mismatched human corneal buttons were studied using the CISH technique to identify corneal epithelial and keratocyte cells containing the Y chromosome. Keratocyte identity and lack of infiltrating inflammatory cells were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The sex mismatch of donor (XX) and host (XY) suggested any identified Y chromosomes cells were of host origin having migrated into the donor tissue. Results Host corneal epithelial cells were identified in all four buttons, and corneal stromal keratocytes were present {{in three of the}} four specimens in the central corneal area. Conclusion Defining the corneal cell movements and the location of the progenitor or stem cells has important clinical implications. This study has successfully used the CISH technique to demonstrate the in vivo centripetal movement of corneal stromal keratocytes and epithelial cells.

However, the mechanism underlying the maintenance of <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> capabilities of endogenous progenitor cells or engrafted stem cells in a pathological environment remains elusive. To investigate the effect of astragaloside IV (ASI) on the proliferation and differentiation of the engrafted neural stem cells (NSCs), we cultured NSCs from the hippocampus of E 14 rat embryos, treated the cells with ASI, and then transplanted the cells into the hippocampus of rat AD models. In vitro experimentation showed that 10 − 5 [*]M ASI induced NSCs to differentiate into β-tubulin III+ and GFAP+ cells. NSCs transplantation into rat AD models resulted in improvements in learning and memory, especially in the ASI-treated groups. ASI treatment resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of β-tubulin III+ cells in the hippocampus. Further investigation showed that ASI inhibited PS 1 expression in vitro and in vivo. The high-dose ASI downregulated the Notch intracellular domain, whereas the low-dose ASI increased Notch- 1 and NICD.

40|$|Summary: Clear audit {{opinions}} {{were issued}} for the 87 public hospitals and their 19 controlled entities {{for the financial}} year ending 30 June 2015. These entities make up the Victorian public hospital sector. The sector generated a net deficit from operations (which excludes capital revenue) of more than 700  million annually {{in each of the}} past five financial years. The sector 2 ̆ 7 s net deficit from operations was 775. 0 million in 2014 – 15 (741. 5 million in 2013 – 14). This has contributed to short-term cash-flow issues at individual public hospitals where they had taken actions such as delaying the payment of creditors or inappropriately using specific purpose funds to pay for operational costs. This indicates that the current funding model is not sufficiently sustainable for those hospitals. Analysis of the sector found that public hospitals face both short- and long-term financial sustainability risks, as they are unable to generate a surplus from operations or build up reserves from operations to replace or renew their fixed assets. The Department of Health & Human Services needs to work more closely with public hospitals to ensure that the funding model will address the root cause of public hospital financial sustainability risks. Financial support to public hospitals needs to allow them to fund operations, thus reducing public hospitals 2 ̆ 7 cash-flow issues and this includes developing a longer-term financially sustainable framework for the <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of assets...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Life cycle cost (LCC) {{considerations}} are of increasing importance to offshore wind farm operators and their insurers to undertake long-term profitable investments {{and to make}} electricity generation more price-competitive. This paper presents a cost breakdown structure (CBS) and develops a whole life cost (WLC) analysis framework for offshore wind farms throughout their life span (∼ 25 years). Methods A combined multivariate regression/neural network approach is developed to identify key cost drivers and evaluate all {{the costs associated with}} five phases of offshore wind projects, namely pre-development and consenting (P&C), production and acquisition (P&A), installation and commissioning (I&C), operation and maintenance (O&M) and decommissioning and disposal (D&D). Several critical factors such as geographical location and meteorological conditions, rated power and capacity factor of wind turbines, reliability of sub-systems and availability and accessibility of transportation means are taken into account in cost calculations. The O&M costs (including the cost of <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement,</b> cost of lost production, cost of skilled maintenance labour and logistics cost) are assessed using the data available in failure databases (e. g. fault logs and O&M reports) and the data supplied by inspection agencies. A net present value (NPV) approach is used to quantify the current value of future cash flows, and then, a bottom-up estimate of the overall cost is obtained. Results and discussion The proposed model is tested on an offshore 500 -MW baseline wind farm project, and the results are compared to experimental ones reported in the literature. Our results indicate that the capital cost of wind turbines and their installation costs account for the largest proportion of WLC, followed by the O&M costs. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to identify those factors having the greatest impact on levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Conclusions The installed capacity of a wind farm, distance from shore and fault detection capability of the condition monitoring system are identified as parameters with significant influence on LCOE. Since the service lifetime of a wind farm is relatively long, a small change in interest rate leads to a large variation in the project’s total cost. The presented models not only assist stakeholders in evaluating the performance of ongoing projects but also help the wind farm developers reduce their costs in the medium–long term...|$|E

40|$|Universal life {{insurance}} {{has been difficult}} to analyze due to its extremely flexible, dynamic design. ^ Methodology. The dissertation attempts to design a framework for evaluating investment and product design strategies for a universal life policy in light of the exogenous stochastic effects which influence the viability of the product. Data for the estimation were obtained from a large midwestern stock life insurer. A Box-Jenkins transfer function model approach is used to identify insurance cash flow models and ridge regression is used to control for multicollinearity. A set of significant exogenous economic input variables are identified for each cash flow component which include: new and renewal premium income, policy loans, cash value surrenders, and partial surrenders. ^ The estimated insurance cash flow models are then combined with assumptions about investment policy to form an 2 ̆ 2 integrated 2 ̆ 2 experience model. This combination allows for the use of a so-called scenario testing approach, through which the potential impact on policy experience of various exogenous economic and internal investment 2 ̆ 2 scenarios 2 ̆ 2 can be assessed. A detailed discussion of various asset/liability management approaches is provided and is followed by specific illustrations of how these approaches {{can be applied to the}} integrated experience model. ^ Results. Several interesting results are found with respect to insurance cash flows. First, the number of new policies and the premium on these increase with increases in the yield spread and decreases in the rate of unemployment. This suggests a sensitivity of universal {{life insurance}} premium flows to economic changes. <b>Renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> premiums also increase with decreases in the rate of unemployment. Second, the direct recognition strategy used in the policy appears to lessen the disintermediation risk associated with policy loan activity. Some evidence suggests that policyholders may opt to 2 ̆ 2 disintermediate 2 ̆ 2 through the reduction of premium payments rather than through the exercise of policy loan and surrender options. ^ Conclusions. The dissertation provides some insight into premium and policy persistency under varying economic environments. Investigation of various credited rate strategies, also, suggests that this component is important in determining policy performance. Finally, the desirability of a particular investment strategy is found to vary across the different economic scenarios. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of sustainable financial management {{of water and}} wastewater pipeline infrastructure has grown in recent years due to the increasing backlog of maintenance, <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of aging water and wastewater infrastructure. As the water and wastewater infrastructure age, {{the condition of the}} water and wastewater infrastructure will continue to deteriorate increasing the cost for <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement.</b> In response to the aging and deteriorating potable water and wastewater infrastructure Public Sector Accounting Board PS 3150 and Regulation 453 / 07 under the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Act were established. PS 3150 requires local governments to report their tangible capital assets along with their depreciation on financial statements. One key component of this reporting is determining the need for and cost of the replacement of these assets. Ontario Regulation 453 / 07 requires public utilities to prepare and submit long term financial plans for water systems. One key principle of the financial plans is that the expenses of operating water systems should be paid by revenues generated from providing the water systems. A crucial aspect of PS 3150, Ontario regulation 453 / 07 and the financial management of water and wastewater infrastructure are accurate estimates of future capital works construction prices. Historically, construction indices are used to forecast construction prices. Engineering New Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (CCI), Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) composite National Highway Construction Cost Index (NHCCI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) have been used to estimate future construction prices of water and wastewater infrastructure in Canada. However, these indices do not accurately represent the circumstance of the water and wastewater infrastructure construction sector, which can lead to errors and inaccuracies in construction price forecasts. It is recommended sector specific construction indices be used to forecast construction prices. However, there are few construction indices available for the water and wastewater infrastructure sector and available indices are not based on actual construction data. This thesis presents a methodology to accurately estimate future construction prices for water and wastewater pipeline capital works based on actual construction price data. The methodology contains three components: construction data processing, development of unit price indices for watermain and sanitary sewer construction, and estimation of inflation in watermain and sanitary sewer construction. The data processing component cleans and transforms actual construction price data from the City of Niagara Falls from 1981 to 2014 into a centralized, organized and auditable construction price dataset. Based on the construction price dataset, unit price indices specific to the watermain and sanitary sewer construction sector were developed. Unit price indices were developed and calculated for watermain projects, pipes, valves, and hydrants, and sanitary sewer projects, pipes, and maintenance holes. Geometric Brownian Motion was used to estimate inflation in and forecast future construction prices for watermain and sanitary sewer capital works construction based on the developed unit price indices. A Microsoft Access relational database containing the data processing function, calculation of watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices, and estimation of inflation was developed to improve the accuracy, efficiency and consistency of the methodology. Additionally, the methodology allows contractor markup in watermain and sanitary sewer construction and factors influencing watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices to be examined. The inflation of watermain reference project construction is 5. 79 % per annum from 1982 - 2014, while the inflation of sanitary sewer reference project capital works construction is 4. 66 % per annum from 1981 - 2014. The inflation rates of watermain pipe, valve and hydrant construction from 1982 - 2014 are 6. 36 %, 5. 09 %, and 2. 81 % per annum, respectively. The inflation rates of sanitary sewer pipe and maintenance hole construction from 1981 - 2014 are 7. 41 % and 5. 25 % per annum, respectively. Inflation of watermain and sanitary sewer reference projects is above inflation of CPI, NRBCPI and LDCCT at 2. 25 %, 3. 17 % and 3. 77 % per annum, respectively, but below inflation of S&P/TSX composite index at 6. 90 % per annum. This indicates when forecasting future prices within a construction sector, the use of a proxy index will result in inaccurate estimates of future construction prices. In the water and wastewater pipeline construction sector the use of CPI, NRBCPI or LDCCT will result in significant underestimation of future construction prices. To obtain accurate estimates of future construction prices it is important to use sector specific indices which the developed unit price indices represent for the water and wastewater pipeline construction sector. In this thesis contractor markup is defined as a financial premium in excess of market inflation {{in the form of a}} per annum interest rate surcharge. Contractor markup includes risk premiums, overhead and profit. The contractor markups for watermain and sanitary sewer projects are 3. 54 % and 2. 41 %, respectively. As the number of tender bids submitted for a project increase, the unit price of reference projects generally decreases. This is caused by an increase in the competition among contractors resulting in a decrease in the unit prices of the reference projects as bidders attempt to win the project. The Infrastructure Stimulus Fund increased the total number of projects and the total value of projects in 2009 and 2010 but did not significantly alter the watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices...|$|E
