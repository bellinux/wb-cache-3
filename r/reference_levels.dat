50|$|The {{requirements}} {{and characteristics of}} <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> are under {{the purview of the}} UNFCCC. Given the wide variety in ecological conditions and country-specific circumstances, these requirements are rather global and every country will have a range of options in its definition of <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> within its territory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reference</b> <b>levels</b> have to {{eventually}} have national coverage, {{but they may}} be composed from a number of sub-national <b>reference</b> <b>levels.</b> As an example, forest degradation may have a reference emission level for commercial selective logging and one for extraction of minor timber and firewood for subsistence use by rural communities. Effectively, every identified driver of deforestation or forest degradation has to be represented in one or more reference emission level(s). Similarly for <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> for enhancement of carbon stocks, there may be a reference level for plantation timber species and one for natural regeneration, possibly stratified by ecological region or forest type.|$|E

50|$|WHO {{presented}} in 2009 a recommended <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> (the national <b>reference</b> <b>level),</b> 100 Bq/m3, for radon in dwellings. The recommendation {{also says that}} where this is not possible, 300 Bq/m3 should be selected as the highest <b>level.</b> A national <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> {{should not be a}} limit, but should represent the maximum acceptable annual average radon concentration in a dwelling.|$|R

Node D propagates the <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b> Node E now [...] "reflects" [...] the <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b> The <b>reference</b> heights of the neighbours are equal with the reflection bit not set. E sets the reflection bit to indicate the reflection and sets its offset to 0. Node C just propagates the new <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b> Node A now propagates the <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, {{unlike a}} true {{verification}} the technical assessment cannot [...] "approve" [...] or [...] "reject" [...] the <b>reference</b> <b>level,</b> or the reported results measured against this <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b> It does provide clarity on potential areas for improvement.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for generating}} a single pulse {{the first time}} only that a noisy cyclic signal exceeds a <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> during a half-cycle is disclosed. For the positive half of a cycle of the noisy cyclic signal, a comparator and a multivibrator produce a fixed voltage output when the noisy cyclic signal first exceeds the <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b> A multivibrator stops {{the production of the}} fixed voltage output when the noisy cyclic signal next passes the zero voltage level in the negative direction. Consequently, a single pulse is generated indicating that the signal exceeded the <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> during that half-cycle. The comparator and multi-vibrator produce pulses whenever the noisy cyclic signal exceeds the <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> during the negative half-cycle...|$|R

40|$|I {{develop a}} model of daily labor supply where {{preferences}} are dependent on a <b>reference</b> daily income <b>level,</b> and I apply this model to data on the labor supply of New York City taxi drivers. I find {{that there may be}} a <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> of income on a given day that affects labor supply. However, there is substantial day-to-day variation in a given driver's <b>reference</b> <b>level,</b> and most shifts end before reaching the <b>reference</b> income <b>level.</b> This pattern is inconsistent with an important role for reference-dependent preferences. ...|$|R
30|$|Only one of {{the three}} {{laboratories}} reported red-cell folate results that were consistent with the evidence for folate deficiency, as defined by the <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> of Bates and Lewis (2012).

50|$|The {{core of the}} EQF {{concerns}} eight <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> {{describing what}} a learner knows, understands {{and is able to}} do - 'learning outcomes'. Levels of national qualifications will be placed at one of the central <b>reference</b> <b>levels,</b> ranging from basic (Level 1) to advanced (Level 8). This will enable a much easier comparison between national qualifications and should also mean that people do not have to repeat their learning if they move to another country.|$|E

30|$|Unless more {{evidence}} becomes available, {{it would be}} recommended to use the MAL at iliac crest as zero <b>reference</b> <b>level,</b> as stated previously [3 – 6, 13, 20, 21], because it offers a better anatomical reference.

50|$|The Brussels {{deliberations}} {{concluded that}} the mobility of people (both learners and workers, including migrant workers) and jobs (including outsourcing and offshoring) constitutes an important driver for the world <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> emanating from the Shanghai Consensus Recommendation. It was noted that jobs are not always matched to demands during these movements, because of demographic shifts and the differential capacities of economies to create jobs. The cross-border provision of education and training, {{as well as the}} technological developments resulting in increased open and distance learning, and online learning, were also identified as important drivers towards world <b>reference</b> <b>levels.</b> Another important driver identified in the Brussels deliberations was the need for international dialogue, cooperation and capacity-building in the field of the recognition of qualifications.|$|E
40|$|For {{the motion}} {{compensation}} in airborne SAR processing the imaged terrain is generally {{assumed to be}} flat at some <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b> For SAR interferometry this introduces differential phase errors leading to distortions of the estimated heights above the assumed <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b> This contribution presents a correction approach which avoids a reprocessing of the interferometric SAR image pair...|$|R

40|$|To {{estimate}} the earth’s radiation budget {{at the top}} of the atmosphere (TOA) from satellite-measured radiances, it is necessary to account for the finite geometry of the earth and recognize that the earth is a solid body surrounded by a translucent atmosphere of finite thickness that attenuates solar radiation differently at different heights. As a result, in order to account for all of the reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation from the planet by direct integration of satellite-measured radiances, the measurement viewing geometry must be defined at a <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> well above the earth’s surface (e. g., 100 km). This ensures that all radiation contributions, including radiation escaping the planet along slant paths above the earth’s tangent point, are accounted for. By using a field-of-view (FOV) <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> that is too low (such as the surface <b>reference</b> <b>level),</b> TOA fluxes for most scene types are systematically underestimated by 1 – 2 W m � 2. In addition, since TOA flux represents a flow of radiant energy per unit area, and varies with distance from the earth according to the inverse-square law, a <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> is also needed to define satellite-based TOA fluxes. From theoretical radiative transfer calculations using a model that accounts for spherical geometry, the optimal <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> for defining TOA fluxes in radiation budget studies for the earth is estimated to be approximately 20 km. At this <b>reference</b> <b>level,</b> there is no need to explicitly account for horizontal transmission of solar radiation through the atmosphere i...|$|R
