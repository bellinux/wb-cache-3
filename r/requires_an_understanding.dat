30|$|To assess students’ {{understanding}} of how elevation is encoded on a topographic map, and how the three-dimensional shape of a terrain is depicted on the map, we employed two types of topographic map test items: those that emphasize {{understanding of}} how elevation is denoted using contour lines (i.e., elevation items), and those that emphasize comprehending the three-dimensional shape of the represented terrain (i.e., shape items). Previous work suggested a dissociation between items that <b>required</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of elevation information and items that <b>required</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of shape information; participants who used the word “elevation” in their written descriptions of practice maps did better in an assessment of topographic map comprehension (Newcombe et al., 2015).|$|R

25|$|For {{mathematical}} models the Poisson point {{process is}} often defined in Euclidean space, {{but has been}} generalized to more abstract spaces and plays {{a fundamental role in}} the study of random measures, which <b>requires</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of mathematical fields such as probability theory, measure theory and topology.|$|E
25|$|External {{validity}} {{pertains to}} the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This <b>requires</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of which conditions are relevant (or irrelevant) to the generalization. Internal validity is clearly a prerequisite for external validity.|$|E

40|$|Developmental {{pathways}} are {{networks of}} genes that act coordinately {{to establish the}} body plan. Disruptions of genes in one pathway can have effects in related pathways and may result in serious dysmorphogenesis or cancer. Environmental exposures {{can be associated with}} poor pregnancy outcomes, including dysmorphic offspring or children with a variety of diseases. An important goal of environmental science should be reduction of these poor outcomes. This will <b>require</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of the genes affected by specific exposures and the consequence of alterations in these genes or their products, which in turn will <b>require</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of the pathways critical in development. The ligand Sonic hedgehog, the receptors Patched and Smoothened, and the GLI family of transcription factors represent one such pathway. This pathway illustrates several operating principles important in the consideration of developmental consequences of environmental exposures to toxins...|$|R
25|$|TEM {{samples of}} {{biological}} tissues need high atomic number stains to enhance contrast. The stain absorbs the beam electrons or scatters {{part of the}} electron beam which otherwise is projected onto the imaging system. Compounds of heavy metals such as osmium, lead, uranium or gold (in immunogold labelling) may be used prior to TEM observation to selectively deposit electron dense atoms in or on the sample in desired cellular or protein region. This process <b>requires</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of how heavy metals bind to specific biological tissues and cellular structures.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{surrounding}} body image can be examined through, body negativity, and body positivity. Negative body image {{consists of a}} disoriented view of one’s shape; whereby they often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive. Aside from having low self-esteems, suffers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of eating disorders, isolation, and mental illnesses. Positive body image on the other hand, {{is described as a}} clear true perception of one’s figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also <b>requires</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> that an individual’s appearance does not reflect their character or self worth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes <b>requires</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of how and why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. It is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it. The second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics through the modern definition of entropy.|$|E

The focus on diachrony has led to accusations against Derrida of engaging in the etymological fallacy.|$|R

They major in the production of yam, Cocoyam and cassava through consistent agriculture. These agricultural activities have in recent time suffered a setback due to massive out-migration of their youths to the urban centres, thereby resulting in food scarcity and over population in urban environment.|$|E

Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials (e.g. carbon, phosphorus) between different pools (e.g., tree biomass, soil organic material). Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine {{the underlying causes of}} these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure primary production (g C/m^2) in a wetland in relation to decomposition and consumption rates (g C/m^2/y).

[...] It <b>requires</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of God that is informed by the ideas of apophatic theology and of antithesis and paradox. [...] Some of Silesius's writings and beliefs that bordered on pantheism or panentheism caused tensions between Silesius and local Protestant authorities.

As with heart ultrasound (echocardiography) studies, venous ultrasonography <b>requires</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> of hemodynamics in order to give useful examination reports. In chronic venous insufficiency, sonographic examination is of most benefit; in confirming varicose disease, making an assessment of the hemodynamics, and charting the progression of the disease and its response to treatment. It has become the reference standard for examining the condition and hemodynamics of the lower limb veins.|$|E
