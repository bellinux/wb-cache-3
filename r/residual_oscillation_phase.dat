40|$|Input-shaping is a {{practical}} open-loop strategy for the control of transient and <b>residual</b> <b>oscillations</b> on cranes, especially those having predefined payload transfer paths and repeated maneuvers. In this paper double-step input-shaping control approach is developed to include maneuvers that involve large hoisting distances and speeds. The approach is based on using the graphical representation of the phase plane of the payload <b>oscillations.</b> The <b>phase</b> plane is used to derive mathematical constraints to compute the switching times of a double-step acceleration command profile {{that will result in}} minimal transient and <b>residual</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The controller design is based on a two-dimensional four-bar-mechanism model of a container crane. For the purpose of controller design, the model is reduced to a constrained double pendulum with variable length hoisting cable and a kinematic angular constraint. The generated commands were based on both a linear and a nonlinear frequency approximations of the payload oscillation period. Numerical and experimental results demonstrated that in contrast with the single-step input shaping controllers, which are very sensitive to frequency approximations, the proposed double-step controller is less sensitive to small variations in the frequency even with large commanded accelerations. Using this approach, oscillations during {{and at the end of}} transfer maneuvers can be reduced to less than 5 cm on a full size model of a 65 ton quay-side container crane...|$|R

40|$|In {{the cold}} {{inflation}} scenario, the slow roll inflation and reheating via coherent rapid oscillation, are usually considered as two distinct eras. When the slow roll ends, a rapid <b>oscillation</b> <b>phase</b> begins and the inflaton decays to relativistic particles reheating the Universe. In another model dubbed warm inflation, the rapid <b>oscillation</b> <b>phase</b> is suppressed, {{and we are}} left with only a slow roll period during which the reheating occurs. Instead, in this paper, we propose a new picture for inflation in which the slow roll era is suppressed and only the rapid <b>oscillation</b> <b>phase</b> exists. Radiation generation during this era is taken into account, so we have warm inflation with an oscillatory inflaton. To provide enough e-folds, we employ the non-minimal derivative coupling model.

If the resonant frequencies of such a system are known, it is possible to determine a switching command that delivers comparable actuation without exciting these natural modes of vibration. If there is redundancy in actuation, it can be exploited to suppress vibration with a reduced amount of actuator changes in state. Minimum switching discrete switching vibration suppression (MSDSVS) involves choosing a switching function with integer amplitudes and continuously variable switch timings to force the root of the <b>residual</b> <b>oscillation</b> function with respect to frequency to be at a resonance. By minimizing the one norm of the vector of amplitudes, we obtain several desired properties.

40|$|We {{show how}} the {{neutrino}} mixing angles and <b>oscillation</b> <b>phase</b> can be predicted from tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing, corrected by charged lepton mixing angles which are related to quark mixing angles via quark-lepton unification. The tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing can naturally originate from the see-saw mechanism via constrained sequential dominance (CSD), where CSD can result from the vacuum alignment of a non-abelian family symmetry such as SO(3). We construct a realistic model of quark and lepton masses and mixings based on SO(3) family symmetry with quark-lepton unification based on the Pati-Salam gauge group. The atmospheric angle is predicted to be approximately maximal ? 23 = 45 °, corrected by the quark mixing angle ? 23 CKM 2. 4 °, with the correction controlled by an undetermined phase in the quark sector. The solar angle is predicted by the tri-bimaximal complementarity relation: ? 12 +(1 / 21 / 2) (?C/ 3) cos (?-?) 35. 26 °, where ?C is the Cabibbo angle and ? is the neutrino <b>oscillation</b> <b>phase.</b> The reactor angle is predicted to be ? 13 (1 / 21 / 2) (?C/ 3) 3. 06 °.
