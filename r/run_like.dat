5|$|There {{had been}} hunger strikes by Irish republican prisoners since 1917, and twelve had {{previously}} died on hunger strike, including Thomas Ashe, Terence MacSwiney, Seán McCaughey, Michael Gaughan and Frank Stagg. After {{the introduction of}} internment in 1971, Long Kesh—later known as HM Prison Maze—was <b>run</b> <b>like</b> {{a prisoner of war}} camp. Internees lived in dormitories and disciplined themselves with military-style command structures, drilled with dummy guns made from wood, and held lectures on guerrilla warfare and politics.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the Mahdiyah {{functioned as}} a jihad state, <b>run</b> <b>like</b> a {{military}} camp. Sharia courts enforced Islamic law and the Mahdi's precepts, which had the force of law. After consolidating his power, the Khalifa instituted an administration and appointed Ansar (who were usually Baqqara) as amirs over each of the several provinces. The Khalifa also ruled over rich Al Jazirah. Although he failed to restore this region's commercial wellbeing, the Khalifa organized workshops to manufacture ammunition and to maintain river steamboats.|$|E
25|$|Even though Ranjitsinhji was {{no longer}} heir, Vibhaji {{increased}} his financial allowance but passed the responsibility for his education to the Bombay Presidency. With his fees coming from the allowance, Ranjitsinhji continued his education at the Rajkumar College. Although his material position remained unchanged, comments made at the time by {{the principal of the}} college, Chester Macnaghten, suggest that Ranjitsinhji was bitterly disappointed by his disinheritance. The college was organised and <b>run</b> <b>like</b> an English public school and Ranjitsinhji began to excel.|$|E
25|$|Relatively complex {{technical}} diving operations may {{be planned}} and <b>run</b> <b>like</b> an expedition, or professional diving operation, with surface and in-water support personnel providing direct assistance or on stand-by {{to assist the}} expedition divers. Surface support might include surface stand-by divers, boat crew, porters, emergency medical personnel, and gas blenders. In-water support may provide supplementary breathing gas, monitor divers during long decompression stops, and provide communications services between the surface team and the expedition divers. In an emergency, the support team would provide rescue and if necessary search and recovery assistance.|$|E

25|$|At this point, Momentum {{gained a}} new boss when Theodore Shackley {{transferred}} {{in as the}} CIA's Chief of Station in Laos. Shackley is credited with stating that Momentum was <b>run</b> <b>like</b> a country store, {{and it was his}} job {{to turn it into a}} supermarket. An ad hoc U.S. Air Force unit called the Raven Forward Air Controllers was founded to direct the swelling tide of airpower being unleashed in support of the Hmong and other irregulars. Rather than continuing to craft a strategy to defend Laos, the new emphasis in the war became the support of the combat in South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Many {{supporters}} of Hogan and some golf historians feel that his {{victory at the}} Hale America Open in 1942 should be counted as his fifth U.S. Open and 10th major championship, since the tournament {{was to be a}} substitute for the Open after its cancellation by the USGA. The Hale America Open was held in the same time slot and was <b>run</b> <b>like</b> the U.S. Open with more than 1,500 entries, local qualifying at 69 sites and sectional qualifying at most major cities. The top players, who were not off fighting in World War II, participated and the largest purse of the year was awarded.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a failed}} 107-day cigar-makers' strike in 1877, Gompers {{assisted}} President Adolph Strasser in radically restructuring the Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU) in 1879. Henceforth, the union would be <b>run</b> <b>like</b> a business. The international union {{would have the}} authority to take control of local affiliates. Dues would be raised to build financial reserves, and to pay sick and death benefits. A union bank would be established to provide short-term loans for workers who had been laid off and were seeking new jobs. The constitution of the union would be changed to permit the international to seize funds from locals with flush treasuries and transfer the money to locals in distress.|$|E

25|$|The Palais Strousberg, a vast {{town house}} built in Berlin between 1867–1868, {{confined}} the servants to its semi-basement. The only windows facing outwards {{at the front}} of the mansion, were ironically those of servants' bedrooms: all the workrooms either had no windows at all or were lit by a complicated system of light-wells and small internal courtyards. The servants' quarters were designed to <b>run</b> <b>like</b> a well-oiled machine. Everything from the carriage horses to the wine cellar, kitchen and laundry was confined to one compact floor under one roof and, most importantly, out of sight. Small staircases led to convenient points in a complex labyrinth of narrow passages on the piano nobile above, allowing servants to enter reception rooms when required, without being seen in other parts of the house.|$|E
25|$|Tram-trains are railcars or trains which <b>run</b> <b>like</b> trams (streetcars) in city streets, and {{on heavy}} rail tracks {{out to the}} suburbs or between the cities. Usually, this {{requires}} two current systems (German Zweisystemstadtbahn, Stadtbahn with two systems), both the tram voltage (600 or 750 V DC) and the heavy rail high voltage (in Germany, 15 kV AC). The vehicles must also be adapted to the heavy rail’s signalling system. This transit mode combines the tram’s availability with stops in the street, and the heavy rail’s higher speed. They are often faster than most rapid transit (metro) systems. The first system was opened in Karlsruhe in 1992. Their top speed is often 100km/h, in Kassel as much as 114km/h. Most of the tram-trains fit the definition of an interurban; in reality, this transit mode is a rebirth of the interurban.|$|E
25|$|The SM-sarja {{was also}} {{outdated}} on its own, {{as it was}} run according to amateur principles. Clubs {{were not supposed to}} pay their players beyond compensation for lost wages. However, by the 1970s many clubs were already <b>run</b> <b>like</b> businesses and recruited players through a contract of employment, paying their wages secretly and often evading taxes. However, in 1974, accounting reform in Finland extended book-keeping standards to cover sports clubs, and shortfalls were exposed in audit raids. The SM-liiga was to allow wages for players, and clubs were also put under a tighter supervision. They were to establish their own association for SM-liiga ice hockey only, separating their commitments from junior activities and other sports. Copies of all player contracts were to be sent to the SM-liiga to provide players with adequate security, such as insurance and pensions.|$|E

25|$|Air Marshal Les Fisher, {{who headed}} the RAAF from 1994 to 1998, served as the last CAS and the first Chief of Air Force (CAF), the change of name {{occurring}} in 1997. Fisher instituted a policy requiring staff to meet minimum physical fitness standards {{to remain in the}} service, {{for the first time in}} Air Force history. Air Marshal Errol McCormack commanded the RAAF as it moved into the 21st century, addressing fundamental cultural questions such as the balance of change and tradition, and whether defence should be <b>run</b> <b>like</b> a business. Beginning in 2000, he reintroduced the distinctive dark blue uniform that had been chosen by Richard Williams in the 1920s but discarded in 1972 by then-CAS, Air Marshal Hannah, in favour of a more neutral blue suit. McCormack’s successor, Air Marshal Angus Houston, became well-known to the public for contradicting the Federal Government’s version of events in relation to the Children Overboard Affair. In 2005, Houston was promoted to Chief of the Defence Force, the third Air Force member out of 18 Chiefs of the Defence Force or equivalent, and the third to achieve the rank of air chief marshal.|$|E

After the race, Martin who finished fourth, was less optimistic about his championship chances, [...] "We've still got to go to Homestead and <b>run</b> <b>like</b> this again because we've still got that threat behind us, Jeff Gordon, especially." [...] Gordon maintained third with 6,323 points, forty-two ahead of Kurt Busch and one-hundred and sixteen in front of Stewart. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 256 points. Toyota remained second with 198 points. Ford followed with 161 points, six ahead of Dodge in fourth. 5.17 million people watched the race on television. The race took two hours, forty-nine minutes and twenty-six seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 1.033 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Although {{reluctant}} {{to audition for}} the commission, on 15July 1904 Bauer left for Lappland and stayed there for a month. Coming from the dense, dark forests of Småland he was overwhelmed by the open vistas and colorful landscapes. His encounters with the Sami people and their culture became important for his later works. He took many photos, sketched and made notes of the tools, costumes and objects he saw, but he had difficulty becoming close to the Sami, due to their shyness. He recorded his experiences in his diary and in letters {{to his family and}} friends. After a visit to a Sami goahti he noted: [...] "All light from above. If the head is tilted forward it is dark. The lit parts of the figure always lighter than the tent canvas. Sharp shadows <b>run</b> <b>like</b> spokes {{from the middle of the}} goathi." ...|$|E
500|$|Established in 1981 in west London DBC (Dread Broadcasting Corporation) {{also known}} as Rebel Radio FM is {{considered}} the first black owned pirate radio station in Europe. The West London-based DBC (Dread Broadcasting Corporation), founded by DJ Lepke, played reggae on Friday nights in a format based on sound systems style and using heavy dub echo and reverb in the links. DBC also broadcast soul music, gospel, jazz, funk, r, Afrikan (South African black music) and soca (upbeat calypso). DBC was unique among radio stations in the UK at the time, a black-run station broadcasting black music to a mixed audience. Miss P, who would later DJ the first reggae show on BBC Radio 1, commented: [...] "There's never been a station <b>run</b> <b>like</b> DBC. Our format allows us to play music that would otherwise never be heard publicly. We create movement within the industry." ...|$|E
