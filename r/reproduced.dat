40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [11222221]A {{consistently}} coupled isogeometric-meshfree {{method is}} presented. This method {{takes advantage of}} the geometry exactness of isogeometric analysis and the refinement flexibility of meshfree method. The coupling of isogeometric approximation and meshfree approximation is based upon the <b>reproducing</b> or consistency conditions which are crucial for the coupled method to achieve the expected optimal convergence rates. It is shown that unlike the <b>reproducing</b> kernel meshfree shape functions which satisfy the <b>reproducing</b> conditions with the nodal points as the <b>reproducing</b> locations, the monomial <b>reproducing</b> points for different orders of B-spline basis functions in isogeometric analysis are different and consequently a rational method is proposed to compute these <b>reproducing</b> points. Both theoretical proof and computational justification of the <b>reproducing</b> conditions for B-spline basis functions are given. Subsequently within the framework of <b>reproducing</b> conditions, a mixed <b>reproducing</b> point vector is proposed to ensure arbitrary order monomial reproducibility for both B-spline basis functions and <b>reproducing</b> kernel meshfree shape functions, which leads to a consistently coupled approximation with smoothing transition between B-spline basis functions and <b>reproducing</b> kernel meshfree shape functions. Consequently a coupled isogeometric-meshfree method is established with the Galerkin formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed coupled isogeometric-meshfree method is demonstrated through a series of benchmark numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
