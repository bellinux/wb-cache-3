However, there was less confidence in this scenario due {{to the presence of}} dry air west of the cyclone. On November28, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned the storm the local name Reming as it entered their area of responsibility. At 1200UTC that day, the JTWC upgraded Durian to a typhoon, estimating one-minute sustained winds at 120km/h (75mph). It was not until 0300UTC on November29 that the JMA also upgraded the storm. During the course of November29, a westward-moving convectively-coupled Kelvin wave interacted with Durian and provided additional convergence around the typhoon. This precipitated a period of rapid intensification as the cyclone's vorticity abruptly deepened an reached to more than [...] in altitude. At 0530UTC, intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique [...] a method of determining a tropical cyclone's intensity based on satellite appearance [...] yielded a <b>raw</b> <b>value</b> of 7.0, indicating one-minute sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph).

The normalization of a feedback indicator {{can be regarded as}} a simple credit assignment scheme. In fact, normalization is helpful in reducing dependency related to feedback indicators built from <b>raw</b> <b>values</b> [22]. The concept of ranking has also been proposed as a way of eliminating the concern regarding <b>raw</b> <b>values</b> [22].

Patients are encouraged to record their personal best measures.|$|E
50|$|Each drive {{manufacturer}} {{defines a}} set of attributes, and sets threshold values beyond which attributes should not pass under normal operation. Each attribute has a <b>raw</b> <b>value,</b> whose meaning is entirely up to the drive manufacturer (but often corresponds to counts or a physical unit, such as degrees Celsius or seconds), a normalized value, which ranges from 1 to 253 (with 1 representing the worst case and 253 representing the best) and a worst value, which represents the lowest recorded normalized value. The initial default value of attributes is 100 but can vary between manufacturer.|$|E

Normalized values are usually mapped so that higher values are better (exceptions include drive temperature, number of head load/unload cycles), but higher raw attribute values {{may be better}} or worse depending on the attribute and manufacturer. For example, the [...] "Reallocated Sectors Count" [...] attribute's normalized value decreases as the count of reallocated sectors increases. In this case, the attribute's <b>raw</b> <b>value</b> will often indicate the actual count of sectors that were reallocated, although vendors are in no way required to adhere to this convention.|$|E

50|$|UUIDs are {{commonly}} used as a unique key in database tables. The NEWID function in Microsoft SQL Server version 4 Transact-SQL returns standard random version 4 UUIDs, while the NEWSEQUENTIALID function returns 128-bit identifiers similar to UUIDs which are committed to ascend in sequence until the next system reboot. The Oracle Database SYS_GUID function does not return a standard GUID, despite the name. Instead, it returns a 16-byte 128-bit <b>RAW</b> <b>value</b> based on a host identifier and a process or thread identifier, somewhat similar to a GUID.

40|$|Problems {{associated}} with medication {{use and the}} consequent effects on genome-wide association analyses were explored using the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 Problem 3 data. Lipid phenotypes were simulated in the Framingham Heart Study using several measured variables including causal genes (based on a 500 k SNP panel), smoking, dietary intake, and medication usage. We report a sensitivity analysis of how medication use (which artificially alters lipid values) affects association inferences. Associations were performed for LDL-c under seven different correction schemes: 1) ignore medication use entirely (no correction) and adjust for covariates; 2) delete medicated subjects then adjust for covariates; 3) include medication use (Yes/No) as a covariate during covariate adjustments; 4) correct <b>raw</b> <b>values</b> using clinical trials information then adjust for covariates; 5) correct <b>raw</b> <b>values</b> using the actual simulation protocol ("truth") then adjust for covariates; and 6 - 7) over-corrections (add arbitrary values) then adjust for covariates. Results indicate that failure to properly correct for medication usage can profoundly affect the heritability, and hence the association results. The empirical results yielded one genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 22 (RS 2294207), consistent with the simulation protocol. This signal was detected under all schemes that corrected the <b>raw</b> <b>values</b> (clinical trials, simulation protocol, or over corrections), but was not detected under the first three adjustment schemes (ignore medication use, delete medicated individuals, use medication status as covariate). In summary, we confirm that failure to properly account for medication usage can have {{a profound impact on}} genetic associations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 <b>Raw</b> product <b>value</b> of {{vegetables}} for processing in the Northwest {{used to be}} established by a competitive market involving proprietary processors and growers. Due to the relocation of proprietary processors to the Midwest, this competitive market has eroded forcing cooperative processors to seek other means to set <b>raw</b> product <b>values.</b> In {{the absence of a}} competitive market for raw product, cooperatives must rely on an average of last year's prices paid by processors in a given region to <b>value</b> <b>raw</b> product. This method of lagged averages may be resulting in misallocated contracted acreage to grower-members of cooperatives, and inappropriate production levels of the processed good given market conditions. Therefore, the principal objective of this research is to develop and evaluate alternative methods of forecasting <b>raw</b> product <b>value.</b> Since the market for processed vegetables at the retail level is competitive, one alternative method employed was to use a forecast of supply and determinants of demand affecting retail price to forecast <b>raw</b> product <b>value.</b> These explanatory variables were regressed against <b>raw</b> product <b>values</b> of various crops obtained from a northwest processing and marketing cooperative. The <b>raw</b> product <b>values</b> were expressed as net returns/acre to the crops under investigation. The estimated equations, which had adjusted R²'s ranging from. 267 to. 851, were used to forecast <b>raw</b> product <b>value.</b> A second forecasting method investigated in this study was an exponential smoothing model. <b>Raw</b> product <b>value</b> forecasts were generated over two different time horizons, identified by the cooperatives' accounting procedures. The two alternative forecasting methods were compared to each other, and to the method currently in use by the cooperative, with the aim of determining the most accurate forecasting technique. Results showed that both the econometric and smoothing approaches fit the data better over the estimation period than did a naive lagged price estimate resembling the present method in use by the cooperative. The econometric method also fit the data better than did the smoothing approach. The econometric model provided poor forecasts for the longer forecast horizon, but proved to be effective in the shorter. The smoothing technique forecasted more effectively in the longer forecast horizon as compared with the shorter. These results suggest the importance of the forecast horizon in determining the more appropriate forecasting technique. Both forecasting techniques proposed in this study produced forecasts which were more accurate than the cooperative's present method {{at least half of the}} time. This suggests that viable alternatives to the present method of establishing <b>raw</b> product <b>value</b> exist for agricultural cooperatives...|$|R

The <b>raw</b> <b>value</b> of improvement after a nap decreased after this correction (from ~ 15 % to ~ 5 %), but remained significantly higher than the control.

40|$|Interestingness {{measures}} {{provide information}} {{that can be used to}} prune or select association rules. A given value of an interestingness measure is often interpreted relative to the overall range of the values that the interestingness measure can take. However, properties of individual association rules restrict the values an interestingness measure can achieve. An interesting measure can be standardized to take this into account, but this has only been done for one interestingness measure to date, i. e., the lift. Standardization provides greater insight than the <b>raw</b> <b>value</b> and may even alter researchers ’ perception of the data.
