The Maybach HL-120TRM, having been successful during the ongoing Second World War, was selected as the engine for this new project, and was connected to the SSG-77 transmission. The most striking change was the use of a box drive with large wheels, with a hydraulic pivoting device tower. The vehicle was designed to be equipped with 50mm armour all-round, with 60mm thick armor plates on the front part of the body having a 60 degree vertical inclination on the top and 45 degrees vertical inclination at the bottom. Driving wheels of the PzKpfw III were used with the addition of reinforced output shafts, along with 540mm wide symmetrical tracks with a central ridge. The chassis had six semi-detached rollers 660mm in diameter on the leaf springs. The turret used was a modified variant of the PzKpfw IV Ausf.

5000|$|Speaker {{diaphragms}} have mass, {{and their}} surroundings have stiffness. Together, these form a resonant system, and the mechanical cone resonance may be excited by electrical signals (e.g., pulses) at audio frequencies. But a driver {{with a voice}} coil is also a current generator, since it has a coil attached to the cone and suspension, and that coil is immersed in a magnetic field. For every motion the coil makes, it will generate a current that will be seen by any electrically attached equipment, such as an amplifier. In fact, the amp's output circuitry will be the main electrical load on the [...] "voice coil current generator". If that load has low resistance, the current will be larger and the voice coil will be more strongly forced to decelerate. A high damping factor (which requires low output impedance at the amplifier output) very rapidly damps unwanted cone movements induced by the mechanical resonance of the speaker, acting as {{the equivalent of a}} [...] "brake" [...] on the voice coil motion (just as a short circuit across the terminals of a <b>rotary</b> <b>electrical</b> generator will make it very hard to turn). It is generally (though not universally) thought that tighter control of voice coil motion is desirable, as it is believed to contribute to better-quality sound.|$|E

But, in case of renewable energy based microgrids, the inherent involvement of static power electronics based power conversion raises the issues of poor power quality and instability during uncertainties {{due to lack of}} effective control facility and sufficient moment of inertia. So, an attractive way of mitigating the above mentioned key concerns is to make the microgrid's operation similar to <b>rotary</b> <b>electrical</b> machines based power plant by retaining the advantages of using power electronic converter.

For the performance analysis of the proposed VSMIGC, various power quality indices are measured during uncertainties and compared with those of conventional “Voltage-Current Control Strategy (VIC) ” based inverters with respect to standard limits.

The electrical power, supplied by low speed mechanical movement, requires the use of electrical machinery capable of generating high amounts of torque. Among the analyzed topologies, the one selected for further study was the Transverse Flux Permanent Magnet machine (TFPM). This topology differs from the conventional ones, presenting high power and torque densities, and allowing to independently set machine current and magnetic loadings in the machine.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{machining}} characteristics of EN- 8 steel with copper {{as a tool}} electrode during <b>rotary</b> <b>electrical</b> discharge machining process. The empirical models for prediction of output parameters have been developed using linear regression analysis by applying logarithmic data transformation of non-linear equation. Three independent input parameters of the model viz. peak current, pulse on time and rotational speed of tool electrode are chosen as variables for evaluating the output parameters such as metal removal rate (MRR), electrode wear ratio (EWR) and surface roughness (SR). Analysis of the results, by using Taguchi's recommended signal–noise ratio formulae and ANOVA, has been conducted to identify the significant parameters and their degree of contribution in the process output. Analyzed results shows that peak current and pulse on time are the most significant and significant parameters for MRR and EWR, respectively. But peak current and electrode rotation become the most significant and significant parameters for SR, respectively. Experimental results further revealed that maximizing the MRR while minimizing EWR and improving the surface roughness, cannot be achieved simultaneously at a particular combination of control parameters setting. In addition, the predictions based on the above developed models have been verified with another set of experiments and {{are found to be}} in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
