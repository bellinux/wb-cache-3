50|$|In 2006, when high {{roaming charge}} rates persisted the Commission {{proposed}} {{to intervene in}} the market by setting maximum rates at which mobile network operators could charge their subscribers. The proposed regulation was approved by the European Parliament and by the Council of Ministers, and came into law in June 2007. It required capping of retail and wholesale voice roaming charges from 30 August 2007, unless a special <b>roaming</b> <b>tariff</b> applied. The maximum prices was set to decrease further in 2008 and 2009. The regulation also required that customers traveling to another member state would receive a text message of the charges that apply for roaming services. Originally the capping measures were introduced on a temporary basis and were due to expire on 30 June 2010.|$|E

Customers are segregated into groups under the categorization of network providers. There are different types of networks, but we used only four types of networks. These networks are network a, b, c and d. we can calculate the score {{with the help of}} different- different attributes. These attributes are- STD Calls Local Calls, Local SMS, STD SMS, <b>Roaming,</b> <b>Tariff</b> Plan, and Data Plan Second, Revenue maximization profiling-use of clustering for identifying maximal cluster. With the help of clustering profiling is done for maximization of revenue. This all will be done using data mining tools which will provide data statistics. In second problem Revenue maximization profiling was done by using clustering for identifying maximal cluster. Revenue maximization was done invidually for each cluster.

40|$|Since summer 2007, {{mobile phone}} {{users in the}} European Union (EU) are {{protected}} by a ceiling on the <b>roaming</b> <b>tariff</b> when calling or receiving a call abroad. We analyze {{the effects of this}} price regulative policy, and compare it to alternative implementations of price regulations. The problem is a three-level mathematical program: The EU determines the price regulative policy, the telephone operator sets profit-maximizing prices, and customers choose to accept or decline the operator’s offer. The first part of this paper contains a polynomial time algorithm to solve such a three-level program. The crucial idea is to partition the polyhedron of feasible price regulative parameters into a polynomial number of smaller polyhedra such that a certain mprimitive decision problem can be written as an LP on each of those. Then the problem can be solved by a combination of enumeration and linear programming. In the second part, we analyze more specifically an instance of this problem, namely the price regulation problem that the EU encounters. Using customer-data from a large telephone operator, we compare different price regulative policies with respect to their social welfare. On the basis of the specific social welfare function, we observe that other price regulative policies or different ceilings can improve the total social welfare. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} the present {{briefing}} is to analyse some of the fundamental aspects of the legal proposal by the European Commission {{on the subject of}} roaming, COM (2006) 382 on 12 July 2006, which proposed to modify the regulation of mobile communications, resulting in important eductions of <b>roaming</b> <b>tariffs</b> within the Community. The briefing examines the efficiency and concrete applicability of the measures introduced by the Regulation Proposal, which created the “Mechanism of the Domestic European Market” and the envisaged requirements of transparency and information on roaming costs charged by mobile network operators (MNOs). The briefing consists of four sections, analysing the following issues: Transparency, Technical Infrastructure, Overview of Existing Data, and Feasibility of Technical Implementation. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the impacts of European Union's roaming {{regulation}} on company T-Mobile Czech Republic, a. s. For customers, reducing of roaming prices is a welcome step, on the other hand, telecommunication companies have a different opinion and the impacts on companies are doubtful. In the theoretical part I will try to describe the roaming service and introduce the content of roaming legislative regulation, which the company must follow when creating roaming strategy. The practical part will include the real impacts of European Union's roaming regulation on company T-Mobile Czech Republic, a. s., such as usage of roaming services, new <b>roaming</b> <b>tariffs</b> or company's financial indicators. At the conclusion I will try to predicate possible future roaming development because lately talking about the abolition of roaming fees, which could mean {{the completion of the}} single European market in telecommunications...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} stages of network build-out, the company relied {{significantly}} on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could [...] "roam" [...] across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which were very similar in nature to cross-carrier <b>roaming</b> <b>tariffs.</b> In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{a general}} trend of lower charges for mobile calls, in Europe prices for {{international}} roaming calls have remained at levels surprisingly high. The apparent reluctance of mobile network operators to lower <b>roaming</b> <b>tariffs</b> is generating many antitrust concerns. This paper presents in a two country - two ﬁrm framework, {{the functioning of}} the current system governing wholesale international roaming agreements based on Inter Operator Tariffs (IOTs). The focus is on the role of traffic management: thanks to the emergence of traffic direction techniques, MNOs are allowed to select the roaming partner. We show that unless these techniques do not allow for perfect control on traffic ﬂows, traffic management does not improve markets efficiency. In line with the regulatory mechanism recently adopted by the European Commission, we show that a simple price cap mechanism may restore partial efficiency in the wholesale market. We also show that although cross border cooperation at the wholesale level is Pareto efficient it will not emerge as an equilibrium of a two-sided matching game...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{a general}} trend of lower charges for mobile calls, prices for {{international}} roaming calls have remained at levels surprisingly high. The apparent reluctance of European mobile network operators to lower <b>roaming</b> <b>tariffs</b> is generating many antitrust concerns. This paper discusses in a two country - two firm framework, the distortions {{associated with the}} functioning of the current system governing wholesale international roaming agreements based on Inter Operator Tariffs (IOTs) and the role played by cross border roaming alliances between foreign operators. We describe how competition between roaming operators at the wholesale level is influenced by the adoption of traffic redirection techniques. The paper shows that when mobile operators act un-cooperatively and traffic redirection techniques allow only partial control on traffic flows, competition between roaming operators may not guarantee a reduction in IOTs and, consequently, on retail tariffs. We propose a simple and effective regulatory price cap mechanism to restore efficiency in the wholesale market. When mobile operators cooperate within a cross border alliance, internal IOTs are set at cost and retail prices are lower. ...|$|R
40|$|The Southern African Development Community (SADC) {{experiences}} {{high levels}} of cross border human traffic due to trade, cultural and language links across the fifteen countries. Technological advances and increased domestic competition have contributed to lower domestic retail tariffs for mobile cellular services. Unfortunately, this has not extended to international mobile <b>roaming</b> (IMR) retail <b>tariffs</b> which remain unacceptably high. These high tariffs have attracted harsh criticism from commentators and prompted calls for regulatory intervention. This study investigates the level of international mobile <b>roaming</b> (IMR) retail <b>tariffs,</b> usage and demand elasticity. It further considers whether competition or regulation play {{a greater role in}} reducing these tariffs and whether regulatory intervention is likely to reduce competition. The research took the form of a quantitative study and used an online survey questionnaire as the data collection tool. The results of the study confirmed that international mobile <b>roaming</b> (IMR) retail <b>tariffs</b> are indeed high, resulting in poor uptake by cost conscious travellers who pay for their own cellular usage. The finding that competition plays a greater role than regulation in reducing IMR retail tariffs is not significant. It was concluded that neither competition nor regulation are sufficient on their own to provide increased social welfare. The best result is obtained when competition is allowed to flourish, underpinned by an enabling regulatory framework. CopyrightDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
