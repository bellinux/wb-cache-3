Inoculated culture tubes were incubated with rolling at 96 rpm. Immunoperoxidase (IP) staining and cytopathic effects (CPE) were used to detect positive cultures. At 24 h, 42 (53 %) of the rolled cultures were positive for CPE, while only 16 (21 %) of the shell vials were CPE positive (P less than 0. 01). No difference in sensitivity was seen between rolled and shell vial cultures that were inoculated with high-titered viral preparations and IP stained at 16 h.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a generalization of our previously published simple <b>roller</b> <b>method</b> for seamless enlargement of colour textures such as natural bidirectional texture functions (BTF) that realistically represent appearance of given material surfaces. The generalized roller allows automatic detection of major texture periodicity directions {{which do not}} need to be aligned with coordinate axes. The roller texture synthesis method is based on the overlapping tiling and subsequent minimum error boundary cut. One or several optimal double toroidal BTF patches are seamlessly repeated during the synthesis step. While the method allows only moderate texture compression it is extremely fast due to complete separation of the analytical step of the algorithm from the texture synthesis part. The method is universal and easily implementable in a graphical hardware for purpose of real-time rendering of any type of static or dynamic textures...|$|E

In the New South Wales fruit fly control program, caneite {{has been used as}} a carrier for the lure and pesticide in MAT blocks for many years. In this paper, MAT blocks containing cuelure as an attractant and malathion as a toxicant were manufactured using two methods, namely bag immersion and roller painting, as part of the control program for Queensland fruit fly in New South Wales between September 1998 and June 2000. These blocks were sampled from storage and the field, along with historical blocks in the field deployed before the current study period. Chemical analyses of these three block types were conducted for malathion, cuelure, and raspberry ketone (a breakdown product of cuelure). There was significantly more cuelure and malathion in blocks made by the bag method than the <b>roller</b> <b>method</b> and in historical blocks. The bag method resulted in chemical concentrations closer to the desired standards. There were no significant differences between the three methods in block weight or in level of raspberry ketone.

In this study, four different tillage systems were compared {{in terms of their}} effects on some physical properties of soil (bulk density, penetrometer resistance and porosity), fuel consumptions, labor and time efficiency and crop yield.

The samples, obtained with spinning <b>roller</b> <b>method</b> as a ribbons 3 mm in width and 20 μm thick, were investigated as-quenched and after {{each step of}} a multi steps heating treatment procedure. Each sample was annealed at four steps, fifteen minutes at every temperature, starting from 573 K+ 600 K up to + 700 K depending on type of alloy. Mössbauer spectroscopy data and transmission electron microscope (HRE M) pictures confirmed that the as-quenched samples are fully amorphous. This is not changed after the first stages of treatment heating leads to a reduction of free volumes. The heating treatment has a great influence on the magnetic susceptibilities. The treatment up to 600 K improves soft magnetic properties: an χ increase was observed, from about 400 to almost 1000 for the samples of alloys without Pt, and from about 200 to 450 at maximum, for the Fe 81 Pt 5 Zr 7 Nb 1 Cu 1 B 5. Further heating, at more elevated temperatures, leads to magnetic hardening of the samples. Curie temperatures, established from the location of Hopkinson’s maxima on the χ(T) curve are in very good agreement with those obtained from the data of specific magnetization, σ(T), measured {{in a field of}} 0. 75 T.
