5|$|Buckler {{suggests}} the following: According to the Athenian politician Demosthenes, Kersebleptes met Philip at Maroneia (in Thrace), {{together with the}} Theban general Pammenes, and came to an agreement with Philip; furthermore, he states that Amadokos was hostile to Philip at the time. Demosthenes says that the Athenian general Chares filed the <b>report</b> <b>about</b> the meeting between Philip, Pammenes and Kersebleptes; and Polyaenus says that after Philip's Maroneia campaign, Chares ambushed Philip's fleet {{off the coast of}} Neapolis. Since it is recorded that Neapolis appealed to Athens for aid against Philip in 355 BC, it is a strong possibility that these events all took place in 355 BC. It is not entirely clear what occasioned this meeting between Philip and Kersebleptes; Buckler suggests that Philip and Kersebleptes agreed to divide Thrace between them, leaving Kersebleptes free to attack the other Thracian kings (to try to reunite the Thracian kingdom), and leaving Philip free to campaign elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Garran {{worked with}} Professor Harrison Moore of the University of Melbourne and South Australian judge Professor Jethro Brown on a <b>report</b> <b>about</b> {{proposed}} constitutional amendments which ultimately became the referendum questions put {{forward in the}} 1919 referendum.

Garran attended two Imperial Conferences, accompanying Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in 1923 and in 1930 joining Prime Minister James Scullin and Attorney-General Frank Brennan, chair of the Drafting Committee which prepared drafts of agreements on various topics, such as merchant shipping. He also attended the eleventh League of Nations conference that year with them in Geneva, Switzerland. At the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1927, Garran was invited to give evidence by Prime Minister Bruce, where he discussed the history and origins of the Constitution {{and the evolution of}} the institutions established under it.|$|E
5|$|For 10days, Myanmar's {{government}} did not <b>report</b> <b>about</b> the cyclone, which usually under-reports on storms that affect the country. There was also little to no advanced warning of the storm. The storm destroyed over 2,650homes and severely damaged another 1,385, leaving around 25,000people homeless, mostly in Pauktaw. Four hospitals in the region were heavily damaged, including the one in Sittwe that was unable to continue normal operations. About 300schools were damaged or destroyed, including 44 in Sittwe. The storm also damaged or destroyed 133religious buildings and 176government buildings. Across the region, high winds knocked down telephone lines and disrupted power supply. About 2,000cattle were killed, and many rice mills were knocked down, causing a 70% increase of food prices. Transportation was disrupted after roads were washed away, which contributed to food shortages, while damaged wells caused water shortages. During the storm, 84ships were lost at sea, {{in addition to a}} lost ocean liner, while the main harbor at Sittwe was damaged, along with several fishing piers.|$|E

5000|$|The Adequate Information Management in Europe (AIM) Project, a {{multinational}} European social science project conducting several studies on journalism structures and processes of daily <b>reporting</b> <b>about</b> the European Union between 2004 and 2007, found that impulses for European professional journalism are {{not found in}} an explicit interest in European topics or special knowledge concerning European matters, as assumed. Rather, they are determined by [...] "day to day operations and subsequent media performance"13, structural on-site factors, or [...] "on-the-job and trial-and-error" [...] practices. Furthermore, <b>reporting</b> <b>about</b> Europe is determined by national views and national and individual journalistic practices and thus lacking coherence and proper context. The AIM study concludes that these daily deficiencies, neglects and misapprehensions lead to myopic <b>reporting</b> <b>about</b> European matters.
