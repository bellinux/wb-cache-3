30|$|It can be {{seen from}} the Fig.  4 that the total cost is {{decreased}} with the increasing of wind speed V, which is from 11471 $/hr at wind speed V =  0 to 9061.6 $/hr at <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> V <b>r.</b> That demonstrates the wind farm integration plays a positive role in reducing the total cost. Compared to the total cost, the valve-point cost is increased with the increasing of wind speed and decreased afterwards, which also indicates the introduction of wind farm will not always decrease the valve-point cost. Because, according to (1), the valve-point cost is determined by its function property.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Algorithmic {{self-assembly}} using DNA-based molecular tiles {{has been}} demonstrated to implement molecular computation. When several different types of DNA tile selfassemble, they can form large two-dimensional algorithmic patterns. Prior analysis predicted that the error rates of tile assembly can be reduced by optimizing physical parameters such as tile concentrations and temperature. However, in exchange, the growth speed is also very low. To improve the tradeoff between error <b>rate</b> and growth <b>speed,</b> we propose two novel error suppression mechanisms: the Protected Tile Mechanism (PTM) and the Layered Tile Mechanism (LTM). These utilize DNA protecting molecules to form kinetic barriers against spurious assembly. In order to analyze the performance of these two mechanisms, we introduce the hybridization state Tile Assembly Model (hsTAM), which evaluates intra-tile state changes as well as assembly state changes. Simulations using hsTAM suggest that the PTM and LTM improve the optimal tradeoff between error <b>rate</b> and growth <b>speed</b> <b>r,</b> from r b 2 : 0 (for the conventional mechanism) to r b 1 : 4 and r b 0 : 7, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Asthmatics exhibit reduced airway {{dilation}} at maximal inspiration, {{likely due to}} structural {{differences in}} airway walls and/or functional differences in airway smooth muscle, factors that may also increase airway responsiveness to bronchoconstricting stimuli. The goal {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that the minimal airway resistance achievable during a maximal inspiration (<b>R</b> <b>min)</b> is abnormally elevated in subjects with airway hyperresponsiveness. Methods The <b>R</b> <b>min</b> was measured in 34 nonasthmatic and 35 asthmatic subjects using forced oscillations at 8 Hz. <b>R</b> <b>min</b> and spirometric indices were measured before and after bronchodilation (albuterol) and bronchoconstriction (methacholine). A preliminary study of 84 healthy subjects first established height dependence of baseline <b>R</b> <b>min</b> values. Results Asthmatics had a higher baseline <b>R</b> <b>min</b> % predicted than nonasthmatic subjects (134 ± 33 vs. 109 ± 19 % predicted, p = 0. 0004). Sensitivity-specificity analysis using receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that baseline <b>R</b> <b>min</b> was able to identify subjects with airway hyperresponsiveness (PC 20 min % predicted, FEV 1 % predicted, and FEF 25 - 75 % predicted, respectively). Also, 80 % of the subjects with baseline <b>R</b> <b>min</b> min > 145 % predicted had hyperresponsive airways, regardless of clinical classification as asthmatic or nonasthmatic. Conclusions These findings suggest that baseline <b>R</b> <b>min,</b> a measurement that is easier to perform than spirometry, performs as well as or better than standard spirometric indices in distinguishing subjects with airway hyperresponsiveness from those without hyperresponsive airways. The relationship of baseline <b>R</b> <b>min</b> to asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness likely reflects a causal relation between conditions that stiffen airway walls and hyperresponsiveness. In conjunction with symptom history, <b>R</b> <b>min</b> could provide a clinically useful tool for assessing asthma and monitoring response to treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} {{method to}} quantify the effects of recombination on populations is to estimate the minimum number of recombination events, <b>R</b> <b>min,</b> {{in the history of}} a DNA sample. People have focused on estimating the lower bound of <b>R</b> <b>min,</b> because it is also a valid lower bound for the true number of recombination events occurred. Current approaches for estimating the lower bound are under the assumption of the infinite site model and do not allow for recurrent mutations. However, recurrent mutations are relatively common in genes with high mutation rates or mutation hot-spots, such as those in the genomes of bacteria or viruses. Results In this paper two new algorithms were proposed for estimating the lower bound of <b>R</b> <b>min</b> under the infinite site model. Their performances were compared to other bounds currently in use. The new lower bounds were further extended to allow for recurrent mutations. Application of these methods were demonstrated with two haplotype data sets. Conclusions These new algorithms would help to obtain a better estimation of the lower bound of <b>R</b> <b>min</b> under the infinite site model. After extension to allow for recurrent mutations, they can produce robust estimations with the existence of high mutation rate or mutation hot-spots. They {{can also be used to}} show different combinations of recurrent mutations and recombinations that can produce the same polymorphic pattern in the sample. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a topology control problem {{in which we}} are given a set of n sensors in ℝ d and we would like to assign a communication radius to each of them. The radii assignment must generate a strongly connected network and have low receiver-based interference (defined as the largest in-degree of the network). We give an algorithm that generates a network with O(logΔ) interference, where Δ is the interference of a uniform-radius network. Since the radius of each sensor only depends on its neighbors, it can be computed in a distributed fashion. Moreover, this construction will never assign communication radius larger than <b>R</b> <b>min</b> to a sensor, where <b>R</b> <b>min</b> is the minimum value needed to obtain strong connectivity.

40|$|Abstract. CDMA/HDR {{system is}} {{designed}} to provide High Data Rate services in the cellular networks compatible with IS- 95 B CDMA network. It uses a PF(Proportional Fairness) scheduler that improves total throughput by using multi-user diversity in a forward link while supporting user’s average throughput proportional to channel conditions. Therefore, PFS does not guarantee the minimum data rate to the users with poor channel conditions. We propose a new scheduling algorithm, which bounds the throughput ratio (Rmax <b>R</b> <b>min)</b> between the best-channel user and the worst-channel user and maximizes the total throughput. Thus, it can guarantees minimum bandwidth by adapting the through-put ratio (Rmax <b>R</b> <b>min).</b> Furthermore, if the user data in the queue is less than the accommodation size of the assigned slot, there will be a loss of efficiency. We add a function to the scheduler to protect the system from this performance degradation. ...|$|R
