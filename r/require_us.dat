40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this paper}} is to suggest that the study of ethics and ethical {{theories}} can enhance nursing practice. Discussion. Knowledge of ethical theories can be of practical use to nurses in at least three ways. First, it can help nurses uncover to what extent a problem is an ethical one. The questions faced in practice can be empirical, formal or philosophical. Very often, a practical decision <b>requires</b> <b>us</b> to tackle all three types. In the example of a 'Do not attempt resuscitation' order, deciding on whether such an order is appropriate <b>requires</b> <b>us</b> to answer empirical questions such as how likely any attempt is to achieve success. It also <b>requires</b> <b>us</b> to answer formal questions such as whether the law permits such an order in the present circumstance. Finally, it <b>requires</b> <b>us</b> to answer ethical/philosophical questions, such as how we should weigh up quality of life against quantity. Second, it can enable practitioners to develop skills and tools to tackle ethical/philosophical questions. In this paper I describe two such tools: Socratic questioning and Aristotelian dialectic. Third, it can help practitioners to develop the soundness of their ethical values and beliefs. All ethical reasoning <b>requires</b> <b>us</b> to use our values and beliefs, and attending to them enhances the quality of our reasoning. Conclusion. The study of ethics can enhance nursing practice...|$|R

500|$|Higginbotham entered Purdue as a {{freshman}} in 1944. At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students. Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted {{to live in the}} dormitories. Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students to sleep in a section of one of the heated dormitories. Elliott's response was purportedly [...] "he law doesn't <b>require</b> <b>us</b> to put you in those dormitories. The law doesn't even <b>require</b> <b>us</b> to let you in. You take it or leave it."

2500|$|Kocher {{notes that}} Tolkien's {{literary}} techniques <b>require</b> <b>us</b> to increasingly view hobbits as like us, especially when placed under moral pressure {{to survive a}} war that threatens to devastate their land. Frodo becomes {{in some ways the}} symbolic representation of the conscience of hobbits, a point made explicitly in the story [...] "Leaf by Niggle" [...] which Tolkien wrote {{at the same time as}} the first nine chapters of The Lord of the Rings. Niggle is a painter struggling against the summons of death to complete his one great canvas, a picture of a tree with a background of forest and distant mountains. He dies with the work incomplete, undone by his imperfectly generous heart: [...] "it made him uncomfortable more often than it made him do anything". After discipline in Purgatory, however, Niggle finds himself in the very landscape depicted by his painting which he is now able to finish with the assistance of a neighbour who obstructed him during life. The picture complete, Niggle is free to journey to the distant mountains which represent the highest stage of his spiritual development. Thus, upon recovery from the wound inflicted by Angmar on Weathertop, Gandalf speculates that the hobbit Frodo [...] "may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can". Similarly, as Frodo nears Mount Doom he casts aside weapons and refuses to fight others with physical force: [...] "For him struggles for the right must hereafter be waged only on the moral plane." ...|$|E
