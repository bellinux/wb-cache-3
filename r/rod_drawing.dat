40|$|Abstract. Wire and <b>rod</b> <b>drawing</b> {{is widely}} used in metal forming {{processes}} to obtain products such as rods and wires. Rods having shaped sections such as square, rectangle and irregular section are necessary to produce connecting pins and components of transformers. Important characteristics of the shaped drawing process are the corner filling and inhomogenious factor of strain that influence the dimensional accuracy and the good quality of the product. In this paper, a three-dimensional rigid-plastic finite element analysis is used to simulate the drawing process of a square rod from a round bar. A finite element method {{is also used to}} investigate the corner filling, forming load, stress distribution and inhomogenious factor of effective strain under various process parameter conditions, including the reduction of area, the die semi-angle, and the friction facto...|$|E
40|$|With few exceptions, metal {{deformation}} analyses {{employ a}} constant yield stress (rigid, perfectly plastic metal) which ignores strain hardening, or a "mean" yield stress which attempts to accommodate strain hardening in a simplified manner. Since strain hardening {{is of interest}} here, little reference {{will be made to}} a rigid, plastic type of behavior. The first part of this paper demonstrates that the use of a mean yield stress underestimates the working loads (or stresses) needed to draw metal through conical dies as compared to those loads predicted by more "exact" analyses. In this context "exact" refers to those solutions obtained by incorporating the strain hardening relationship in the governing "force balance" differential equations prior to the integration of the said equations. It is shown, however, that the error introduced by the use of a mean yield stress is no more than some 8 per cent for conditions that typify actual practice. Since analyses of other metal-working processes, such as rolling and extrusion, employ the same sort of differential equation, it is felt that these results are applicable there also. The second part of this paper shows that redundant work in <b>rod</b> <b>drawing</b> may be approached either from considerations of the mechanical properties that result after the metal is drawn or from considerations of the stress necessary to draw down the rod. Contrary to what is implied in the literature, it is shown that these two approaches lead to different interpretations of the "redundant work factor". Relationships are given between the two for metals that are assumed to strain harden in certain simple ways...|$|E
