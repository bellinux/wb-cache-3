25|$|No more major land {{acquisitions}} {{took place}} until the 1960s, when the State Council of Parks, forerunner of NYSOPRHP, formed the temporary Hudson River Valley Study Committee {{to develop a}} comprehensive plan in response to increasing industrial interest in the area, exemplified by Consolidated Edison's proposal to excavate {{a large chunk of}} Storm King Mountain, across from Breakneck, for a hydroelectric plant, which would have involved <b>running</b> <b>power</b> lines across the river and into the eastern Highlands. In 1967 the state acquired the Little Stony Point property to prevent its development.|$|E
500|$|Equally {{important}} in terms of traffic but not as extensive in terms of route were the <b>running</b> <b>power</b> agreements with the Midland Railway (MR). For the NSR passenger traffic into Derby and Burton was authorised and good traffic as far afield as Wellingborough. The arrangements with these two companies allowed the NSR to run its longest passenger service, between Derby and Llandudno. These trains only ran [...] on NSR rails, with [...] over MR but with the majority, [...] over the LNWR.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} agreements were {{reached with}} the LNWR. In 1849 an {{agreement was reached}} where LNWR traffic could work over the NSR system but in exchange {{a certain amount of}} the LNWR London trains had to be routed via Stoke. These Manchester to London Euston restaurant car expresses were unique in often being hauled by NSR tank engines from Manchester to Stoke-on-Trent where the LNWR express engines took over for the run via Stone, Sandon, Colwich, and the main line to London Euston. The NSR received a payment for every through passenger on these trains and employed a small army of ticket inspectors to examine and clip (with its distinctive 'P' clip) every ticket during the Stoke-on-Trent station stop. The agreement did give the NSR access to destinations such as Llandudno, Manchester, Stafford, Wolverhampton and Buxton. NSR goods trains were able to run to places such as Liverpool and Rugby. [...] The LNWR also used running rights over the Uttoxeter–Ashbourne line to run through coaches from Buxton to London via Nuneaton. As well as the <b>running</b> <b>power</b> agreements with the LNWR there was a very short joint line of [...] at Middlewood and three jointly owned stations; Ashbourne, Colwich and Macclesfield Goods.|$|E
5|$|As {{a company}} with only a small route mileage the NSR made {{extensive}} use of <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> and in exchange granted <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> to other companies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{opening of}} the NSR line was also {{accompanied}} by reciprocal <b>running</b> <b>powers.</b> The NSR gained <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> to Wellington (for goods traffic) and [...] (passengers and cattle) and the GWR had <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> for freight traffic to [...] [...] The NSR also built its own small engine shed at Market Drayton which lasted until 1931.|$|R
5000|$|The RR and the LNWR got <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> to Pontypridd, and the PC&NR got <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> into Cardiff {{over the}} RR. The RR powers to Pontypridd were {{rendered}} unusable by the obstructive {{attitude of the}} TVR.|$|R

50|$|Now the {{resolution}} {{was for the}} Severn Bridge Railway Company and the Severn and Wye Railway to amalgamate. Financial assistance would be provided by the Midland Railway, which would get the <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> it had previously had refused. The Severn and Wye Railway and the Severn Bridge Railway would amalgamate, but would remain independent of the larger networks. In exchange for granting the Midland Railway <b>running</b> <b>powers,</b> the S&WR would get <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> over the Midland to Nailsworth and Stroud; although these were local centres of industry, the <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> from the Forest to those places were of little value as the Midland was dominant in taking traffic to its own large network.|$|R
50|$|The TVR {{informed}} the GWR that it {{intended to use}} its <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> over the joint line from 1 September 1878, but Dowlais as an objective seems to have reduced in priority: the TVR's own connection to the Dowlais Railway was still in existence. The priority now was access to the Navigation Colliery at Treharris, and traffic from the Taff Bargoed line itself, {{as well as the}} collieries at Llancaiach. The GWR disputed the use of the <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> to get access to Navigation Colliery: the <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> were to get access to the Taff Bargoed line, not to serve intermediate locations.|$|R
50|$|The North British {{immediately}} deposited a Parliamentary bill to {{make its}} own crossing of the Forth near the Caledonian viaduct. This was probably tactical, and the Caledonian agreed to <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> for the North British over the Alloa Railway (and over the SCR main line to Castlecary) and to double the earlier branch from Dunmore Junction to the SCR main line. In exchange the Caledonian got <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> over a new, short North British Railway link between a point just outside the Caledonain Alloa station to the NBR station there, as well as <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> from there to Stirling. In 1887 a new and enlarged station layout was built at Alloa to handle existing and new traffic {{as a result of}} the new line.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} years, power was {{generated}} by the company. However, in 1914 the company contracted to purchase power from other companies. This practice continued until the 1950s when the company again started <b>running</b> <b>power</b> plants to provide a portion of its base supply.|$|E

50|$|The Rhymney Railway and the LNWR {{agreed to}} {{construct}} the connecting line jointly, and <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> were granted to the RR along the MT&AR as far as Ebbw Vale, although in practice these were not used. The LNWR did well out of the exchange of <b>running</b> <b>powers,</b> receiving the right to run to Cardiff and Penarth over the RR system, although this required the acquiescence of the Taff Vale Railway, which was not easily obtained.|$|R
50|$|The Barry Railway {{deposited}} {{proposals for}} the 1896 Parliamentary session {{to build a}} new line from Tynycaeau Junction (near St Fagans) to join the Rhymney Railway near Caerphilly (at Penrhos Junction), and to get <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> on that railway's system north from the new junction. The Taff Bargoed line, joint between the Rhymney and the Great Western Railway, led to the important mineral centre of Dowlais, and <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> were sought on that line too.|$|R
50|$|These {{were that}} the Taff Vale Railway would agree <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> (except for {{passenger}} trains) between Cogan and Walnut Tree Junction over the Penarth and Radyr lines. At Walnut Tree the Rhymney Railway had a junction with the Taff Vale Railway, in fact giving access to the Rhymney's original main line there. Moreover <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> would be granted for all classes of train from Cogan to Penarth Curve South Junction, where connection was made with the Great Western Railway main line. From this point the GWR had its Riverside Branch, opened in 1884, running down {{the east side of}} the River Taff into an important industrial area; both the Barry and the Taff Vale were given <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> over this line, which was to be made suitable by the GWR for passenger operation.|$|R
50|$|Compressed air for <b>running</b> <b>power</b> {{drills and}} for driving fans and small {{hoisting}} engines was {{adopted in the}} Comstock mines. Diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use, but were discarded for prospecting purposes, being found unreliable. Several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed.|$|E
50|$|IPL {{was formed}} in October 1926 by the merger of the Indianapolis Light and Heat Company and the Merchant’s Heat and Light Company. Those two {{companies}} had started providing electrical service in the 1880s. At {{the time of the}} merger, the company had 105,000 customers.In 1937, IPL began a rural electrification program, <b>running</b> <b>power</b> lines to many areas outside Marion County.|$|E
50|$|Barry {{was not a}} prime travel {{destination}} for {{the residents of the}} Taff and Rhondda except on holiday days, and the Barry Railway went about providing a train service to Cardiff, over the GWR main line from St Fagans. Such a service was not covered by the Taff Vale's <b>running</b> <b>power</b> concession, so the trains only ran from the Barry station at Pontypridd southwards. It started operating on 7 June 1897.|$|E
50|$|In 1920 {{the railway}} company also took over <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> for the Soltau-Neuenkirchen railway, {{for which it}} also {{provided}} rolling stock and staff.|$|R

50|$|In 1873 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway {{obtained}} <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> into Hull, {{and passenger}} trains from that company running to Paragon from August. In 1898/9 the Hull and Barnsley Railway and the NER began work towards constructing a joint dock in Hull (see Alexandra Dock); {{as part of}} this cooperation between the two companies the H&BR gave the NER <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> over its line in Hull, and the NER allowed the H&BR to run into and use Paragon station.|$|R
50|$|Solar {{power in}} North Dakota is a little-used resource. The state ranked 51st on {{installed}} solar {{power in the}} United States, with 220 kW of installed capacity. Solar on rooftops can provide 24.6% of all electricity used in North Dakota from 3,300 MW of solar panels. The most cost effective applications for solar panels is for pumping water at remote wells where solar panels can be installed for $800 vs. <b>running</b> <b>power</b> lines for $15,000/mile.|$|E
5000|$|In 1863 the NER {{obtained}} an act {{allowing the}} construction of a line from Staddlethorpe on the Hull and Selby Line to Thorne, connecting to the South Yorkshire Railway's line from Thorne to Doncaster, with running powers shared between the two companies. Additional <b>running</b> <b>power</b> arrangements were made with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway on trains from Hull to south Yorkshire. The branch was completed in 1869. (See Hull and Doncaster Branch) ...|$|E
50|$|Biogas {{with a high}} {{concentration}} of methane is produced as a by-product, and this may be captured and used as an energy source, to generate electricity for export and to cover its own <b>running</b> <b>power.</b> The technology needs constant monitoring when put into use to ensure that the sludge blanket is maintained, and not washed out (thereby losing the effect). The heat produced as a by-product of electricity generation can be reused to heat the digestion tanks.|$|E
50|$|The NBR made {{full use}} of the <b>running</b> <b>powers,</b> which gave it a viable route from Perth to Glasgow {{avoiding}} the Caledonian, except where it had <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> (between Perth and Hilton Junction and over the Alloa bridge section). Express passenger and goods services were brought over the line. Use of the route by NBR goods trains was especially heavy between {{the opening of the}} (Second) Tay Bridge and the opening of the Forth bridge, for services from Dundee southwards.|$|R
50|$|Incidentally <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> {{had been}} south to Tondu in the authorising Act but {{this had been}} refused, obliging the company to {{exchange}} mineral traffic at Coity Junction.|$|R

5000|$|An {{automotive}} {{battery is}} a rechargeable battery that supplies electrical energy to a motor vehicle. It {{is also known}} as an SLI battery (starting-lighting-ignition) [...] and its main purpose is to start the engine. Once the engine is <b>running,</b> <b>power</b> for the car's electrical systems is supplied by the alternator. Typically, starting discharges less than three per cent of the battery capacity. SLI batteries are designed to release a high burst of current and then be quickly recharged. They are not designed for deep discharge, and a full discharge can reduce the battery's lifespan.|$|E
50|$|The North Eastern Railway and the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway now {{proposed}} to amalgamate, {{under the name}} North Eastern Railway. The NBR and several other competing lines, opposed the Parliamentary Bill. The NBR was persuaded to withdraw its opposition in return for an exchange of running powers: the NBR was to get <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> from Hexham to Newcastle, and from Sprouston to Kelso. The NER obtained <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> between Berwick and Edinburgh, including all facilities at and between those places, except for the running of local trains and fish trains.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, in 1856 the EKR {{introduced}} a Parliamentary Bill seeking <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> over the SER to , {{and then to}} build a new line to link to the proposed Mid Kent line of the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway. <b>Running</b> <b>powers</b> over the latter railway would then give the EKR access to Battersea Wharf station of the WEL&CPR. The SER successfully fought off this attempt, arguing that their North Kent Line was already operating at full capacity. At one stage they even announced publicly ‘that they would handle no East Kent traffic.’ ...|$|R
50|$|The Barry Railway {{had asked}} for <b>running</b> <b>powers</b> over the Rhymney Railway and over the Taff Bargoed Joint line but these were refused, except for powers into Caerphilly station.|$|R
