A hemispherical follower moved its carrier on a pivot axis parallel {{to that of the}} cam's <b>rotating</b> <b>axis.</b> Pivoting motion was the output.

25|$|A special type of integrator, used at a {{point where}} only {{moderate}} accuracy was needed, was based on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's <b>rotating</b> <b>axis.</b> That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.|$|E
2500|$|A pair of rollers [...] "above" [...] and [...] "below" [...] the pickoff plane were {{mounted in}} {{rotating}} holders that were geared together. That gearing {{was driven by}} the angle input, and established the <b>rotating</b> <b>axis</b> of the ball. The other input rotated the [...] "bottom" [...] roller to make the ball rotate.|$|E

50|$|Rotational molding {{machines}} {{are made in}} a wide range of sizes. They normally consist of molds, an oven, a cooling chamber, and mold spindles. The spindles are mounted on a <b>rotating</b> <b>axis,</b> which provides a uniform coating of the plastic inside each mold.|$|E

50|$|Another is a pinion-shaped cutter {{that is used}} in a {{gear shaper}} machine. It is {{basically}} when a cutter that looks similar to a gear cuts a gear blank.

50|$|The {{rotation}} of the axes is a translation in the parallel coordinates and if the lines intersected outside the parallel axes it can be translated between them by rotations. The simplest {{example of this is}} <b>rotating</b> the <b>axis</b> by 180 degrees.|$|R
50|$|In machine tools, {{a spindle}} is a <b>rotating</b> <b>axis</b> of the machine, which often has a shaft at its heart. The shaft itself {{is called a}} spindle, but also, in shop-floor practice, the word often is used metonymically {{to refer to the}} entire rotary unit, {{including}} not only the shaft itself, but its bearings and anything attached to it (chuck, etc.).|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that can}} {{contribute}} to engine imbalance, {{and there are many}} ways to categorize them. The following categories will be used for the purposes of this discussion. In the category descriptions, 'Phase' refers to the timing on the rotation of crankshaft, 'Plane' refers to the location on the crankshaft <b>rotating</b> <b>axis,</b> and 'CG' refers to the center of gravity.|$|E
5000|$|The ISAR {{image is}} the 2-D {{projection}} {{image of the}} target on the Range-Doppler plane which is perpendicular to the <b>rotating</b> <b>axis.</b> When the Range-Doppler plane and the coordinate plane are different, the ISAR image can not reflect the real shape of the target. Thus, the ISAR imaging can not obtain the real shape information of the target in most situations.|$|E

50|$|A {{panemone}} windmill {{is a type}} {{of vertical}} axis wind turbine. It has a <b>rotating</b> <b>axis</b> positioned vertically, while the wind-catching blades move parallel to the wind. By contrast, the shaft of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) points into the wind while its blades move at right-angles to the wind's thrust. That is, a panemone primarily uses drag whereas the blades of a HAWT use lift.|$|E
5000|$|... {{centrifugal}} pump, marine {{centrifugal pump}} {{is used to}} transport fluids by the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to the hydrodynamic energy of the fluid flow. The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor.

50|$|The non-spherical {{curvature}} of an aspheric lens {{can also be}} created by blending from a spherical into an aspherical curvature by grinding the curvatures off-axis.
