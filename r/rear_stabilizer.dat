25|$|Additional {{front and}} rear brake cooling ducts are added, and a full NISMO tuned {{suspension}} is installed, including a hollow 17.3mm <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bar from the NISMO performance division.|$|E
25|$|The Boss 302 Laguna Seca edition is {{a further}} {{upgraded}} version of the Boss 302. Additions include Recaro sport seats, a Torsen limited-slip rear differential (both optional on the standard Boss 302), revised suspension tuning with unique spring and damper rates, and a larger <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> The Laguna Seca model loses its rear seats, which are replaced by a cross-car X-brace to increase structural rigidity approximately 10%. It rides on 19X9-inch front and 19X10 inch rear light-weight alloy wheels with R-compound ultra high-performance tires. Ford Racing front brake ducts help cool the brakes.|$|E
5000|$|As a toy, it is {{the largest}} G.I. Joe playset, {{measuring}} in at just under 7'6". Had it been built to the scale of an actual Nimitz for 3 3/4" [...] figures, the Flagg would have been over 65 feet long, and 13 feet wide. It featured an electronic public address system, which could broadcast a person's voice, and a two-piece utility vehicle that was part [...] "low tow" [...] tractor, and part fuel delivery trailer. The Flagg had radar, missile launchers, an [...] "Admiral's Launch", an elevator deck, and an arrestor cable that fit snugly into the <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizers</b> of the Skystriker aircraft. It came with the [...] "Admiral Keel Haul" [...] action figure.|$|R
50|$|The LIBIS-17, {{originally}} {{known as}} the LIBIS KB-17, was designed to provide tandem seat training in advanced gliding flight, including aerobatics and cloud flying, as well as solo experience to gold and silver C standard as a single seater. It had a high wing of 5° dihedral, built around a single spar. The leading edge was a plywood torsion box, supported by Styrofoam, {{and the rest of}} the wing was fabric covered. The ailerons were of the Frise type, wooden, foam filled and fabric covered. It had Hütter type plate spoilers just behind the spar. Both vertical and horizontal <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizers</b> were all-moving, single piece surfaces, fitted with servo tabs. Both were wooden structures, near-rectangular in shape, with Styrofoam filling.|$|R
5000|$|The Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) {{technology}} was employed initially in the Lexus GX 470, and subsequently the 200 Series Toyota Land Cruiser. The system was invented and developed by Kinetic Pty Ltd, a small R&D {{company based in}} Dunsborough, Western Australia. It optimally adjusts front and <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizers</b> based {{on a set of}} interconnected hydraulic cylinders. The interconnection is made up of hydraulic piping and a control cylinder which is located at the frame rail. [...] KDSS, which is fully mechanical, can disengage the stabilizer bars (the bars are jointed, allowing movement independent of one another). This system will not engage during normal driving conditions, when hydraulic pressure is equal. In off-road conditions, KDSS activates when it senses that a wheel has dropped.|$|R
25|$|The SS {{was now a}} trim option {{limited to}} the mid-level Malibu series. Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less—but the mix of sport and {{utilitarian}} wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bars, 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.|$|E
500|$|The Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft, {{intended}} as a lightweight and agile aerial platform with advanced, highly adaptable avionics. It has canard control surfaces that contribute a positive lift force at all speeds, while the generous lift from the delta wing compensates for the <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> producing negative lift at high speeds, increasing induced drag. [...] Being intentionally unstable and employing digital fly-by-wire flight controls to maintain stability removes many flight restrictions, improves maneuverability, and reduces drag. The Gripen also has good short takeoff performance, being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand the stresses of short landings. [...] A pair of air brakes are located {{on the sides of}} the rear fuselage; the canards also angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease landing distance. It is capable of flying at a 70–80 degrees angle of attack.|$|E
2500|$|... 304th Bomb Wing: Large {{black diamond}} {{in the upper}} half; lower half painted to group color. The <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was painted the group color on the left half and had a diamond on the right. 454th BG: white; 455th BG: yellow; 456th BG: red; 459th BG: black-and-yellow checkerboard.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} {{is based on}} a unitized welded steel body (monocoque) with an independent short long arms (SLA) double wishbone front suspension with stabilizer bar and an independent multi-link twist blade <b>rear</b> suspension with <b>stabilizer</b> bar.|$|R
50|$|While archival combat footage {{was used}} {{in some of the}} scenes, miniatures were used to portray the early model Curtiss P-40B/C Tomahawks that the Tigers flew on screen. For all ground shots, {{full-size}} P-40 mock-ups were used that did no more than taxi. They were propelled by V-8 automobile engines, and the elevators and ailerons were missing from their wings and <b>rear</b> horizontal <b>stabilizers.</b> John Wayne's character arrives at the Tigers' airbase on the one-off Capelis XC-12, a failed 1933 twin-engine transport aircraft that found new life at RKO as a non-flying movie prop. The aircraft was also used in Five Came Back and other films.|$|R
50|$|In June 2017, {{dispatch}} reliability {{increased to}} 97.85% from 96.94% a year earlier, {{while there was}} 89.6 malfunctions per 1,000 flight-hours has, 40% less.On 21 July 2017 the European Aviation Safety Agency mandated a compulsory horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> <b>rear</b> spar inspection following the discovery of cracks on Sukhoi Superjet 100-95B aeroplanes in service in the rear spar of the horizontal stabilizer between ribs 0, 1 and 2.|$|R
2500|$|... 49th Bomb Wing: Upper {{half of the}} fin painted red, and a red symbol in {{the lower}} half; used the same scheme on the upper <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> with the red {{on the right side}} and the symbol on the left. 451st BG: circle; 461st BG: {{horizontal}} bar; 484th BG: bow-tie.|$|E
2500|$|Front {{and rear}} {{suspension}} components from the Fit are used including MacPherson struts {{at the front}} and an H-shaped torsion beam at the rear to keep the load floor low. Front and <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bars are also installed. On EX models, the 175/65-15 low-rolling resistance tires are mounted on lightweight aluminum wheels, each weighing [...] together with the tire.|$|E
2500|$|... 55th Bomb Wing: Large black {{square in}} {{upper half of}} the fin, lower half painted black with a yellow symbol superimposed. 460th BG: ring; 464th BG: {{vertical}} bar; 465th BG: horizontal stripe; 485th BG: a saltire. The <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> generally displayed only the black square outlined in yellow {{until late in the}} war, when the entire surface was painted yellow except for the elevators.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{engineer}} {{a completely}} new chassis for the Premier the then-new Renault 25's monocoque underpinnings were used as a basis and adapted for the new product. Using the Renault 25 chassis the suspension {{was derived from the}} Renault Medallion (Renault 21). The suspension featured a four-wheel independent system with MacPherson struts at the front wheels and two torsion bars at each <b>rear</b> wheel, with <b>stabilizer</b> bars in both front and rear.|$|R
25|$|Newly {{available}} for the Mustang GT for 2010 were two performance packages. The 3.73 Axle Package featured higher performance front brake pads, a more aggressive 3.73:1 rear axle, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system. The Track Package featured higher performance front and <b>rear</b> brake pads, <b>stabilizer</b> bars and <b>rear</b> lower control arms from the GT500, uniquely tuned shocks and struts, Pirelli summer tires (includes automatic upgrade to 19-inch wheels), a 3.73:1 rear axle with carbon plates in the differential, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{group identification}} aircraft markings for the 456th Bomb Group, {{located on the}} outward side of the B-24's twin tail fins, consisted of a black diamond symbol superimposed on a white circle (marking of the 304th Wing) on the fin's upper half, and the number 3 in white on the lower half. In May 1944, with the numbers of olive drab aircraft diminishing rapidly by combat attrition and operational wear, the Fifteenth Air Force adopted a system of color bands and symbols. The 456th's markings then became a 4 ft long black diamond on the upper half, and the entire lower half painted bright red (the 456th's group color). The upper surface of a bomber's <b>rear</b> horizontal <b>stabilizer,</b> on which the tail fins were mounted, was similarly marked, with the left stabilizer painted red and the right having the diamond symbol.|$|R
2500|$|... 47th Bomb Wing: Diagonally divided tail fins {{and painted}} {{the lower half}} in yellow and/or black, with the 98th BG using {{horizontal}} stripes, the 376th BG in black-only, the 449th BG in half-yellow half-black, and the 450th BG in vertical stripes. The former triangle-circle symbol was retained in the upper half. Late in the war the upper <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was painted black with a longitudinal yellow band in the center except for the elevators.|$|E
2500|$|The Boss 302 {{takes the}} Mustang GT’s {{suspension}} and adds higher-rate coil springs, stiffer bushings, {{and a larger}} diameter <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bar. The body is lowered [...] up front and just [...] in the rear {{to give it a}} more raked stance designed to recall the original. The shocks are adjustable at the shock tower by using a flat head screwdriver. The standard Mustang traction and stability control programs have been altered with a new intermediate sport mode designed to allow for more flexibility on the track.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Spyder" [...] {{nameplate}} {{had been}} used to designate the 1962-1964 Corvair turbocharged model. The [...] "Spyder" [...] name was introduced for the Chevrolet Monza in 1976. This package included performance equipment and some small appearance items. [...] The Monza Spyder equipment package was available on all 2+2 hatchbacks and Monza Towne Coupes (with the [...] "sport equipment" [...] package) with five-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmissions. [...] The Spyder equipment package included a two-barrel, Dura-Built 2.3 litre engine, floor console unit, large front and <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bars, special shock absorbers, steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires, wheel opening mouldings (chrome), day-night inside mirror, a sport steering wheel (two-spoke), a special instrumentation and [...] "stitched" [...] instrument panel pad with added wood-grain vinyl accents (standard on 2+2), distinctive [...] "Spyder" [...] identification (script fender emblems, steering wheel horn button insert) and Spyder front facia and rear-lock cover.|$|E
5000|$|The GT {{included}} {{all the equipment}} of the LX, but featured the F2T 2.2 L turbocharged, intercooled engine that produced [...] and 190 lbft Nm of torque. It came with an IHI RHB5-VJ11 turbocharger and an intercooler to the intake tract, {{as well as a}} knock sensor and electronic boost controller to the engine-control system. The boost pressure was [...] in the vicinity of 2,500 rpm. The GT version also came with 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, a 3-way adjustable suspension utilizing variable damping shocks, and a speed-sensitive variable-assist power steering (VAP). The Probe GT's suspension system was based on a Mazda design, but its tuning was different and included nitrogen-gas pressurized front and <b>rear</b> struts, with <b>stabilizer</b> bars.|$|R
50|$|Changes to 2012 Chevrolet Camaro {{include the}} {{introduction}} of the 323 horsepower 3.6L direct injection V-6 LFX engine replacing the outgoing V6 engine models, a new FE4 suspension package for SS coupe (retuned front and rear dampers, new solid front (23 mm) and <b>rear</b> (24 mm) <b>stabilizer</b> bars, 20-inch aluminum wheels with P245/45R20 front and P275/40R20 rear tires (from SS)), a revised instrument panel appearance (new instrument graphics and trim), a new steering wheel design with improved ergonomics, a power lift feature for the front passenger seat, a new Rear Vision Package (a rearview camera system and an auto-dimming mirror to the existing Rear Park Assist feature), a new rear spoiler as standard, taillamps from RS appearance package option becomes standard for all vehicles.

2500|$|AT-99 Scorpion Gunship is {{the heavily}} armed gunship {{counterpart}} to Samson and {{is similar in}} role and appearance to the AH-64 Apache, Mi-28 or AH-1 Cobra gunships. Dual co-axial ducted-fan rotor systems {{with a total of}} four prop-rotors each with three blades lead as the aircraft's primary proplusion. It drives on redundant fuel cells. Twin turbine generators driving counter-rotating annular ceramic motors. It is equipped with radar and sonar generators. It is armed with hex-cluster pylon-mounted [...]50 caliber rotary chain gun systems that can rotate a full 360 degrees with 700 rounds per minute cyclic rate of fire as close range primary weapons. The Scorpion has two pair of stub-wing pylons to carry its armament. Scorpions carry 190 TK-411 WAFAR (Wrap-Around Fin Aerial Rocket) rockets in ten 19-tube rocket launchers. The use of the rocket varies according to the warhead that can range from tactical applications to impact-based sensor systems. Eight Hawkeye NPB-9 Hellfire (Helicopter Launched Fire-and-forget) missiles are used to engage air-to-air targets in conjunction with the nose-mounted sensor suite. The tail doubles as a <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Despite these features, Riviera {{sales for}} 1971 dropped to 33,810, the lowest to date. The 1972 Riviera was little changed, with the 455 engine {{switching}} to net power ratings, [...] or [...] with the Gran Sport, although the actual drop in net power was only [...] Sales remained moribund at 33,728. For 1973, the [...] engine became standard, with [...] with the Stage One package, which {{also included a}} limited slip differential and a chrome-plated air cleaner.

Sluggish sales of the third generation Riviera led GM {{to believe that the}} boattail deck lid was too radical for most customers' tastes, so in 1973 it was blunted and made slightly shorter. The design change however only led to a marginal increase in sales, with 34,080 being produced for the model year.|$|E
2500|$|The 1976 [...] four-cylinder engine, {{as used in}} the Vega {{got some}} refinements. Named [...] "Dura-built 140", it {{features}} quieter hydraulic lifters eliminating valve adjustments. The basic four develops 70 horsepower, but two-barrel carburetion increases the rating to 84. The 1976 model was the introduction of Chevrolet's new 5.0 liter (305 CID) V8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor generating [...] at 3800 rpm, but only for California and high-altitude Monza customers, and replaced the 5.7 liter (350 CID) V8. The 262 V8 was again the optional engine in 49 states. A mid-year option for the 1976 model year was a sport front end available for the Towne Coupe, which features the 2+2's polyurethane front end and quad headlamps. The Monza Spyder option package was first introduced in 1976. It features a two-barrel carburetor version of the four-cylinder engine as standard, a floor console, F41 suspension with larger front and <b>rear</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bars, and special shock absorbers.
