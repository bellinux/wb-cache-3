The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the optimal load required to observe peak power output (PPO) during the hang power clean in professional rugby players. METHODS: Twelve professional rugby players performed hang power cleans on a portable force platform at loads of 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, and 90 % of their predetermined 1 -repetition maximum (1 -RM) in a randomized and balanced order. RESULTS: <b>Relative</b> <b>load</b> had a significant effect on power output, with peak values being obtained at 80 % of the subjects' 1 -RM (4466 +/- 477 W; P <. 001). There was no significant difference, however, between the power outputs at 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, or 90 % 1 -RM compared with 80 % 1 -RM. Peak force was produced at 90 % 1 -RM with <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> having a significant effect on this variable; however, <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> had no effect on peak rate of force development or velocity during the hang power clean. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> has a significant effect on PPO during the hang power clean: Although PPO was obtained at 80 % 1 -RM, there was no significant difference between the loads ranging from 40 % to 90 % 1 -RM.

40|$|Background: The {{relative}} physical load (% VO 2 max) is the quotient {{of oxygen}} uptake (Vo 2) during physical effort and maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) {{by the human}} body. For this purpose the stress test must be performed. The <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> shows a high correlation with minute ventilation, cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, increased concentrations of catecholamines in the blood, inner temperature, weight, height and human body surface area. The <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> is a criterion for the maximum workloads admissible for healthy and sick workers. Besides, the classification of effort can be more precise when based on the <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> than on the energy output. Material and Methods: Based on our own and international empirical evidence {{and the laws of}} heat transfer and fluid mechanics, a model of temperature control system has been developed, involving the elements of human cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Using this model, {{we have been able to}} develop our own methods of determining the <b>relative</b> <b>load,</b> applying only the body core temperature (TW) or heart rate within one minute (HR), body mass (m), height (H), and body surface area (AD) instead of VO 2 max. Results: The values of the relative physical load (% VO 2 max) obtained by using our own methods do not differ significantly from those obtained by other methods and by other researchers. Conclusions: The developed methods for determining the relative physical load (% VO 2 max) do not require the exercise test to be performed, therefore, they may be considered (after verification in an experimental study) a feasible alternative to current methods.

At higher <b>relative</b> <b>loads,</b> however, little difference in the speed of shortening was observed. Vmax (determined by the slack test) of R. pipiens fibres increased {{as the level of}} activation increased. Over sarcomere lengths 1. 8 - 2. 1 microns it was 2. 28 muscle lengths/s (m. l. /s) (S. E. of mean +/- 0. 25, n = 5) at 20 - 35 % activation, 2. 89 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 22, n = 7) at 40 - 60 % activation, and 4. 18 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 25, n = 6) at 100 % activation. At longer sarcomere lengths (2. 2 - 2. 6 microns), higher Vmax values were observed at all levels of activation, but the {{influence of}} Ca 2 + on Vmax persisted. Vmax was 3. 54 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 41, n = 4) at 20 - 30 % activation and 5. 15 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 22, n = 5) at 100 % activation. In R. temporaria fibres, Vmax (determined by force clamps over sarcomere lengths 1. 8 - 2. 1 micron) also increased as the level of activation increased, from 3. 47 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 06, n = 6) at 13 - 29 % activation to 5. 62 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 17, n = 6) at 100 % activation. Vmax was also determined (using the slack test) in mechanically and chemically skinned rabbit soleus fibres. Vmax at 15 degrees C (1. 05 m. l. /s, +/- 0. 11, n = 5) at full activation decreased by more than 3 -fold as the level of activation was reduced to 10 %. We conclude that the level of activation influences the Vmax of skinned skeletal muscle fibres. This has now been demonstrated in three different preparations and by a variety of techniques.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reviews the}} regulation of left ventricular pressure (LVP) fall by load and relates this regulation to left ventricular contractility. Load regulation of LVP fall has to be distinguished from neurohumoral regulation, from effects induced by arterial reflected waves and from long-term load effects on contractility. The response of LVP fall to a moderate elevation of systolic LVP is highly variable. It depends on the ratio between the actual systolic pressure and peak isovolumetric pressure, defined as "relative load". Up to a <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> of 81 % to 84 %, LVP fall accelerates. Above this <b>relative</b> <b>load,</b> LVP fall decelerates. Depending {{on the level of}} <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> there is a wide variety of effects ranging from moderate acceleration of LVP fall to marked deceleration of LVP fall. Acceleration of LVP fall in response to a load elevation is associated with normal cardiac function, while slowing of LVP fall is associated with impaired cardiac function. Similar but opposite effects are observed with reductions of systolic LVP. Effects of changes in systolic LVP on time constant tau reveal a fair correlation with systolic elastance (Ees), peak dP/dtmax and regional fractional shortening (or ejection fraction). There is an excellent correlation with measured isovolumetric LVP, indicating that contraction-relaxation coupling is close when contractility is expressed in terms of peak isovolumetric pressure. Assessment of contractility with systolic LVP-relaxation relation is precise and load independent and can be performed with the sole use of a high-fidelity pressure gauge positioned in the left ventricular cavit...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The force {{development}} by calcium-activated skinned frog skeletal muscle fibers and the motion on a slow time base {{after a quick}} decrease in load were studied at 0 - 1 ~ {{as a function of}} the ionic strength and the degree of activation. The ionic strength was varied between 50 and 190 mM by adding appropriate concentrations of KCI to the bathing solution. Under these conditions, the fibers could be maximally activated for several cycles at low ionic strength without developing residual tension. We found that the steady isometric force in fully activated fibers linearly decreased when the KCI concentration was increased from 0 to 140 mM. The steady isotonic motion at a given <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> in fully activated fibers was almost the same at KCI concentrations> [...] 50 mM. In 0 and 20 mM KCI, the isotonic velocity decreased continuously for more than 300 ms. At a given <b>relative</b> <b>load,</b> the initial velocity of the motion in 0 and 20 mM KCI was about 0. 6 and 0. 9 times, respectively, that in 140 mM KC 1. The initial velocity decreased further when residual tension developed; this observation provides additional evidence that residual tension may reflect the presence of an internal load. The effect of calcium on the motion was examined at 70 mM KCI. In this solution, the motion during the velocity transient at a given <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> appeared to be the same at different levels of activation. The speed of the subsequent motion was almost steady at high calcium levels but decreased continuously in low calcium levels. These results support the idea that at low ionic strength the response of the fiber to calcium is switch-like, but that other factors also affect the contraction mechanism under these conditions...|$|E

40|$|When {{operating}} a cellular radio system at nearly full capacity, admitting yet another user may jeopardize {{the stability of}} the system as well as the performance of the individual users. Therefore, proper admission control is crucial. Prior art includes algorithms which are limiting the number of users or the uplink interference per cell. Both are known to yield roughly the same performance, but the former is difficult to configure, and the latter is based on a quantity, which is hard to measure accurately. The core idea in this work is to predict the <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> of the system directly, given that a user is admitted. Then, the user will be admitted if the predicted load in the specific cell, and in its neighbors, is below some threshold. The proposed uplink <b>relative</b> <b>load</b> estimate is focused on WCDMA. It utilizes measurements readily available in that system, either periodically scheduled or from handover events. Multi-services are naturally handled, and availability of high data-rate services are automatically limited with respect to coverage, compared to services of lower data-rate.

Furthermore, the reporting overhead with periodical measurements can be avoided, since handover event-driven measurements yield roughly the same performance...|$|E

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} is a novel {{steady-state}} adaptive fueling strategy for an internal combustion engine. The proposed strategy utilizes a feedforward controller to determine the necessary correction in fuel pulsewidth such that after a throttle transient, the air-fuel ratio is regulated to stoichiometry. To determine the correction in fuel pulsewidth necessary for stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, the feedforward controller utilizes a novel nonlinear steady-state gain model for the air-path and the fuel-path. It is shown that engine speed is not an important factor for model development if fuel pulsewidth perturbation and <b>relative</b> <b>LOAD</b> perturbation are considered as inputs to the system. From an experimental testing standpoint, it is shown that the data required for model development {{can be obtained by}} performing perturbation tests at a single operating point. The ramification is that perturbation tests at different operating points within the engine operating envelope need not be performed. ^ To achieve stoichiometric air-fuel ratio at steady-state, a feedforward fueling strategy is developed. By using the steady-state gain models, the feedforward fueling strategy directly accounts for the nonlinearities in the air-path and the fuel-path of a spark ignition engine. Since the performance of the feedforward controller is contingent upon the accuracy of the air-path and the fuel-path model, an adaptive algorithm is employed to recover modeling accuracy should the performance of the feedforward strategy deteriorate. The adaptive algorithm adjusts the air-path model via feedback error based adaptation and recursive least squares to account for errors in the air-path and/or the fuel-path model. The proposed adaptive strategy is not contingent upon a particular type of exhaust gas oxygen sensor. In fact, a relay type exhaust gas oxygen sensor can be utilized. Since adaptation is limited to the air-path model, traversing the <b>relative</b> <b>LOAD</b> input space plays a vital role in recovering model accuracy. The requirement is that the driver input must result {{in a wide range of}} <b>relative</b> <b>LOAD</b> perturbations to complete the adaptation process. The proposed steady-state adaptive fueling strategy is experimentally verified on the Ford 4. 6 L- 2 valve V- 8 sequential fuel injected engine. ...|$|E
