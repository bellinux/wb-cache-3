40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} different agricultural services, by correlation-descriptive method, the present study attempts to prioritize demands of villagers for agricultural services, determine the role of effective factors on serving villagers through discriminant analysis and compute correlation between demands of agricultural services with education services through Spearman's Coefficient in Guilan Agricultural Jihad centers. The {{results showed that the}} five demands of services which had the priority were related to applicants of agricultural machines, draft discussion for fertilizer, facilities for livestock and poultry units, quota of fuel for agricultural machines and agricultural units and demands related to rice agronomy. In addition,educational services had a positive correlation with educational needs of villagers and staff factor enjoyed more important role in compare with human resource factor, equipment and <b>rural</b> <b>coordination</b> to offer services. Regarding that priorities in service demands from the centers requires providing credits, cooperation to establish local funds to provide agricultural machines which is the first demands of villagers and agreeing with collective ownership of these agricultural instruments are proper options so that the fund could be effective to provide other inputs and credits...|$|E
40|$|China has {{undergone}} a dramatic transition echoed the unprecedented urbanization and economic growth since the late 1970 s. The current research on urbanization has overlooked the transformation consistency between urban and rural areas. Although the Chinese central government has focused on improving rural residents' livelihood, it is still far from achieving coordinated urban rural development. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of China's urban rural development transformation (URDT) based on three indicator systems, namely the urban rural development level (URDL), the urban rural structure level (URSL), and the urban <b>rural</b> <b>coordination</b> level (URCL). Findings from this investigation show that universal and intense URDT {{has taken place in}} China over the last two decades. This has been accompanied by growth of URDL and URSL and deterioration of URCL. There are, however, obvious spatial disparities in the different aspects of URDT. The western and northeastern regions of China have experienced slower transformation than other regions between 1990 and 2010. Correlation analysis among the sub-index shows that coordinated urban rural development needs a certain initial socioeconomic level and moderate changes of URDL and URSL. This paper suggests that more attentions should be paid to rural areas and lagging areas in central and western China. Given the regional disparities of URDT, {{the most effective way to}} achieve urban rural integration in China is by taking the overall considerations of development policies of both region and urban rural areas aimed at various urban rural development transformation characteristics.

40|$|The Technical Centre for Agricultural and <b>Rural</b> <b>Coordination</b> (CTA) {{approved}} a project "Implementing the Caribbean Community Common Fisheries Policy: positioning and engaging fisherfolk organisations". The project is being {{implemented by the}} Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM) {{in collaboration with the}} Caribbean Network of Fisherfolk Organisations (CNFO) and other partners. The project purpose is to facilitate continuous engagement of fisherfolk organisations with policy processes and decision-makers for the implementation of key regional fisheries policies. It focuses on three specific policy areas: (1) finalisation and adoption of the Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Community Common Fisheries Policy (CFP); (2) operationalization of the Castries (St. Lucia) Declaration of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing; and (3) mainstreaming of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF), Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) in small-scale fisheries governance and management. As the first activity of this project, a four-day consultation was held between February 25 and 28, 2013 at the Grand Coastal Hotel in Guyana. The consultation was aimed at better expressing the needs and determining the arrangements to facilitate the continuous engagement of fisherfolk organisations with policy processes and decision-makers for the implementation of key regional fisheries policies. The desired outputs of the consultation were: (1) needs, expectations and demands (with respect to capacity enhancement) from fisherfolk on regional and national fisheries issues better expressed; (2) common positions of fisherfolk' organizations on finalization and adoption of Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Community Common Fisheries Policy, operationalization of the Castries (St. Lucia) Declaration on IUU Fishing, and mainstreaming of EAF, CCA and DRM in small-scale fisheries governance and management; (3) mechanisms and tools for sound governance, monitoring and evaluation of the Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Community Common Fisheries Policy, Castries (St. Lucia) Declaration on IUU fishing and EAF, CCA and DRM; (4) arrangements for continuous information and knowledge sharing and engagement of fisherfolk organisations with regional and national policy processes and decision makers; and (5) advocacy strategy for fisherfolk organizations outlined. The workshop was attended by fisherfolk leaders from 14 CARIFORUM countries and six partner organisations, and facilitated by the Caribbean Natural Resources Institute (CANARI).

40|$|Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC), a {{tertiary}} {{cancer centre}} in North Queensland, Australia, provides chemotherapy services to surrounding small rural towns using the Queensland Remote Chemotherapy Supervision model (QReCS). Under this model, selected chemotherapy regimens are administered in rural hospitals by rural based generalist doctors and nurses, {{under the supervision}} of TCC-based medical oncologists and chemotherapy competent nurses through videoconferencing. We sought to explore the perspectives of health professionals participating in QReCS. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with 19 participants, including nine nurses, eight doctors, one rural pharmacist and one administration officer. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were examined using iterative thematic analysis. Four major themes were identified from the data: (1) benefits of the model, (2) enablers of implementation, (3) operational requirements for optimal functioning and (4) disadvantages of the model. The reported benefits of the model were patient convenience, inter-professional communication across health district borders, expanded scope of practice, continuity of care and maintenance of patient safety and compliance with guidelines while delivering chemotherapy. Further improvements in the quality of training for <b>rural</b> nurses, <b>coordination</b> between urban and rural sites and between health professionals and documentation of clinical encounters would optimise the operation of the model. QReCS appears to provide many benefits to patients and health professionals and a framework for safe administration of chemotherapy in <b>rural</b> areas. <b>Coordination</b> of care, the quality of training for rural nurses as well as clinical documentation needs to improve to optimise the operation of the model...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{regions in}} South Africa need revitalisation. This {{paradigm}} shift {{is due to}} overpopulation and congestion in urban areas, technological advances leading to “space shrinking”, a growing need for food security, and {{a need for a}} sense of community and belonging. Since 2011, the national State of the Nation addresses (SONAs) in South Africa have focused on rural development as one of the main priorities of government, a neglected practice for more than two decades. This article analyses the state of rural development policies in South Africa and provides solutions for improved implementation. Government policies have been analysed and a need for improved <b>rural</b> development <b>coordination</b> is required. Possible solutions provided include categorising of rural regions, the “Feza iSimangaliso ” rural development model, and rural development best practice principles and procedures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a microeconomic framework of territorial dynamics through the {{comprehension of the}} processes of coordination between local actors. Neo-institutional economics {{as well as economic}} sociology approaches restore the role of social structures as constraint and resource for individual action. By dealing specifically with the strategic formation of social links, network economics allows to bear simultaneously social dilemmas in collective action, global social structure and individual choices of action. The empirical implementation of such a framework is demanding, and thus constitutes its main limit. However, its application to the specific context of public territorial action in rural areas, as addressed in this paper, confirms its attractiveness for the renewal of research questions in territorial governance, as for the relation between formal devices?like regional natural park in France- and local actor networks. <b>rural</b> areas, <b>coordination,</b> structural analysis, institutional devices...|$|R

40|$|PurposeRural-urban {{disparities in}} {{provision}} of preventive services exist, {{but there is}} sparse research on how rural, suburban, or urban differences impact physician adherence to clinical preventive service guidelines. We aimed to identify factors that may cause differences in adherence to preventive service guidelines among rural, suburban, and urban primary care physicians. MethodsThis qualitative study involved in-depth semi-structured interviews with 29 purposively sampled primary care physicians (10 rural, 10 suburban, 9 urban) in Missouri. Physicians {{were asked to describe}} barriers and facilitators to clinical preventive service guideline adherence. Using techniques from grounded theory analysis, 2 coders first independently conducted content analysis then reconciled differences in coding to ensure agreement on intended meaning of transcripts. FindingsPatient epidemiologic differences, distance to health care services, and care coordination were reported as prominent factors that produced differences in preventive service guideline adherence among rural, suburban, and urban physicians. Epidemiologic differences impacted all physicians, but rural physicians highlighted the importance of occupational risk factors in their patients. Greater distance to health care services reduced visit frequency and was a prominent barrier for <b>rural</b> physicians. Care <b>coordination</b> among health care providers was problematic for suburban and urban physicians. Patient resistance to medical care and inadequate access to resources and specialists were identified as barriers by some rural physicians. ConclusionsThe rural, suburban, or urban context impacts whether a physician will adhere to clinical preventive service guidelines. Efforts to increase guideline adherence should consider the barriers and facilitators unique to rural, suburban, or urban areas.
