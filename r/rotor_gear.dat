At about 150 feet altitude, the entire tail rotor gearbox was torn from the aircraft, resulting in an immediate and radical center of gravity change to the aircraft. This caused a severe nose down attitude and uncontrolled contact with the ground. Compounding the accident was the failure of both hydraulic systems due to the loss of the tail <b>rotor</b> <b>gear</b> box, which rendered the aircraft virtually uncontrollable.

50|$|During an {{official}} {{visit to the}} United States in September 1959, Nikita Khrushchev took a flight in the S-58 presidential helicopter {{for the first time}} and was reportedly extremely impressed. On Khrushchev's return, he ordered the creation of a similar helicopter, which was to be ready for the return visit by the American president, to save face. A luxury version of the Mi-4 was quickly created and Khrushchev took an inspection flight, during which Mikhail Mil proposed that his helicopter in development was more suitable. However, it would be necessary to have a second engine for reliability. This gave Mikhail Mil the power under the orders of Khrushchev to build the original two-engined helicopter, which for the first time in Soviet history would need purpose-built turbine engines, rather than those adapted from fixed wing aircraft (as in the Mil Mi-6 and the first prototype V-8) and an entirely new main <b>rotor</b> <b>gear</b> box that would be designed in-house for the first time. In May 1960, the order was given for Mikhail Mil to create his twin engine helicopter. The Sergei Isotov Design Bureau accepted the task of creating the engines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Gear {{boxes and}} {{direct-drive}} systems {{are commonly used}} in the transmission of large wind turbines. The components such as blades, <b>rotor,</b> <b>gear</b> box and the generator should be set up coaxially in the nacelle. Thus, the total weights of the nacelle increases {{with the size of}} the wind turbines. This research develops a hydrodynamic variable rotational speed transmission system combining with planetary gear-sets and the hydrodynamic transmission system for a 2 MW wind turbine. The nonlinear dynamic models of hydrodynamic transmission system and planetary gear-sets are derived firstly. The dynamic simulation analysis for the feedback type hydrodynamic transmission system (FHDTS) with feedback planetary gear-sets is implemented using MATLAB / SIMULINK. Finally, the closed-loop variable rotational speed control simulation combined with an intelligent controller can be achieved for evaluating the feasibility.

40|$|The pessimist {{complains}} about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails. ” [...] William Arthur Ward Alternative energy sources have {{become much more}} necessary as fossil fuels are depleted and pollute the environment. Wind energy {{is one of the}} most cost effective of all types of renewable energy. It does not create pollution or waste and the fuel, wind, is not used faster than it is produced. However, to make wind a viable source of energy—electricity in particular— careful design of wind-capturing machines is necessary. A variety of principles of physics are used to create wind turbines that can efficiently capture energy from the wind. This paper discusses the wind and how the parts of a wind turbine—blades, <b>rotor,</b> <b>gears,</b> generator, and electronics—operate to capture wind energy and turn it into electricity.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the fault}} {{diagnosis}} of rolling bearing in aeroengines {{is based on}} the vibration signal measured on casing, instead of bearing block. However, the vibration signal of the bearing is often covered by a series of complex components caused by other structures (<b>rotor,</b> <b>gears).</b> Therefore, when bearings cause failure, it is still not certain that the fault feature can be extracted from the vibration signal on casing. In order to solve this problem, a novel fault feature extraction method for rolling bearing based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the difference spectrum of singular value is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the vibration signal is decomposed by EMD. Next, the difference spectrum of singular value method is applied. The study finds that each peak on the difference spectrum corresponds to each component in the original signal. According to the peaks on the difference spectrum, the component signal of the bearing fault can be reconstructed. To validate the proposed method, the bearing fault data collected on the casing are analyzed. The results indicate that the proposed rolling bearing diagnosis method can accurately extract the fault feature that is submerged in other component signals and noise...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEver since Yoichiro Ito {{reported}} {{the separation of}} blood plasma cells with a sealed helical tube in 1966, countercurrent chromatography (CCC) has been a fertile ground for instrumental and technical innovations. The key innovation of CCC was to use centrifugal forces to retain the stationary liquid phase in the column {{in such a way}} that it can interact dynamically with mobile phase without any solid support. The great diversity of countercurrent separation terminology reflects both the innovative spirit of the field and the global appeal of this technique. The selected biphasic liquid system is the core of the CCC technique. The CCC columns must be able to generate the centrifugal field needed to maintain the liquid stationary phase. They cannot be a simple tube with frits at both ends. <b>Rotors,</b> <b>gears,</b> spools, and rotating seals are very specific things that are not needed in classical LC with a solid stationary phase.

40|$|Attempts to {{fabricate}} mechanical devices on {{the molecular level}} have yielded analogues of <b>rotors,</b> <b>gears,</b> switches, shuttles, turnstiles and ratchets. Molecular motors, however, {{have not yet been}} made, even though they are common in biological systems. Rotary motion as such has been induced in interlocked systems and directly visualized for single molecules, but the controlled conversion of energy into unidirectional rotary motion has remained difficult to achieve. Here we report repetitive, monodirectional rotation around a central carbon-carbon double bond in a chiral, helical alkene, with each 360 ° rotation involving four discrete isomerization steps activated by ultraviolet light or a change in the temperature of the system. We find that axial chirality and the presence of two chiral centres are essential for the observed monodirectional behaviour of the molecular motor. Two light-induced cis-trans isomerizations are each associated with a 180 ° rotation around the carbon-carbon double bond and are each followed by thermally controlled helicity inversions, which effectively block reverse rotation and thus ensure that the four individual steps add up to one full rotation in one direction only. As the energy barriers of the helicity inversion steps can be adjusted by structural modifications, chiral alkenes based on our system may find use as basic components for ‘molecular machinery’ driven by light. ...|$|R
