This {{paper is}} the first {{experience}} of systematization of X-ray sensitometric and structuremetric characteristics, as well as surface silver concentration and the emulsion layers thickness of <b>radiographic</b> industrial <b>films</b> manufactured by photochemical companies all over the world. All films have been divided into several classes, {{in accordance with the}} Standard recommended in Russia named “Nondestructive Radiographic Testing Method”. To start with, it should be mentioned that at present in Russia there is no single standard for classifying <b>radiographic</b> <b>films,</b> methods of their testing, as well as the standard regulating the use of chemicals for <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> photoprocessing that corresponds to European Standard [1]. In the 1980 -s the information became available relating to new methods of image quality estimating for <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> used in NDT (nondestructive testing) depending {{on the quality of the}} films, as well as information concerning film classification methods. In accordance with up-to-date standards, the quality of <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> is usually divided into 4 or 6 classes [1, 2, 3, 4 - 6]. The most important criteria of <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> quality for NDT are graininess (noise), gradient (signal) and detection quantum efficienc...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{diagnostic}} radiology, {{analysis of}} set aside <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> {{is a useful}} method for testing quality control. Repeated radiography not only imposes additional costs, but also increases the amount of unnecessary radiation dose radiated to the patients and relevant staff. The {{aim of this study}} to determine the frequency of set aside <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> and its reasons. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> were evaluated over a period of two months. After reviewing the scientific literature, a form was designed to study the setting aside of <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> and its related reasons. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 24, 392 radiographies were performed. The frequency of repeated <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> was 1241. The average rate of repeated radiographies in three hospitals was 5. 09 %. The specific rates of repeated radiographies in Khatamolanbia, Bu-Ali and Ali-ibn-e-Abitaleb Hospitals were 5. 32 %, 7. 22 %, and 2. 75 %, respectively. The main reasons for repeating radiography were radiation errors (42. 72 %) and the movement of patients (20. 30 %). The highest rate of repeating radiography was related to the pelvic cavity (11. 72 %). Conclusion: It was found that human error {{plays an important role in}} the repetition of radiographic images. Repetition rate of radiographic images in this study is in the middle range compared to the previous studies conducted in Iran, but its rate in some hospitals and some organs is not acceptable...|$|R

50|$|Chest {{radiography}} is {{the preferred}} means of initial diagnosis for hemothorax. Upright radiography is preferred but supine films may be taken when upright radiography is not feasible due to the clinical situation. Tube thoracostomy may be done prior to imaging when patients have sustained blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma and display unstable hemodynamics, have respiratory failure with absent or decreased breath sounds, show tracheal deviation, or have serious penetrating injuries. In upright radiography, hemothorax is suggested by blunting of the costophrenic angle or partial or complete opacification of the hemithorax, in which the lateral side of the chest appears bright and the lung appears pushed away toward the center; the air-filled lung normally appears as a dark space on <b>radiographic</b> <b>film.</b> In {{the case of a}} small hemothorax, several hundred milliliters of blood can be hidden by the diaphragm and abdominal viscera. In supine patients, signs of hemothorax may also be subtle on <b>radiographic</b> <b>film,</b> because the blood will layer in the pleural space, and {{can be seen as a}} haziness in one half of the thorax relative to the other side.|$|E

50|$|Paints are {{produced}} {{with a variety}} of elements. Depending on how much these pigments absorb x-rays affects how clear or opaque they will appear in the radiograph, this is known as x-ray fluorescence. Lead white, for example, will absorb more rays and appear much more opaque on an x-radiograph than carbon black, which will allow most of the x-rays to pass through resulting in a clearer result on the radiograph. To produce a radiograph of a painting, the <b>radiographic</b> <b>film</b> is placed on the painted surface and the x-ray tube is placed behind the canvas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Identification of {{deceased}} individuals {{based on}} dental characteristics is receiving increased attention. Dental <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> {{of an individual}} are usually composed into a digital image record. In order to achieve high level of automation in postmortem identification, {{it is necessary to}} decompose dental image records into their constituent <b>radiographic</b> <b>films,</b> which are in turn segmented to localize dental regions of interest. In this paper we offer an automatic hierarchical treatment to the problem of cropping dental image records into films. Our approach is heavily based on concepts of mathematical morphology and shape analysis. Among the many challenges we face are non-standard assortments of films into records, variability in record digitization as well as randomness of record background both in intensity and texture. We show by experimental evidence that our approach achieves high accuracy and timeliness. ...|$|R
40|$|Gag reflex is a {{physiologic}} {{mechanism that}} promotes contraction {{of the muscles}} of the tongue and pharyngeal walls. Different factors, including intraoral <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> and sensors, may trigger this reflex. Patients with severe gag reflex {{may not be able to}} tolerate the presence of intraoral <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> or sensors during root canal therapy (RCT). This factor may prevent an appropriate intraoral radiograph, which is important in RCT. Different approaches have been used to facilitate dental procedures in patients suffering from severe gag reflex. The use of an extraoral radiographic technique is an alternative method to obtain working length confirmation in patients with severe gag reflex. In this report of 2 cases, the use of an extraoral radiographic technique as an alternative approach during RCT in patients with severe gag reflex associated with phobic behavior and trismus was successfully demonstrated...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the Italian {{radiologist}} Alessandro Vallebona proposed focal plane tomography {{to represent a}} single slice of the body on <b>radiographic</b> <b>film.</b> The idea is based on simple principles of projective geometry: moving synchronously and in opposite directions the X-ray tube and the film, which are connected together by a rod whose pivot point is the focus; the image created by the points on the focal plane appears sharper, while {{the images of the}} other points annihilate as noise. This is only marginally effective, as blurring occurs in only the [...] "x" [...] plane. This method of acquiring tomographic images using only mechanical techniques advanced through the mid-twentieth century, steadily producing sharper images, and with a greater ability to vary the thickness of the cross-section being examined. This was achieved through the introduction of more complex, pluridirectional devices that can move in more than one plane and perform more effective blurring. However, despite the increasing sophistication of focal plane tomography, it remained ineffective at producing images of soft tissues. With the increasing power and availability of computers in the 1960s, research began into practical computational techniques for creating tomographic images.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} and verify a dose engine {{by comparing the}} three-dimensional dose matrix calculated by dual-level micro multileaf collimator based TPS and a Monte Carlo-based code MCNPX. Method and Materials: An irregular aperture shape was created by a dual-level mMLC and dose was delivered through the aperture to a cylindrical solid water phantom by a 6 MV Varian 600 C linear accelerator. A Monte Carlo model was designed by using MCNPX according to the configurations of the linac source, jaws, aperture shape and phantom. The computed dose matrix from CrossPlan treatment planning system (TPS) and MCNPX was compared against {{each other and the}} <b>radiographic</b> <b>films.</b> The isodose distributions, profiles, and gamma index were selected for comparison parameters. 3 D dose matrixes from CrossPlan and MCNPX were converted and exported to Pinnacle TPS for further comparison. Results: The planar dose image generated by both CrossPlan and MCNPX provided close match with each other considering the isodose overlay, dose profiles. The mean dose difference was less than 1. 4 %, and the gamma index values were less than one. The computed dose images from CrossPlan and MCNPX matched well with the <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> in isodose lines. The isodose and DVH comparisons by Pinnacle 3 further demonstrate the agreement of the 3 D dose matrix from CrossPlan and MCNPX. Conclusion: The good agreement between the computed dose from CrossPlan and MCNPX compared with the <b>radiographic</b> <b>films</b> indicated that both CrossPlan and MCNPX dose engines are capable to calculate and provide reliable and reasonably accurate dose distribution. The CrossPlan based dual-level micro-MLC is capable of precise aperture shaping, potentially allowing for an improved intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning and delivery...|$|R

40|$|Kodak X-Omat V <b>radiographic</b> <b>film</b> {{has been}} tested for its {{polarization}} properties when using polarized and non-polarized light sources and detectors. The <b>radiographic</b> <b>film</b> {{has been shown to}} produce a relatively small but not negligible (less than 5 %) variation in 90 ◦ cycles in measured optical density within the visible spectrum when the light source is fully linear polarized and the film is rotated through 360 ◦ angle. Negligible variations are seen when the detector is linearly polarized. If both light source and detector are linearly polarized, variations in measured optical density can reach 35 % when the film is rotated through 360 ◦ angle. This seems to be due to variations in the degree and axis of rotation in polarized light caused by the <b>radiographic</b> <b>film</b> and is independent of exposure level as the intensity of variation in absolute optical density is relatively the same for all film exposures.
