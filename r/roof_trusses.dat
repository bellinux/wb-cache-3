5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron <b>roof</b> <b>trusses</b> and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{behind the}} church is Tre Kronor castle. Destroyed by fire in 1697 and {{subsequently}} replaced by the Stockholm Palace, it was named after the central citadel, a large gun tower emblazoned with the Three Crowns symbol, known as the first building in Stockholm and a symbol for the Swedish Crown. While {{it is not known}} when the symbol was first added to the citadel (it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century), it was gilded during the 16th century. Again, the painting is strictly accurate, as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image. The castle's eastern wing, the king's personal residence, was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king, burdened by debts of war to Lübeck, expressed his indignation over the fact that the reconstruction was still not completed.

5|$|Macedonian architecture, {{although}} {{utilizing a}} mixture of different forms and styles {{from the rest of}} Greece, did not represent a unique or diverging style from other ancient Greek architecture. Among the classical orders, Macedonian architects favored the Ionic order, especially in the peristyle courtyards of private homes. There are several surviving examples, albeit in ruins, of Macedonian palatial architecture, including a palace {{at the site of the}} capital Pella, the summer residence of Vergina near the old capital Aigeiai, and the royal residence at Demetrias near modern Volos. At Vergina, the ruins of three large banquet halls with marble-tiled floors (covered in the debris of roof tiles) with floor plan dimensions measuring roughly 16.7 x 17.6m (54.8 x 57.7ft) demonstrate perhaps the earliest examples of monumental triangular <b>roof</b> <b>trusses,</b> if dated before the reign of Antigonus II Gonatas or even the onset of the Hellenistic period. Later Macedonian architecture also featured arches and vaults.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{structural}} design process for prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system in Malaysia. To gain insights on the central focus of this study, three research objectives were addressed: 1) to identify the methods employed {{in the design of}} prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system, 2) to determine the constraints in designing prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system in accommodating the specifications, 3) to establish the structural design software capability in assisting the design decision-making of prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system. Salient discoveries were obtained qualitatively, through in-depth interviews, and observations with the truss designers who are experts in the field of proprietary <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> industry. Data analysis was conducted using NVivo version 10, simultaneously with data collection. Coding process validated the basis for emerging themes where meanings were comprehended and organized thematically. The findings painted a vivid picture of the truss designing experience. Firstly, the findings revealed the significant methods employed in the design of prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system consist of two types of design: i) descriptive design method, ii) prescriptive design method. Initial conceptual design decision-making were highly characterized by technical experiences, user preference, attitudes towards requirements and specifications, constraints associated with design/construction stages, cost, raw materials, support-systems and production setup. Initial communication-related stress related to the players within and between players and acclimatizing to choices evolves towards offer and acceptance of the end product. Secondly, findings warranted the constraints in designing prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system in accommodating the specifications were hindered by the limitations of the system itself, constructability, and conflict in the local standard practices. Thirdly, aspects of the structural design software capability assisting decision-making, relies on the perceived understanding by the users on what the software can/cannot do, level of expertise of the support system and setup in the trade scope of work in assisting the design decisionmaking of the prefabricated <b>roof</b> <b>truss</b> system...|$|R

25|$|The widest span of {{a temple}} roof was across the cella, or {{internal}} space. In a large building, this space contains columns to support the roof, the architectural form being known as hypostyle. It appears that, although the architecture of ancient Greece was initially of wooden construction, the early builders {{did not have the}} concept of the diagonal truss as a stabilising member. This is evidenced by the nature of temple construction in the 6th century BC, where the rows of columns supporting the roof the cella rise higher than the outer walls, unnecessary if <b>roof</b> <b>trusses</b> are employed {{as an integral part of}} the wooden roof. The indication is that initially all the rafters were supported directly by the entablature, walls and hypostyle, rather than on a trussed wooden frame, which came into use in Greek architecture only in the 3rd century BC.|$|E
