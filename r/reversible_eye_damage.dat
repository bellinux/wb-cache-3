50|$|Class 3B {{can cause}} {{immediate}} <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> upon exposure.|$|R
25|$|Inherently safe; no {{possibility}} of <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b> This can be either because of a low output power (in which case <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> is impossible even after hours of exposure), or due to an enclosure preventing user access to the laser beam during normal operation, such as in CD players or laser printers.|$|R
50|$|Gold(I) {{chloride}} may irritate {{the skin}} and <b>eyes,</b> <b>damage</b> kidney function, and reduce white blood cell counts.|$|R
5000|$|Eye {{exposure}} symptoms include: pain, redness, swelling, and blurred vision. Permanent <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> including blindness can occur.|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} acts as {{a strong}} oxidizing agent and can cause skin irritation and severe <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Eye {{exposure}} symptoms include: [...] pain, redness, swelling, and blurred vision. Permanent <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> including blindness can occur.|$|R
40|$|An {{antibody}} which {{sticks to}} the intercellular region of xenogenic epidermal tissue has been shown by indirect immunofluorescence {{to be present in}} the serum of patients with practolol-induced <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b> These antibodies and those found in patients with pemphigus were compared for their ability to bind to isolated epidermal cells. Binding was achieved only with the pemphigus antibody, which suggests that it may have a different specificity from the antibody associated with practolol-induced <b>eye</b> <b>damage...</b>|$|R
25|$|Albinism is {{a serious}} problem in areas of high {{sunlight}} intensity, leading to extreme sun sensitivity, skin cancer, and <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} tanning {{dependence}} are/but not limited to: skin cancer, skin burns, premature skin aging, and <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> (both short and long-term).|$|R
5000|$|... "Fatal if swallowed", [...] "Poisonous if inhaled", [...] "Extremely {{hazardous}} by skin contact--rapidly absorbed through skin", or [...] "Corrosive--causes <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> {{and severe}} skin burns" ...|$|R
50|$|Facing Japanese {{gatekeeper}} Daijiro Matsui at PRIDE 9, Vovchanchyn {{controlled the}} bout by sprawling and performing ground and pound on him, until {{the fight was}} stopped by <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> on Matsui.|$|R
50|$|Diabetic retinopathy, <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> that {{frequently}} occurs {{as a result}} of diabetes, is related to the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. The barrier becomes more leaky in patients with diabetic retinopathy.|$|R
25|$|Also, {{the weaker}} effects {{are part of}} any {{stronger}} effect. Even if a laser does not cause <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> at 25 feet, it can still cause flash blindness, glare and a distraction.|$|R
50|$|Bush also {{continued}} to make radios for BWBF and their VTR set issued in 1970 had a non-tilting aerial with a smooth plastic moulding on the tip to prevent accidental <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|R
50|$|Serious <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> {{involves}} {{tissue damage}} or degradation of vision {{which does not}} fully reverse in 21 days. Eye irritation involves changes to the eye which do fully reverse within 21 days.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, the {{extremely}} bright light required for filming under the Technicolor process melted the wax figures, and they instead {{had to be}} played by actors. Some actors even received <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> from the lights.|$|R
50|$|If {{humans are}} exposed to ziram through {{inhalation}} for a prolonged period of time, they may develop nerve and irreversible <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b> Ziram has also been observed to cause irritation of the skin, nose, and throat.|$|R
50|$|XADS {{makes the}} Photonic Disruptor Series https://web.archive.org/web/20060719011154/http://xtremeads.com/photonic.htm. It {{is called a}} Threat Assessment Laser Illuminator (TALI); but it can cause night-blindness and {{secondary}} effects such as nausea; it is claimed to leave no permanent <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Faulty {{surgical}} devices: OCI {{agents were}} instrumental in securing the conviction of two company executives who had fraudulently sold surgical sterilizing devices that caused <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> in 18 patients, one of whom lost sight in one eye.|$|R
50|$|Bloggers later {{discovered}} {{a photograph of}} Warren Clegg in his role in Conservative Future pictured with Conservative Party leader David Cameron on the Conservative Party website which, in some <b>eyes,</b> <b>damaged</b> {{the credibility of the}} claims being made.|$|R
5|$|Concentrated {{acetic acid}} is {{corrosive}} to skin and {{must therefore be}} handled with appropriate care to avoid skin burns, permanent <b>eye</b> <b>damage,</b> and irritation to the mucous membranes. These burns or blisters may not appear until hours after exposure.|$|R
50|$|Both {{fighters are}} beaten, bloodied, and bruised {{by the end}} of the boutâ€”Balboa with severe <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> and Creed with {{internal}} bleeding. Creed gains a controversial split decision victory, and neither fighter wants a rematch, at least at that moment.|$|R
50|$|This double ketone (quinone) is a {{reactive}} metabolite of naphthalene and {{is found in}} diesel exhaust particles. The accumulation of this toxic metabolite in rats from doses of naphthalene {{has been shown to}} cause <b>eye</b> <b>damage,</b> including the formation of cataracts.|$|R
25|$|Pulsed/continuous {{nature of}} the beam. Some laser beams emit their energy in pulses. A pulsed laser {{presents}} a greater <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> risk than a continuous laser of equal (average) power. This is because the power is packed into shorter but more intense pulses.|$|R
50|$|Injections with zymosan {{can promote}} macrophages {{to enter the}} eye and secrete oncomodulin (6). This is an {{effective}} method of treatment in patients with minor <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> (6). Injections into patients with severed spinal cords has shown to restore partial motor function (4).|$|R
50|$|Most {{people who}} have dry eyes {{experience}} mild irritation with no long-term effects. However, if the condition is left untreated or becomes severe, it can produce complications that can cause <b>eye</b> <b>damage,</b> resulting in impaired vision or (rarely) {{in the loss of}} vision.|$|R
50|$|Pulsed/continuous {{nature of}} the beam. Some laser beams emit their energy in pulses. A pulsed laser {{presents}} a greater <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> risk than a continuous laser of equal (average) power. This is because the power is packed into shorter but more intense pulses.|$|R
50|$|Setaria cervi in {{the body}} cavity is {{generally}} harmless. But the young larvae upon infection can move to the nervous system, where they induce severe neurological disease, {{as well as in}} the eye, where they can cause <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> resulting in blindness.|$|R
50|$|Class 3R (formerly IIIa) lasers {{are usually}} up to 5 mW and involve a small risk of <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> within {{the time of}} the blink reflex. Staring into such a beam for several seconds is likely to cause damage to a spot on the retina.|$|R
5000|$|Eye {{contact can}} cause severe {{irritation}} and burns with possible <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b> For some individuals, 2-phenylphenol can also irritate the skin. [...] It {{is one of}} the chemicals that the Hyperactive Children's Support Group recommends be eliminated from the diet of children (Needs citation).|$|R
5000|$|When Wang Jingping's friend Mo Naneng had {{a severe}} {{accident}} in 1979 that implied <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> {{and then turned}} him blind, it was noted left-wing author Chen Yimgzhen who personally [...] "taught him braille writing", which signalled the beginning of Mo's career as a writer.|$|R
25|$|The three {{visual effects}} above {{are the primary}} concern for {{aviation}} experts. This is because they could happen with lower-powered lasers that are commonly available. The fourth concern, <b>eye</b> <b>damage,</b> is much less likely. It would take specialized equipment not readily available to the general public.|$|R
50|$|The United States Coast Guard {{requires}} {{their air}} crews {{to return to}} base if a green laser is pointed at them, and have their eyes examined for <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b> People have been given {{up to five years}} in jail for aiming a green laser at an aircraft.|$|R

25|$|The blink reflex of {{the human}} eye (aversion response) will prevent <b>eye</b> <b>damage,</b> unless the person {{deliberately}} stares into the beam for an extended period. Output power may be up to 1mW. This class includes only lasers that emit visible light. Some laser pointers are in this category.|$|R
25|$|As {{with other}} CrVI compounds, {{potassium}} dichromate is carcinogenic {{and should be}} handled with gloves and appropriate health and safety protection. The compound is also corrosive and exposure may produce severe <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> or blindness. Human exposure further encompasses impaired fertility, heritable genetic damage and harm to unborn children.|$|R
