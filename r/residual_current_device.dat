40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>devices</b> {{are applied}} to ensure {{protection}} against indirect contact using auto-matic disconnection of supply in low voltage systems.

40|$|Measurement of fault loop {{impedance}} in {{low voltage}} grids and systems is {{in most cases}} performed to verify the effectiveness of {{protection against electric shock}} by automatic disconnection of supply. For the sake of measurement accuracy, it is advisable to perform it using large current.

The study presents results of an investigation of <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>devices</b> behaviour during measurements of fault loop impedance performed with selected measuring devices. The tests have been performed on circuits with <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>devices</b> with a rated <b>residual</b> operating <b>current</b> IΔn = 30 mA, of AC and A type.

50|$|Shocks can {{be caused}} by direct or {{indirect}} contact. Contact with an exposed conductive part under fault conditions is called direct contact.

50|$|Until the 1950s, {{isolated}} ground domestic mains supplies {{tended to have}} no Residual-Current Device (RCD) or Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), and too high a ground impedance to blow a fuse if a live-to-earth fault occurred.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> {{protector}} {{based on}} high performance micro-controller MSP 430 is introduced. The micro-controller MSP 430 F 149 {{is used as}} the main controller in the device, which can detect the real-time <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> value. And the <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> operating value can be switched automatically according to the present condition of the power system. When the protection is occurred, the <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> protective <b>device</b> has the inverse time lag function, ideal time delay and the automatic reclosing function. So the <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> protective <b>device</b> can be used at all kinds of complicated rural grid and climatic condition, and the safety and {{the reliability of the}} power supply can be ensured...|$|R
5000|$|In IT and TN-C networks, <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>devices</b> are {{far less}} likely to detect an {{insulation}} fault. In a TN-C system, they would also be very vulnerable to unwanted triggering from contact between earth conductors of circuits on different RCDs or with real ground, thus making their use impracticable. Also, RCDs usually isolate the neutral core. Since it is unsafe to do this in a TN-C system, RCDs on TN-C should be wired to only interrupt the line conductor.|$|R
5000|$|In {{low-voltage}} distribution networks, which {{distribute the}} electric {{power to the}} widest class of end users, the main concern for design of earthing systems is safety of consumers who use the electric appliances and their protection against electric shocks. The earthing system, in combination with protective devices such as fuses and <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>devices,</b> must ultimately ensure that a person must not come into touch with a metallic object whose potential relative to the person's potential exceeds a [...] "safe" [...] threshold, typically set at about 50 V.|$|R
50|$|In {{designing}} domestic power installations the {{short-circuit current}} {{available on the}} electrical outlets should not be too high or too low. The effect of too high short circuit current is discussed in the previous paragraph. The short circuit current should be around 20 times the rating of the circuit to ensure the branch circuit protection clears a fault quickly. Quick disconnecting is needed, because in live-ground short circuit the grounding pin potential on the power outlet can rise compared to the local earth (concrete floor, water pipe etc.) during short circuit to a dangerous voltage, which needs {{to be shut down}} quickly for safety. If the short circuit current is lower than this figure, special precautions need to be taken {{to make sure that the}} system is safe; those usually include using a <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>device</b> (sometimes called a ground fault interrupter) for extra protection.|$|E
50|$|Within zone 0, no {{devices are}} allowed apart from {{suitable}} equipment and or insulated pull cords. Previously, in zone 1, only separated extra low voltage (SELV) devices were permitted. Any AC transformer supplying such a device must be located outside zones 0-2. Since {{the introduction of}} the 17th edition of the IET Wiring Regulations in 2008, 230V fixtures such as light fittings and extractor fans are permitted in zones 1 and 2, subject to those fixtures meeting the appropriate ingress protection ratings. The minimum required ingress protection rating in zone 0 is IPX7 and IPX4 in zone 1 and 2. If water jets are likely to occur, at least IPX5 is required in zone 1-3. Otherwise, in zone 3 and beyond, an ingress protection rating of IP20 is the minimum required. Equipment in zones 1 and 2 must be protected by a 30 mA <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>device</b> (RCD).|$|E
50|$|The second problem, the {{inadequacy}} of fuses to act as the sole safety device in most power systems, is probably best resolved {{by the use of}} residual current devices (RCDs). In any properly functioning electrical appliance the current flowing into the appliance on the active line should equal the current flowing out of the appliance on the neutral line. A <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>device</b> works by monitoring the active and neutral lines and tripping the active line if it notices a difference. Residual current devices require a separate neutral line for each phase {{and to be able to}} trip within a time frame before harm occurs. This is typically not a problem in most residential applications where standard wiring provides an active and neutral line for each appliance (that's why your power plugs always have at least two tongs) and the voltages are relatively low however these issues do limit the effectiveness of RCDs in other applications such as industry. Even with the installation of an RCD, exposure to electricity can still prove lethal.|$|E
50|$|Standard IEC 60755 (General {{requirements}} for <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> operated protective <b>devices)</b> defines {{three types of}} RCD depending {{on the characteristics of}} the fault current.|$|R
40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>devices</b> (RCDs) {{are most}} {{commonly}} used {{as a part of}} the protection system in low voltage installations. RCDs are supposed to disconnect the supply whenever the imbalance current between the live conductor(s) and the neutral conductor, i. e. <b>residual</b> <b>current,</b> exceeds the predetermined value. Such an imbalance is sometimes caused by current leakage through the body of a person who is grounded and accidentally touching the energized part of the circuit, which could result in a lethal shock. However, harmonic components in ground fault current may influence the tripping sensitivity of RCDs, and the protection against electrical shock may not be effective. In the paper, results of theoretical analysis and experiments are presented. Several mechanisms which could influence the tripping sensitivity of RCDs are validated, and their dominant conditions are identified...|$|R
50|$|In pre-RCD era, the TT {{earthing}} system was unattractive for general use {{because of the}} difficulty of arranging reliable automatic disconnection (ADS) {{in the case of a}} line-to-PE short circuit (in comparison with TN systems, where the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults). But as <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>devices</b> mitigate this disadvantage, the TT {{earthing system}} has become much more attractive providing that all AC power circuits are RCD-protected. In some countries (such as the UK) is recommended for situations where an low impedance equipotential zone is impractical to maintain by bonding, where there is significant outdoor wiring, such as supplies to mobile homes and some agricultural settings, or where a high fault current could pose other dangers, such as at fuel depots or marinas.|$|R
