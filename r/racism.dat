5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about <b>racism</b> amongst fans in the host countries.

He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept <b>racism</b> in any form, talking of his past experience of <b>racism</b> in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan.

5|$|Critics {{praised the}} film's hard-line look at <b>racism</b> and Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors {{to present his}} argument, and its {{somewhat}} disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while <b>racism</b> is learned, it cannot be cured.

What sorts of criteria are used in arguments about the place of groups along racial hierarchies? What are the political implications of claims made about racial hierarchies...|$|R
