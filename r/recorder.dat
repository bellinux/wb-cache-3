5|$|The DC-9 {{carried a}} {{primitive}} flight data <b>recorder</b> that recorded basic {{information about the}} aircraft's air speed, acceleration, heading, and altitude on metal foil tapes. Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice <b>recorder</b> that recorded all conversations {{that took place in}} the cockpit of the aircraft. The flight <b>recorder</b> was recovered by investigators on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice <b>recorder</b> was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording tapes were destroyed by fire.|$|E
50|$|Consumer wire <b>recorders</b> were marketed {{for home}} {{entertainment}} {{or as an}} inexpensive substitute for commercial office dictation <b>recorders,</b> but the development of consumer magnetic tape <b>recorders</b> starting in 1946, with the BK 401 Soundmirror, using paper-based tape, quickly drove wire <b>recorders</b> from the market.|$|R
5000|$|British Tape <b>Recorders</b> or BTR {{machines}} were reel-to-reel tape <b>recorders</b> initially made by EMI in England after World War II. They {{were the first}} magnetic tape <b>recorders</b> to be manufactured in Britain, and their design imitated that of the tape <b>recorders</b> used by the Germans during the war. Because these multi-track <b>recorders</b> were painted EMI green, they then {{became known as the}} [...] "Green Machines".|$|R
50|$|L-3 Aviation <b>Recorders,</b> part of L-3 Communications Holdings, is a Sarasota, Florida based {{manufacturer}} of flight data <b>recorders,</b> {{often referred to}} as black boxes.

5|$|Following the crash, the aircraft's cockpit voice <b>recorder</b> was {{recovered}} from the wreckage and the data recorded found to be intact and usable.

5000|$|On January 12 and 13, 2015, {{following}} {{the recovery of}} the flight <b>recorders,</b> an anonymous ICAO representative said: [...] "The time has come that deployable <b>recorders</b> {{are going to get a}} serious look." [...] Unlike military <b>recorders,</b> which jettison away from an aircraft, signaling their location to search and rescue bodies, <b>recorders</b> on commercial aircraft remain inside the fuselage.

5|$|Democrat Joseph A. Scanlon {{was elected}} over Republican Edward W. Furia for clerk of courts, an officer {{charged with the}} {{collection}} and disbursement of payments ordered by the courts. Scanlon, a former state legislator, served as clerk until 1957, {{when he died in}} office. For <b>recorder</b> of deeds, another county administrative office, Democrat Marshall L. Shepard was elected. Shepard was a Baptist minister who had also served as <b>recorder</b> of deeds in Washington, D.C. Two years later, the office was folded into the city government and converted to a civil service position.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{magnetic tape}} <b>recorders,</b> not commercially {{available in the}} U.S. until 1948, were too expensive, complicated, and bulky to compete with these consumer-level wire <b>recorders.</b> During {{the first half of}} the 1950s, however, tape <b>recorders</b> which were sufficiently affordable, simple, and compact to be suitable for home and office use started appearing and they rapidly drove wire <b>recorders</b> from the market.|$|R

5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape <b>Recorder</b> {{with a new}} Solid State <b>Recorder,</b> and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E

5|$|The ICAO investigation, led by Caj Frostell, did {{not have}} the {{authority}} to compel the states involved to hand over evidence, instead having to rely on what they voluntarily submitted. Consequently, the investigation {{did not have}} access to sensitive evidence such as radar data, intercepts, ATC tapes, or the Flight Data <b>Recorder</b> (FDR) and Cockpit Voice <b>Recorder</b> (CVR) (whose discovery the U.S.S.R. had kept secret). A number of simulations were conducted with the assistance of Boeing and Litton (the manufacturer of the navigation system).|$|E
5|$|The baroque alto <b>recorder</b> (blockflöte in German) {{enjoyed a}} period of {{popularity}} in Europe as an orchestral instrument in the seventeenth century, starting with Monteverdi in his opera L'Orfeo. By {{the middle of the}} eighteenth century it had been displaced by the transverse flute. In France the transition was more marked, since cultural life centred on Paris; it was more gradual in Germany, made up of many separate principalities, all with their own court or municipal musicians. The baroque <b>recorder</b> was used in orchestral music in association with death and the supernatural; to express tenderness; in pastoral scenes (as the shepherd's pipe); and to imitate bird song.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{clarinet}} {{developed from}} a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This instrument {{was similar to}} a <b>recorder,</b> but with a single-reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore. Lacking a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about {{one and a half}} octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a <b>recorder,</b> and two keys for its two highest notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.|$|E

50|$|On 21 June, {{officials}} {{involved in}} the investigation disclosed that the memory chips from both <b>recorders</b> were damaged.

5000|$|Several {{changes in}} the {{construction}} of <b>recorders</b> took place in the 17th century, resulting in the type of instrument generally referred to as Baroque <b>recorders,</b> as opposed to the earlier Renaissance <b>recorders.</b> These innovations allowed baroque <b>recorders</b> to possess a tone regarded as [...] "sweeter" [...] than that of the earlier instruments, at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes.|$|R
