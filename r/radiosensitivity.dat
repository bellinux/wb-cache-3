25|$|The {{response}} of a tumor to radiation therapy is {{also related to}} its size. Due to complex radiobiology, very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer with wide local excision or mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Another method is to shrink the tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the <b>radiosensitivity</b> of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include: Cisplatin, Nimorazole, and Cetuximab.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{facilitate}} {{investigation of}} the molecular mechanisms of tumor cell <b>radiosensitivities,</b> we have generated a set of clones with different <b>radiosensitivities</b> from a human glioma cell line U- 251 MG-Ho. Forty-four colonies were isolated by subjecting parent cells to the mutagen N-methylnitrosourea and then irradiating these cells with increasing doses of x-rays. About half of the clones displayed different <b>radiosensitivities</b> than the parent cells. We selected {{one of the most}} sensitive clones (X 3 i) {{and one of the most}} resistant clones (Y 6) for further study. Isoeffective doses for these two clones differed by about a factor of 1. 7; the relative <b>radiosensitivities</b> of both clones were stable for at least 30 cell culture passages. These two clones do not differ significantly in either the induction or repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks as measured by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Radiation-induced apoptosis measured by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and micronucleus formation were similar in both clones. However, potentially lethal damage repair was greater in the radioresistant Y 6 clone than in the radiosensitive X 3 i clone as determined by colony-forming efficiency assay...|$|R

2500|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish the <b>radiosensitivity</b> of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation [...] "curability" [...] of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localised to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example: non-melanoma skin cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, anal cancer, prostate cancer. Metastatic cancers are generally incurable with radiation therapy {{because it is not}} possible to treat the whole body.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} <b>radiosensitivities</b> of precursor (Tsp), activated (Ts) {{and memory}} (Tsm) suppressor T cells for delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to sheep {{red blood cells}} (SRBC) were investigated in mice. Spleen cells from CBA mice, primed i. v. with 10 (9) SRBC 3 - 4 days previously, contain specific Ts cells which substantially impair the induction of DTH to SRBC in normal syngeneic recipients. Exposure of mice to 400 rad irradiation 1 day before the priming completely eliminated the subsequent development of Ts cells. In contrast, 3 days after the priming injection, Ts cell activity in mice is resistant to doses higher than 600 rads. Mice primed 40 days previously with 10 (9) SRBC contain Ts-cell memory which can be readily recalled by i. p. injection of 10 (8) SRBC. The secondary Ts cells which specifically inhibit DTH induction can be demonstrated adoptively in normal recipients. Mice were exposed to various doses of irradiation 40 days after the priming and 1 day before the i. p. injection. Ts memory was significantly reduced by 300 rads and was completely abrogated by 400 rads. The relative <b>radiosensitivities</b> of the three subsets of suppressor T cells are {{in the order of}} Tsm = Tsp greater than Ts...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether the cell-killing fraction can quantitatively explain the uptake reductions of thyroid remnants reported after a low activity pre-therapeutic scan using either radio-iodines (131 I, 123 I) [6, 7]. The survival fraction, or equivalently the cell-killing fraction, was computed by two independent approaches: analyzing data reported in recent thyroid ablation studies [20 – 24] with the statistical theory underlying the tissue control probability (TCP) [25], and using the <b>radiosensitivities</b> measured in human thyroid cell assays performed on both normal and malignant lines [26] and the mean absorbed doses reported in clinical studies [7].

40|$|Cellular {{radiation}} biology {{currently is}} undergoing changes {{common to all}} science in which the understanding in one area is becoming solidified while in another area conclusion of the classical phase is being engendered by the needs of modern thought.

The latter consideration will be supported by a summary of the responses of synchronous populations of the L 5178 Y S/S murine leukaemic lymphoblast to 20 Ne, 28 Si, 40 Ar, 56 Fe and 93 Nb ions of energies broadly in the region of 500 MeV/u...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Background: To {{investigate}} {{the differences between}} two rat yolk sac tumor cell lines with different <b>radiosensitivities</b> and p 53 status in sensitivity to high-LET heavy-ion beam and in sensitizing effect of etoposide or cisplatin in combination with heavy-ion beam. Materials and Methods: NMT- 1 (wild-type p 53 cell) is a parent radiosensitive cell line and NMT- 1 R (mutant-type p 53 cell) is a variant radioresistant cell line. Heavy ion (carbon ion) was accelerated to 290 MeV per nucleon by a heavy-ion medical accerelator in Chiba at National Institute of Radiological Sciences. The effects of carbon ion irradiation and carbon ion irradiation plus chemotherapeutic agents were assessed by clonogenic assay. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} between NMT- 1 cells and NMT- 1 R cells in sensitivity to high-LET heavy-ion irradiation. The RBE of carbon beam was larger in mutant-type p 53 cells than in wild-type p 53 cells...|$|R
40|$|The dual {{goals of}} {{optimizing}} clinical efficacy of hadrontherapy and determining radiation risk estimates for space research have intersected {{to a common}} focus for investigation of the biological effects of charged particles. This paper briefly highlights recent international progress at accelerator facilities engaged in both biological and clinical studies {{of the effects of}} particle beams, primarily protons, carbon and iron ions. Basic mechanisms of molecular, cellular and tissue responses continue under investigation for radiations with a range of ionization densities. Late normal tissue effects, including the risk of cancer in particular, are of importance for both research fields. International cooperation has enhanced the rate of progress as evidenced by recent publications. Specific areas of biomedical research related to the biological radiotoxicity of critical organs (especially the central nervous system), individual <b>radiosensitivities</b> to radiation carcinogenesis, and the analysis of effects in mixed radiation fields still require more research. Recommendations for addressing these issues are made...|$|R
40|$|A radiobiological {{study of}} {{circulating}} interferon {{production in the}} mouse was undertaken {{in the hope of}} elucidating the site(s) of circulating interferon production. After total body X-irradiation of the animals, different <b>radiosensitivities</b> of circulating interferon production were observed with different viral inducers. Myxovirus-induced circulating interferon production was especially radiosensitive. Moreover, a study of interferon production in syngeneic and xenogeneic radiochimeras demonstrated that cells producing NDV (Newcastle disease virus) -induced circulating interferon were derived from hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, treatment of mice with antilymphocyte serum significantly reduced NDV- and Sendai virus-induced circulating interferon, as opposed to other inducers. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the lymphocyte is the major source of myxovirus-induced circulating interferon. A survey of interferon production in 12 inbred mouse strains, using NDV as inducer, revealed the existence of low and high producers. A Mendelian analysis carried out with low producing Balb/c and high producing C 57 BL indicated that the difference between low and high interferon producers was caused by a single, autosomal, codominant factor...|$|R
50|$|It is {{also used}} as a radiosensitizer in adjunct to radiotherapies, since it can {{increase}} the <b>radiosensitivity</b> of tumor cells by inhibiting repair of sublethal radiation damage and delay {{the onset of the}} compensatory hyperplasia that occurs following irradiation.|$|E
50|$|Taiwanese {{scientists}} {{studied the}} sensitization effect of Panax notoginseng extract and purified Saponin (Rb1) on the radiation response of an experimental tumor (KHT sarcoma) {{in comparison with}} its effects on a normal tissue (bone marrow) in mice. Panax notoginseng extract at a concentration of 0.1-100 mg/kg produced an increase in tumor <b>radiosensitivity.</b> The sensitization effect was maximal at 10 mg/kg and at 30 minutes after injection. Higher doses were toxic to the bone marrow stem cells. Rb1 at a concentration 0.001-1 mg/kg produced an increase in tumor <b>radiosensitivity,</b> with maximum effect at 1 mg/kg. Higher doses were not toxic to the bone marrow stem cells. The differential effect on tumor suggest that further purified or synthetic versions of this extract may be useful not only in vascular-related diseases but also in cancer therapy.|$|E
50|$|Radiation {{exposure}} {{can cause}} cancer in any living tissue, but high-dose whole-body external exposure is most {{closely associated with}} leukemia, reflecting the high <b>radiosensitivity</b> of bone marrow.

Doniach and Logothetopoulos (1955) observed that the goitrogenic response could be inhibited by ionising radiation delivered by radioiodine. Crooks et al. (1964) used the degree of inhibition of the goitrogenic response {{as an indicator of}} the effect of graded doses of X-rays on the thyroid cell population by comparing the growth pattern of irradiated rat thyroids with that of unirradiated controls. They found that the normal growth curve was biphasic. Furthermore, on the basis of observed differing <b>radiosensitivities</b> of the two phases they suggested that the shape of the growth curve might be accounted for by a predominance of cell hypertrophy in the first growth phase and a predominance of cell hyperplasia during the second. However, Thyssen (1947) reported a different form of growth curve of the rat thyroid following methylthiouracil administration consisting of a lag phase, a phase of logarithmic growth followed by a plateau phase...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A radiobiological {{study of}} {{circulating}} interferon {{production in the}} mouse was undertaken {{in the hope of}} elucidating the site(s) of circulating interferon production. After total body X-irradiation of the animals, different <b>radiosensitivities</b> of circulating interferon production were observed with dif-ferent viral inducers.

30|$|Gaussen et al. [26] {{measured}} thyroid {{normal and}} tumor cells <b>radiosensitivities</b> for low LET from 60 Co irradiation of 15 cell cultures (5 normal, 6 papillary carcinoma, 1 follicular carcinoma, 3 macrofollicular adenoma, coming from 11 patients). These assays analyzed {{according to the}} linear-quadratic model showed that α ranged from 0.37  Gy− 1 (most radioresistant tumor cells) up to 0.97  Gy− 1 (most radiosensitive normal cells), with a very low β/α value. As beta particles also present a low LET, these α values measured for 60 Co {{can be used for}} 131 I as recommended by ICRP [30]. Furthermore, the quadratic term can be neglected, validating the use of Eq. (2). Lundh et al. [19] showed in thyroid cells assays that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 123 I versus 131 I was about 5 -fold, resulting in α value for 123 I ranging from 1.9 to 4.9  Gy− 1. This {{can be explained by the}} larger LET of 123 I Auger electrons as compared to that of higher energy 131 I beta particles. In addition, a higher LET also induces an even lower β/α value [31].|$|R

To ascertain that the respective <b>radiosensitivities</b> of the systems producing rat interferon in chimeras corresponded to that of normal mice, some rat-to-mouse chimeras were subjected to a second X irradiation 1 month after the first irradiation and restoration. Circulating interferon production was studied 4 days later.
