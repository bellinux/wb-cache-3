5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E

5|$|Although {{paleontology}} became established around 1800, earlier thinkers {{had noticed}} {{aspects of the}} fossil record. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water. During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, discussed fossils and proposed a theory of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) proposed a theory of climate change based {{on the presence of}} petrified bamboo in <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> in his time were too dry for bamboo.|$|E
5|$|Claudius {{annexed to}} the empire three <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> became {{important}} sources of auxiliary recruits: Britannia (43AD), {{and the former}} client kingdoms of Mauretania (44) and Thracia (46).

Britain in mid-2nd century contained the largest number of auxiliary regiments in any single province: about 60 out of about 400 (15%). By the rule of Nero (54–68), auxiliary numbers may have reached, by one estimate, about 200,000 men, implying about 400 regiments.|$|E
5|$|Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times.

5|$|In {{parts of}} the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, {{ambulances}} are designed to meet local conditions, being built using intermediate technology. Ambulances can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered ambulances can be particularly useful in <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with sidecars (or motorcycle ambulances) are also used, though they are subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road ambulances. The level of care provided by these ambulances varies between merely providing transport to a medical clinic to providing on-scene and continuing care during transport.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the range of}} the mockingbird {{expanded}} northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts, although the sightings were sporadic. Within the first five decades of the twentieth century, <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine, Vermont, Ohio, Iowa, and New York. In western states such as California, the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties.
