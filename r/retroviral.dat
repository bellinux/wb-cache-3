5|$|Primary HIV infection: May {{be either}} {{asymptomatic}} or associated with acute <b>retroviral</b> syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat <b>retroviral</b> infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute <b>retroviral</b> syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.|$|E
5|$|This complex {{scenario}} {{leads to}} the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient {{in the course of}} one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping {{back and forth between the}} two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized <b>retroviral</b> DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.|$|E
25|$|NF-κB {{family members}} share {{structural}} homology with the <b>retroviral</b> oncoprotein v-Rel, resulting in their classification as NF-κB/Rel proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of HIV-infection among {{the adult population}} is 1.8%. Only 20% of infected pregnant women receive anti <b>retroviral</b> coverage to prevent transmission to newborns.|$|E
25|$|The protein {{consists}} of four conserved domains (RNA-Binding Domain (TRBD), fingers, palm and thumb), organized into a ring configuration that shares common features with <b>retroviral</b> reverse transcriptases, viral RNA polymerases and bacteriophage B-family DNA polymerases.|$|E
25|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} enzymes {{include an}} RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which {{work together to}} perform transcription. In addition to the transcription function, <b>retroviral</b> reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication.|$|E
25|$|A non-genetic {{method of}} {{producing}} iPSCs {{has been demonstrated}} using recombinant proteins, but its efficiency was quite low. However, refinements to this methodology yielding higher efficiency may lead to production of safer iPSCs. Other approaches such as using adenovirus or plasmids are generally thought to be safer than <b>retroviral</b> methods.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this type}} of {{antibody}} {{has the ability to}} fight <b>retroviral</b> infections, in some cases it attacks pharmaceuticals administered to the body which would otherwise treat multiple sclerosis. Recombinant protein drugs, especially those derived from animals, are commonly targeted by neutralizing antibodies. A few examples are Rebif, Betaseron and Avonex.|$|E
25|$|An {{antisense}} GFAP retrovirus (PLBskG) {{to reduce}} GFAP mRNA expression, has been implemented in suppressing growth and arresting astrocytes in the G1 {{phase of the}} cell cycle. However, a main caveat to the clinical application of <b>retroviral</b> use is the non-discriminatory effects of PLBskG on normal as well as injured astrocytes. Further in vivo {{studies are needed to}} determine the systemic effects of PLBskG administration.|$|E
25|$|Comparative oncogenomics uses cross-species {{comparisons}} to identify oncogenes. This research involves studying cancer genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes in model organisms such as mice, identifying potential oncogenes and referring back to human cancer samples {{to see whether}} homologues of these oncogenes are important in causing human cancers. Genetic alterations in mouse models {{are similar to those}} found in human cancers. These models are generated by methods including <b>retroviral</b> insertion mutagenesis or graft transplantation of cancerous cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retroviral</b> vectors {{can either}} be replication-competent or replication-defective. Replication-defective vectors {{are the most common}} choice in studies because the viruses have had the coding regions for the genes {{necessary}} for additional rounds of virion replication and packaging replaced with other genes, or deleted. These virus are capable of infecting their target cells and delivering their viral payload, but then fail to continue the typical lytic pathway that leads to cell lysis and death.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} issue related to {{human gene therapy}} is safety, particularly for the gene therapy of non-fatal diseases such as OA. The main concern is the high immunogenicity of certain viral vectors. <b>Retroviral</b> vectors integrate into the chromosomes of the cells they infect. There will be always a chance of integrating into a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene, leading to virulent transformation of the cell. In general, gene transfer to humans is considered as a safe therapeutic method, despite recent events that have provided examples of random adverse events.|$|E
25|$|Reprogramming {{of human}} cells to iPSCs was {{reported}} in November 2007 by two independent research groups: Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University, Japan, who pioneered the original iPSC method, and James Thomson of University of Wisconsin-Madison {{who was the first}} to derive human embryonic stem cells. With the same principle used in mouse reprogramming, Yamanaka's group successfully transformed human fibroblasts into iPSCs with the same four pivotal genes, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and C-MYC, using a <b>retroviral</b> system, while Thomson and colleagues used a different set of factors, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28, using a lentiviral system.|$|E
25|$|Even at {{the highest}} doses that can be tolerated in patients, AZT is not potent enough to prevent all HIV {{replication}} and may only slow the replication of the virus and progression of the disease. Prolonged AZT treatment can lead to HIV developing resistance to AZT by mutation of its reverse transcriptase. To slow the development of resistance, physicians generally recommend that AZT be given in combination with another reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an antiretroviral from another group, such as a protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor; this type of therapy is known as HAART (Highly Active Anti <b>Retroviral</b> Therapy).|$|E
25|$|Viral vectors are {{generally}} genetically engineered viruses carrying modified viral DNA or RNA {{that has been}} rendered noninfectious, but still contain viral promoters and also the transgene, thus allowing for translation of the transgene through a viral promoter. However, because viral vectors frequently are lacking infectious sequences, they require helper viruses or packaging lines for large-scale transfection. Viral vectors are often designed for permanent incorporation of the insert into the host genome, and thus leave distinct genetic markers in the host genome after incorporating the transgene. For example, retroviruses leave a characteristic <b>retroviral</b> integration pattern after insertion that is detectable and indicates that the viral vector has incorporated into the host genome.|$|E
25|$|Lavdas et al. (2006) {{investigated}} whether sustained {{expression of}} PSA on Schwann cells enhances their migration. Schwann cells were tranduced with a <b>retroviral</b> vector encoding STX {{in order to}} induce PSA expression. PSA-expressing Schwann cells did obtain enhanced motility as demonstrated in a gap bridging assay and after grafting in postnatal forebrain slice cultures. PSA expression did not alter molecular and morphological differentiation. The PSA-expressing Schwann cells were able to myelinate CNS axons in cerebellar slices, which is not normally possible in vivo. It is hopeful that these PSA-expressing Schwann cells {{will be able to}} migrate throughout the CNS without loss of myelinating abilities and may become useful for regeneration and myelination of axons in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of antibody production in Sjögren's syndrome {{is not fully}} understood, but apoptosis (programmed cell death) and molecular mimicry may play a role. The Ro and La antigens are expressed {{on the surface of}} cells undergoing apoptosis and may cause the inflammation within the salivary gland by interaction with cells of the immune system. The antibodies may also be produced through molecular mimicry, where cross reactive antibodies bind to both virus and human proteins. This may occur with one of the antigens, Ro or La, and may subsequently produce antibodies to other proteins through a process known as epitope spreading. The <b>retroviral</b> gag protein shows similarity to the La protein and is proposed as a possible example for molecular mimicry in Sjögren's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Currently it {{is unknown}} which {{mechanism}} {{gave rise to the}} initial duplication of the amylase gene, and it can imply that the insertion of the <b>retroviral</b> sequences was due to non-homologous end joining, which caused the duplication of the AMY1 gene. However, there is currently no evidence to support this theory and therefore this hypothesis remains conjecture. The recent origin of the multi-copy AMY1 gene implies that depending on the environment, the AMY1 gene copy number can increase and decrease very rapidly relative to genes that do not interact as directly with the environment. The AMY1 gene is an excellent example of how gene dosage affects the survival of an organism in a given environment. The multiple copies of the AMY1 gene gives those who rely more heavily on high starch diets an evolutionary advantage, therefore the high gene copy number persists in the population.|$|E

2500|$|Although the plasmid methods avoid viruses, {{they still}} require cancer-promoting genes to {{accomplish}} reprogramming. The other main issue with these methods {{is that they}} tend to be much less efficient compared to <b>retroviral</b> methods. Furthermore, transfected [...] plasmids [...] have been shown to integrate into the host genome and therefore they still pose the risk of insertional mutagenesis.|$|E
2500|$|The MIR155HG was {{initially}} {{identified as a}} gene that was transcriptionally activated by promoter insertion at a common <b>retroviral</b> integration site in B-cell lymphomas and was formerly called BIC (B-cell Integration Cluster). It was demonstrated that miR-155 over-expression supports the development and aggresivness of B cell malignancies. [...] The MIR155HG is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and the resulting ~1,500 nucleotide RNA is capped and polyadenylated. [...] The 23 nucleotide single-stranded miR-155, which is harbored in exon 3, is subsequently processed from the parent RNA molecule.|$|E
2500|$|Some viral vectors, for {{instance}} [...] gamma-retroviruses, insert their genomes at a seemingly random location {{on one of}} the host chromosomes, which can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to cancer. In a severe combined immunodeficiency <b>retroviral</b> gene therapy trial conducted in 2002, four of the patients developed leukemia {{as a consequence of the}} treatment; three of the patients recovered after chemotherapy. [...] Adeno-associated virus-based vectors are much safer in this respect as they always integrate at the same site in the human genome.|$|E
2500|$|Frameshifting {{may also}} occur during {{prophase}} translation, producing different proteins from overlapping open reading frames, {{such as the}} gag-pol-env <b>retroviral</b> proteins. This is fairly common in viruses and also occurs in bacteria and yeast (Farabaugh, 1996). Reverse transcriptase, as opposed to RNA Polymerase II, {{is thought to be}} a stronger cause of the occurrence of frameshift mutations. In experiments only 3–13% of all frameshift mutations occurred because of RNA Polymerase II. In prokaryotes the error rate inducing frameshift mutations is only somewhere in the range of [...]0001 and [...]00001.|$|E
2500|$|Alphaviruses are of {{interest}} to gene therapy researchers, in particular the Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus have all been used to develop viral vectors for gene delivery. Of particular interest are the chimeric viruses that may be formed with alphaviral envelopes and <b>retroviral</b> capsids. Such chimeras are termed pseudotyped viruses. [...] Alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses are able to integrate the genes that they carry into the expansive range of potential host cells that are recognized and infected by the alphaviral envelope proteins E2 and E1. The stable integration of viral genes is mediated by the <b>retroviral</b> interiors of these vectors. There are limitations {{to the use of}} alphaviruses in the field of gene therapy due to their lack of targeting, however, through the introduction of variable antibody domains in a non-conserved loop in the structure of E2, specific populations of cells have been targeted. Furthermore, the use of whole alphaviruses for gene therapy is of limited efficacy both because several internal alphaviral proteins are involved in the induction of apoptosis upon infection and also because the alphaviral capsid mediates only the transient introduction of mRNA into host cells. Neither of these limitations extend to alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses. However, the expression of Sindbis virus envelopes may lead to apoptosis, and their introduction into host cells upon infection by Sindbis virus envelope pseudotyped retroviruses may also lead to cell death. [...] The toxicity of Sindbis viral envelopes may be the cause of the very low production titers realized from packaging cells constructed to produce Sindbis pseudotypes. Another branch of research involving alphaviruses is in vaccination. Alphaviruses are apt to be engineered to create replicon vectors which efficiently induce humoral and T-cell immune responses. They could therefore be used to vaccinate against viral, bacterial, protozoan, and tumor antigens.|$|E
2500|$|Neutralizing {{antibodies}} {{have shown}} {{potential in the}} treatment of <b>retroviral</b> infections. Medical professionals and researchers have shown how the encoding of genes which influence the production of this particular type of antibody could help {{in the treatment of}} infections which attack the immune system. Professionals in the field have used HIV treatment as an example of infections these antibodies can treat. Recently, potent and broadly neutralizing human antibodies against influenza (such as CR6261), HIV and hepatitis C have been reported, and have suggested possible strategies to generate an improved vaccine that would confer long-lasting immunity. [...] Another disease which has been linked to the production of neutralizing antibodies is multiple sclerosis. [...] The use of medicines which modify diseases is nothing new, used in regulation for multiple sclerosis since 1998 when the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Consensus Statement recommended their use.|$|E
2500|$|Evans and his {{collaborators}} showed that they could introduce a new gene into cultured embryonic stem cells and then use such genetically transformed cells to make chimeric embryos. In some chimeric embryos, the genetically altered stem cells produced gametes, thus allowing transmission of the artificially induced mutation into future generations of mice. In this way, transgenic mice with induced mutations in the enzyme Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were created. The HPRT mutations were produced by <b>retroviral</b> insertion; it was proposed that {{by taking advantage of}} genetic recombination between the normal HPRT gene and an artificial gene sequenced added to the cultured embryonic stem cells, [...] "it may also eventually be possible to produce specific alterations in endogenous genes through homologous recombination with cloned copies modified in vitro". The production of transgenic mice using this proposed approach was accomplished in the laboratories of Oliver Smithies, and of Mario Capecchi.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Retroviral</b> RNA is {{arranged}} in 5’ terminus to 3’ terminus. The {{site where the}} primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5’end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3’ end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5’ terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3’ end of the primer in the 5’ to 3’ [...] direction (with respect to the RNA template). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3’ end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>retroviral</b> {{ribonuclease}} H (<b>retroviral</b> RNase H) is a catalytic {{domain of}} the <b>retroviral</b> reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. The RT enzyme is used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from the <b>retroviral</b> RNA genome. This process is called reverse transcription. To complete this complex process, the <b>retroviral</b> RT enzymes need to adopt a multifunctional nature. They therefore possess 3 of the following biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H, and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities [...] ). Like all RNase H enzymes, the <b>retroviral</b> RNase H domain cleaves DNA/RNA duplexes and will not degrade DNA or unhybridized RNA.|$|E
50|$|BAF can be {{exploited}} by retroviruses {{to act as}} a host component of pre-integration complexes, which promote the integration of the <b>retroviral</b> DNA into the host chromosome by preventing autointegration (integration into itself). BAF might contribute to the assembly or activity of <b>retroviral</b> pre-integration complexes through direct binding to the <b>retroviral</b> proteins p55 Gag and matrix, as well as to DNA.|$|E

50|$|Retroviruses that infect {{human cells}} {{interact}} with different receptors, thus investigation began to find with which receptor HERV-W interacts. The HERV-W envelope glycoprotein could fuse parental TE671 cells (human embryo cells, identical to human rhadbomyosarcoma RD cells), PiT-1 and PiT-2-blocked cells (PiT1/2 are <b>retroviral</b> (RV) receptors), but not <b>retroviral</b> type D receptor-blocked cells. It {{was concluded that}} HERV-W may recognize and interact with the type D mammalian <b>retroviral</b> receptors expressed in humans.|$|E
