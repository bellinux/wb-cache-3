40|$|The {{regulation}} of the social implications <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> is a topic that has made its way in the European law with quite enough difficulty, but became in time an increasingly discussed topic. Since the {{transfer of an undertaking}} from an employer to another could not be achieved with disregard of its human capital, the European legislator has established a legal framework ensuring the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> Currently, the main legal basis in the field consists of Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings,</b> businesses or parts <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> or businesses - the Transfer Directive. The paper aims to achieve a critical analysis of European regulations on the protection of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> {{as a result of a}} merger. The scope of the Transfer Directive, the obligation to inform and consult employees in advance and the transfer of rights and obligations arising from the contract of employment as a result of a merger are being approached. In the study, matters on which the current European legal framework requires improvements so that the achieving of its objective be possible beyond interpretation and controversy are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{doctoral}} thesis is the regulation of passage of rights and obligations under employment relationship, i. e. the regulation that aims to safeguard the rights of employees {{in the event of}} structural changes of their employers. The first chapter introduces the legal regulation adopted by the European Union, the Council Directive 77 / 187 /EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings,</b> businesses or parts of businesses and the amended Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings,</b> businesses or parts <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> or businesses, that harmonized the standards of employees' protection in the event <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>undertakings,</b> including the historical background. Particular emphasis is placed on the relevant case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreting the directives. In the next chapters of the thesis three national legislations of the member states of the European Union are subsequently analysed - the Czech, French and British law. The foreign regulations were chosen for comparison based on their [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} the use <b>of</b> {{enforceable}} <b>undertakings</b> by the Australian employment standards enforcement agency, the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO), and its predecessor, the Workplace Ombudsman. Enforceable undertakings are used by the FWO as an alternative enforcement tool to court litigation in relation to breaches of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), which regulates wages, working hours and other minimum employment conditions. Proponents <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> argue that they deliver value to regulatory agencies as a responsive alternative to traditional, punitive enforcement action. On the other hand, critics have raised concerns about the accountability and effectiveness of this enforcement tool. The authors provide a critical analysis of the FWO&# 039;s use <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> including consideration <b>of</b> the decision-making process, content, monitoring and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The analysis {{is based on a}} review <b>of</b> all enforceable <b>undertakings</b> concluded in the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2012, as well as qualitative interviews with approximately 60 inspectors, managers and lawyers of the FWO, and a number of specialist workplace relations lawyers. The article reveals that the FWO has made limited but promising use <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> in the review period. Through deployment <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> the FWO has demonstrated that it has a mix of regulatory approaches available to it that are consistent with the key principles of responsive regulation. The number <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> accepted by the FWO, however, remains fairly limited. We set out a number of ways in which the regulator may maximise the utilisation <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> and more fully realise the regulatory benefits of this particular compliance tool...|$|R
