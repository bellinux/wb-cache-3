5|$|On 4 December, Stabæk Fotball {{stated that}} {{they were willing to}} move their training, Norwegian Football Cup and UEFA matches to either Nadderud or Ullevaal, as a {{compromise}} to free up more available time in the arena. This was rejected by NFF, who stated that the licensing rules required that a club's main arena be available for all league, cup and UEFA matches, and that a general exemption would not be given for the cup. In mid-December, Stabæk Fotball started the process of a judicial registration of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the venue, which was permitted according to the contract. This would grant Stabæk Fotball the right to continue to lease the venue even if the holding company went bankrupt. A preliminary injunction for this was granted by Asker and Bærum District Court.|$|E

25|$|Jackson's {{economic}} growth was further stimulated in the 1930s {{by the discovery}} of natural gas fields nearby. Speculators had begun searching for {{oil and natural gas}} in Jackson beginning in 1920. The initial drilling attempts came up empty. This failure did not stop Ella Render from obtaining a lease from the state's insane asylum to begin a well on its grounds in 1924, where he found natural gas. (Render eventually lost the rights when courts determined that the asylum did not have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the state's property.) Businessmen jumped on the opportunity and dug wells in the Jackson area. The continued success of these ventures attracted further investment. By 1930, there were 14 derricks in the Jackson skyline.|$|E

The American support worried Norwegian authorities and was discussed at a Paris meeting between Lange and United States Secretary of State, Christian Herter, in December 1959. A memorandum to the United States to stop funding was issued on 12 January 1960, resulting in AINA withdrawing the grant and instead issuing $5,000 to complete the previous year's study.|$|R

5000|$|Oklahoma City FC {{initially}} {{intended to}} pursue a franchise in the United Soccer Leagues' Professional Division (USL Pro) that year. The USL, however, also received an expansion franchise bid from a competing group, managed by another Oklahoma City-based sports group, Prodigal, LLC. With Prodigal, LLC's impending bid before the Division III USL Pro, Oklahoma City FC instead concentrated on obtaining an expansion franchise in the Division II NASL in April 2013. [...] Oklahoma City FC's organizational plans met with some initial success on June 17, 2013 by obtaining the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> Oklahoma City's Taft Stadium (a venue for which the Prodigal group also bid).|$|R

50|$|Since Wrather owned land {{adjacent}} to Disneyland, {{the acquisition of}} Wrather meant Disney could now either expand Disneyland or add a retail and entertainment district near the 1955 theme park. However, Wrather also held the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> and develop 236 acre near the Queen Mary under the 1985 proposal, though much of that land was underwater, giving Disney the option {{to build a new}} park in Long Beach. By June 1989, Disney had already advanced a concept for an oceanfront theme park using the Queen Mary as a backdrop. As a first step, Disney won the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> develop a hotel on a 14.8 acre site near the intersection of Pine Avenue and Shoreline Drive, across the Queensway Bay from the Queen Mary.|$|R

50|$|It {{was built}} in 1967 as the Apolo Hotel, named after Prime Minister Apollo Milton Obote. When Obote was overthrown in a {{military}} coup by Idi Amin in 1971, the hotel was renamed the Kampala International Hotel. Following the overthrow of Amin by Tanzanian forces and the Uganda National Liberation Army in 1979, the hotel reverted to the Apollo Hotel name. There were other regime changes {{in the country in}} 1985 and 1986. The National Resistance Movement, which ascended into power in 1986, liberalised the economy and Middle Eastern investors won the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the hotel from the government of Uganda and manage it for the next 25 years, starting in 1999. The investors won a franchise from Sheraton Hotels and Resorts to use the Sheraton name. The hotel then underwent extensive renovations.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{founding}} of Red Dot, and later Northfoto, domestic media in much of Eastern Europe had only limited access to independent news photography - like that provided by Reuters or Associated Press.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, between 1865 and 1878, three foreign groups encroached into North Borneo (Sabah). In 1865, Charles Lee Moses, an American Consul General, signed a treaty with Sultan Abdul Momin and {{obtained}} twenty one districts. Later, Moses transferred his <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the <b>lease</b> <b>to</b> Joseph Wilfred Torrey who {{sold it to}} Gustavus Baron von Overbeck. In 1881, the British government granted the British North Borneo Company a royal charter. William Hood Treacher was appointed the first British Governor of North Borneo.|$|R
50|$|In 1868, the LR {{made the}} mistake of not {{renewing}} its <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the <b>lease</b> of the Vale of Towy.

The completed Central Wales line was opened in June 1868.|$|R
50|$|Pendergast had a {{perpetual}} renewable lease with a Domain Board. During a rent renewal, {{a new lease}} agreement was prepared. Unbeknown to Pendergast, the Domain Board hid in it a clause giving it a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> cancel the <b>lease.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Japanese {{possessed the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> and own {{land in the}} United States for {{residential}} and commercial use based on the 1911 American treaty with Japan. In 1910, most Japanese were working in the agricultural and fishing industries. Rights to agricultural land, unprotected by treaty, thus became the focus for the Alien Land Laws as state-level deterrents to immigration were sought in a dearth of national-level involvement.|$|E
50|$|In October 1940, {{the governments}} of the United States and United Kingdom signed a {{contract}} known as the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, whereby the United States (still a neutral country) would provide 50 ex-United States Navy destroyers in exchange for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> territory in British territories in Newfoundland and the Caribbean. Of particular importance was Newfoundland, which the United States sought to arm as a buffer area similar to Alaska territory.|$|E
2500|$|Like Liberia, an {{independent}} Black nation, Haiti was also considered {{a good place}} to colonize freedpeople from the U.S. As the Chiriquí plan was hitting its stride in 1862, Lincoln was developing another plan to colonize the small island of Île à Vache near Haiti. Lincoln struck a deal with businessman Bernard Kock, who had obtained <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the island for cultivation and wood-cutting. 453 Blacks, mostly young men from the Tidewater region around occupied Hampton, Virginia, volunteered to colonize the island. On April 14, 1863, they left Fort Monroe in the [...] "Ocean Ranger". Kock confiscated all of the money possessed by the colonists and did not pay their wages. Initial reports suggested dire conditions, though these were later disputed. A number of colonists died in the first year. 292 survivors from the original group remained on the island and 73 had moved to Aux Cayes; most were restored to the U.S. by a mission of the Navy in February 1864. Congress rescinded Lincoln's colonization authority in July 1863.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to reflection {{on the question of}} land markets in Africa. Based on a case study of Abure society (Cote d'Ivoire), the article emphasizes, first, the relation between the intra-family dimension of land rights and the functioning of the land lease market. Particular attention is paid to intra-family land tensions induced by the land lease market, and their repercussions in the form of inter-community conflict reflecting the ethnic-national basis of the land lease market (with autochthonous Abure lessors and Burkinabe tenants). Second, emphasis is placed on the socio-political dimension of land tenancy relationships. The article is based on a deciphering of the land rights and land tenure practices within Abure family groups, and of a 2001 conflict which set Abure young men against Burkinabe pineapple growers. Beyond the inter-community conflict surrounding land, the article reveals an intergenerational conflict within Abure society itself between social juniors and the elders who manage family land, regarding the delegation of <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> out family land and the distribution of land lease (rental) income...|$|R
50|$|The society, in March 1919, {{voted to}} accept $360,000 {{from the city}} and give up the {{remaining}} 17 years of its 50-year lease of the city ground on which the buildings were located. During those next 17 years, the buildings with the <b>lease</b> would revert <b>to</b> the city anyhow, but the sale would enable the Society to pay its debts. Any money left over was to be divided among the men who invested their money in the institution. Pittsburgh's mayor, Edward V. Babcock, negotiated for the purchase of the Society's <b>rights,</b> <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the main buildings for a union trolley freight station, and to use machinery hall for a city garage and machine shop, while the music hall could still be used for conventions and mass meetings. The final transaction by the society was made that March, when the lifetime managers and members of the society met in the auditorium of the Chamber of Commerce and unanimously decided to sell the holdings to the city for no less than $360,000. Local businessman Henry J. Heinz was the last elected president of the society.|$|R
