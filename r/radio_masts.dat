After World War 2 the Taiaroa Head garrison was withdrawn and the lighthouse automated. The University of Otago took over the hatchery as a research facility as its commercial purpose waned. The City of Dunedin absorbed Peninsula County in 1967, promising to extend water and sewerage reticulation.|$|E

25|$|RAF Andover was {{attacked}} twice by the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain. At 1700 hours on 13 August 1940, approximately 12 high explosive bombs were dropped by Junkers Ju 88s of III Staffel, Lehrgeschwader 1, of Luftflotte 3, from Châteaudun in France. The Station Headquarters and officer's quarters were extensively damaged. One aircraft {{on the station}} was also damaged. Casualties were two killed. The following day, on 14 August 1940, RAF Andover {{was attacked}} again, about 15 high explosive bombs being dropped which destroyed a transmitting set in the centre {{of a group of}} <b>radio</b> <b>masts,</b> and killing a civilian radio operator.|$|E
25|$|On 28 January 1915 USRC Unalga became USCGC Unalga {{by virtue}} of the {{establishment}} of the United States Coast Guard by merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service. In February 1915 additional duties were assigned enforcing the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 which related to prohibited pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea. Patrol work during 1915 and 1916 consisted of summers in Alaskan waters with sealing treaty duties, law enforcement, search and rescue, medical assistance to fishermen and others, and the delivery of mail to remote camps. Winters were spent at various locations along the Pacific Northwest coast doing law enforcement patrol work. In January 1917, Unalga was assigned her first winter patrol in Alaskan waters at the urging of representatives of the fishing industry to provide medical services to crews of fishing vessels as well as search and rescue work in remote waters. She stopped in Sitka, Alaska to investigate reports of a measles epidemic and to take on more coal for her first winter mission into the Gulf of Alaska. Unalgas first winter patrol was begun 30 January during a squall with hurricane force winds that iced the cutter over and threaten to sink her with the additional weight. After the starboard whaleboat was smashed by heavy seas and the <b>radio</b> <b>masts</b> snapped from the weight of ice, Captain Frederick Dodge made for the shelter of Yakutat Bay. The cutter was listing starboard at twenty degrees and the crew had to clear ice from the decks and machinery with axes and steam hoses. The crew of Unalga spent the next week repairing damage to the cutter while the surgeon treated the ills of inhabitants of Yakutat and gave the resident missionary a short course in medicine. Each time the cutter would leave the shelter of the bay another gale would appear, but Dodge took care to seek shelter before the cutter was as severely iced as the first time. Unalga was recalled to Seattle on 6 March after steaming 3000 miles, boarding 342 vessels, having given medical aid to 19 individuals of whom three were fishermen.|$|E

50|$|The tallest mast {{radiator}} {{ever built}} was the Warsaw <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> at Konstantynow, Poland. The antenna was 648.38 m high but collapsed in 1991. Currently the masts of the Lualualei VLF transmitter, at 458.11 m, are the tallest mast radiators insulated against ground. In {{contrast to the}} Warsaw <b>Radio</b> <b>Mast,</b> the Lualualei antenna uses extensive electrical lengthening measures. The tallest mast radiator not using electrical lengthening may be the Hellissandur longwave <b>radio</b> <b>mast</b> at 411.48 m high.|$|R

500|$|Portishead was {{previously}} the telephone control centre used by British Telecom (BT) for non-direct dialled calls to maritime vessels, a service known as [...] "Portishead Radio". This {{has now been}} largely replaced by INMARSAT, which permits directly dialled calls made from any BT landline in the UK. The radio station had separate transmitting and receiving stations. They were constructed by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company and operated by the General Post Office (GPO). By 1936, the station had a staff of 60 radio officers who handled over 3 million words of radio traffic per year. Following the privatisation of the GPO's telephone network in 1981, the station was operated by British Telecommunications PLC (now known as BT Group PLC). The main transmitting station, which was remotely operated, originally consisted of a large array of <b>radio</b> <b>masts</b> at nearby Portishead Downs but {{was replaced by a}} single radio mast at Clevedon. It was used until the 1970s. The receiving station's control centre and <b>radio</b> <b>masts</b> were located at Highbridge, near Burnham-on-Sea.|$|E
500|$|The first {{production}} {{version was}} the Ju 87 B-1, with a considerably larger engine, its Junkers Jumo 211D generating 1,200PS (...) , and completely redesigned fuselage and landing gear, replacing the twin <b>radio</b> <b>masts</b> of the [...] "A" [...] version {{with a single}} mast mounted further forward on the [...] "greenhouse" [...] canopy, and much simpler, lighter-weight wheel [...] "spats" [...] used from the -B version onwards, discarding the transverse strut bracing of the [...] "A" [...] version's maingear design. This new design was again tested in Spain, and after proving its abilities there, production was ramped up to 60 per month. As a result, by the outbreak of World War II, the Luftwaffe had 336 Ju 87 B-1s on hand.|$|E

500|$|In July 1922, Argus was {{inclined}} to evaluate her stability {{in light of the}} additional weights that had been added since her completion and it was discovered that her metacentric height had been reduced by [...] The Director of Naval Construction proposed to fit her with a girdle at her waterline to increase her beam and thus her stability. He intended to do this under the 1923–1924 Naval Programme, but this was delayed several times as the ship was needed for training and when she was finally modified it was under the 1925–1926 Naval Programme. Girdling increased her deep displacement to [...] and her beam to , and reduced her draught to [...] and her speed by a quarter of a knot. The ship was also fitted with bulk petrol storage, new four-inch guns that used fixed ammunition, and new <b>radio</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|E
500|$|The second {{prototype}} had a redesigned single vertical stabiliser and a 610PS (...) Junkers Jumo 210 A engine installed, {{and later}} the Jumo 210 Da.

To ease the difficulty of mass production, {{the leading edge of the}} wing was straightened out and the ailerons' two aerofoil sections had smooth leading and trailing edges. The pilot could adjust the elevator and rudder trim tabs in flight, and the tail was connected to the landing flaps, which were positioned in two parts between the ailerons and fuselage. The A-0 also had a flatter engine cowling, which gave the pilot a much better field of vision. In order for the engine cowling to be flattened, the engine was set down nearly [...] The fuselage was also lowered along with the gunner's position, allowing the gunner a better field of fire.|$|E

The British and Cypriot governments jointly commissioned health research from the University of Bristol and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Cyprus, and that research project reported in 2005 that there was no evidence of health problems being caused by electromagnetic fields from the antennas.
