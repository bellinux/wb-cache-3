40|$|Digital VLSI IC {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} margins {{continue to increase}} in light of process variability, circuit reliability and wide operating conditions. In spite of the enhancements from the manufacturing and design sides, there are still substantial margins in terms of manufacturing yield, circuit area and power, and design turn-around-time due to the conservatisms {{in the design and}} manufacturing flows. These margins are extremely costly when the benefits from developing the next technology node are only approximately 20 % in circuit performance, power and density. To reduce the margins, accurate modeling and assessment of the impacts of variability and reliability are essential. Meanwhile, innovative manufacturing and design techniques must be developed based on comprehensive understanding of the benefits and costs of such new measures. This thesis presents techniques to mitigate variability and <b>reliability</b> <b>margins</b> which can be grouped into three main thrusts : (1) design for manufacturability and reliability, (2) signoff condition optimization, and (3) design-aware manufacturing optimization. In the design for manufacturability and variability thrust, this thesis presents two performance sensor designs for adaptive voltage scaling, which can be used to mitigate the impact of process variations. To reduce the <b>reliability</b> <b>margins</b> for time-dependent dielectric breakdown, this thesis presents a layout optimization technique and a design- dependent reliability analysis framework. In the signoff condition optimization thrust, this thesis presents analyses on the design overheads due to suboptimal signoff conditions in (i) circuit operating voltage and performance, (ii) circuit aging timing model, and (iii) wire parasitic resistance and capacitance models.
