He was a major benefactor of Keble College, Oxford, and dedicated the later {{part of his life}} to philanthropic works. Also being teetotal, he added to the estate's holding by buying the local Failand Inn, which enabled him to control any <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour</b> (it was sold to Courage Brewery in 1962 by the second Lord Wraxall). William Gibbs died in the house on 3 April 1875. After a service at the estate chapel on 9 April, 30 estate workers carried his coffin to All Saints Church, Wraxall. He is buried within the family plot in the church grounds.|$|E

25|$|A full {{replay of}} the state final at a neutral venue (namely York Park in Launceston) was a {{potential}} solution, and each club was approached for its opinion. Wynyard was in favour of a replay match; on 2 October, they were quoted as being satisfied with a game at a neutral venue, but with a different umpire, suggesting a high calibre umpire be brought from Victoria to officiate; the following day, Wynyard instead {{said it would be}} happy for Pilgrim to umpire any replay, but that the game should again be played in Burnie. North Hobart, on the other hand, was opposed to playing a replay, stating that the club had fulfilled its obligations to the league for the season, and that to replay the game would vindicate the <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the north-western crowd.|$|E
50|$|Breach of {{the peace}} can include, but is not limited to, any <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviours</b> (which {{includes}} 'rowdiness' or 'brawling') and any disorderly behaviour. This behaviour doesn't have to be noisy but still of a nature that would cause concern to other people. Examples include 'Peeping Tom'-type behaviour, persistently following someone, delivering 'threatening' letters and 'streaking' or 'mooning'.|$|R
50|$|The Crimes Act 1891 {{included}} specific prohibitions under PART II.—Suppression of Prostitution Procurement (ss 14-17) or detention (ss 18-21) {{of women}} either through inducements or violence {{to work as}} prostitutes was prohibited, with particular reference to underage girls. The Police Offences Act 1891 separated <b>riotous</b> and indecent <b>behaviour</b> from prostitution, making it a specific offence for a prostitute to 'importune' a person in public (s 7(2)).|$|R
50|$|Laws against {{prostitution}} existed {{from the}} founding of the State in 1851. The Vagrant Act 1852 included prostitution as <b>riotous</b> and indecent <b>behaviour</b> carrying a penalty of imprisonment for up to 12 months with the possibility of hard labour (Part II, s 3). The Conservation of Public Health Act 1878 required detention and medical examination of women suspected of being prostitutes, corresponding to the Contagious Diseases Acts {{in other parts of the}} British Empire. This Act was not repealed till 1916, but was relatively ineffective either in controlling venereal diseases or prostitution.|$|R
500|$|As {{the banking}} career {{was not working}} out – and as {{trainees}} were (after a period with a relaxed regime) again required to sit an exam, for which Bellman was ill equipped – he took a break in 1758, going {{to the university of}} Uppsala, where Linnaeus was professor of botany. The idea of attending lectures was no more congenial than banking, and he stayed only one term; one of his songs (FS 28) records that [...] "He contemplated Uppsala—the beer stung his mouth—love distracted his wits..." [...] However, he met young men (such as Carl Bonde) from wealthy and noble families, went drinking with them, and started to entertain them with his songs. Bellman returned to the bank job, and seems quickly to have fallen into financial difficulty: [...] "a jungle of debts, sureties and bondsmen began to proliferate around him." [...] The character of bailiff Blomberg appears in his songs (e.g. FS 14), constantly trying to track down debtors and seize all their property. The law allowed the bankrupt only one way to escape from debtors' prison: to leave Sweden. In 1763, Bellman ran away to Norway. From the safety of Halden (then called Fredrikshald) he writes to the Council applying first for a passport, and then for a safe-conduct, both of which were granted. Meanwhile, his father had first mortgaged the Lilla Daurerska house, and then sold it: the family's finances were no better than his own. Even worse, by April 1764 the Bank had become tired of the <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour</b> of its young men: its investigations showed that Bellman had been the ringleader, leading them (the Bank wrote) into [...] "gambling, masquerades, picnics and suchlike". Bellman resigned, his safe banking career at an end.|$|E
2500|$|Gambling {{has always}} had its unsavoury side and {{eventually}} the Artillery Ground became a place of ill-repute. The club members became uneasy about associating with {{a place that was}} widely known for licentious and, occasionally, <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour,</b> even though it showcased cricket of the highest class. Cricket was severely impacted by the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763 and the number of matches played greatly reduced. There are signs of the game returning to its rural roots during this period and evidently the aristocrats were happy with that development. Apart from four matches in the 1769 English cricket season, there are few mentions of London as a team {{in the aftermath of the}} Seven Years' War and many of the references suggest that these teams were in fact occasional [...] "London XIs" [...] rather than representing an organised London club.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was sworn}} in by Billy McMillen, and {{described}} joining as [...] "a big occasion, like joining the priesthood". In 1968 {{he was arrested for}} the first time, after he assaulted a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) during a civil rights march in Derry. During the August 1969 riots in Belfast he was {{one of a handful of}} IRA members who tried to defend Catholic areas from attacks by Ulster loyalists, and resigned as a result of the organisation's failure to adequately protect Catholic areas. Meehan was arrested on 22 August 1969 for <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and was badly beaten before being imprisoned. The beating was so severe Meehan was given the last rites, the first of four occasions on which he received last rites. He was released after spending two months in prison. After his release Billy McKee convinced Meehan to rejoin the IRA. Meehan sided with the Provisional IRA following its split with the Official IRA in January 1970, and by mid-1970 was a senior IRA leader in the Ardoyne area. On 27 June 1970 rioting broke out across Belfast following a parade by the Orange Order, and a gun battle started in the Ardoyne area. Meehan stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Sectarianism {{became a}} serious problem in the twentieth century. In the interwar period {{religious}} and ethnic tensions between Protestants and Catholics were exacerbated by economic depression. The Orange Order was still dominated by Irish Protestants and became a focus for Anti-Catholic feeling. It appealed strongly to working class Protestants and organised parades and carnivalesque commemorations of the Battle of the Boyne that veered into <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Tensions were heightened by {{the leaders of the}} Free Church and Church of Scotland and later the reunified church, who orchestrated a racist campaign against the Catholic Irish in Scotland. Key figures leading the campaign were George Malcolm Thomson and Andrew Dewar Gibb. This focused on the threat to the [...] "Scottish race" [...] based on spurious statistics that continued to have influence despite being discredited by official figures in the early 1930s. This created a climate of intolerance that led to calls for jobs to be preserved for Protestants. After the Second World War the Church became increasingly liberal in attitude and moved away from hostile attitudes. Sectarian attitudes continued to manifest themselves in football rivalries between Protestant and Catholic supporters. This was most marked in Glasgow in the traditionally Roman Catholic team, Celtic, and the traditionally Protestant team, Rangers. Celtic employed Protestant players and managers, but Rangers have had a tradition of not recruiting Catholics. Major watersheds were Rangers signing of the Catholic player Mo Johnston (b. 1963) in 1989, and in 1999 the appointment of their first Catholic captain, Lorenzo Amoruso.|$|E

Drunken Maoris would indulge in insolent and <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the street; for no native could be imprisoned without the risk of war, and with the colonists {{scattered}} about {{all over the country}} the risk was too great to be run. In addition to the want of any rule or authority to regulate the dealings of the natives with the English, there were constant troubles between the native tribes.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes {{the older}} people in that {{miscellaneous}} camp emulated the children in <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Of course, in such an assemblage there were bad as well as good people, {{and some of the}} former, taking advantage of the unprotected state of things, went about the camp pilfering where opportunity offered. One of these was at last caught in the act, and the exasperated people at once proceeded to execute summary justice. The thief was a big, strong, sulky-looking fellow. He was well known as an incorrigible idler, who much preferred to live on the labours of other men than to work. The captor was Baptiste Warder, the half-breed chief who had acted so conspicuous a part in the buffalo hunt of the previous season.|$|E
6000|$|A gentleman, {{with whom}} I am {{slightly}} acquainted, {{lost in the}} Argyle Rooms several thousand pounds at Backgammon.[A] It is but justice to the manager in this instance to say, that some degree of disapprobation was manifested: but why are the implements of gaming allowed in a place devoted to the society of both sexes? A pleasant thing for the wives and daughters {{of those who are}} blessed or cursed with such connections, to hear the Billiard-Balls rattling in one room, and the dice in another! That this is the case I myself can testify, as a late unworthy member of an Institution which materially affects the morals of the higher orders, while the lower may not even move to the sound of a tabor and fiddle, without a chance of indictment for <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour.</b> [The Argyle Institution, founded by Colonel Greville, flourished many years before the Argyll Rooms were built by Nash in 1818. This mention of Greville's name caused him to demand an explanation from Byron, but the matter was amicably settled by Moore and G. F. Leckie, who acted on behalf of the disputants (see 'Life', pp. 160, 161).]] ...|$|E

So did {{everybody else in the}} little island capital; for neither the beach nor Lavina's boarding house had been so scandalized in years. In midday, bareheaded, clad only in swimming trunks, Aloysius Pankburn ran down the main street from Lavina's to the water front. He put on the gloves with a fireman from the Berthe in a scheduled four-round bout at the Folies Bergères, and was knocked out in the second round. He tried insanely to drown himself in a two-foot pool of water, dived drunkenly and splendidly from fifty feet up in the rigging of the Mariposa lying at the wharf, and chartered the cutter Toerau at more than her purchase price and was only saved by his manager's refusal financially to ratify the agreement. He bought out the old blind leper at the market, and sold breadfruit, plantains, and sweet potatoes at such cut-rates that the gendarmes were called out to break the rush of bargain-hunting natives. For that matter, three times the gendarmes arrested him for <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and three times his manager ceased from love-making long enough to pay the fines imposed by a needy colonial administration.|$|E

He was discharged on three out of four of these first offences, and received probation for the other. He served in the British Merchant Navy towards the end of World War I. On his return to Belfast his criminal career expanded, being charged with assault, <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour</b> and robbery by 1921.|$|E

The fair attracted people from Horwich, Chorley and further afield. During the 1830s an increase in drunken and <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour</b> following the fair brought prompt and stern measures from the local authorities. Two men from Bolton were charged with [...] "Neglect of Divine Service". The arrival of the Manchester and Bolton Railway's extension to Preston and the opening of Blackrod railway station in 1841 brought more visitors which was sustained until the introduction of seaside excursions in about 1860 resulted in a decline in visitors.|$|E
50|$|After {{the war he}} aligned {{himself with}} George Clinton and the anti-federalist party. He and several {{other members of the}} Sons of Liberty were elected to the State Assembly in December 1783. He was Sheriff of New York County, New York from 1784 to 1787 and from 1791 to 1795. He was now in charge of {{repressing}} the <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour</b> he formerly committed. In 1787, he took part in the putting down of Shays' Rebellion. In 1788, he helped George Clinton in his fight against the United States Constitution. Willett was a delegate from New York City to the state convention where he and other anti-federalist were defeated.

On 13 November 1642, the Battle of Turnham Green was fought nearby during the First English Civil War resulting in the Parliamentarians blocking the King's advance on London. In 1680 the homicidal Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke murdered a watchman, William Smeeth, after a drunken evening in the local tavern. A similar but far less serious episode in the tavern in 1795 saw the young Daniel O'Connell arrested for drunken and <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The artist William Hogarth had a 'Country cottage' nearby on what is now known as Hogarth Roundabout.

As their intentions were ultimately peaceful and unrelated to the cause of inciting riot, the court found their actions to be within the limits of the law. That it was known that their marching may cause riots was not found to be a breach of the law, as it was the actions of antagonistic parties including the Skeleton Army which led directly to the <b>riotous</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The convictions against Beatty and the two other Salvationists were later quashed by the Queen's Court and costs were awarded against the sentencing magistrates.The action was reported by The Times; at the appeal hearing it was stated that the Skeleton Army was founded in Weston-super-Mare.|$|E
