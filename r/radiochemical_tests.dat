With this, it is of vital importance {{to be familiar with}} the technical significance of the secondary application of steel slag, because some steel slag might contain increased concentration of substances harmful to human health. In terms of steel slag impact on the environment, radionuclides are the least researched of all pollutants emitted from the metallurgical processes. This paper presents the results of <b>radiochemical</b> <b>testing</b> of steel slag and steel slag aggregates for the purpose of its use in the production of construction material. Obtained results of measurements show that 40 K, 226 Ra and 232 Th in all examined steel slag samples have the activity concentration from 45. 3 to 62. 9 Bqkg− 1, 15. 2 to 21. 4 Bqkg− 1 and 12. 9 to 15. 4 Bqkg− 1, respectively. Results of measurements of radionuclide activity concentrations of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K in slag aggregates show similar values for all radionuclides ranges as follows: 40 K from 14. 1 to 23. 3 Bqkg− 1; 232 Th from 8. 6 to 14. 4 Bqkg− 1 and 226 Ra from 14. 8 to 26. 8 Bqkg− 1. Activities index (I 1, I 2, I 3) of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K were compared with values recommended by Croatian legislation. Radium equivalent concentrations (Raeq) of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K for examined steel slag and steel slag aggregates are harmounious with the results presented by other authors for the same by-product. The testing has been conducted on steel slag created during the production of carbon steel by electric arc furnace in Steel Mill of CMC Sisak, Croatia...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of FY 1995 technical studies conducted by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) as part of the Hydrology and Radionuclide Migration Program (HRMP), a multi-agency program sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office (DOE/NV), to address the environmental consequences of nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). A priority is to better characterize the complex near-field environment in order to assess and predict the movement of radionuclides in groundwater. Other participating organizations include the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Desert Research Institute (DRI) of the University of Nevada. A radiologic source term in excess of 10 {sup 8 } curies of tritium, fission products, activation products and actinides is residual from more than three decades of underground nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). Burial depths to insure containment of these explosions necessitated firing approximately one third of the more than 800 underground nuclear tests within one cavity radius or below the static water table. Work at LLNL has focused on studies of radionuclide transport under saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated conditions as well as investigations of the stable, radiogenic and cosmogenic isotope systematics of NTS groundwaters. LLNL has prioritized these studies because of the significance for potential radionuclide migration at the Nevada Test Site. LLNL utilizes expertise in nuclear weapons <b>testing,</b> <b>radiochemical</b> diagnostics, nuclear <b>test</b> phenomenology, mass spectrometry, aqueous geochemistry and field and laboratory studies of radionuclide migration to bring a unique measurement and interpretative capability to this research...|$|R

Three batches of kits labelled as B 1, B 2 and B 3 were produced by freeze drying technique. The commercial products such as sestamibi Cardiolite, Polatom, ChiMIBI and tetrofosmin Myoview were used in this study. The quality control testing which included microbiology <b>testing,</b> <b>radiochemical</b> and animal biodistribution study were conducted accordingly. The NM sestamibi kits passed the sterility and pirogen <b>test.</b> The <b>Radiochemical</b> Purity <b>testing</b> (RCP) was assessed by the Instant Thin Layer Chromatography (ITLC) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) methods after the reconstitution of the Tc 99 m-sestamibi. The RCP results were above 90 % and the kits were stable for 52 weeks. The animal biodistribution {{studies were carried out}} on Sprague-Dawley rats at 5, 30, 60, 120 and 1440 minutes post injection time intervals. The percentage injected dose per gram organ in heart for Tc 99 m-B 1 were 4. 722 ± 0. 343 %, 3. 752 ± 0. 438 %, 4. 564 ± 0. 664 %, 4. 180 ± 1. 293 % and 1. 090 ± 0. 230 % at 5, 30, 60, 120 and 1440 minutes respectively.

40|$|Quick {{methods are}} {{functional}} in clinical practice {{to ensure the}} fastest availability of radiopharmaceuticals. For this purpose, we investigated the radiochemical purity of the widely used 99 mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate, 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime, and 99 mTc-tetrofosmin by reducing time {{as compared with the}} manufacturer's method. Methods: We applied a miniaturized chromatographic method with a reduced strip development from 18 cm to 9 cm for all 3 radiopharmaceuticals. The specific support medium and solvent system of the manufacturer's methods was kept unchanged for 99 mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate and 99 mTc-tetrofosmin, whereas for 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime the instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) polysilicic gel (silicic acid [SA]) was replaced with a monosilicic gel (silicic gel [SG]) in the chromatographic system that uses methyl ethyl ketone as solvent. The method was applied and compared with the routine ITLC insert method in a total of 30 batches for each radiopharmaceutical. The precision of repeated tests was determined by comparison with the results of 10 replications on the same batch. Small volumes of concentrated 99 mTcO 4 -, and 99 mTc-albumin nanocolloid were used to produce potential radiochemical impurities. Correlation between the quick methods and the insert methods was analyzed using a nonparametric 2 -tailed test and a 2 Â· 2 contingency table with the associated Fisher exact test to evaluate sensitivity and specificity. A receiver-operating-characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the best cutoff. Results: The percentage radiochemical purity of the quick methods agreed with the standard chromatography procedures. We found that 99 mTcO 4 and colloidal impurities are not the only common radiochemical impurities with 99 mTc-tetrofosmin, and shortening of the ITLC strip with respect to the manufacturer's method will worsen system resolution and may produce inaccuracy. Conclusion: The miniaturized methods we described represent a fast and reliable alternative for 99 mTc-exametazime and 99 mTc-oxidronate quality control, with the upper cutoff for acceptable radiochemical purity values being 84 % and 95 %, respectively. For 99 mTc-tetrofosmin <b>radiochemical</b> purity <b>testing,</b> a longer strip as described in the standard method is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Extracellular purines (adenosine, ADP, and ATP) and pyrimidines (UDP and UTP) mediate diverse {{biological}} effects via {{two main}} families of purine receptors: P 1 and P 2 receptors. Adenosine/P 1 receptors have been further subdivided, according to convergent molecular, biochemical, and pharmacological evidences into four subtypes, A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B, and A 3, all coupled to G proteins. Based on differences in molecular structure and signal transduction mechanisms, P 2 receptors divide naturally into two families of ligand-gated ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors termed P 2 X and P 2 Y receptors, respectively; to date, seven mammalian P 2 X receptors (P 2 X 1 – 7) {{and at least}} eight mammalian P 2 Y receptors (P 2 Y 1, P 2 Y 2, P 2 Y 4, P 2 Y 6, P 2 Y 11, P 2 Y 12, P 2 Y 13, P 2 Y 14) have been cloned, characterized, and accepted as valid members of the P 2 receptor family. Extracellular purines and pyrimidines have important and diverse effects on many biological processes including smooth muscle contraction, neurotransmission, exocrine and endocrine secretion, immune response, inflammation, platelet aggregation, pain, and modulation of cardiac function. Additional studies have shown the role of purines in emergency situations, such as cerebral and myocardial infarct, epileptic seizures, and infections where these molecules serve as danger signals family. During the last decade, PET has become a valuable tool {{in the development of}} new drugs. Non‐invasive imaging using PET would allow studying biological targets in both healthy and diseased condition. Furthermore, it would be very useful in the drug development process since it gives direct insight in the relation between receptor occupancy and the dose of the candidate antagonist, allowing to validate or invalidate a new drug candidate at an early stage, thereby saving a lot of effort and money, making the drug development process more efficient. In this view, we planned the synthesis of new PET radiotracers towards purinergic system, focusing our attention against A 2 B and P 2 X 7 receptor subtypes. A 2 B adenosine receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor and it activates the cAMP-dependent pathway, by activating adenylyl cyclase through action of the Gs alpha subunit, and the phosphatidylinositol pathway, by activating phospholipase C through Gq subunit. It determines an enhancement in intracellular level of calcium, activation of IL 6 pathway and NO synthesis. Due to its involvement in several physiopathological conditions, including angiogenesis induction, myocardial ischemia, kidney and lung injury, tumors, glucose metabolism, and osteoblast differentiation, A 2 B AR represents a valuable therapeutic and diagnostic target for different diseases, such as diabetes, tumours, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary fibrosis and others. Anyway, the limited availability of potent and selective ligands has prevented an inner characterization of the receptor for years. We have recently studied the class of 3 -aryl[1, 2, 4]triazino[4, 3 -a]benzimidazol- 4 (10 H) -ones in search for A 2 B AR ligands with high affinity and selectivity. Actually, a number of new derivatives was disclosed that resulted completely inactive and moderately active at A 3 and A 1 ARs, respectively, whereas showed a A 2 B AR/A 2 A AR selectivity degree strictly dependent on the aryl group (Ar) at the 3 -position of the central core. On the basis on these results, we investigated the aryltriazinobenzimidazole scaffold, in order to develop PET radiotracers as useful tools to deeper study and characterize A 2 B ARs. In collaboration with Dr. Menichetti and his collaborators of CNR, Pisa, our designed compound was synthesized in high <b>radiochemical</b> yield and <b>tested</b> by PET to evaluate its pharmacokinetics in vivo, and to ascertain its potential use for A 2 B AR imaging. The molecule showed a very high chemical stability in saline and in plasma, and a good pharmacokinetic profile. Results of in vivo and ex vivo studies, mRNA and RT-PCR are in agreement, and showed the ability of this molecule to bind the A 2 B AR. Although further studies are required to better characterize this probe, our compound may represent a good lead compound for the development of new A 2 B AR radiotracers with improved selectivity and potency of binding. These results have been published on Nuclear Medicine and Biology, 43 (2016) 309 – 317. During my PhD, I spent a research period in the Molecular Imaging Branch Laboratory, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA with Dr. V. W. Pike and Dr. M. Haskali. This visit was part of an ongoing collaboration between University of Pisa and MIB, aimed at developing new radiotracers for imaging brain P 2 X 7 receptor in neuroinflammatory conditions with positron emission tomography (PET). The P 2 X 7 receptor (P 2 X 7 R) has an important role in inflammation and immunity, since its stimulation by endogenous level of ATP is correlated to the pro-inflammatory cascade culminating in activation of Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), an inflammatory cytokine. More specifically, P 2 X 7 R is a ionotropic receptor activated that require extracellular concentrations of ATP in the range of 1 mM, in contrast to concentrations of ≤ 100 μM needed to activate other P 2 receptors. The ATP molecule binds to and activates P 2 X 7, resulting in pore formation. This leads to K+ efflux from the cell, which is a crucial step in inflammasome assembly. Prolonged activation of the P 2 X 7 R results in irreversible pore formation and allows the non-selective passage of ions and hydrophilic solutes of up to 900 Da; this can result in colloido-osmotic lysis and cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. Pore formation is also thought to allow entry of bacterial products and extracellular ATP into the cell, which drives inflammasome formation. P 2 X 7 R is also involved in neuroinflammation since it affects microglial cells, which are the primary immune cells of the CNS. Microglia play an important part in the immune system of the CNS by acting as scavenger cells. Activation of P 2 X 7 R by ATP in microglial cells results in the release of autolysosomes into the extracellular space, providing a mechanism for the clearance of intracellular pathogens. P 2 X 7 R also plays a role in the generation of superoxide in microglia. Thus, P 2 X 7 R has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions through ATP-mediated cortical cell death and superoxide release. As far as we know, the only molecule for this purpose reported in literature being able to cross the BBB in rats and showing good results both in rats and monkeys is 11 C‐JNJ‐ 54173717. In developing a new PET radiotracer, we chose a molecule already patented as antagonist which shown an IC 50 value of 2 nM and a pIC 50 value of 8. 64 M. The product was obtained and characterized but due to technical issues we weren’t able to perform the last radiosynthtetic step and the project is still ongoing. In parallel to these diagnostic applications, I focused my attention on design and synthesis of novel anticancer compounds. Cancer is an increasing worldwide emergency and its incidence and mortality will double in the next twenty years, so it seems to be clear that we need new and more effective pharmacological therapies. Our attention was focused on DNA Topoisomerases: a class of enzymes that are responsible for solving complex topological problems of the DNA. They prevent excessive supercoils which may cause functional and structural alteration in cells. The mechanism of action consists in catalyzing the break of DNA's phosphodiester skeleton through the formation of a transient cleavage complex with the nucleic acid. Topoisomerase I catalyzes a single-stranded break, while Topoisomerase II a double-stranded one. After the cut, these enzymes catalyze the reanniling of segments. The formation of cleavage complex is due to the presence of a tyrosine residue conserved in all classes of topoisomerases and this intermediate represents the target of inhibitors. Firstly, we started with the development of non-CPT derivatives against Topo I. Today there are two drugs approved for therapy, Topotecan and Irinotecan, which are Campthotecin derivatives. Campthotecin is a cytotoxic quinoline alkaloid which is extracted from the bark and stem of Camptotheca acuminata with remarkable anticancer activity but also low solubility and high reverse drug reaction. The new derivatives have partly solved these negative effects, but they maintained the lactonic ring responsible for chemical instability and part of the toxicity. So, research has moved towards design and synthesis of new classes of non-CPT derivatives like indolocarbazoles, phenanthridines and indenoisoquinolines. Recently our research group published a new series of compounds based on phenylpyrazoloquinazoline structure, which mimics the central core of phenanthridines and indenoisoquinolines. From biological assays, four structures demonstrated the best activity against Topoisomerase I. They have been subjected to docking studies performed by the research team of Professor Novellino from University of Naples in order to rationalize the obtained results. Based on these structures we design a new series of potential Topo I inhibitors featuring a new scaffold, in which the pendant phenyl of phenylpyrazoloquinazolines is fused with the other rings to constitute an indazoloquinazoline core. At position 5 a dialkylaminoalkyl chain is present with an NH- or O-linker. Preliminary results on N-linked compounds showed that they are inactive against Topo I, while O-linked compounds are still under biological evaluation at Professor Pommier’s laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, National Institute of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD (USA). Considering its crucial role in such important processes Topo II enzyme has been widely exploited for cancer|$|R
