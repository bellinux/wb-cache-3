The 2001 ASP Men's World Tour was <b>restricted</b> to five <b>contests</b> and the 2001 ASP Women's World Tour was <b>restricted</b> to three <b>contests,</b> due to the tragic events of September 11, 2001.|$|R

25|$|Following {{the failure}} of 1895, this {{leadership}} became reluctant to overextend the party by running in too many electoral races. By 1898 the decision was formally made to <b>restrict</b> electoral <b>contests</b> to those where a reasonable performance could be expected rather than putting forward as many candidates as possible to maximise exposure for the party and to accumulate a maximum total vote.|$|R

50|$|The {{highlight}} of the Manila Carnival is the crowning of the Carnival Queen by the Carnival mascot Billiken. Cameron Forbes and the carnival promoters established the Carnival Queen contest. The Queen will be selected through purchase of ballots through newspaper clippings. Initially, Forbes decided to <b>restrict</b> the <b>contest</b> to {{the daughters of the}} wealthiest families from the capital city of Manila but eventually accepted entries from different parts of the country. The Queen was voted through a system of money ballots or magazine coupons. Philippine magazines like Liwayway, Telembang and Lipang Kalabaw had such coupons inserted in their pages.|$|R
2500|$|All {{contests}} use {{one or more}} amateur radio bands {{on which}} competing stations may make two-way contacts. [...] HF contests use {{one or more of}} the 160 meter, 80 Meter, 40 Meter, 20 Meter, 15 Meter, and 10 Meter bands. [...] VHF contests use all the amateur radio bands above 50 MHz. [...] Some contests permit activity on all HF or all VHF bands, and may offer points for contacts and multipliers on each band. [...] Other contests may permit activity on all bands but restrict stations to making only one contact with each other station, regardless of band, or may limit multipliers to once per contest instead of once per band. [...] Most VHF contests in North America are similar to the ARRL June VHF QSO Party, and allow contacts on all the amateur radio bands 50MHz or higher in frequency. [...] Most VHF contests in the United Kingdom, however, are restricted to one amateur radio band at a time. [...] An HF contest with worldwide participation that <b>restricts</b> all <b>contest</b> activity to just one band is the ARRL 10 Meter Contest.|$|R

5000|$|Some <b>contests</b> <b>restrict</b> {{participation}} to {{stations in}} a particular geographic area, such as a continent or country. Contests like the European HF Championship aim to foster competition between stations located in one particular part of the world, specifically Europe. There are contests in which any amateur radio station worldwide may participate and make contact with any other stations for contest credit. The CQ World Wide DX Contest permits stations to contact other stations anywhere else on the planet, and attracts {{tens of thousands of}} participating stations each year. [...] In large contests the number of people taking part is a significant percentage of radio amateurs active on the HF bands, although they in themselves are {{a small percentage of the}} total amateurs in the world.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the switch}} to Amp, the station began {{attracting}} controversy {{for a number of}} unconventional on-air promotions. In June 2011, CKMP held a contest known as Breast Summer Ever—in which the station would give away a breast implant, valued at $10,000. Entrants submitted a photo of themselves and explained why they wanted the implant; a shortlist of 10 entries were chosen by judges, and the winner was decided by an online poll. The contest was met with mixed reaction; the station's program manager Kris Mazurak stated that the contest had received a positive reaction, given that [...] "somebody out there that wants that prize", while a critic believed that the promotion could have a positive response if the prize were to go to someone in legitimate need of a breast implant, such as a woman suffering from breast cancer. However, the station also received criticism for the promotion, particularly from those who felt that it was sexist and promoted the objectification of women (even though the station did not specifically <b>restrict</b> the <b>contest</b> to females), and the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council received two complaints about the contest upon its introduction. After receiving 76% of 30,000 votes, the implant was awarded to a trans woman who had been affected by the provincial government's decision to drop funding for gender reassignment operations as part of budget cuts.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe analyze a group {{contest in}} which n groups compete {{to win a}} group-specific public good prize. Group sizes can be {{different}} and any player may value the prize differently within and across groups. Players exert costly efforts simultaneously and independently. Only the highest effort (the best-shot) within each group represents the group effort that determines the winning group. We fully characterize the set of equilibria and show that in any equilibrium at most one player in each group exerts strictly positive effort. There always exists an equilibrium in which only the highest value player in each active group exerts strictly positive effort. However, perverse equilibria may exist in which the highest value players completely free-ride on others by exerting no effort. We provide conditions under which the set of equilibria can be <b>restricted</b> and discuss <b>contest</b> design implications...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{understandings}} of war have {{been dominated by}} the thought of Clausewitz for a number of decades. His thought is valid in many respects, but for various reasons it is open to misinterpretation and misunderstanding; furthermore, a number of his observations (particularly on the prevalence of chance and uncertainty in war) are not fully explored and substantiated theoretically. This thesis is an attempt to present and elucidate a new theoretical understanding of war’s nature which complements Clausewitz’s theories and addresses these concerns: this is the understanding of war as a form of violent conflict which is not bound by rules. The thesis consists of five main chapters. The first is an in-depth study of Clausewitz, which will provide an exegesis of his theories and highlight the deficiencies in his thought, before positing how understanding war as ‘violent conflict without rules’ could be used to address and explain them. The second chapter is a study of the theory of rules, examining in particular the role they play in moderating conflict: we can find that amongst other things, rules lend predictability and psychological security to a <b>contest,</b> <b>restrict</b> the scope of physical harm and tend to preserve the political and social status quo. As war lacks rules (in the sense that there are no ‘rules of war’ as there are ‘rules of chess’), it therefore lacks these benefits. A following chapter on the laws and customs of war will address cases where war appears to be bound by rules, and clarify my position. The final two chapters explore the implications of war’s lack of rules with reference to two areas which are most commonly associated with war. The fourth chapter on strategy will explore how this military concept is necessitated by war’s ruleless nature; the final chapter will examine the uniquely violent, physical nature of war through the same theoretical prism, and will show how the technological innovation associated with war is a consequence of its lack of regulation, and a potent contributor to the chance and uncertainty which plagues warfare...|$|R
