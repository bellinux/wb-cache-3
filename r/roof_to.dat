5|$|After its completion, Winslow Ames {{used the}} house as a rental {{property}} until 1949 {{when he went to}} work in a museum in Springfield, Missouri. The house was sold to Connecticut College. Connecticut College continued to rent it to staff and students until 2004, when plans were made to demolish the house. Changing the flat <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> a gable roof was a significant alteration from the original plan; the date of the alteration is unknown, but it preceded 1995.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower {{with a flat}} <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters to from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns finally arrived around 1536 {{in the form of}} wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to be raised in the mid-1530s about whether the Camber might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Excavated between 1992 and 1995, it {{is located}} {{underneath}} the western sector of the palace {{at a depth of}} almost 6 meters. The tomb is composed of two rooms opened on each other's with lime plaster floors. Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 meters long (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west-east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west-east oriented. Limestone was used to build the walls and few blocks protruding from the sides toward the middle of the rooms suggest the <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> have been a corbelled vault.|$|E
5|$|In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion {{in which}} Somerset people fought against James II. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and {{travelled}} north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, puritan soldiers damaged the west front of Wells Cathedral, tore {{lead from the}} <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and the furnishings, {{and for a time}} stabled their horses in the nave. They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil. The Bloody Assizes which followed saw the losers being sentenced to death or transportation.|$|E

5|$|Some {{minor works}} {{took place during}} the {{remainder}} of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided {{at the top of the}} north tower.|$|E

The soldiers damaged the Bishop's Palace and west front of Wells Cathedral, tearing lead from the <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> make bullets, breaking the windows, smashing the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabling their horses in the nave.|$|E
5|$|Two SEALs {{broke through}} the bedroom door. Bin Laden's wife Amal was {{on the edge of}} the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E

5|$|Another wooden palace, Tranovola ("Silver House"), {{was under}} {{construction}} {{at the same}} time as Bevato and is considered by historians to represent the first true hybrid of Creole and traditional Merina aristocratic architecture. Its innovations included a roof of wood shingles, a second storey, the addition of a veranda, glass windows, multiple interior rooms (as opposed to a single open interior space) and the use of curved shapes as design elements. Historic sources offer conflicting accounts of these two buildings. Some maintain that Bevato was relocated and remodelled to become Tranovola, while others maintain the buildings were separate but debate which of the two houses was the first two-storey building in the Rova (still other sources award this innovation to Marivolanitra). The design of Radama's tomb likewise embodies the hybrid style that was to influence and inspire not only the majority of the buildings built at the Rova in the 19th century, but ultimately architecture throughout the entire highland region of Madagascar—particularly in its use of equidistant pillars supporting the overhanging <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> create a veranda.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull <b>roof,</b> <b>to</b> form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|Himeji Castle is {{the largest}} and most visited castle in Japan, and it was {{registered}} in 1993 {{as one of the first}} UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. The area within the middle moat of the castle complex is a designated Special Historic Site and five structures of the castle are also designated National Treasures. Along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle, Himeji Castle is considered one of Japan's three premier castles. In order to preserve the castle buildings, it underwent restoration work for several years and reopened to the public on March 27, 2015. The works also removed decades of dirt and grime, restoring the formerly grey <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> its original brilliant white color.|$|E
