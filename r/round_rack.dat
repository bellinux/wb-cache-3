50|$|The Falcons, {{with the}} NFC's #2 seed, began their postseason run by {{defeating}} the third-seeded Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional <b>Round,</b> 36-20, <b>racking</b> up 422 yards. The next week, {{in the last}} NFL game ever played at the Georgia Dome, they defeated the fourth-seeded Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game, 44-21, racking up 493 yards.|$|R
60|$|The Captain's cabin of the Ruffling Harry {{was in a}} deck-house {{upon the}} poop, and a sternchaser gun was mounted {{at the back of}} it. <b>Round</b> shot were <b>racked</b> <b>round</b> the wall, and three great hogsheads of powder made a stand for dishes and for bottles. In this grim room the five pirates sang and roared and drank, while the silent steward still filled up their glasses, and passed the box and the candle round for their tobacco-pipes. Hour after hour the talk became fouler, the voices hoarser, the curses and shoutings more incoherent, until three of the five had closed their blood-shot eyes, and dropped their {{swimming}} heads upon the table.|$|R
50|$|In May, Bencic {{qualified}} for the main the draw at the Mutua Madrid Open, where she lost to World No. 1 Serena Williams in straight sets. The next week, she once again {{qualified for}} the main draw at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. In the opening <b>round,</b> she <b>racked</b> up another win over a top-25 player, Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. In the second round, she lost to 12th seed Flavia Pennetta in three sets. At the Nürnberger Versicherungscup, Bencic lost {{in the first round}} in straight sets to Mona Barthel.|$|R
60|$|I sat on {{the hill}} {{in a sort of}} despair. There was no town nearer than Chichester at which it was even {{remotely}} probable that there would be such a thing as an artist's colourman. And yet, without white, my absurd little pictures would be as pointless as the world would be if there were no good people in it. I stared stupidly <b>round,</b> <b>racking</b> my brain for expedients. Then I suddenly stood up and roared with laughter, again and again, so that the cows stared at me and called a committee. Imagine a man in the Sahara regretting that he had no sand for his hour-glass. Imagine a gentleman in mid-ocean wishing that he had brought some salt water with him for his chemical experiments. I was sitting on an immense warehouse of white chalk. The landscape was made entirely out of white chalk. White chalk was piled more miles until it met the sky. I stooped and broke a piece off the rock I sat on; it did not mark so well as the shop chalks do; but it gave the effect. And I stood there in a trance of pleasure, realising that this Southern England is not only a grand peninsula, and a tradition and a civilisation; it is something even more admirable. It is a piece of chalk.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, he lost to {{the more}} {{experienced}} Alonzo Martinez via submission from punches in the first <b>round.</b> Lowe <b>racked</b> up three wins before trying out for the ninth season of the Ultimate Fighter reality show. Lowe was selected {{as one of the}} contestants and brought in for the show. Before he could move in the TUF house, Lowe had to fight Santino DeFranco. After an impressive first round, which Dana White believed should not have gone to a second round because of the beating Lowe delivered to DeFranco, Lowe was defeated by submission early in the second round.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 Bartercard Cup {{kicked off}} on April 14 and despite now fielding a Premier League side the Lions were {{still able to}} {{dominate}} the Bartercard Cup. Unbeaten after eight <b>rounds</b> they <b>racked</b> up some big scores including thrashings of the Counties Manukau Jetz (62-0), Waicoa Bay Stallions (64-4), Central Falcons (84-0) and Northern Storm (70-8). They again won the minor premiership and after the major semi final against Harbour League went 117 minutes they won 44-40 and advanced to the Grand Final when they again accounted for Harbour League to win the last Bartercard Cup.|$|R
50|$|Weedman's {{professional}} career began in 2005. Making his {{debut in the}} HOOKnSHOOT promotion, Weedman finished his first fight with a draw after two <b>rounds.</b> Weedman later <b>racked</b> up two successive victories in the promotion before meeting future UFC veteran Gray Maynard. Weedman lost via unanimous decision, which gave Maynard his entry onto The Ultimate Fighter 5.|$|R
50|$|Kovács {{began his}} {{professional}} career coached by former top class amateur East German trainer Fritz Sdunek in late 1997, amidst great media hype in Hungary, {{with one of}} the newly founded nationwide TV channels buying the exclusive rights to broadcast his bouts. In his first fight he knocked out Frenchman Ahmed Lain in the first <b>round</b> and <b>racked</b> up a 10-0 record within little more than one year. In his ninth bout he defeated former EBU champion Vincenzo Belcastro and in 1999 he gained the WBC featherweight intercontinental belt by defeating Nabaloum Dramane in Budapest. Due to his technical skills, fast foot- and handspeed and spectacular fighting style he was often compared to fellow 1996 Olympian Floyd Mayweather Jr. who started his long-lasting reign in the super-featherweight division at that time, and he was considered as the future challenger of the unbeaten WBO featherweight champion Naseem Hamed.|$|R
5000|$|After {{missing out}} the All-Filipino Cup finals {{for the first}} time last season, the Tender Juicy Hotdogs welcome back guard Dindo Pumaren on its fold and signed two {{promising}} rookies; Rodney Santos and Reuben Dela Rosa. Purefoods lost their first two games of the season to San Miguel Beer, 69-80, in the opener on February 18, and Shell, 80-85, on February 24 in Lipa City, before picking up their first win against Ginebra, 100-92 on February 27. The Hotdogs began to peak late in the elimination round and finish third behind Alaska and Formula Shell at 8 wins and 6 losses. In the semifinal <b>round,</b> Purefoods <b>racked</b> up six straight victories to clinch the first finals seat, leaving Alaska and Ginebra, which earn a playoff by winning five games in the semifinals, to dispute the other slot, the Milkmen won over Ginebra in their playoff game. In the championship series, Purefoods lost to Alaska Milkmen in just five games and settled for runner-up honors.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} unravel the physiological, endocrine, and {{behavioral}} differences between gregarious and solitarious forms of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk.) (Orthoptera, Acrididae), a constant supply of rather large numbers of solitary individuals has to be guaranteed. This represents a bottleneck, {{mainly because of the}} intensity of the labor involved and limited laboratory accommodation. The method we describe here substantially reduces the space and manpower needed. The survival rate we obtained in the solitarised population was relatively high, reaching about 55 %. The optimal rearing temperature proved to be 32 - 36 degreesC. Cabbage leaves and oat flakes sufficed for feeding all year <b>round.</b> Special <b>racks</b> have been designed that enable high density stacking and easy handling. The solitarisation process was monitored over ten consecutive generations. Changes in morphometrics, eye stripes, color, and behavior were recorded, of which only morphometrics, temperature related development, and mortality are discussed. A shift towards the solitarious phase was recorded, with clear differences between gregarious, 1 st generation and 7 th to 10 th generation solitarious locusts. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|At {{their meeting}} in 1907, Lewis {{introduced}} Cannon to the 13-year-old guitarist and singer Ashley Thompson, with whom Lewis {{had been playing}} {{in the streets of}} Ripley and Memphis for some time, and the three of them worked together over the next 20 years whenever Cannon was in Memphis and not away working medicine and tent shows. When Will Shade's Memphis Jugband recorded and became popular in the late 1920s, Cannon added a coal-oil can on a <b>rack</b> <b>round</b> his neck and renamed the trio (Cannon, Lewis and Thompson) Cannon's Jug Stompers. It was this lineup that made the Jug Busters' first recordings, for Victor Records, in Memphis on January 30, 1928. The songs from that session included [...] "Minglewood Blues", [...] "Springdale Blues", [...] "Big Railroad Blues" [...] and [...] "Madison Street Rag". By the time of the band's next recording, on September 5, 1928, Cannon had replaced Thompson with Elijah Avery on banjo and guitar. By the time of the band's third recording session, four days later, Avery had in turn been replaced with an old friend of Cannon's from the medicine and tent show circuit, the six-string banjo player and guitarist Hosea Woods. The band's lineup remained unchanged from then on. With the Jug Stompers, Lewis sang lead vocal and played a melancholy harmonica solo on [...] "Viola Lee Blues".|$|R
6000|$|In {{a little}} while he should be out of money, and then what should he do? He wished, now, that he had {{borrowed}} a little more liberally from that stranger's store. He {{found it impossible to}} sleep. A single torturing, terrifying thought went <b>racking</b> <b>round</b> and round in his head, wearing a groove in his brain: What should he do--What was to become of him? And along with it began to intrude a something presently which was very like a wish that he had not joined the great and noble ranks of martyrdom, but had stayed at home and been content to be merely an earl and nothing better, with nothing more to do in this world of a useful sort than an earl finds to do. But he smothered that part of his thought as well as he could; he made every effort to drive it away, and with fair keep it from intruding a little success, but he couldn't now and then, and when it intruded it came suddenly and nipped him like a bite, a sting, a burn. He recognized that thought by the peculiar sharpness of its pang. The others were painful enough, but that one cut to the quick when it calm. Night after night he lay tossing to the music of the hideous snoring of the honest bread-winners until two and three o'clock in the morning, then got up and took refuge on the roof, where he sometimes got a nap and sometimes failed entirely. His appetite was leaving him and the zest of life was going along with it. Finally, owe day, being near the imminent verge of total discouragement, he said to himself--and took occasion to blush privately when he said it, [...] "If my father knew what my American name is,--he--well, my duty to my father rather requires that I furnish him my name. I have no right to make his days and nights unhappy, I can do enough unhappiness for the family all by myself. Really he ought to know what my American name is." [...] He thought over it a while and framed a cablegram in his mind to this effect: ...|$|R
