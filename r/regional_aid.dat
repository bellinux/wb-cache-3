50|$|Mollet's cabinet {{carried out}} a {{programme}} of progressive social reform which went unnoticed due to the international context and the Algerian War. Substantial improvements were made in welfare provision for the sick and elderly, funding for <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> and housing was increased, veterans' payments were extended, and a third week of paid holidays was introduced. Mollet's government passed other pieces of social legislation during its time in office, including an increase in wages and improved medical benefits. The level and mechanism of state pensions to both the elderly and chronically ill was improved, while working-class housing was also given close attention, with HLMs receiving top priority in the government’s target of 320,000 houses in 1956. Educational opportunities were increased, while wage-price levels were adjusted in favour of workers and civil servants.|$|E

In practice, however, it is possible to notice expressions like "state support" or "state aid", which are equivalents for the Czech term "public support".

The crucial part of the doctoral thesis focuses on investment aids aimed at the tool of discounts on income taxes, which is evaluated both from the perspective of legal theory and practice. Finally, I scrutinize the case law of the European and Czech courts, which represent the basis, and there is also a comparison with the historical development of the evaluation criteria for compatibility of state aids.

50|$|Closer {{linkages}} between trade and general economic planning in the 1980s had mixed effects. Fluctuating commodities prices {{at home and}} market-oriented trade with, and investment from, Western countries were too uncertain to plan. Consequently, the Second Five-Year Plan was crippled when hoped-for Western investment failed to materialize. The joint planning approach was designed to enable Vietnam to minimize risk because it could count on stable supplies of important resources and equipment at concessionary prices, especially from the Soviet Union. Any delays or bottlenecks in the plans or aid commitments of Comecon countries, however, could delay or disrupt Vietnam's planning effort. In the early 1980s, for example, announcement of the Third Five-Year Plan was delayed until the Fifth National Party Congress of March 1982 while Vietnam waited for the Soviet Union to confirm its aid commitment. Similarly, Vietnam in the mid-1980s endured first reduction, then elimination of Soviet price subsidies for purchases of Soviet oil. The reductions {{were in accordance with}} the then general Soviet practice of avoiding oil price subsidies in order to keep Comecon oil prices close to those of the world market. The volume of Vietnamese trade suffered increasingly from some of the recurring problems that troubled planners in other Comecon countries during this period, including overly optimistic targets, problems of regionalism, priorities often driven by ideology, and chronic shortages of domestically produced raw materials and industrial commodities. By 1987 observers had concluded that, despite Vietnam's financial ties with Comecon, increased investment and trade from Western countries and other non-Comecon sources would be required for a general Vietnamese economic recovery (following Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia in late 1978, numerous Western and <b>regional</b> <b>aid</b> donors had withdrawn their support and imposed a trade boycott).|$|E
