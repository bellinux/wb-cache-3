Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E

In the past, physicians cautioned women that antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.

50|$|<b>Rifabutin</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of Mycobacterium avium complex disease, a bacterial infection most commonly encountered in late-stage AIDS patients.

50|$|<b>Rifabutin,</b> by mouth daily, is {{recommended}} for the people's lifetime unless disseminated MAC develops, which would then require multiple drug therapy. Although other drugs, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, have laboratory and clinical activity against MAC, none {{has been shown in}} a prospective, controlled trial to be effective and safe for prophylaxis. Thus, in the absence of data, no other regimen can be recommended at this time.The 300-mg dose of <b>rifabutin</b> has been well tolerated.

50|$|Like ritonavir, {{delavirdine}} is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4, and {{interacts with}} many medications.

Susceptibility to clarithromycin, clofazimine and ethionamide has been detected for some strains.|$|E
5000|$|Every regimen {{should contain}} either {{azithromycin}} or clarithromycin; many experts prefer ethambutol {{as a second}} drug.

Isoniazid and pyrazinamide are not effective for the therapy of MAC.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{abdominal}} pain, nausea, rash, headache, and low blood neutrophil levels. Other side effects include muscles pains and uveitis.

50|$|<b>Rifabutin</b> is {{primarily}} bactericidal antibiotic drug {{used to treat}} tuberculosis. Its effect on bacteria {{is based on the}} DNA-dependent RNA polymerase blocking drug rifamycin S, a semi-synthetic derivative. It is effective, for example, in highly resistant mycobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria (and some are effective against Gram-negative bacteria), but also against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. leprae, and M. avium intracellulare.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rifabutin</b> (Rfb) is an {{antibiotic}} {{used to treat}} tuberculosis and prevent and treat Mycobacterium avium complex. It is typically only used in those who cannot tolerate rifampin such as people with HIV/AIDS on antiretrovirals. For active tuberculosis it is used with other antimycobacterial medications. For latent tuberculosis it may be used by itself when the exposure was with drug-resistant TB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rifabutin</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1992. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 30 USD a month. In the United States a month of treatment is more than 200 USD.|$|E
5000|$|Being metabolized by hepatic {{cytochrome}} P450, voriconazole {{interacts with}} many drugs. [...] Voriconazole {{should not be}} used in conjunction with many drugs including sirolimus, rifampicin, <b>rifabutin,</b> carbamazepine, quinidine and ergot alkaloids) and dose adjustments and/or monitoring when coadministered with others (including fluconazole, warfarin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, omeprazole, and phenytoin). Voriconazole may be safely administered with cimetidine, ranitidine, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics, mycophenolate, digoxin and prednisolone.|$|E
50|$|Clinicians must {{weigh the}} {{potential}} benefits of MAC prophylaxis against the potential for toxicities and drug interactions, the cost, the potential to produce resistance in a community with a high rate of tuberculosis, and the possibility that the addition of another drug to the medical regimen may adversely affect patients' compliance with treatment. Because of these concerns, therefore, in some situations <b>rifabutin</b> prophylaxis should not be administered.|$|E
50|$|Abiraterone acetate is a CYP3A4 {{substrate}} {{and hence}} {{should not be}} administered concurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone,saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole) or inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, <b>rifabutin,</b> rifapentine, phenobarbital. It also inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 and likewise {{should not be taken}} concurrently with substrates of any of these enzymes that have a narrow therapeutic index.|$|E
50|$|Heliconda, {{a product}} for the {{treatment}} of drug-resistant Helicobacter pylori, is a combination of the antibiotics <b>rifabutin</b> and amoxicillin and the proton pump inhibitor drug pantoprazole. Heliconda was invented in 1998. In 2006 the results of a Phase II study of Heliconda in around 130 patients with resistant H. pylori infection was published. This study demonstrated an eradication of the infection in 90.9% of patients treated with Heliconda.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rifabutin</b> is well tolerated in {{patients}} with HIV-related tuberculosis (TB), but new findings suggest that patients with low CD4 cell counts have {{a high risk of}} treatment failure or relapse due to acquired rifamycin resistance. Since patients co-infected with TB and HIV/AIDS are likely to get TB treated first, when the CD4 is suppressed at the time TB treatment begins, doctors and patients should be aware of a possible rifamycin resistance.|$|E
5000|$|Cross-resistance is the {{tolerance}} to a usually toxic substance {{as a result}} of exposure to a similarly acting substance. It is a phenomenon affecting e.g. pesticides and antibiotics. As an example <b>rifabutin</b> and rifampin cross react in the treatment of tuberculosis. This sort of resistance is also seen against drugs involved with the treatment of HIV. Drugs ending with [...] "- ine" [...] and [...] "-inavir" [...] are the most common.|$|E
50|$|M. avium and M. haemophilum {{infections in}} {{children}} form a distinct clinical entity, {{not associated with}} abnormalities of the immune system. M. avium typically causes unilateral swelling {{of one of the}} lymph nodes of the neck. This node is firm at the beginning, but a collarstud abscess' is formed eventually, which is a characteristic blue-purple in colour with multiple discharging sinuses. The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the affected lymph nodes, with antibiotic treatment (usually clarithromycin and <b>rifabutin</b> for 18 to 24 months) reserved for those patients who cannot have surgery.|$|E
