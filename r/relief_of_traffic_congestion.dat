40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from vehicles have alarmingly increased over the past decades as a result from people 2 ̆ 7 s daily commute. Building newer and larger roads to improve traffic flow and decrease emissions {{is no longer an}} option. Transportation needs to embrace higher levels of sustainability and efficiency in order to solve one of the greatest 21 st century 2 ̆ 7 s problems. Not surprisingly, engineers and researchers develop nowadays many valuable and green engineering ideas for transportation changes. One such idea creates automated or semi-automated platoons or road trains of vehicles on highways in order to achieve multiple benefits including considerable reduction in emissions through enhanced aerodynamic characteristics, <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>congestion</b> through better road space utilization, and improvement of safety and driver comfort through use of fail-safe mechanisms and shock wave reductions. Still, the interactions between the human factors, or truly the lack thereof, and the new technologies may directly impact on the traditional guidelines for the geometric design of highways. Required new technology is mostly built into passenger cars and further targets their operation, which results in a lack of necessity to continue to extend the existing roadway infrastructure. ^ This thesis presents these potential changes in design guidelines. The investigation of a continuum of transitory to end state scenarios concluded that overall road train modes of highway operation displayed a strong potential to significantly reduce the minimum lengths requirements on vertical and horizontal curves alike. Existing freeway designs are thus more than satisfactory for the deployment of these operational modes. ...|$|E

40|$|Road use {{charging}} means {{charging a}} price {{for the use of}} scarce road space. It is a method of charging {{for the use of the}} road at the point and time of use to reflect the economic policy objective that vehicles should cover the full costs of their use. There are two distinct types of road use charging – congestion charging and tolling. Congestion charges are designed to be levied in cities; vehicles are charged as they cross a cordon on the outskirts of the city – or through a series of zones within a city. Singapore and Norway use electronic road pricing for this purpose. However, they could be used anywhere that congestion imposes unacceptable environmental costs eg, (1) at the Barcelona Olympic Games a payment plus restriction of access system was used to relieve traffic congestion, (2) the Lake District National Park could use it in the Summer months. Tolling is generally used on motorways or major highways or bridges and the motive for its use is usually the raising of revenue to finance road infrastructure costs rather than the <b>relief</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>congestion.</b> A fee is charged for the use of a motorway and charging is usually on a distance basis. Where bridges and tunnels are concerned, tolling is done on a “point ” or single charge, basis. Tolling will be covered in a future Network Management note. Why use Congestion Charging? The aim of using congestion charging is to charge a price sufficiently high to promote modal shift and achieve transport policy objectives such as reducing congestion and encouraging a shift to public transport. Within this economic rationale sits the principle that the polluter pays. The aim may be to charge the economic price for the road space in order to promote the most efficient use of the facility and parallel facilities. This concept dates from the 1920 s and was the basis for the Smeed report on road pricing, published in 1967. It is still cited today as the economic justification for road use charging, and is the basis of the road user charging projects currently bein...|$|E

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate among {{transport}} planners and safety policy makers as to whether there is any association between the level <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>congestion</b> and road safety. One can expect that the increased level <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>congestion</b> aids road safety and this is because average traffic speed is relatively low in a congested condition relative to an uncongested condition, which may result in less severe crashes. The relationship between congestion and safety {{may not be so}} straightforward, however, as {{there are a number of}} other factors such as traffic flow, driver characteristics, road geometry, and vehicle design affecting crash severity. Previous studies have employed count data models either Poisson or negative binomials and their extensions while developing a relationship between the frequency <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> crashes and traffic flow or density as a proxy for <b>traffic</b> <b>congestion.</b> The use <b>of</b> aggregated crash counts at a road segment level or at an area level with the proxy for congestion may obscure the actual relationship.
