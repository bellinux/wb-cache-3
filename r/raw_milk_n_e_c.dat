A cross-sectional {{study was conducted to}} detect the presence of Salmonella spp., Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp., and antimicrobial residues in <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> (<b>n</b> = 120) and processed cow <b>milk</b> (<b>n</b> = 20) from smallholder dairy farms from three sites in Zimbabwe. Culture and isolation of Salmonella spp., C. albicans, and Aspergillus spp. were performed using selective media, while antimicrobial residues were detected by a dye reduction test. No Salmonella, butC. albicans (17. 5 %; 21 / 120),Aspergillus spp. (0. 8 %; 1 / 120), and antimicrobial residues (2. 5 %; 3 / 120) were detected from <b>raw</b> <b>milk.</b> C. albicans was isolated from all three sites, while Aspergillus spp. and antimicrobial residues were detected from sites 1 and 3, respectively. From processed milk, only C. albicans (5 %) was isolated while Aspergillus spp. and antimicrobial residues were not detected. These results suggested low prevalence of Salmonella spp. and Aspergillus spp. and a relatively high prevalence of C. albicans in <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> from the smallholder farms. The potential public health risks of C. albicans and the detected antimicrobial residues need to be considered. Thus, educating farmers on improving milking hygiene and storage of milk and establishing programmes for monitoring antimicrobial residues may help to improve the safety of milk from smallholder farms. 1...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal infections with shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella dysenteriae type I play a {{major role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome in childhood. Escherichia coli has been repeatedly detected in the intestines of healthy cattle. Twenty-seven children with hemolytic-uremic syndrome were treated at our hospital between June 1990 and March 1997. Factors indicating a possible previous contact with bovine intestinal content were found in 18 out of the 27 patients: parents stockbreeders (n = 7), recent visit to a cowshed or contact with cowdung or manure (n = 5), residence in a rural cattle-breeding area (n = 5), or consumption of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> (<b>n</b> = 1). The factors mentioned were found in 5 out of 27 control patients (p < 0. 01). Two children experienced hemolytic-uremic syndrome after a stay respectively in Egypt and Tunisia. Our results indicate an important source for acquisition of hemolytic-uremic syndrome in childhood. Observing simple hygienic rules such as washing of hands and pasteurization of milk is likely to have a positive influence on the incidence of this illness. There are also grounds to consider adding the hemolytic-uremic syndrome to the list of travel-related diseases...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{ubiquitous}} bacterium {{widely distributed}} in the environment that can cause a severe disease in humans when contaminated foods are ingested. Cheese has been implicated in sporadic cases and in outbreaks of listeriosis worldwide. Environmental contamination, in several occasions by persistent strains, has been considered {{an important source of}} !nished product contamination. The objectives of this research were to (i) evaluate the presence of L. monocytogenes within the factory environments and cheeses of three processing plants, artisanal producer of <b>raw</b> ewe's <b>milk</b> cheeses (APC), small-scale industrial cheese producer (SSI) and industrial cheese producer (ICP) each producing a distinct style of cheese, all with history of contamination by L. monocytogenes (ii) and identify possible sources of contamination using different typing methods (arsenic and cadmium susceptibility, geno-serotyping, PFGE). The presence of markers speci!c for 3 epidemic clones (ECI– ECIII) of L. monocytogenes was also investigated. Samples were collected from <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> (<b>n</b> = 179), whey (n = 3), cheese brining solution (n = 7), cheese brine sludge (n = 505), !nished product (n = 3016), and environment (n = 2560) during, at least, a four-year period. Listeriamonocytogeneswas detected in environmental, <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and cheese samples, respectively, at 15. 4 %, 1. 1 % and 13. 6 % in APC; at 8. 9 %, 2. 9 % and 3. 4 % in SSI; and at 0 %, 21. 1 % and 0. 2 % in ICP. Typing of isolates revealed that <b>raw</b> ewe's <b>milk</b> and the dairy plant environment are important sources of contamination, and that some strains persisted for at least four years in the environment.

40|$|In this study, the enterotoxigenic {{potential}} of Staphylococcus strains (n = 574) isolated from <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> samples (<b>n</b> = 140) was determined for {{their capacity to}} produce staphylococcal enterotoxins. In addition, {{the relationship between the}} presence of enterotoxins, coagulase, and thermonuclease (Tnase) was assessed. The results showed that 19 % of Staphylococcus was enterotoxigenic, being able to produce {{at least one of the}} staphylococcal enterotoxins (A, B, C, and D). Most of the strains were able to produce enterotoxin D (68. 8 %), whereas 12. 8 % of the Staphylococcus strains were able to produce staphylococcal enterotoxin A. Besides, the production of more than one type of enterotoxins by the same strain was observed. Tnase was considered the best marker for enterotoxigenic {{potential of}} isolates, although some of them were negative for coagulase and Tnase but positive for enterotoxin production. Therefore, either the use of Tnase to assess Staphylococcus enterotoxigenic potential or the use of simple and easy screening tests for enterotoxin production should receive more attention when evaluating the pathogenic potential of foodborne Staphylococcus strains. Due to the association of both coagulase positive Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus with foodborne disease outbreaks, regulators and industries should pay more attention to enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus rather than focusing only on S. aureus or coagulase positive Staphylococcus. Finally, data found here suggest a high risk of staphylococcal intoxication with the consumption of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> or dairy products made from <b>raw</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{has been}} noted {{to be a major}} and increasing human health issue. Cold storage of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> promotes the thriving of psychrotrophic/psychrotolerant bacteria, which are well known for their ability to produce enzymes that are frequently heat stable. However, these bacteria also carry antibiotic resistance (AR) features. In places, where no cold chain facilities are available and despite existing recommendations numerous adulterants, including antibiotics, are added to <b>raw</b> <b>milk.</b> Previously, <b>N</b> 2 gas flushing showed real potential for hindering bacterial growth in <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> at a storage temperature ranging from 6 to 25 ◦C. Here, the ability of N 2 gas (N) to tackle antibioticresistant bacteria was tested and compared to that of the activated lactoperoxidase system (HT) for three <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> samples that were stored at 6 ◦C for 7 days. To that end, the mesophiles and psychrotrophs that were resistant to gentamycin (G), ceftazidime (Ce), levofloxacin (L), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) were enumerated. For the log 10 ratio (which is defined as the bacterial counts from a certain condition divided by the counts on the corresponding control), classical Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by a mean comparison with the Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch multiple range test (REGWQ). If the storage “time” factor was the major determinant of the recorded effects, cold storage alone or in combination with HT or with N promoted a sample-dependent response in consideration of the AR levels. The efficiency of N in limiting the increase in AR was highest for fresh <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and was judged to be equivalent to that of HT for one sample and superior to that of HT for the two other samples; moreover, compared to HT, N seemed to favor a more diverse community at 6 ◦C that was less heavily loaded with antibiotic multi-resistance features.

40|$|Milk {{spoilage}} {{is caused}} by the presence of proteolytic enzymes produced by Pseudomonas spp. during storage at low temperatures. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify Pseudomonas spp. in <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and investigate their associated proteolytic properties at low temperatures. <b>Raw</b> <b>milk</b> samples (<b>n</b> = 87) were collected from 87 bulk tanks in Shaanxi Province in China. Pseudomonas spp. were identified using Pseudomonas specific 16 S, universal 16 S rRNA sequencing, and rpoB gene sequencing. The proteolytic properties of Pseudomonas spp. were examined using milk agar, quantitative trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid assay, and by the presence of alkaline metallopeptidase gene (aprX). A total 143 isolates from all 87 samples were confirmed as Pseudomonas, and were identified as belonging to 14 Pseudomonas species. Of these, 40 (28. 0 %) isolates revealed proteolysis on milk agar at 2 °C, 74 (51. 8 %) at 4 °C, 104 (72. 7 %) at 7 °C, and 102 (71. 3 %) at 10 °C.

In light of {{the increasing number of}} machines where <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> is sold via <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> vending systems, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the risk for food infections with the Campylobacter bacterium resulting from the milk dispensed from these <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> vending machines. The assessment also addresses {{the question of whether the}} more frequent occurrence of outbreaks of illness due to Campylobacter infections (Campylobacter enteritis or Campylobacteriosis) could be associated with the increase in the number of points of sale for <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and in particular <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> vending machines. As there are no validated empirical data, the preliminary assessment of the BfR is based on the working hypothesis that changes in consumer behaviour entailing the increased consumption of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> from the so-called "milk vending machines" is leading to more frequent outbreaks of Campylobacter. One of the main sources of contamination of the <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> is faecal contamination during the milking process.

5000|$|In 2009, 29 U.S. states allowed {{sales of}} <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> in some form. In {{other parts of}} the world, <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> can often be bought {{directly}} from the farmer. Arizona, Utah, California and Washington allow <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> sales in retail stores with appropriate warning labeling. As of May 2010, Massachusetts only allows direct sales from farm to consumer, resulting in [...] "buying clubs" [...] where consumers pool transportation resources to obtain <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> more conveniently.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of earned agricultural dollars in Vermont come from the dairy industry, but with volatility in the market in recent years, including rising costs of feed and the fluctuating price of milk, state officials have begun to recommend diversification of farm activities to instill resiliency into the system. The research presented in this thesis explores two avenues for diversification, farm-to-consumer sales of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and local beef production. The second chapter utilizes diffusion theory to understand the prevalence of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> consumption in Vermont, develop {{a profile of the}} <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> consumer, document the motivations of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> consumers, and identify sources and channels of information for <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> consumers. The results of a general population telephone survey indicate that 11. 6...|$|R
40|$|<b>Raw</b> <b>milk</b> cheeses {{are widely}} {{produced}} in Europe, particularly in France, Italy and Switzerland {{and in many}} regions of the USA. These cheeses are artisanal products, linked to specific geographical areas, and are characterised by unique textural and sensory qualities. The use of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and natural starters requires careful attention to the cheesemaking process to ensure a good quality product. Cheeses can be contaminated with pathogen microorganisms if these organisms {{are present in the}} <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> used in the manufacturing of cheeses and are able to survive the cheesemaking process. The unique characteristics of each specific cheese variety can affect the growth and survival of microbial pathogens. However, a combination of parameters, including the use of lactic acid bacteria starters, pH, water activity, salt content and temperature, interact to produce cheeses that are microbiologically safe. The content of this chapter gives some insights into the microbiological safety of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> cheeses. It describes the occurrence of microbial pathogens in <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and cheeses made of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and the intrinsic and extrinsic conditions that favour their survival and growth. The microbial safety of these cheese may be enhanced by the use of high microbiological quality <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and by following good manufacturing practices throughout the whole cheesemaking process to prevent the cross-contamination of the product...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years farm {{marketing}} has significantly increased. The present study deals with the bacteriological-hygienic quality, particularly with pathogenic microorganisms of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> products from farm marketing. 709 samples of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> products were collected nationwide. Certified milk (a kind of raw certified grade A <b>milk),</b> ex-farm <b>milk,</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> cheeses (soft cheese, semihard and hard cheese) and other products made of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> underwent quality checks for Listeria monocytogenes (L. mono-cyto-genes), Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and coliforms, which were valuated as hygienic pa-rameters according to the milk regulations 1995 (Milk Ordinance ? 95), were checked. The total bacterial count (TBC) and somatic cells of certified <b>milk</b> and <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> were deter-mined. Pursuant to the <b>Milk</b> Ordinance ? 95 <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> cheese was investigated for staphylo-coccal enterotoxins. 35 strains of B. cereus isolated from <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> products were examined for cytotoxicity. 21 <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> products were examined for heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). 12 of 74 bulk milk samples from farms producing certified milk contained L. mono-cytogenes. However, all the 12 L. monocytogenes positive samples came from {{one and the same}} farm of the 35 farms producing certified milk. The fact that the certified milk of this farm was sold over a longer period gives cause for concern. 54 % of the samples contained S. aureus, 59, 5 % E. coli and 87, 8 % coliforms. In 17 % or 22 % of the cases, the counts of S. aureus or coliforms exceeded the threshold value "M" stipulated in the Milk Ordinance. 10 % of 149 bulk milk samples from farms selling <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> were contaminated with L. mo-no-cytogenes, 8 % with B. cereus, 0, 7 % each with VTEC and C. jejuni as well as 47 % with S. aureus. More than 80 % of the samples contained E. coli and coliforms. In 22, 8 % and in more than 80 % of 35 <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> fresh cheese samples respectively S. aureus or E. coli as well as coliforms could be detected. In 2, 2 % of the samples from 89 <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> soft cheeses L. monocytogenes was isolated. 5, 6 % contained B. cereus and 2, 4 % VTEC. In 28, 1 % or in over 90 % of these products respectively S. aureus or E. coli as well as coliforms were detected. 2, 0 % of the 245 semihard and hard cheese samples were contaminated with L. monocytogenes, 15, 1 % with B. cereus and 1, 4 % with VTEC. 31, 4 % or more than 90 % of the samples respectively contained S. aureus or E. coli and coliforms. All the VTEC serotypes in the present study have already been isolated in connection with human diseases. Neither LT-, ST-enterotoxins nor S. aureus toxins could be detected in the subsequently analyzed products. 71, 4 % of the 35 analyzed B. cereus strains showed cytotoxic activity. The {{results of the present study}} show that part of the <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> products from farm marketing offered to the consumers do not fulfil the requirements of the food hygienic standards. Basically, the occurrence of pathogenic microorganisms in <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> products has even to be expected, to a smaller or larger extent. Thus there exists a health risk for the consumer. <br...|$|R
