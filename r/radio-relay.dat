In 1971, the Slovenian broadcaster RTV started building a transmitter on the mountain {{in order to provide}} television coverage to an area that could not be reached by the transmitters at Mount Krvavec and Ljubljana Castle. The Yugoslav military also took an interest in the location and started building its own facilities {{at the same time as}} RTV. The summit of Mount Krim was then closed to hikers and other members of the public, who could go no higher than Mount Krimšček (941 m), also known as Little Mount Krim (Mali Krim). While it was used by the military, the mountain was an important radio point for the army, serving as a radio and <b>radio-relay</b> point that covered most of Slovenia and also maintained contact with similar points throughout Slovenia and the rest of Yugoslavia. The exterior of the military structure indicates that it was similar to that found at Guslica on Mount Risnjak. In 1991, during Slovenia's Ten-Day War of independence, Slovenian Territorial Defense units sought to force the staff at the facility to surrender, but without success. The structure continued to be used by the Yugoslav military until October 1991, when the Yugoslav People's Army withdrew from Slovenia.

A large number and variety of LF and HF antennas were used at both transmitter sites. These included directional (beam antennas), omnidirectional antennas, and tall antenna towers for dedicated, wide-area broadcast capability. An extensive infrastructure supported the station. This included a multi-purpose building with barracks, administration offices, mess hall, navy exchange, and recreation room; an enlisted men's club, autonomous power generating facility, water and sewer treatment facilities, helicopter pad, and security posts.

40|$|Quality {{transmission}} of digital signals from a transmitting <b>radio-relay</b> device to a receiving one {{depends on the}} impact of environmental effects on the propagation of electromagnetic waves. In this paper {{some of the most important}} effects are explained and modeled, especially those characteristic for the frequency range within which the GRC 408 E operates. The modeling resulted in the conclusions about the quality of {{transmission of}} digital signals in the GRC 408 E <b>radio-relay</b> equipment. Propagation of electromagnetic waves A <b>radio-relay</b> link is achieved by direct electromagnetic waves, provided there is a line of sight between the transmitting and receiving antenna of a <b>radio-relay</b> device. Electromagnetic waves on the road are exposed to various environmental influences causing phenomena such as bending, reflection, refraction, absorption and multiple propagation. Due to these environmental effects, the quality of information transmission is not satisfactory and a <b>radio-relay</b> link is not reliable. The approach to the analysis of the quality of links in digital radiorelay devices is different from the one in analog <b>radio-relay</b> devices. Therefore, the quality is seen through errors in the received bit (BER), the propagation conditions are taken into account, a reservation for the fading is determined by other means, etc [...] Phenomena which accompany the propagation of electromagnetic waves in digital <b>radio-relay</b> links The propagation of direct EM waves is followed by the following phenomena: - attenuation due to propagation, - diffraction (changing table), - refraction (refraction), - reflection (refusing), - absorption (absorption) and - multiple wave propagation. Each of these has a negative effect on the quality of the received signal at the receiving antenna of the <b>radio-relay</b> device. Attenuation due to propagation of electromagnetic waves The main parameter for evaluating the quality of <b>radio-relay</b> links is the level of the field at the reception, i. e. the strength of a signal received at the entrance of the receiver. The error in the received bit (BER) is a function of the receiving field. By reducing the level of the field the BER increases and vice versa. The level of the receiving field in the absence of margin is called the nominal level of the receiving field. The difference between the nominal level and the receiving threshold represents a margin or a budget for the fading for the given BER. Diffraction is a phenomenon that follows the propagation of electromagnetic waves and indicates their ability to bend round the relief, uneven surfaces and other obstacles, during propagation through the environment. Diffraction is considered when the obstacles on the path of propagation of electromagnetic waves enter the first Fresnel zone, because then an error in the information transmission occurs. Refraction is the refraction of electromagnetic waves in the lower layers of the atmosphere and is caused by its unhomogeneity. The upper part of the EM wave front progresses faster and the wave bends towards the Earth. The phenomenon of EM wave bending towards the Earth is called refraction. Reflection When electromagnetic waves propagate near the Earth surface, a part of the wave front, reflected from the surface of the Earth, may arrive in the receiving antenna of radio relay equipment together with direct electromagnetic waves. EM waves (direct and reflected) are summed up vectorially in the receiver giving the resulting EM wave. This can cause a substantial reduction in the resulting field when compared to the field in ideal conditions, which leads to the error increase. Absorption or EM wave absorption occurs in all frequency bands and signifies a higher or lower level of attenuation of electromagnetic waves. It is taken into consideration in digital <b>radio-relay</b> devices which operate in the frequency range over 7 GHz. Multiple propagation of electromagnetic waves EM waves from the transmitter can reach the receiver in different ways, and such EMW propagation is known as multiple EM wave propagation in the literature. The result of multiple propagation can be the reduction of the EM field intensity or its complete disappearance. This phenomenon is called fading. Fading Fading is caused by short-term weakening of electromagnetic waves at the reception. During EMW propagation, the interaction between EM waves and objects occurs resulting in multiple copies of useful signals of different amplitude and delay values at the reception point, thus making the resulting EM field unstable. A large number of copies of the useful signal at the reception are caused by the effects of environmental impacts on the propagation of electromagnetic waves along the route, such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and their combination. The total loss is equal to the sum of propagation weakening and fading weakening. Fading is divided into propagation fading and interference fading. Propagation fading is generally slow and does not depend on frequency. Interference fading occurs due to the appearance of multiple EM wave propagation and it can be flat or selective. Flat fading is the same in the entire frequency range. In selective fading there is degradation of basic signals, i. e. Intersymbol interference which is present at RR devices operating at higher frequencies with the data flow around 34 MBit/s and over. Model of the <b>radio-relay</b> system and the results of modeling The paper deals with a model as the one given in Fig. 2 The GRC 408 E RR devices are supposed to be built into mobile call centers. The following phenomena are modeled: attenuation due to propagation, diffraction, reflection and fading. Each phenomenon is modeled for typical cases. The input signal in the GRC RR 408 E device is a random binary sequence, modulated by a modulation device provided by the RR. Such a signal propagates through the particular medium towards the RR device receiving antenna. At the reception point, the transmitted and the received signal are compared in order to find an error due to the influence of some of the modeled phenomena. The modeling results are presented graphically for different effects of environmental impacts on the propagation of EM waves in RR digital devices. The graphs indicate the errors occurred during the propagation of EM waves. Conclusion Modeling the impact of environment on the propagation of EM waves in RR digital devices can show the influence of environment on the propagation of EM waves, as well as on the quality of transmission signals. The conclusion is that the choice of the terrain for setting a mobile communication center is essential for high-quality signal transmission. For high-quality transmission of digital signals in RR devices, another requirement is also important and that is the requirement for the line-of-sight transmission and free first Fresnel zone. While in analog RR devices the conditions of EMW propagation are not a key factor in calculating the quality of communication, the results of modeling show that the conditions of propagation in digital RR devices are an important factor in the calculation of the quality of communication. The obtained results are useful for modeling RR devices in mobile communication centers and for engineers working on the main design of communication systems in the Serbian Army. The next aim is to model the impact of environment on the propagation of EM waves in GRC RR 408 E/ 34 digital devices which operate within a higher frequency range and at higher data flow speeds...|$|E

40|$|Interference in <b>radio-relay</b> links {{caused by}} {{multipath}} propagation {{can be reduced}} {{by the use of}} receiving antennas with adaptive beam orientation. High-performance <b>radio-relay</b> antennas with low sidelobes and high polarization purity frequently consist of dual-offset reflectors with low edge illumination and feeds with low cross-polarization level. A simple means for achieving beam scanning with an antenna is the use of a dual-feed, which consists of two corrugated horns penetrating into each other. Measurements of such a feed were done with a 3 m offset Gregorian antenna (''shell antenna'') in the frequency band 9 - 11 GHz. It results that the phase centres of the dual-feed are not located as close as it would correspond to their geometrical distance. For this reason, the cross-over level of the two main beams of the antenna was by 2. 5 dB lower than expected. This effect can be compensated for by filling the feed horns partially with a dielectric foam. With an axial distance of 38 mm (corresponding to 1. 27 wavelengths) a cross-over level of - 2. 5 to - 3 dB was achieved. The low side-lobe level in the horizontal antenna pattern remains unchanged. However, the near-in sidelobes in the vertical pattern are increased. The maximum cross-polarization level amounts to - 27 dB (in comparison: - 31 dB for a single-feed horn) in the investigated frequency region. The cross-polarization can be diminished by enlarging the axial distance of the two horns, resulting in a decreased cross-over level. Another method for diminishing the cross-polarization level is the use of a feed with a larger beamwidth. But in this case, the sidelobes rise in the horizontal pattern. Moreover, the cross-over level is by 0. 2 dB to 0. 5 dB lower than {{in the case of the}} dual-feed with lower edge illumination. (orig.)

40|$|This thesis revisits Stanley Milgram’s “cyranoid method” of {{interactive}} social psychological experimentation (Milgram, 2010 a) and explores the technique’s empirical potential in several domains. The central {{component of the}} method is speech shadowing, a procedure that involves a person (the shadower) repeating in real-time words they receive through an innerear monitor by-way-of <b>radio-relay</b> from a remote source. Speech shadowing effectively creates a hybrid agent (a “cyranoid”) composed {{of the body of}} one individual (the shadower) and the “mind” (or more precisely, the words) of another (the source). Interactants naïve to this manipulation perceive speech shadowers as autonomous communicators, and this perceptual bias (the “cyranic illusion”) affords researchers the ability to inspect the effects of separately altering the physical (outer) and dispositional (inner) elements of an interlocutor’s identity in contexts involving spontaneous and unscripted face-to-face dialog. Four articles and two additional chapters have been developed for this thesis. Chapter 1, “Introducing and situating the cyranoid method” presents an overview of the cyranoid method alongside an analysis of documents pertaining to the method contained in the Stanley Milgram Papers archive at Yale University and situates the method {{in the context of the}} demise of the classical paradigm, or “golden age,” of social psychology. Chapter 2 (Article 1), “Replicating Milgram” (published in the Journal of Social Psychology under the title “Revisiting Milgram’s cyranoid method: Experimenting with hybrid human agents”), examines the cyranic illusion through replications of two of Milgram’s original pilot studies and discusses the method’s potential as a means of conducting person perception. Chapter 3 (Article 2), “Echoborgs: Cyranoids with computer program sources” (published in Frontiers in Psychology under the title “A truly human interface: Interacting face-to-face with someone whose words are determined by a computer program”), expands upon the traditional cyranoid method by exploring situations wherein a conversational agent (a computer program designed to mimic a human interlocutor) sources for a human shadower, thereby producing a special type of cyranoid known as an “echoborg”; the article places the echoborg within the context of android science, a field that uses humanlike machines as stimuli in social psychological research in order to explore various aspects of human interaction (Ishiguro & Nishio, 2007). Chapter 4 (Article 3), “Using echoborgs to assess intersubjective effort in human-agent dialog” (accepted for publication pending minor revisions in Computers in Human Behavior), combines conversation analysis techniques (e. g., Schegloff, 1992, 1993) with the echoborg method to investigate factors that influence how people repair misunderstandings that arise during dialog with conversational agents. Chapter 5 (Article 4), “Cyranoids in first-person, self-experimental research” (published in Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science under the title “The researcher as experimental subject: Using self-experimentation to access experiences, understand social phenomena, and stimulate reflexivity”), explores the history of researcher-as-subject self-experimentation in social psychology and illustrates how the cyranoid method can be used as a first-person means of directly experiencing the consequences of a transformed social identity through systematic self-experimentation. Finally, Chapter 6, “Cyranoid ethics,” discusses the various ethical concerns involved in cyranoid research, outlines how they were mitigated in the current thesis, and offers suggestions for ensuring positive research participant experience. As Milgram died before publishing any work on the cyranoid method, and as speech shadowing has seen relatively little application in social psychological experimentation, this thesis attempts to provide the initial basis for future iterations and variants of the method...|$|E
