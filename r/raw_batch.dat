40|$|Issue: Fiberglass {{insulation}} manufacturing {{has grown}} {{to be one of}} the largest uses for recycled glass. Because fiberglass does not have glass’s clarity, there is an assumption among some that fiberglass raw materials can tolerate higher levels of contaminants than container manufacturing. In fact, metal, organic, and ceramic contaminants can be costly to fiberglass quality and production equipment. Best Practice: During fiberglass production, <b>raw</b> <b>batch</b> materials and glass cullet are continuously added to the furnace. After melting and “fining, ” the molten glass is spun into fibers by a process called fiberizing. To ensure production of consistent fibers, cullet must meet specifications for major and minor oxide chemical composition, color consistency, and contaminant levels. Major and Minor Oxide Chemical Composition. The chemical composition of cullet as <b>raw</b> <b>batch</b> material for fiberglass should fall within the ranges listed in the table. Variations in major oxide concentration can affect both the viscosity and emissivity of the glass melt. Viscosity is a measure of flow resistance, while emissivity is the ability of a material to emit heat through radiation. Both of these properties affect the attenuation ability of the molten glass during fiber formation. In addition, a shift in a major oxide concentration can cause fluctuations in the electrical resistivity of the melt. This requires an adjustment of transformer settings controlling the power input to the furnace, as well as creating changes in heat flow patterns, current paths, and temperature distribution, all of which are undesirable during stable furnace operations. Minor and trace oxide composition of the batch cullet is also very important. Oxides such as CoO, Cr 2 O, and FeO can influence infrared heat transmission, heat transfer during melting, and rate of fiber cooling. These factors will affect fiber attenuation, leading to variability in the fiber diameters and lengths...|$|E
40|$|Issue: Glass {{container}} {{manufacturers are}} using {{increasing amounts of}} recycled glass cullet. While reducing the demand for natural resources, the use of cullet is also cost-effective from a manufacturing standpoint. Cullet melts at a lower temperature than raw materials, reducing the demand for energy and lowering production costs. Further energy savings {{can be achieved by}} using furnace exhaust gases to preheat the cullet. One method of preheating involves direct transmission of furnace exhaust through a cullet medium. Another approach involves passing the cullet through a vertical funnel that is heated externally by the furnace exhaust. Preheating cullet also helps to promote a longer furnace life. This best practice explains the benefits of using preheated cullet in the manufacturing of glass containers. Preheater designs using direct and indirect heat transmission are also discussed. Best Practice: Typical glass container manufacturing furnaces are capable of producing from 100 to 400 tons of glass per day. Because recycled glass melts at lower temperatures than <b>raw</b> <b>batch</b> materials, it requires less furnace energy during production. Studies show that every 10 % increase in the amount of cullet used reduces melting energy by about 2 %. Reducing the energy input reduces fuel consumption, and ultimately helps reduce the level of nitrogen emissions produced by the furnace. Preheating cullet with the furnace exhaust gas allows further reduction in the melting energy. The exac...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{addresses}} the protolytic charge of montmorillonite, which occurs on the broken-bond sites at the particle edges. The {{purpose is to}} overcome the general difficulty arising in potentiometric titration due to coupled side reactions, which severely impede the titrant budget (partial dissolution of the clay and of secondary phases, hydrolysis and readsorption of dissolved species, cation exchange). Batch potentiometric titrations were carried out on the montmorillonite fractions extracted from two bentonites (MX 80 and SWy 2) to quantify their protolytic charge. The effects of equilibration time (24 h and 7 days), pH from 4 to 10, and ionic strength (0. 1 and 0. 01 mol L− 1) were extensively studied for the MX 80 sample. Quantification of dissolution was achieved by analysis of the equilibrium solutions for dissolved species and by La 3 + exchange of the readsorbed species. The results clearly show that secondary phases such as iron- or silica-rich minerals contribute to the dissolved species, according {{to the nature of}} the raw bentonite. Furthermore, readsorption affects significant amounts of dissolved species. The overconsumption of proton/hydroxide due to dissolution, readsorption, and hydrolysis of dissolved species was evaluated using a self-consistent thermodynamic calculation. The ability of such calculation to correct the raw titration curves in order to extract the titrable surface charge of montmorillonite was evaluated by comparison with the continuous titration procedure. Especially in the alkaline domain, correcting the <b>raw</b> <b>batch</b> titration curves for the measured side reactions failed to reproduce the continuous titration curves.

When that is not verified, MPCA-CCs must be adapted to handle variable batch duration.

40|$|In a bid {{to address}} {{environmental}} challenges associated with the management of waste Coca cola glass bottle, this study set out to develop glass ceramic materials using waste coca cola glass bottles and magnesite from Sakatsimta in Adamawa state. A reagent grade chrome (coloring agent) were used to modify {{the composition of the}} coca cola glass bottle;  X-ray fluorescence(XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize <b>raw</b> materials, four <b>batches</b> GC- 1 = Coca cola glass frit + 1 %Cr 2 O 3, GC- 2 = 97 % Coca cola glass frit+ 2 % magnesite+ 1 %Cr 2 O 3, GC- 3 = 95 % Coca cola glass frit+ 4 %magnesite+ 1 %Cr 2 O 3, GC- 4 = 93 %Coca cola glass frit+ 6 %magnesite+ 1 %Cr 2 O 3 were formulated and prepared. Thermal Gradient Analysis (TGA) results were used as a guide in selection of three temperatures (7000 C, 7500 C and 8000 C) used for the study, three particle sizes - 106 + 75, - 75 + 53, - 53 µm and 2 hr sintering time were also used, the sinter crystallization route of glass ceramic production was adopted. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), the density, porosity, hardness and flexural strength of the resulting glass ceramics were also measured. The resulting glass ceramic materials composed mainly of wollastonite, diopside and anorthite phases depending on composition as indicated by XRD and SEM, the density of the samples increased with increasing sintering temperature and decreasing particle size. The porosity is minimal and it decreases with increasing sintering temperature and decreasing particle size. The obtained glass ceramic materials possess appreciable hardness and flexural strength with GC- 3 and GC- 4 having the best combination of both properties...|$|R
40|$|Wollastonite (CaSiO 3), an {{important}} industrial raw material, has been attempted to synthesize from its constituent oxides i. e. CaO and SiO 2. Besides its industrial importance. This synthesis was per-for-med {{on account of}} insufficient availability of wollastonite in natural for-me Rice husk and limestone were used as source materials for the said oxides. Abundantly available r-ice husk was pyroprocessed under varying time temperature conditions to obtain ash with maximum percentage of silica, having dominant amorphous character Rice husk ash. With highest silica yield i. e. 92. 01 %, was purified by different physico-chemical methods to eliminate the metallic impurities and residual carbon. Thus prepared silica, being 98. 50 % pure, was reacted with CaO from limestone. Two routes were adopted to synthesize wollastonite. In first, CaO obtained by proper calcination of limestone was inter-mixed with silica, the mixture pulverized and hydrothermally treated in autoclave under water vapour pressur-e from 30 bars to 80 bars, for one hour. The resulting inter-mediate compounds i. e. calcium silicate hydrates. were investigated employing chemical analysis, SEM and XRD techniques. Hydrothermal runs, carried out under 50 and 70 bars water vapour pressure. resulted in formation of xonotlite and tobermorite respectively. These, being structurally related to wollastonite were calcined at 950 oC for three hour-s, to eliminate the chemically combined water molecules. Secondly. prepared silica and limestone powders were mixed in 1 : 1 molar ratio and a mineralizer having glass like composition was added. Direct solid state synthesis was attempted by heating the <b>raw</b> mixed <b>batches</b> at The products obtained through both. hydrothermal and solid state routes. were evaluated and mutually compared as we 11. Wollastonite resulting from hydrothermal process showed comparatively low yield and was not as well crystalline as that from the latter route. Batches sintered at 1200 oC and 1300 oC produced {{the highest percentage of}} Î²-wollastonite and Î±-wollastonite respectively. The rate of solid state reaction was found proportional to rise in temperature. Reactivity of rice husk ash silica towards CaO was also considered for its comparison with that of the commonly available variety i. e. quartz. Chemical kinetic study of produced wollastonite showed that required energy of activation was 27. 48 KCal. mole- 1. While on the other hand. this value for the same synthesis, utilizing quartz instead of rice husk ash silica. amounted to 78 KCal. mole- 1. Consequently, amorphous form of rice husk SiO 2 proved to be many times more reactive than crystalline variety of the same. This was also shown by the results regarding evaluation of synthesized CSH. Utilization of synthesized wollastonite. in ceramic tile bodies. was also tried. Both, natural as well as synthetic wollastonite were separately added (55 %) to other batch components with fixed proportions and raw bodies were fired under identical conditions. Fast firing tile technology saves both time and energy simultaneously. It was observed in this regard that produced tile bodies matured within two hours instead of twelve hours. the time required for tiles without wollastonite. Considerable saving in time and heat energy can be made in tile production by using wollastonite. Physical properties i. e. crushing strength. transverse breaking strength and water absorption etc. of these bodies were determined and found comparable...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{shows the}} advantages of re-melting post-consumer glass, but also the potential risks of using contaminated cullet in the <b>raw</b> material <b>batch</b> of glass furnaces (e. g. container glass furnaces). As an example of potential advantages: increasing the cullet % in the batch of an efficient end-port fired regenerative container glass furnace from 65 up to 75 % decreased the specific energy consumption from 3. 95 MJ/kg molten glass to 3. 8 MJ/kg and reduced the direct CO 2 emissions with 31 grams per kg glass. Additional, lower indirect CO 2 emissions can be taken into account, since less primary raw materials have to be applied, saving fossil energy in raw material synthesis (e. g. synthetic soda production). Waste glass has to be sorted and prepared in dedicated cullet recycling (treatment) plants (CTP) to meet the strict quality standards often expressed in maximum mass fraction of ceramics, stones, china, metal (ferro & non-ferro) and color mismatches that can still be accepted. But, also the presence of organic components (fats, oils, sugar, food residues, [...] ) has to be controlled to avoid production or glass color problems. Contamination of cullet may lead to: 1. Glass quality problems: inclusions or color changes; 2. Glass melting disturbances by foaming or limited heat transfer into melt; 3. Glass furnace lifetime, by downward drilling of melts of metals, present in the cullet. The most important problems today {{are related to the}} presence of glass ceramics in the post-consumer waste glass and the variable amount of different colors in the glass cullet or fluctuating contamination by organics. Even small pieces of china or glass ceramics in the cullet, with sizes less than 5 mm, may end as glass defects in glass products. Larger pieces of glass ceramics may even lead to severe interruptions in the gob formation process, due to problems with cutting of the gobs with high viscous inclusions. In modern cullet treatment plants most ferro- and non-ferro metals are rather effectively removed. Glass-ceramics are very difficult to distinguish from normal soda-lime-silica glass, because color and transparency can be almost the same. Specific techniques have to be applied to detect glass-ceramic pieces in the cullet based on X-Ray absorption, X-Ray fluorescence, Hyper-spectral Imaging or UV techniques. Such systems are recently applied in modern waste glass treatment plants in Europe, delivering recycling cullet to the glass industry. This paper will show the glass defects related to the presence of glass-ceramics and the typical compositions of these inclusions (often present as cord or big knots). Organic materials can pyrolize within the batch blanket to form carbon rich residues. Carbon or cokes can react with sulfates in the batch and will cause formation of sulfides. A high level of sulfides in the batch (instead of sulfate) will jeopardize the fining process, may cause changes in fining onset temperature, may cause foaming around the batch blanket, or may lead to chemically reduced glass or even amber cords. The process of radiant heat transmission in the melt will change with a variation of the oxidation state of the melt (redox state of batch & cullet). Examples of glass defects caused by metal contamination in the batch will be shown. The composition of the metal inclusions (glass defects) in the glass product may be very different from the composition of the original contamination, causing the defect. An example is metallic aluminum that leads to silicon inclusions in the glass. Nickel sulfide can be formed by pollution of the glass melt by stainless steel flakes. Liquid metals are very aggressive towards the refractory bottom materials of the tank. A droplet of molten lead for instance will drill a hole in the refractory layers: "downward drilling". The presentation will show the relation between glass defects and their origin in contaminated cullet and the mechanism of defect formation or defect conversion...|$|R
40|$|Excessive sodium {{consumption}} is one contributor to {{high blood pressure}} and cardiovascular disease, and the Institute of Medicine has recommended that salt levels be reduced in food, including processed meats. As such, it is critical to understand the interaction of salt level and meat species with regards to characteristics of further processed meat. Salt-soluble protein extraction, important in forming meat emulsions, is dependent on several factors including species of protein source. As such, the purpose of our first study was to quantify the amount of salt-soluble proteins in various muscles of three species commonly used in meat products - beef, pork, and chicken. Pork and beef serratus ventralis (dark) and semitendinosus (light) muscles, and chicken pectoralis major muscles (light) and the entire thigh (dark) were used. Samples were analyzed for salt-soluble protein content at salt (NaCl) concentrations ranging from 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1 %, 1. 5 %, 2 %, 2. 5 %, 3 %, to 3. 5 %. Overall, there was an increase in extractable salt-soluble protein content as the salt concentration increased. The interaction of species and salt showed all species were different (P < 0. 05) from one another when compared at the same salt concentration when corrected for fat and moisture content with chicken showing the greatest extractability. In chicken, extractable salt-soluble protein was increased (P < 0. 01) in light muscles compared with dark muscles. In industry, most processed products include 1. 5 - 3. 5 % salt, and at these levels we have demonstrated that chicken meat had more salt-soluble proteins to aid in the processing of meat products. Given the advantage of chicken overall and in chicken light muscles compared with dark muscles, the purpose of the second study was to evaluate characteristics of products manufactured from pectoralis major muscle (light) and the entire thigh (dark) of chicken. The study was designed as a complete randomized design in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement with factors of muscle type (light and dark) and salt concentration (0. 5 %, 1 %, 1. 5 %, and 2 %). Bologna was manufactured and analyzed for salt-soluble protein content, proximate analysis, cooking yield, pH, Minolta L*, and binding strength. In thigh muscle bologna <b>batches,</b> <b>raw</b> and cooked moisture content, as well as cooked fat content, was increased over breast muscle batches (P < 0. 01). Increased retention of moisture in thigh muscle bolognas contributed to improved cooked yields compared to breast muscle bolognas (P = 0. 01). We were especially interested in whether characteristics of low-salt (??? 1 %) light muscle bolognas were similar or superior to higher salt (??? 1. 5 %) dark muscle bolognas. Therefore, we used a single degree of freedom contrasts to compare these products. Low salt breast bolognas exhibited slightly higher (0. 05 percentage units) salt-soluble protein extractability (as a percentage of crude protein) compared with higher salt thigh meat bolognas. The increase in salt-soluble protein content, however, was not reflected in a higher break strength value for low-salt breast bologna compared to high-salt thigh bologna (P < 0. 01). Hardness increased in low-salt breast bologna compared to high-salt thigh bologna (P < 0. 01). Low salt breast bologna showed acceptable processing characteristics and textural properties, therefore {{it can be used to}} manufacture low salt products...|$|R
