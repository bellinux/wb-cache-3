The maximum <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> is obtained in the case that the electrode length and streamwise location equals 60 mm and 0. 75.

40|$|Abstract Abstract The {{reason to}} measure the <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> in a {{combustion}} engine is to extract combustion parameters {{in order to achieve}} closed loop control of the combustion i. e. control of the spark, fuel and air into the engine. By using the spark plug, in a spark-ignited engine, as a probe it is possible {{to measure the}} <b>ion</b> <b>current.</b> The purpose with this thesis is to improve an existing <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> interface. A ringing caused by the ignition coil will follow by the <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> signal. Now the need of energy in the spark increase. Since increased energy in the spark gives a longer burn time and a longer ringing the ringing will extend into the <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> signal. The problem with the old interface is that the ringing is not symmetrical which could cause problems when filtering the signal. The aim of this thesis is to achieve a symmetrical ringing and a interface that can handle an <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> amplitude from 0, 1 µA to 1 mA...|$|R

Retarding field energy analyzers (RFEA) {{have been used}} to measure IEDs because they are considered accurate, relatively simple and cost effective. However, their usage for critical {{measurement of}} <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> density is less common due to difficulties in estimating the proportion of incident <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> reaching the current collector through the RFEA retarding grids. In this paper an RFEA has been calibrated to measure <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> density from an ion beam at pressures ranging from 0. 5 to 50. 0 mTorr. A unique method is presented where the currents generated at each of the retarding grids and the RFEA upper face are measured separately, allowing the reduction in <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> to be monitored and accounted for at each stage of ion transit to the collector. From these I-V measurements a physical model is described.
