40|$|The {{accumulation}} of soil moisture {{during the period}} of summer fallow between successive winter crops of wheat has been examined for a number of localities on the Darling Downs, and for the seasons 1951 - 1954. The moisture gain to a depth of 4 ft between the harvest of one crop and the planting of the succeeding crop ranged from — 0 - 3 to 5. 0 in., with an average of 2. 2 in. representing 17 per cent. of the rainfall. <b>Available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting averaged 42 ̆ 78 in., the excess of 2. 6 in. over fallow gain being due to the <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> already in the soil at the preceding harvest. In this locality, therefore, moisture accumulation commonly occurs prior to harvest, owing to rainfall in excess of crop requirements at this period. The average values for <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting were well below the capacity of these soils for storage to 4 ft. Values following long fallow averaged 6. 5 in., and were as high as 9. 1) in. in one instance. Correlations have been sought between fallow <b>moisture</b> gain and <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting, and the associated soil and climatic factors. The more important findings were:Total rainfall during the fallowing period was not correlated with fallow moisture gain. Fallow <b>moisture</b> gain and <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting were correlated with March-April rain. Fallow moisture gain was correlated negatively with <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at the preceding harvest and positively with <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting. The clay content of the soil and depth of surface mulch were not significantly related to fallow moisture gain nor to <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting. No significant difference in moisture accumulation was observed between sites stubble-mulched and those stubble-bumt. Explanations in terms of climatic and soil characteristics are offered for the results obtained. Features considered important are the characteristics of the rainfall and the high-evaporation conditions, the low rate of moisture penetration in wet soil, and the high moisture-holding capacity of the surface soil layers...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects on}} wheat yields of <b>available</b> soil <b>moisture</b> at planting, {{rainfall}} {{during the growing}} period, and évapotranspiration were examined for the years 1951 - 1954. The relation between free water surface evaporation, <b>available</b> soil <b>moisture,</b> and évapotranspiration was examined for the years 1951 and 1952. Wheat yields {{were found to be}} correlated with <b>available</b> soil <b>moisture</b> at planting for the four years combined, the two drier years combined (1951 and 1953), and the two wetter years combined (1952 and 1954). The relationship for the four years combined was sufficiently strong to suggest that <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> at planting could be successfully used for yield prediction. Yield was correlated with évapotranspiration only for the dry year 1953. The ratio of yield to évapotranspiration was found to be lower for the years of high rainfall during the growing period, the mean values for the wet and dry years being 2. 1 and 3. 5 bus. /in. respectively. Growing-period rainfall was correlated with yield only for the month of August for the two dry years of 1951 and 1953 combined.

40|$|Moisture {{availability}} {{to plants}} {{is an important}} land quality that is relevant {{in a wide variety}} of circumstances. Efficient use of this <b>available</b> <b>moisture</b> particularly in most arid and semi-arid regions of the world that suffer from insufficient and unreliable rainfall conditions is essential. Beside the problem of moisture in these areas, management aspects have a great impact on the production of annual as well as perennial crops. In Mozambique, cashew is one of the major tree (perennial) crops that produce by many farmers. But, the production has been declining over years thereby directly affecting the economies of a number of families involved in the production of this crop. Climatic factors and management practices are among the constraints that lead to low yield of this crop at present in the area. This study was formulated based on this concept to assess the impact of climatic variation and management on yield of cashew using a crop-climate model and comparative performance analysis methods respectively. Magnitude of Climatic variation was estimated using Thronwaite water balance method. The temporal and spatial variation of climate has direct influence on the variability of <b>available</b> soil <b>moisture.</b> In other words, it has an impact on the productivity of crops. Based on this fact, the impact of the critical period of <b>available</b> soil <b>moisture</b> (i. e. June to October) on yield of cashew was analysed. In temporal case, the linear multiple regression analysis based on 3 -years <b>available</b> soil <b>moisture</b> and yield of cashew at (#= 5 %), resulted in a multiple R = 17 %.

40|$|AbstractThe {{classical}} Mitscherlich {{equation is}} based on Liebig's Law of the Minimum and describes the yield response of a crop {{to an increase in}} the main factor that is limiting growth. The maximum, or potential, yield is an important parameter in the Mitscherlich equation and is assumed to be constant, that is, not affected by other factors that limit actual yields under field conditions. The assumption that potential yield is a constant does not apply to rainfed agriculture in semi-arid regions because under such conditions potential yields vary with crop-available moisture. A theoretical framework for the application of the Mitscherlich equation to rainfed crop production is presented. Water-limited potential yield is assumed to be a linearly increasing function of <b>available</b> <b>moisture.</b> Similarly, the quantity of nutrients required by a crop to achieve water-limited potential yield is assumed to be a linearly increasing function of seasonal rainfall. Finally, nutrient availability is also thought to depend on <b>available</b> <b>moisture.</b> The general form of the modified Mitscherlich equation for response to nutrients is simplified, by expressing all moisture dependent parameters as functions of annual rainfall...|$|R
