[...] Some displays have more than three primaries, often called MultiPrimary, such as the combination of <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> and yellow (...) , or <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue</b> and white (W), or even <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> yellow, and cyan (...)

5000|$|For example, a Bayesian would {{model the}} color of a car as a {{probability}} distribution over (<b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue),</b> assigning one number to each color. Dempster-Shafer would assign numbers to each of (<b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>blue,</b> (<b>red</b> or <b>green),</b> (<b>red</b> or <b>blue),</b> (<b>green</b> or <b>blue),</b> (<b>red</b> or <b>green</b> or <b>blue))</b> which do not have to cohere, for example Bel(red)+Bel(green) != Bel(red or green). This may be computationally more efficient if a witness reports [...] "I saw that the car was either blue or green" [...] in which case the belief can be assigned in a single step rather than breaking down into values for two separate colors. However this can lead to irrational conclusions.|$|R
