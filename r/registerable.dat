25|$|In modern Australia, general {{practice}} is listed by the AMC {{as a medical}} specialty and the RACGP as the specialist college responsible for assessment, as endorsed by the Medical Board of Australia inaugurated in 2010. Yet, on further examination of how {{general practice}} is considered across the nation, some of the now-defunct state-based Medical Practitioners’ Boards such as Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, did not consider general practice a medical specialty and general practice qualifications, such as the Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (FRACGP) were not <b>registerable</b> qualifications. The practical implication of the nationalisation of medical registration {{on the status of}} general practice as a medical specialty may be unclear.|$|E
25|$|The {{medical schools}} {{in both the}} Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland – Queen's University Belfast, the University of Dublin (Trinity College), some {{constituent}} institutions of the National University of Ireland (University College Dublin, University College Cork and National University of Ireland, Galway), and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland— award the degrees of MB BCh BAO. The letters BAO stand for Baccalaureus in Arte Obstetricia (Bachelor of Obstetrics), a degree unique to Ireland which the Irish universities added in the 19th century as the legislation at the time insisted on a final examination in obstetrics. This third degree is an anachronism which is not <b>registerable</b> with the Irish Medical Council nor the British General Medical Council (GMC). The only exception is the newly established University of Limerick graduate entry school of medicine which awards BM BS for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Terms {{which are}} not protectable by themselves, such as a generic term or a merely {{descriptive}} term that has not acquired secondary meaning, may become <b>registerable</b> when a Top-Level Domain Name (e.g. dot-COM) is appended to it.

2500|$|While {{they are}} {{recognized}} by the American Kennel Club (AKC) for its Foundation Stock Service as Peruvian Inca Orchid dogs, they cannot be shown at AKC shows, they are also <b>registerable</b> with FCI, UKC, NKC, APRI, ACR. Some breeders think that interbreeding with coated (Peruvian) dogs is required to maintain functional teeth and nervous system health in subsequent generations. They say that breeding of hairless with hairless (and common but unacknowledged culling of hairy pups from litters to maintain a [...] "pure" [...] image) leads to short-lived dogs with serious health problems.|$|E
2500|$|A {{trademark}} may {{be eligible}} for registration, or <b>registerable,</b> if it performs the essential trademark function, and has distinctive character. Registerability {{can be understood as}} a continuum, with [...] "inherently distinctive" [...] marks at one end, [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "descriptive" [...] marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and [...] "suggestive" [...] and [...] "arbitrary" [...] marks lying between these two points. [...] "Descriptive" [...] marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning – consumers have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator – to be protectable. [...] "Generic" [...] terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks. (See the KitKat v Cadbury case.) ...|$|E
2500|$|LRCPI LRCSI, {{or simply}} LRCP, denotes a holder of the {{historical}} non-university qualifying licenciates awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to students of the RCSI's medical school under the Irish Conjoint Scheme. Unlike the corresponding licentiates awarded by the Royal Colleges in Scotland and England (which were external qualifications), these qualifications are still <b>registerable</b> with the Irish Medical Council, {{but not with the}} British GMC. Students at RCSI still receive these licences but now also receive the degrees MB BCh BAO, due to RCSI's status as a recognised college of the National University of Ireland. The RCSI students received a Licence in Midwifery (LM) from each college, {{in the same way that}} the Irish universities granted BAO degrees, so their qualifications were sometimes expressed as L & LM, RCPI, L & LM, RCSI or more misleadingly as LLM, RCP ...|$|E
2500|$|The Subaru Rex {{represented}} {{a fresh start}} designwise, sharing little of its appearance with the Subaru 360, although they were mechanically the same and shared a rear-engine layout. The Rex also retained the 360/R-2's rear swing axle. The appearance of the new Rex {{was similar to the}} new larger platform, the Subaru Leone. The Rex originally featured the same water-cooled 356cc EK34 two-stroke engine as used in the R-2, and was available only as a two-door sedan. In February 1973 a four-door sedan was added, and a three-door [...] "Van" [...] was added in February 1974. The Van was <b>registerable</b> as a commercial vehicle, allowing for considerable savings in taxes and fees. The EK34 engine came with a [...] single carburetor on the Custom L, Super L, and other trim levels down to Standard, or a [...] double carburetor for the sporty GSR. The TS (Touring Sport) received a [...] iteration. The GSR was also somewhat lower than its counterparts, due to radial tires being fitted.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1973 the {{two-stroke}} {{was replaced}} by a 358cc rear-mounted, watercooled, two-cylinder, four-stroke engine called the EK21. This produced [...] at a peaky 8,000rpm and [...] of torque at 6,500rpm, and featured Subaru Exhaust Emissions Control (SEEC). The car also received a minor facelift (with a [...] "frowny" [...] rather than the smiling grille seen on the turqoise four-door in the infobox being the most obvious difference) and a new chassis code: K22. Front disc brakes were also introduced as an option at the same time. The four-stroke Rex could reach a top speed of [...] The three-door, two-seater [...] "Van" [...] (K42) arrived in February of the next year, when a five-speed version (Custom5) was also added. In September (1974), along with a minor facelift consisting of a new grille and bumpers adjusted to allow for the fitment of larger license plates, a [...] "Wagon" [...] version (K26) appeared. This received four permanent seats, but was no longer <b>registerable</b> as a commercial vehicle and had a considerably lower max load. At the same time, a [...] "Super L" [...] version of the Van was added. Vans and Wagons received a lower tuned engine, with [...] at 7,500rpm; but torque increased somewhat to [...] at 5,700rpm. This became the power output of the standard Rex as well for model year 1976 after the SEEC-T (Subaru Exhaust Emission Control - Thermal and Thermodynamic) emissions control system was introduced in December 1975. Torque was down to [...] at 6,000 rpm. The equipment levels were also reshuffled, with the B-type replacing the Standard and then rising from the A via the AG and A to the AG on top. The A and AG versions received disc brakes in front, but the five-speed was no longer available.|$|E

50|$|Females are induced ovulators; {{the act of}} mating and the {{presence}} of semen causes them to ovulate. Females usually conceive after just one breeding, but occasionally do have trouble conceiving. Artificial insemination is technically difficult, but it can be accomplished. Alpacas conceived from artificial insemination are not <b>registerable</b> with the Alpaca Registry.|$|E
50|$|Lionel who {{was born}} in 1914 and schooled at Nalanda College Colombo passed his Senior Cambridge Certificate and gained {{entrance}} to Ceylon Medical College. Later he was qualified with honours in Medicine and Surgery with a Licenciate that was recognised as a <b>registerable</b> qualification with General Medical Council in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|The Jack Russell Terrier {{is notable}} in that its primary breed club, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, {{specifically}} regulates inbreeding and linebreeding to a 16% coefficient of relationship. However, {{it is still}} a modern purebred dog breed, descended from known ancestors, and crossbred (with another breed of dog) dogs are not <b>registerable.</b>|$|E
50|$|The United Examining Board {{was formed}} in 1993 to {{administer}} non-university qualifying examinations in medicine and surgery.

50|$|Firstly, the {{application}} is assessed by an examiner for deficiencies which go to formalities. The next stage is substantive examination, where the main {{grounds of objection}} could be raised: absolute grounds for refusal (e.g. where the mark is inherently not <b>registerable),</b> and relative grounds for refusal (e.g. where the mark is identical or similar to mark covered by an application or registration filed earlier in time).|$|E
50|$|Bailie and Jeannie of Bothkennar are {{the founders}} of the modern breed; {{there are only a few}} other {{registrable}} blood lines, preserved in large part by the perseverance of Mr. Nicolas Broadbridge (Sallen) and Mrs. Betty Foster (Bredon). These are based on Turnbull's Blue—a Bearded Collie from pure working stock, registered in ISDS when ISDS still registered non-Border Collies. He sired three litters of <b>registerable</b> Bearded Collies.|$|E
50|$|The {{specialist}} qualifications {{obtained through}} The CMSA {{are known as}} Fellowships, a designation {{similar to that used}} in various countries.

5000|$|The joint receivers' issued summons for {{determination}} {{claiming that}} (1) although the clause referred to [...] "equitable and beneficial ownership" [...] {{it did not}} have the effect of creating a bare trust {{for the benefit of the}} sellers, but rather it created a floating equitable charge in favour of the sellers; and (2) such a floating charge was created by the buyer company would therefore <b>registerable,</b> and so was void if not registered (as was in fact the case).|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} {{of states and}} the federal government apply systems based on conviction offenses only, where the requirement to register as a sex offender is a consequence of conviction of or guilty plea to a [...] "sex offense" [...] that triggers a mandatory registration requirement. The trial judge typically can not exercise judicial discretion, and is barred from considering mitigating factors with respect to registration. The definition of a <b>registerable</b> sex offense can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another.|$|E
