Michael sets up a meeting with a potential investor and makes a list of potential salesmen to join the company.

500|$|Frederick Hinde Zimmerman (October 17, 1864 – September 21, 1924) was an American banker, farmer, {{real estate}} entrepreneur, businessman, and hotel owner. [...] Due to his large land {{holdings}} and expertise in farming Zimmerman became a notable farmer, breeder, {{and real estate}} entrepreneur during his life. [...] Zimmerman's farm, originally purchased by his grandfather Thomas S. Hinde {{from the federal government}} in 1815, included the Grand Rapids Dam, Hanging Rock, and Buttercrust. [...] His first experience <b>running</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> was in 1883 when he ran a grocery store in Fort Smith, Arkansas with his cousin Harry Hinde.

500|$|Arthur was {{discharged}} from the RAAF on 14February 1946, and took up residence in Darwin, Northern Territory. Initially working for the Repatriation Department, in 1950 he joined the Australian School of Pacific Administration, and later travelled to Vietnam to establish a dairy farm at Bến Cát under the Colombo Plan. He was captured by the Viet Cong in 1961 and was not released until a ransom was paid—reportedly an Olivetti typewriter. He continued to work in Vietnam after this incident, and by 1966 was <b>running</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> supplying duck feathers to the American military for use in life jackets. Returning to Australia, he was administration manager for Geopeko, the exploration unit responsible for discovering the Ranger uranium deposit at Jabiru. Wilf Arthur died on 23December 2000, {{at the age of}} 81. The Kittyhawk [...] "Polly" [...] that he flew in his DSO-winning action of 14April 1943 was purchased by the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, in 1992 and put on display in its Aircraft Hall.|$|E
500|$|Carla Cohen, {{after losing}} her {{job with the}} Carter administration, decided to create an {{independent}} bookstore in Washington, D.C., despite having no previous experience with <b>running</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> She partnered with Barbara Meade, whom she found through the classifieds, and who, with her previous experience of managing a bookstore, became a co-owner early on. Cohen decided to name the store Politics and Prose because it was [...] "Washington-sounding" [...] and not pretentious, and the two co-owners founded the store in 1984. Meade worried that the name was a put-off, and the store struggled at first to attract authors to speak at its events and relied on local journalists to publicize the location. The store's original location in the Forest Hills neighborhood was {{across the street from}} its current spot, and in 1989, Politics and Prose moved to their present larger location after finding success. Politics and Prose has over the years expanded their sections and collections. The store merged with a nearby children's bookstore, the Cheshire Cat, and incorporated its staff in 1990.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed {{a great deal from}} when he was younger. [...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not <b>running</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business. [...] And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2012, Hill {{was charged}} with three counts of tax fraud or failing to file taxes (Title 26 USC § 7202 Willful failure to collect or pay over tax) not tax evasion [...] on $1.8 million of income earned between 2005 and 2007. During this time she had toured as a musical artist, earned {{royalties}} from both her records and from films she had appeared in, and had owned and {{been in charge of}} multiple corporations. In a long post to her Tumblr, Hill said that she had gone [...] "underground" [...] and had rejected pop culture's [...] "climate of hostility, false entitlement, manipulation, racial prejudice, sexism and ageism." [...] She added that, [...] "When I was working consistently without being affected by the interferences mentioned above, I filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family." [...] On June 29, 2012, Hill appeared in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark and pleaded guilty to the charges; her attorney said she would make restitution for the back taxes she owed. By April 22, 2013, Hill had paid back only $50,000 of the $554,000 she owed immediately; U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo criticized Hill, saying [...] "This is not someone who stands before the court penniless. This is a criminal matter. Actions speak louder than words, and there has been no effort here to pay these taxes." [...] Hill also faced possible eviction from her rented home in South Orange as well as a civil lawsuit from the town for <b>running</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> out of a home without a zoning permit.|$|E

2500|$|Verein agent D.H. Klaener greeted Meusebach's {{arrival at}} Galveston and {{immediately}} apprised {{him of the}} desperate straits of the colonists. [...] The finances were in disarray, due to Prince Solms' lack of business experience and his refusal to keep financial records. To a larger degree, the financial situation happened because the Adelsverein was an organization of noblemen with no practical backgrounds at <b>running</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> They were {{on the other side}} of the world and did not witness the situation both Prince Solms and Meusebach were dealing with. Henry Fisher had not supplied transport and supplies for which the Verein advanced money to him. Fisher had also conspired in February 1845 with Dr. F.
