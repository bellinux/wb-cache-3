First we obtain the experimental values {{from the book of}} Palik (Palik 1998) and use them to obtain the <b>complex</b> <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> for each material. Then the program varies the three parameters that need to be extracted and try different combinations to obtain the <b>complex</b> <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity.</b> The square of the <b>complex</b> <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> obtained using the extracted parameters are subtracted from the square of the <b>complex</b> <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> obtained using experimental values. The squared differential term is then compared with a predetermined tolerance value which is near to zero and the iteration goes on until the preset value is reached. The variation in the modeling parameters is random; however, boundary limits have been set so that the extracted parameters meet the requirement of the FDTD method. Varying the modeling parameters in a random fashion is the most challenging part of the algorithm. If a linear method was used to vary the parameters, the computation time would have been much higher. Since the variation is random, it takes less time to find a combination of values that produces the least squared difference.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: The {{material}} properties of greatest importance in microwave processing of a dielectric are the <b>complex</b> <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> ε = ε′- jε″, {{and the loss}} tangent, tan δ = ε″/ ε′. The real part of the permittivity, ε′, sometimes called the dielectric constant, mostly determines {{how much of the}} incident energy is reflected at the air-sample interface, and how much enters the sample. This paper shows the reflection coefficient of a material and the depth of penetration of a dielectric. Therefore the larger the value of the real part of the <b>complex</b> <b>permittivity,</b> the more the incident energy will be reflected by a dielectric but the energy that enters the material will penetrate further than in a dielectric with the same ε″ but lower ε′. However, the most important property in microwave processing is the dielectric loss, ε″ which predicts the ability of the material to convert the penetrating energy into heat. Measurements of ε′ and ε″ are therefore critical in the microwave processing of materials with or without primer. The dielectric constant, ε′, dielectric loss, ε″, and hence <b>complex</b> <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity,</b> ε and loss tangent, tan δ, of some commonly used thermoplastics have been measured at various temperatures and frequencies. These results may be used to determine whether various fibre-reinforced thermoplastic (FRTP) composites are suitable for microwave processing.
