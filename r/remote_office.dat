50|$|Most {{companies}} with <b>remote</b> <b>offices</b> are now connected via a Wide area network (WAN). Applications {{tend to become}} centrally hosted at the head <b>office</b> and <b>remote</b> <b>offices</b> are expected to pull data from central databases and server farms. As applications become more hungry in terms of bandwidth and prices of dedicated circuits being relatively high in most areas of the world, instead of increasing {{the size of their}} WAN circuits, companies feel the need to properly manage their circuits to make sure business-oriented traffic gets priority over best-effort traffic. Traffic shaping is thus a good means for companies to avoid purchasing additional bandwidth while properly managing these resources.|$|R
