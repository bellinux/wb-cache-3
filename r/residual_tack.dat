The number of wheel passes to rutting failure observed during the HWTD test was dependent on the aggregate source as well as on in-place density of the cores. Laboratory pull-off tests showed that most cores were fully bonded at the interface of the 4. 75 -mm NMAS overlay and the HIPR layer, regardless of the tack application rate. The failure mode during pull-off tests at the HMA interface was highly dependent on the aggregate source and mix design of the existing layer material. This study also confirmed that overlay construction with a high tack coat application rate may result in bond failure at the HMA interface. Twelve different 4. 75 -mm NMAS mix designs were developed using materials from the aforementioned but two binder grades and three different percentages of natural (river) sand. Laboratory performance tests were conducted to assess mixture performance. Results show that rutting and moisture damage potential in the laboratory depend on aggregate type irrespective of binder grade. Anti-stripping agent affects moisture sensitivity test results. Fatigue performance is significantly influenced by river sand content and binder grade. Finally, an optimized 4. 75 -mm NMAS mixture design was developed and verified based on statistical analysis of performance data...|$|E
40|$|Interface bonding between hot-mix asphalt (HMA) {{overlays}} and Portland {{cement concrete}} (PCC) pavements {{can be one}} of the most significant factors affecting overlay service life. Various factors may affect the bonding condition at the interface, including HMA material,tack coat material, tack coat application rate, PCC surface texture, temperature, and moisture conditions. The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of these parameters on the permanent deformation of the HMA overlay. This study includes three major components to achieve the objective: laboratory testing, numerical modeling, and accelerated pavement testing. This report presents and analyzes the laboratory testing results. A direct shear test device was built and utilized to investigate the characteristics of the HMA-PCC interface and to determine the interface shear strength in the lab. Tests were run in monotonic mode at a constant loading rate of 0. 47 in/min (12 mm/min). Test specimens were prepared using field PCC cores, laboratory prepared HMA, and tack coat materials provided by the supplier. Parameters affecting the interface performance that were evaluated include HMA material type (SM- 9. 5 surface mix and IM- 19. 5 A binder mix), tack coat type (SS- 1 h and SS- 1 hP emulsions, and RC- 70 cutback), tack coat application rate, PCC surface texture, temperature, and moisture conditions. Test results showed that the asphalt emulsions SS- 1 h and SS- 1 hP produced greater interface bonding strength than the cutback asphalt RC- 70. The SM- 9. 5 surface mix was found to have better interface strength than the IM- 19. 0 A binder mix. The HMA tested produced the same trend of interface shear strength with tack coat application rate for various tack coat types. The optimum <b>residual</b> <b>tack</b> coat application rate for the SS- 1 hP emulsion using IM- 19. 0 A binder mix was 0. 04 gal/yd 2 (0. 18 L/m 2) in the lab. The direction of tining on the PCC produced no effect on interface shear strength at 20 oC. However, the milled concrete surface provided greater interface shear strength than both tined and smooth PCC surfaces for the same tack coat application rate. At the optimum tack coat application rate, the smooth PCC surface produced higher interface shear strength than the tined surface. As temperature increased, interface bonding strength decreased. Moisture conditioning significantly decreased the interface shear strength. This reduction was more pronounced when a stripping-vulnerable binder mix IM- 19. 0 B was used.
