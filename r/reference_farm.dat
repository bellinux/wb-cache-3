The endotoxin worst case values varied from less than 0. 01 to greater than 50 micrograms/m 3 in symptom farms (median 6. 4 micrograms/m 3, geometric mean 2. 2 micrograms/m 3) and from less than 0. 01 to greater than 50 micrograms/m 3 in <b>reference</b> <b>farms</b> (median 42 micrograms/m 3, geometric mean 29 micrograms/m 3).

About 75 % of the activity was found in the non-respirable fraction. No correlation was found between exposure to endotoxin and symptoms in farmers. There were weak, but statistically significant, correlations between endotoxin concentrations and total spore count or dust concentrations.

Using a 10 -year period dataset, obtained from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) WAM model archive and calibrated with a global buoy and Topex satellite altimeter database by OCEANOR, the global theoretical wave power potential has been estimated. This theoretical potential is reduced due to several geographic constraints like shipping activity, ice coverage and marine protected areas. Subsequently, the global and regional technical potential is determined using a cost-trade off model and assuming a reference device and a <b>reference</b> <b>farm.</b> The global technical potential was estimated to be 3, 695 TWh/year with high potential regions Oceania (847 TWh/year), Western Europe (704 TWh/year), South-America (excluding Brasil) (534 TWh/year) and the USA (431 TWh/year). These results were used to construct a cost-supply curve, which gives an impression of the current levelized cost of electricity. The lowest costs were estimated to be 15 US$ 2005 cents per kWh, which is compared with conventional electricity sources and more the developed renewables (in the order of 5 to 10 ￼US$ 2005 cents/kWh), too high to compete in the current electricity mix.

Mitigation options suggested in the literature mainly focused on a signle gas and dealt with isolated processes. An intagrated modelling tool was developed to assess the effect of farm practices on reactive nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions at the whole farm level. It integrated the farm model FARMSIM developed during the GreenGrass project (2002 - 2004) and using the IPCC methodology to simulate emissions from farm components (housing, manure management, livestock energy consumption). The FARMSIM model was coupled with two process-based models of ecosystems : the cropland model CERES-EGC and the grassland model PASIM. Prior to model use to assess mitigation options, a sensitivity analysis was carried out {{to reduce the number}} of input factors to be measured or collected for model calibration. The model inputs were biophysical parameters (e. g., soil and vegetation parameters, emissions factors), farming practices (e. g., N management, grassland management, herd management, farm structure,land use change) and meteorological conditions. Simulated output variables were N 2 O, CH 4, CO 2, NH 3, emissions.

40|$|Introduction, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} When this project began in 1996 the UK supply of organic vegetables, from 2400 hectares, was insufficient {{to meet the}} growing market {{and the majority of}} organic vegetables were imported. It was a policy objective to enable UK farmers {{to meet the demands of}} this growing market. A farmer converting to organic agriculture is faced with a range of specific agronomic and economic challenges different from those of conventional agriculture and of established organic systems and a lack of knowledge about these challenges was recognised as a major barrier for individual farmers considering conversion. The overall aim of this project was therefore to provide information on the agronomic and economic performance of farming systems which included field vegetables as part of their rotations during the conversion period and in the years immediately afterwards. The project was commissioned in 1996 as Project OF 0126 T, later continued as OF 0191; this report describes the findings from both projects. The projects were led by HDRA with HRI (now Warwick HRI), EFRC (Elm Farm Research Centre), and the Institute of Rural Sciences (University of Wales, Aberystwyth) as subcontractors. The main objectives were: 1. 	To convert 12 ha (Hunts Mill) of the farm at HRI Wellesbourne to an organic system, with a rotation including field vegetables and arable crops. 2. 	To assess agronomic and economic performance of the crops grown, soils, weeds, pest and diseases, during conversion and for the first target rotation at Hunts Mill. 3. 	To assess the overall agronomic and financial performance during the first full cycle of the rotations at Hunts Mill, comparing scenarios where the initial fertility building phase was 29 months, 17 or 7 months. 4. 	To assess the agronomic and economic performance during conversion at 10 commercial <b>reference</b> <b>farms,</b> representing contrasting scenarios of organic vegetable production. 5. 	To interpret and evaluate the data and to produce information appropriate to aid farmers who are undergoing, or who are considering undergoing conversion to organic systems, and to aid future policy making on related <b>farming</b> issues. The <b>reference</b> <b>farms</b> were selected to represent three different scenarios of conversion (from conventional arable, from conventional intensive vegetable and from conventional mixed farms with livestock). The farms represented a range of sizes and were located in all the principle vegetable growing areas of England. The assessment period covered the two-year conversion period itself plus at least the first three years of certified organic production. The basic experimental approach was to use all the farms as case studies for monitoring and documenting the performance of the systems undergoing conversion. Comparisons were made between Hunts Mill and the <b>reference</b> <b>farms</b> and also between the <b>reference</b> <b>farms</b> representing the same vegetable production scenario and between the three different scenarios. See main document for a summary of findings. More specific key agronomic and economic findings can also be found in the main report. Conclusions The project has demonstrated that the process of conversion from conventional agriculture to organic vegetables production is often quite complex involving a significant number of innovations and restructuring of the farm systems, including changes in production, the introduction of new enterprises and marketing methods. These have resulted in a number of physical, financial and management changes both during the transition process and on the final organic farm businesses. The project has demonstrated that large-scale organic vegetable production is technically feasible, with soil fertility, weeds and pest and disease problems overcome without too much difficulty. The biggest challenges have been marketing, managing labour and making it financially viable at the farm level. Organic Farming Scheme payments have only made small contributions to the ‘cost of conversion’. Conversions, especially on the larger farms, would seem to be preferable over a 5 to 10 year period, allowing time to make the necessary learning and adjustments. Further research Monitoring at Hunts Mill has been extended until 2006 as part of a new project: Organic field vegetable production – baseline monitoring of systems with different fertility building strategies (OF 0332). Monitoring of some of the <b>reference</b> <b>farms</b> has continued as part of the project The Sustainable Vegetable Systems Network (OF 0340). This project monitors agronomy and economics and aims to assist in the development of established organic vegetable systems. Economic conditions change and the impact of the new CAP reforms beginning in 2005 would merit further research. The models developed within this project could form the basis for this work...|$|R

40|$|Current {{production}} systems for flower bulbs in the Netherlands employ considerable quantities of pesticides and nutrients per unit area. In 1993, {{an association of}} growers and environmentalists set out to design new farming systems that meet environmental objectives in addition to economic objectives. To support the design process, an explorative study was carried out to bring together the fragmented agronomic information and to assess agro-technical options for sustainable flower bulb production with a time horizon of 10 to 15 years. Crop and inter-crop management systems representing the agro-technical components of sustainability at the farm level, were generated with a computer model by systematically varying four system characteristics, three of which represented strategic and tactical aspects of crop protection. Subjective components, one economic and two environmental objectives and various socio-economic constraints, were identified in interaction with the stakeholders. Interactive multiple goal linear programming was used to optimize the objectives at the farm level and determine the exchange value of the economic objective {{in terms of the}} environmental objectives. Calculations were carried out for two <b>reference</b> <b>farm</b> types. The results revealed that the negative impact of environment-oriented {{production systems}} on farm gross margin is importantly mitigated by strategic choices at the farm level, such as renting land and allowing a soil health improving crop, even though of low gross margin, into the rotation. In contrast, the a priori attention of the growers was focused on improving tactical pest and nutrient management at the crop level, the effect of which on farm gross margin is constrained by the strategic choices. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the need for more insight into the ecology of soil-borne growth reducing factors and their effect on crop yield. The paper describes the approach used, reports results and discusses the usefulness of the approach for the stakeholders and for disciplinary crop protection research...|$|E
40|$|Smallholder {{dairy farms}} that intensify {{production}} risk resource degradation and increased dependence on external feeds and fertilizers {{due to lack}} of knowledge and appropriate technology, which undermines farm productivity and profitability. Here we analyze underlying causes at farm level of such process through an integrated analysis at the farm scale by assessing current resource use efficiency for grazing-based dairy farming systems representative of NW Michoacán, Mexico. Whole-farm yield gaps were quantified by comparing current farms to virtual reference farms that have the same farm surface area but improved farm management. Productivity of reference farms was calculated by assuming best crop production practices (as observed within the set of case study farms) and improved herd management. Three family-based (FB) and three semi-specialized (SS) dairy systems spanning three levels of intensification in terms of density of livestock units (LU) : extensive (E, 1. 2 LU ha- 1) were monitored during one year (rainy and dry seasons) to assess productivity and resource use efficiencies. Milk production was generally low and variable (2. 2 – 4. 3 Mg milk cow- 1 lactation- 1, and 0. 6 – 5. 8 Mg ha- 1) due to high incidence of mastitis, a large fraction of non-productive animals in the herd and inefficient reproduction management. During the dry season, grazing areas provided insufficient metabolizable energy, and milk production was sustained through increased use of concentrates (from 310 g kg- 1 DMI in rainy season to 454 g kg- 1 DMI- 1 in dry season of the herd) and conserved forage. All farms had positive nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium balances, averaging 75 ± 16, 15 ± 6, and 19 ± 6 kg ha- 1, respectively. Nutrients in animal excreta were mostly not recycled on the farms but lost to the environment, and nutrient surpluses increased with livestock density. The reference farms exhibited an attainable milk yield of 2. 7 Mg ha- 1 on the basis of full feed self-supply, and 4. 2 Mg ha- 1 when the crude protein limitation in the ration was lifted. Compared to the <b>reference</b> <b>farm</b> actual milk yields were on average 78. 4 % lower on FB farms and 57. 9 % lower on SS farms. The underlying causes of the farm yield gap differed between farms and were due to sub-optimal areas of forage maize, low forage and forage maize productivity and deficient herd management. We conclude that the farm yield gap analysis was effective in identifying the major shortcomings in management of the dairy farming systems and enabled formulation of change avenues for farm reconfiguration focusing on combined improvements in crop, feed and herd management and recycling of nutrients through manure management...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Soil {{organic matter}} is {{considered}} {{as an indicator}} of soil quality, because of its role on the stability of soil structure, water holding capacity, microbial activity, storage and release of nutrients. Although changes and trends of organic matter are assessed on the basis of organic carbon, it responds slowly to changes of soil management. Therefore, identifying sensitive components of organic carbon such as carbon labile lead to better understanding of the effect of land use change and soil management on soil quality. The main components of sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions are the amount of water; and soil and water salinity. Water deficit and irrigation with saline water are important limiting factors for cropping and result in adverse effects on soil properties and soil quality. Soil carbon changes is a function of addition of plant debris and removal of it from soil by its decomposition. If the amount of organic carbon significantly reduced due to the degradation of the soil physical and chemical properties and soil quality, agricultural production will face serious problems. To this end, this study was done to evaluate soil quality using soil labile carbon and soil carbon management indices in some agricultural lands of Neyriz area, Fars province, Iran. Materials and Methods: Five fields were selected in two regions, Dehfazel and Tal-e-mahtabi, consisted of irrigated wheat and barley with different amount of irrigation water and water salinity levels. Three farms were located in Dehfazel and two farms in Tal-e-Mahtabi region. In each farm, three points were randomly selected and soil samples were collected from 0 - 40 cm of the surface layer. Plant samples were taken from a 1 x 1 square meter and grain crop yield was calculated per hectare. Water samples were obtained in each region from the wells at the last irrigation. Physical and chemical characteristics of the soil and water samples were determined. Soil labile carbon and carbon management indices also were calculated. In carbon management index calculation, a <b>reference</b> <b>farm</b> was chosen at the vicinity of two regions which were abandoned for years. Statistical analysis like analysis of variance and correlation coefficients was done using SPSS 16. 0 software. Results and discussion: Results revealed that the highest crop yield (with the average of 5. 7 tonh- 1) was related to the farm which was irrigated with saline water (water EC 8. 1 dSm- 1) with enough water crop requirement. As this farm received the highest amount of water (with thw volume of 1039. 5 mm), it seems that much more irrigation water probably provided the leaching fraction and prevented salt accumulation in the the root zone. Therefore, water salinity could not be a limiting factor for crop growth in this farm. This farm also had the highest content of organic carbon but it didn’t have the highest labile organic carbon and carbon management index (the value of 161. 5). On the other hand, the farm containing the highest labile carbon and carbon management indices (the value of 284), didn’t have the highest crop yield (with the average of 2. 6 tonha- 1) although it has recieved enough amount of water as well as non-saline irrigation water (water EC 2. 28 dSm- 1). The more carbon management index represents the higher soil carbon lability and soil quality and it demonstrates that soil have better condition for living microorganisms. Therefore, it can be concluded from the results that the higher soil quality not necessarily resulted in higher crop yield. Many researchers reported that better soil properties are not always resulted in the higher productivity. Taking everything into account, carbon management index is not related to crop yield, but since it indirectly is related to microbial activity and calculated easily, it could be a useful indicator for rapid assessment of soil quality. Meanwhile, this indicator may be associated with qualitative properties of the crops such as grain protein, which is recommended for future investigations. Conclusion: Results showed that labile organic carbon is more sensitive to crop management than total organic carbon. Amount of irrigation water and its salinity can influence the labile organic carbon content and thus the soil quality even in the fields with the same crop yield and management. Although, a higher amount of carbon management index does not result in higher yield production, it may be associated with crop quality attributes. More investigation is needed to give better idea in this regard...|$|E

40|$|In the mid-altitude {{zones of}} Madagascar, {{cropping}} systems based on direct seeding, {{with a cover}} crop and crop rotation, have been disseminated on smallholdings {{since the turn of}} the century with a degree of success. In order to disseminate these new cropping patterns, CIRAD and its development partners in Madagascar have developed modelling tools to monitor and assess activities through a DSS (Decision Support System). For developers, these tools provide decision-support in the technological choices to be implemented depending on their physical environment and their type of farm. In agricultural development projects, decision-support and negotiation between operators and with farmers is a priority, so that actions live on after the end of the project. CIRAD is endeavouring to optimize extension efforts by proposing techniques and services that are truly adapted to each type of farmer. This type of initiative is being implemented as part of development projects in the regions of Lake Alaotra (BV-lac project, Lake Alaotra watersheds), Vakinankaratra and southeastern coast (BVPI-SE/HP project). The aim is to adapt technical and organizational messages to farmer realities and promote innovation processes including direct seeding mulch based cropping systems (DMC) for sustainable production as well as the integration of agriculture and animal production. A selfappraisal method for farmers'groups and a network of <b>reference</b> <b>farms</b> have been developed. These tools can also be used to assess technical actions and provide support in defining aspects of public agricultural development policy. CIRAD proposes self-appraisal sessions where farmers in producer organizations themselves identify innovation processes adapted to them, using the "Accelerated Propagation of Innovation" (API) method (Belloncles). The method requires prior coaching of the participants so that they can give thought to a situation then act appropriately. This prior coaching is provided by socio-organization specialists. At Lake Alaotra, CIRAD used the API method with associations of irrigation water users, the federation of user associations in the network of the two irrigated areas: "PC 15 " and "Marianina Valley", as wall as with agricultural intensification groups and farmer groups integrating DMC practices. The transmission of technical information within the farmer groups applying DMC was a frank success. The analysis identified how DMC techniques are effectively adopted and revealed a potential will to increase intensification from the 4 th or 5 th year of DMC. The development project partners thereby acquired experience in organizing and running these sessions. The method has been formalized in the form of a BV-lac working document available from CIRAD. New cropping systems are assessed in networks of <b>reference</b> <b>farms.</b> A network of <b>reference</b> <b>farms</b> is a set of farms representative of different agricultural and socio-economic situations. The farms are monitored annually, to measure the impact of technical actions and development policies and carry out prospective analyses. Olympe software is a tool developed by CIRAD, INRA and IAMM (Mediterranean Agricultural Institute in Montpellier) to simulate farm activities. It can be used to test the robustness of a technical choice, and farm's resilience when faced with a series of hazards. Simulations of the adoption of new techniques are carried out with standard crop management patterns that provide reliable data over a large number of plots through prospective analysis. Applying this approach to the adoption of direct-seeding mulch-based cropping systems at Lake Alaotra helped development operators to make progress in their work. Consequently, the technical possibilities offered to famers have become more adapted to the constraints faced by different types of farms. In particular, the levels of cropping system intensification proposed are more adapted to risk levels acceptable to producers...|$|R

Thanks to the existence of a useful database of nitrate profiles measured through six years in the whole Walloon Region, validation of the simulations in the vadose zone can be realised. The comparison of the measured data and the simulation shows a good accuracy of the EPICgrid model. Peer reviewe...|$|R

This study {{was carried out in}} the Andaman Coast of Thailand to elucidate (a) the impact of cage farms on phytoplankton production, and (b) how water quality affects the phytoplankton community in the area. Phytoplankton and water quality were monitored in cage culture farms from April 2007 to May 2008 in four provinces, (Phang-nga, Krabi, Trang and Satun) along the coast of the Andaman Sea, in southern Thailand. Phytoplankton and water samples were taken from <b>reference</b> and cage <b>farm</b> stations. <b>Reference</b> stations were concurrently sampled from locations outside the cage farm. In our investigation, all water quality variables showed non-significant differences between the <b>reference</b> and cage <b>farm</b> stations at all study sites (p> 0. 05). The exception was dissolved oxygen concentration at the Ban Kura study site, Phang-ang province. ANOSIM testing indicated significant phytoplankton community differences between <b>reference</b> and cage <b>farm</b> stations at the study sites in Phang-nga and Krabi provinces. However, the study sites in Trang and Satun province...|$|R

Avoid using features in the design that will cause the flag to become dated or obsolete, e.g., a <b>reference</b> to <b>farming</b> could be timeless but depicting a particular style of tractor will date very quickly. Imagine the flag in a historic setting and in a very modern setting to check whether it would work in both." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe NOWITECH <b>Reference</b> Wind <b>Farm</b> is a {{base case}} wind farm model created for {{research}} and benchmarking. The <b>reference</b> wind <b>farm</b> is using an adapted version of the DTU 10 MW reference turbine, and {{is similar to the}} Dogger Bank Creyke Beck A wind farm in terms of size and distance to shore. The focus of this paper has been to research cost effective solutions for the internal grid in an offshore wind farm. As offshore wind farms and wind turbines grow in size, it could be a better solution to install 66 kV collector grids within the wind farm rather than 33 kV collector grids. In order to save costs it is also researched if it is possible to eliminate the expensive transformer substation within offshore wind farms connected to shore with HVDC technology, as the HVDC converter platform already contains a transformer. The <b>reference</b> wind <b>farm</b> was implemented as a MATLAB Simulink model in order to run load flow simulations to analyze the efficiency of these internal grid configurations. A cost analysis was also carried out for the internal grid in the wind farm. Results show that installing a 66 kV collector network saves cost both in terms of lower power losses and cheaper cables. Overall cost might still increase due to more expensive transformers, but uncertainties in the cost estimates makes it difficult to assess whether 33 or 66 kV collector grids are more economical. Eliminating the transformer substation also saves a large amount of costs, as long as the distance between the clusters of wind turbines and the HVDC converter platform is moderate. The savings is realized mainly due to the elimination of the expensive platform structure, but is offset by higher cable costs as distance to the converter platform increases. A more detailed study of challenges related to removing the transformer platform in terms of fault handling and redundancy should be conducted in the future...|$|R
