40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) and financial risk. We posit that media coverage of CSI generates risk by providing conditions that increase the potential for stakeholder sanctions. Through analyzing an international panel of 539 firms during 2008 – 2013, we find that firms receiving higher CSI coverage face higher financial risk. We show that {{the reach of the}} reporting media outlet is a critical condition for this relationship. Once the outlet has a high reach, the severity of CSI coverage is a boundary condition that further reinforces the effect. Our findings complement existing theory about the <b>risk-mitigating</b> <b>effect</b> of corporate social responsibility by illuminating the risk-generating effect of CSI coverage. For executives, these insights suggest complementary strategies for corporate risk management...|$|E

The bank {{is exposed to}} credit risk and may use credit default swaps (CDS) for hedging purposes. Regulation is found to induce the risk-neutral bank to behave in a more risk-sensitive way: Compared to a situation without regulation the optimal volume of loans decreases more as the riskiness of loans increases. CDS trading is found {{to interact with the}} former effect when regulation accepts CDS as an instrument to mitigate credit risk. Under the Substitution Approach in Basel II (and III) a risk-neutral bank will over-, fully or under-hedge its total exposure to credit risk conditional on the CDS price being downward biased, unbiased or upward biased. This interaction promotes the intention of the Basel II (and III) regulations to “strengthen the soundness and stability of banks”, since capital adequacy regulation without accounting for the <b>risk-mitigating</b> <b>effect</b> of CDS trading would stimulate a risk-neutral bank to take more extreme positions in the CDS market. banking, regulation, credit risk...|$|E
