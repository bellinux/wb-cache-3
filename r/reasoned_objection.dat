40|$|The {{ideal of}} {{personal}} autonomy faces a challenge from advocates of orthonomy, who think good government should displace self-government.

This paper recasts these objections as part of an intramural debate between approaches to autonomy that accept or reject the requirement for robust rational capacities.

2500|$|Students {{sometimes}} resist critical pedagogy. Student {{resistance to}} critical pedagogy {{can be attributed}} to a variety of <b>reasons.</b> Student <b>objections</b> may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: [...] "Resistance in this context thus occurs when students are asked to shift not only their perspectives, but also their subjectivities as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed." [...] Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or ideologies, introduced in the classroom, is a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.|$|R
50|$|However, {{this theory}} is {{unacceptable}} {{for a variety}} of <b>reasons.</b> Two <b>objections</b> are theoretical. First, this theory is not derivable from a Lagrangian, unlike the Newtonian field theory (or most metric theories of gravitation). Second, the proposed field equation is linear. But by analogy with electromagnetism, we should expect the gravitational field to carry energy, and on the basis of Einstein's work on relativity theory, we should expect this energy to be equivalent to mass and therefore, to gravitate. This implies that the field equation should be nonlinear. Another objection is more practical: this theory disagrees drastically with observation.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether a pass/fail system is more appropriate for medical education instead of a grade-based system, a survey of medical students and faculty members of Hallym University, Korea, was taken.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} the genomic DNA yield and the {{microsatellite}} and {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) genotyping success rates of genomic DNA extracted from {{a large number of}} mouth swab samples. In total, the median yield and quality was determined in 714 individuals and the success rates in 378, 480 genotypings of 915 individuals. The median yield of genomic DNA per mouth swab was 4. 1 µg (range 0. 1 – 42. 2 µg) and was not reduced when mouth swabs were stored for at least 21 months prior to extraction. A maximum of 20 mouth swabs is collected per participant. Mouth swab samples showed in, respectively, 89 % for 390 microsatellites and 99 % for 24 SNPs a genotyping success rate higher than 75 %. A very low success rate of genotyping (0 %– 10 %) was obtained for 3. 2 % of the 915 mouth swab samples using microsatellite markers. Only 0. 005 % of the mouth swab samples showed a genotyping success rate lower than 75 % (range 58 %– 71 %) using SNPs. Our results show that mouth swabs can be easily collected, stored by our conditions for months prior to DNA extraction and result in high yield and high-quality DNA appropriate for genotyping with high success rate including whole genome searches using microsatellites or SNPs. Genomic DNA is commonly extracted from peripheral blood samples for genetic studies of families and populations. Blood sampling, however, is expensive and an invasive procedure to which, for ethical <b>reasons,</b> <b>objections</b> may be raised. Several noninvasive DNA sampling methods using buccal cells were reported including mouth swabs, cytobrushes or rinses (Burge...|$|R

40|$|The Fairtrade {{movement}} in the UK has witnessed impressive growth over the last ten years. Fairtrade products are now available beyond the dedicated network of church halls and Oxfam shops and through the mainstream retail sector. Whilst this growth has been widely represented {{as the result of}} thousands of individual citizen-consumers ?voting? for fairer trade, this thesis tells a different tale. Moving away from accounts of consumption that rely on models of conscious, expressive and reflexive choice, the study demonstrates the importance of paying attention to the increasing institutionalisation of forms of collective Fairtrade purchasing, as well as the ways in which orientations towards consumer goods are guided by levels of commitment to varied social practices. Based within a Fairtrade town ? a place with a community of Fairtrade supporters who are actively campaigning to switch the systems of collective provision within the town to Fairtrade-only lines ? and employing a range of mixed-method research techniques, this thesis uniquely pays attention to both the ?Fairtrade supporter? and the ?non-Fairtrade supporter?. In so doing it highlights why attempts to change people?s behaviour through the provision of information alone are unlikely to be successful. Consumers are not infinitely malleable and the practices that guide their routine consumption are supported by a whole range of collective structures, including cultural norms and discourses, institutional frameworks and infrastructures of provision. These are not easily transformed through interventions aimed at the individual level, in other words individuals? behaviours, attitudes and choices. The thesis also contributes to debates about levels and types of citizen-engagement, interrogating the assumption that those who do not engage in Fairtrade consumption behaviour are apathetic or lack certain types of knowledge. Instead the findings suggest that citizen-consumers are capable of expressing <b>reasoned</b> <b>objections</b> and scepticism to the model of individual responsibility that is being directed towards them...|$|R
30|$|By {{looking at}} the above-explained studies on {{introducing}} learning styles in adaptive e-learning systems, {{there is a big}} debate. Eltigani et al.

(2007) reported that {{there is no evidence to}} support the idea that matching learning styles to learners improves learning effectiveness, although their sample was primary school children. Popescu (2009) criticized the learning style approach for several <b>reasons.</b> One <b>objection</b> is that there is a large number of learning style models, with no unanimously accepted approach. Additionally, the length of the assessment questionnaires was considered to discourage participants. Popescu (2009) suggested that learning style questionnaires should be revised for use in web-based learning systems as they ignore technology-related preferences.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this article is}} to offer a {{perspective}} from which the relations between argumentation and reflection can be investigated. The main argument proposed is that the same semiotic-dialogic mechanism that constitutes argumentation (supporting a view with <b>reasons,</b> considering <b>objections</b> and responding to opposition) has a built-in capacity to place the arguer's thinking in a metacognitive framework. Together, they are effective in orienting the thinking a person does towards examining the bases and limits of his/her own thoughts. They do so by introducing into the person's psychological field a new object for reflection the arguer's own thoughts. At the second section of the article, the analysis of some fragments of children's argumentation produced in classroom illustrates how the framework proposed can be used in investigating the development of self-regulated reflection...|$|R
