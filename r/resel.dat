40|$|Many {{studies of}} brain {{function}} with {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) involve the interpretation of a subtracted PET image, usually the difference between two images under baseline and stimulation conditions. The purpose of these studies is to see which {{areas of the brain}} are activated by the stimulation condition. In many cognitive studies, the activation is so slight that the experiment must be repeated on several subjects and the subtracted images are averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio. The averaged image is then standardized to have unit variance and then searched for local maxima (Fox et al., 1988). The main problem facing investigators is which of these local maxima are statistically significant. We describe a simple method for determining an approximate p-value for the global maximum based on the theory of Gaussian random fields as developed by Adler and Hasofer (1976) and Adler (1981). The p-value is proportional to the volume searched divided by the product of the FWHMs of the image reconstruction process, or number of resolution elements (<b>resels).</b> Rather than working with local maxima as in Fox et al. (1988), our method focuses on the Euler characteristic of the set of voxels with a value larger than a given threshold.

The stem water content in the trees of these species and the surrounding soil were monitored with TDR to examine the feasibility of this technology for recording changes in trunk water storage. The average stem water contents of the oaks reflect the soil water contents, and the temporal differences observed (17 %) point to the importance of trunk water for coping with soil water deficit. Although it would be very useful to obtain a single function to estimate the stem water content of trees, it remains necessary to obtain the results in more species.

40|$|This work {{studies the}} water table {{dynamics}} in the forested San Salvador catchment, located in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The groundwater dynamics in this catchment is characterized by three facts: i) the marked seasonality between the driest and wettest periods, {{as a result of}} the Mediterranean climatic influence; ii) the absence of overflow processes (the associated stormflow response occurs without ground saturation), which is indicating the occurrence of subsurface runoff processes; iii) the rapidly oscillating water table levels, both rise and decline; largely influenced by precipitation events, especially by their magnitude. This difference in behavior is related to forest environments, depending on soil characteristics, which are very permeable due to its high porosity and high infiltration capacity, especially in the shady slope. The study of {{the water table}} behaviour allowed us to relate it with the hydrological response and to investigate about the dominant hydrological processes in the San Salvador catchment.

Of these, the model that predicts the room-temperature crystal structure well has been used to understand the behavior of ρ -terphenyl under pressure. Lattice parameters show good agreement with the X-ray diffraction values reported by Puschnig et al. (Puschnig, P.; Heimel, G.; Weinmeier, K.; <b>Resel,</b> R.; Ambrosch-Draxl, C. High Pressure Res. 2002, 22, 105). The nonplanar structure of ρ -terphenyl transforms to a planar structure with gradual disappearance of disorder associated with ring flipping. We show that the transformation is accompanied by a change in the potential energy profile from W-shaped to a U-shaped form, which is associated with complete planarization between 1. 0 and 1. 5 GPa. Our results reported here are in excellent agreement with X-ray diffraction results which also suggest the existence of a similar transition as a function of pressure in polyphenyls such as biphenyl and ρ -hexaphenyl. Interestingly, the amplitude of the torsional motion is largest at an intermediate pressure of 1. 0 GPa.

40|$|Gully {{delineation}} is {{a critical}} aspect of accurately determining soil losses but associated methodologies are rarely detailed. Here, we describe a new gully mapping method, the normalized topographic method (NorToM), based on processing digital elevation model (DEM) data, and we assess associated errors when it is applied over a range of geomorphological scales. The NorToM is underpinned by two gully detection variables (normalized slope and elevation) calculated over local windows of prescribed size, {{and a group of}} filtering variables. For four study sites, DEMs of gullies were obtained using field and airborne photo-reconstruction and evaluated using total station and differential global positioning system (dGPS) survey. NorToM provided accurate areal and volume estimates at the individual gully scale but differences increased at the larger gully system and gully network scales. We were able to identify optimal parameters for using the NorToM approach and so confirm that is represents a useful scale-independent means of gully mapping that is likely to be valid in other environments. Its main limitations are that the normalization process might be time-consuming at regional scales and the need for a fixed window size when applied to landforms with extreme variations in dimensions.

40|$|The {{factors which}} control soil {{moisture}} patterns in a semiarid area are determined {{in two different}} locations: a burnt zone with little vegetation and an unburnt zone with a greater vegetal cover. In the burnt area, the factors affecting the spatial variability of the soil water content are those considered as local controls such as soil texture and slope. These factors are able to explain {{a significant part of}} the spatial distribution of soil moisture in this zone independently of the soil moisture state. In the unburnt area, the factors affecting soil moisture were those related with the presence or absence of vegetation in semiarid environments. The upslope contributing area, aspect, soil profile curvature and soil depth best explained the spatial variability of the soil moisture content in the vegetated zone. The actual influence of these factors showed marked seasonal variations due to changes in the physiological activity of the vegetal cover. These factors, which are in part responsible for the distribution of soil moisture, are not commonly integrated in traditional topographic wetness indices. The topographic index of Beven and Kirkby (Beven, K. J., Kirkby, M., 1979. Hydrological Sciences Bulletin 24, 43 – 69) is extended to account for the interstorm soil water losses. The new indices incorporating the hillslope aspect improve the prediction power of soil water content patterns in semiarid areas.

40|$|EN] The {{hydrological}} {{response of}} two neighbouring catchments {{in the central}} Spanish Pyrenees with similar lithology and topography but different land use was compared. One catchment (2. 84 km 2) was extensively cultivated in the past, and the other (0. 92 km 2) is covered by dense natural forest. Differences in runoff were strongly related to catchment wetness conditions and showed a marked seasonality: under dry conditions runoff tended to be greater in the former agricultural catchment, whereas under wet conditions it tended to be greater in the forested catchment. One explanation for this switching behaviour could {{be an increase in}} the hydrological connectivity within the slopes of the forested catchment as it becomes wetter, which favours the release of large amounts of subsurface flow. Differences in land use (vegetation and soil properties) dictate the contrasting dominant runoff generation processes operating in each catchment, and consequently the differences between their hydrological responses.

40|$|In this paper, a model-based {{integrated}} {{assessment of}} the long-term consequences of water erosion in four olive groves with different conditions in Andalusia (southern Spain) is carried out. The assessment {{is based on a}} system dynamics model built at hillside scale. The modelling approach tackles common difficulties arising from the relative scarcity of data and the uncertainty of the long term. On the one hand, model results have allowed characterising the nonlinear dynamics of water erosion. On the other, they have showed that positive gross margins may definitively vanish after around 100 years in some olive-growing areas. In spite of this, the adoption by farmers of soil conservation practices is limited. The assessment shows that the loss of yields due to the erosion-caused reduction in soil water availability lead to annual economic losses ranging between 1 and 2. 8 €ha- 1 yr- 1 in the studied rainfed orchards. These losses are completely obscured by the normal fluctuations in economic and production variables, so that they do not give farmers adequate warning of the consequences of non-sustainable soil management. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant sediment delivery to streams equal to 16. 1 t ha- 1 year- 1 in average was observed, whereas especially high values during years with rainfall depth above the average annual rainfall, up to 52 t ha- 1 year- 1 were recorded. Our observations within the catchment indicate that rill and gully erosion were major erosion processes which require specific control measures such as the modification of soil management for reducing soil compaction along the tractor tramlines {{and the use of}} vegetation buffers to prevent rill erosion. The analysis of the hydrological variables suggests that an adequate prediction of runoff generation within this kind of catchment should take into account the complex response of the vertic soils, causing a large variability in soil hydraulic properties associated to changes in soil moisture. To model sediment loads, in addition to the need of an accurate prediction of runoff volume and peak flow, the dominance and contribution of gully and rill erosion have to be considered.

40|$|Soil erosion {{by water}} is a {{pressing}} environmental problem caused and suffered by agriculture in Mediterranean environments. Soil conservation practices can contribute to alleviating this problem. The {{aim of this study}} is to gain more profound knowledge of the effects of conservation practices on soil losses by linking crop management and soil status to runoff and sediment losses measured at the outlet of a catchment during seven years. The catchment has 27. 42 [*]ha and is located in a commercial farm in southern Spain, where a package of soil conservation practices is an essential component of the farming system. The catchment is devoted to irrigated annual crops with maize–cotton–wheat as the primary rotation. Mean annual rainfall-induced runoff coefficient was 0. 14 and mean annual soil loss was 2. 4 [*]Mg[*]ha− 1 y− 1. Irrigation contributed to 40 % of the crop water supply, but the amount of runoff and sediment yield that it generated was negligible. A Principal Components Analysis showed that total soil loss is determined by the magnitude of the event (rainfall and runoff depths, duration) and by factors related to the aggressiveness of the events (rainfall intensity and preceding soil moisture). A third component showed the importance of crop coverage to reduce sediment losses. Cover crops grown during autumn and early winter and crop residues protecting the soil surface enhanced soil conservation notably. The role of irrigation to facilitate growing cover crops in Mediterranean environments is discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. P. Cid was supported by a JAE Predoc (CSIC) grant.

40|$|Water balance {{models on}} the monthly scale are {{commonly}} used for planning purposes due to the relative simplicity of their parameterization and because monthly data are more readily available than daily data. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the performance of three hydrological models, suitable as hydrological planning tools in rural engineering projects: one multiple linear regression (MLR) and two water balance models (one with daily and the other with a monthly time step, named DWBR and SIMPA, respectively). Runoff in both models are based on the Curve Number approach. The evaluation was conducted on a large olive orchard catchment of 308 km 2 using a daily rainfall-runoff dataset of 9 years. SIMPA and DWBR performed better than the MLR model. The SIMPA results were heavily dependent on the parameter soil water storage capacity, as determined from Monte Carlo analysis, although they showed the best adjustments (with a mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency[*]=[*] 0. 78 and 0. 66 for calibration and validation, respectively). In addition, inconsistent parameterization could be obtained in both SIMPA and DWBR when the aquifer recharge coefficient was included in the set of parameters to be calibrated. The advantage of DWBR against SIMPA is that the daily temporal scale is more physically meaningful than the monthly scale. Extreme runoff values were responsible for most simulated-measured runoff deviations for the three models.

40|$|A {{reduction}} in plant cover {{can lead to}} an increase in the erosionprocesses that diminish soil quality. Any rise in temperature resulting frompredicted climate changes may aggravate this effect, particularly in semiaridMediterranean areas. Bearing this in mind, the capacity of a soil to preserveorganic matter becomes very important if the soil is to maintain its physicaland chemical properties. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen changes wereevaluatedin a non-disturbed (with natural vegetation) and a disturbed (all vegetationmanually clipped to ground level) pine system. Nine years after vegetationremoval significant differences (p < 0. 01) were found in the soil organiccarbon content between plots (top 20 cm), but not in totalnitrogen. In the disturbed plot 0. 0232 Mg ha– 1 y– 1 of soil organic carbon were lost through erosionand 4. 30 Mg ha– 1 y– 1 throughmineralization. In the first 48 months after vegetation removal the soilorganiccarbon content fell from 40. 3 to 28. 0 g kg– 1. Inthe last 60 months of the experiment the amount of organic carbon in the soilfell from 28. 0 to 27. 7 g kg– 1. This result wasmainly attributable to the intense oxidization, which took place during thefirst 60 months, of organic matter linked to the coarse soil mineral fraction. Up to the 72 nd month the losses by erosion were a total of 532. 7 g, which rose to 1284. 4 g by the end of theexperiment(108 months). The effect of vegetation removal in a Mediterranean semiarid arealeads to a rapid decline in the amount of organic carbon stored in the soil. Such perturbation is irreversible if left to nature.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{microcatchment}} scale allows us to evaluate the real complexity of soil protection in fields, few studies have been carried out in olive groves. This paper explores, on annual and event scales, the hydrological and erosive patterns observed in an olive microcatchment of about 6. ha under non-tillage with spontaneous grass cover, where data series of runoff and sediment load have been measured in a contrasting hydrological period of over 5. years. Firstly, the features of the data series acquired in the study station and its temporal context were explored through statistical analysis (statistics, histograms and correlation test), the intensity-duration-frequency relationships and the annual values of MOPREDAS dataset (1946 - 2005). In addition, annual and seasonal patterns were checked through Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to characterize the impact of rainfall variability and management techniques. Events with return periods of under 3. years caused sediment loads between 7. 2 and 17. 0. Mg., which implies that very high soil losses can be expected from frequent events. Although the contribution of a few events to the annual runoff and sediment load is substantial, a different distribution characterized by prolonged rainfall periods and very high soil losses was observed for a >rainy year> 2009 - 2010 (with an accumulated frequency of annual rainfall close to 79 %). The PCA illustrated a seasonal pattern of events where low values of soil losses and sediment concentration were observed in spring. This is probably associated to lower soil moisture and to sediment being trapped by the grass cover. Finally, the minimal cost of the spontaneous cover for soil protection encourages its use, despite {{the fact that}} could be inefficient when inter-rill erosion is either not the main source of sediment in the catchment or it is not well-established. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|From the 1980 s onward {{studies on}} interrill soil erosion were {{intensified}} in SE Spain. The main {{achievements of the}} research {{carried out in the}} field areas of Alicante and Murcia concern: first, (1) the estimation of erosion rates directly in the field under a wide range of methodologies, different scales and different environmental conditions; (2) estimations based on existing models, such as the USLE, carried out for different subcatchments of the Segura and Júcar catchments; and (3) other parametric and physical event-based models have also been calibrated and validated. Second, the progress of the knowledge in understanding erosion mechanisms. New and reviewed concepts regarding mainly hydrological behaviour and sediment movement and transport at patch, slope and catchment scale have improved our understanding of soil-erosion processes in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. These concepts focus on: (1) the definition of runoff generation models more appropriate to Mediterranean conditions; (2) the definition of thresholds for runoff generation; (3) the definition of models of soil water redistribution within soils and at landscape level; (4) the establishment of conditions and controls for sediment detachment and movement; and (5) the characterization of the change in the controlling factors of soil erosion and degradation under different environmental characteristics (climatic or human-induced). The insights into soil-erosion processes obtained and the renewed hydrological and geomorphological concepts achieved can be very valuable for the design of new strategies of erosion management and ecosystems restoration.

Secondary succession after farmland abandonment has become a common process in north Mediterranean countries, especially in mountain areas. In this paper, a methodology is tested which combines Markov chains and logistic multivariate regression to model secondary succession after farmland abandonment in environments where abiotic constraints play a major role, like mountain areas. In such landscapes, a decay in the succession rate with time is usually found, as the best locations are progressively occupied. This is frequently addressed using non-stationary Markov chains. Here, we test if the combination of logistic multivariate regression with Markov chains, however, allows for spatially distributed transitions probabilities based on abiotic factors and therefore, it is able to reproduce the preferential colonization of the most favourable locations. The model is tested in the Ijuez Valley in the Spanish Pyrenees, which underwent generalized land abandonment during the 1950 s. Results confirm a substantial improvement in the prediction success of the Markov-logistic model when compared to the standard Markov chain approach. As a result, the decay in the succession rate can be successfully modelled. The specific results for our study area are discussed further in an ecological context. The methodology proposed is applicable to any landscape where vegetation dynamics are constrained by environmental factors. However, the inclusion of land use as an explanatory factor would be necessary in human-managed landscapes. 25 Pag., 2 Tabl., 8 Fig. The definitive version is available at: [URL] reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{soil water}} content is {{recognized}} as one of many runoff controlling factors in semiarid environments. A simple, physically based distributed model has been developed to study the role of antecedent soil water content in runoff generation in three small catchments in semiarid southeast Spain. The catchments were set up in two different zones: a burnt area with scarce vegetation and unburnt area with a denser plant cover. The infiltration process is determined by the Green–Ampt equation and the initial soil water content is taken into account by means of maps obtained by Conditional Gaussian simulation. The model was run 2700 times with different soil moisture scenarios and design storms. Stochastic sensitivity analysis was used to examine the role of antecedent soil water content in the runoff response. The results showed that the hydrological response after high intensity, low frequency storms is independent of the initial soil water content. On the other hand, the antecedent soil water content is an important factor controlling runoff during medium and low intensity storms, a type of rainstorm that is relatively frequent in semiarid areas. The sensitivity of the runoff response to soil moisture depended on the predominant runoff mechanisms. When infiltration excess overland flow is predominant, as a result of high rain intensities or less permeable soils, the runoff response is more uniform and does not depend on initial soil moisture. Runoff from less intense storms on soils of higher permeability is controlled by the soil water content of the surface soil layers and is more dependent on initial conditions. The role of the initial soil water content is more important in catchments where the presence of plant cover produces a patchwork of runoff and runon sites, whose spatial pattern is highly dependent on the soil water status.

40|$|Soil water {{repellency}} (SWR) {{has been reported}} under different soils, land uses and regions of the world, particularly in forest land and after wildfires, yet the understanding of this variable in agricultural lands is still rather limited. This study presents the characterization from field-based measurements of SWR in four contrasted olive groves (Olea europaea L.) in Spain in terms of different environmental conditions and management: abandoned and commercial farms under permanent cover crop, conventional tillage and herbicide use. The main objectives were [1] to evaluate the potential occurrence, intensity and persistence of soil {{water repellency}} in different types of olive groves and [2] to explore its spatio-temporal features {{as well as the}} influence of soil properties such as organic matter (OM) and soil moisture. The Water Drop Penetration Time test (WDPT) was used in situ to assess SWR values. Measurements were carried out in two areas {{for each of the four}} groves: below and between the tree canopies. A high spatial and seasonal variability was observed. SWR was absent (WDPT = 0 s) for the olive groves under conventional tillage and with the lowest values of OM (OM-mean = 2. 04 %). The maximum WDPT values were found for cover crop under canopy in summer (WDPT-max = 610 s) and on the lanes in autumn (WDPT-max = 468 s). SWR was developed during the dry season, and to be reduced during the rainfall season as the organic compounds might be reoriented and turned amphiphilic. Strong water repellent values (> 60 s) were related with extremely high OM values (> 12 %) for the cover crop orchard.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} into {{the environmental and}} economic impacts of different soil management strategies, spontaneous grass cover with and without gully control (SC/SCGC) or conventional tillage with and without gully control (T/TGC), based on the experimental results obtained in an 6. 1. ha olive crop microcatchment. Initially, 2. years of rainfall-runoff-sediment load data series, (34 events) recorded under the current management (SCGC), {{was used for the}} calibration of the AnnAGNPS model at event and monthly scales providing suitable adjustments of runoff, peak flow and sediment loads (. E>. 70,. r>. 0. 85). Ephemeral gullies were also identified using aerial orthophotography and field work. The module of the AnnAGNPS model for simulating ephemeral gully generation and the tillage operations based on a bibliographical review were used to compare different scenarios and to perform a 10 year-analysis. The results showed mean runoff coefficients of 10. 0 % for SC/SCGC and of 3. 2 % for T/TGC while the average sediment loads were 2. 0 t*ha - 1 *year - 1 (SCGC), 3. 5 t*ha - 1 *year - 1 (SC), 3. 3 t*ha - 1 *year - 1 (TGC) and 4 t*ha - 1 *year - 1 (T). Significant differences in sediment sources (rill/inter-rill erosion and ephemeral gullies) were evaluated between SC (46 % of gully contribution) and T (19 % of gully contribution), in order to optimize the environmental and economic effort required in each case. Finally, the annual costs associated with soil losses were estimated (< 1 €*ha - 1 *year - 1). SC was the most profitable alternative for soil management. Despite the additional reduction in soil losses of the SCGC approach, the higher cost of its implementation and the minor effect on yield losses in the medium term suggest that without additional support (such as subsidies for gully control measures), farmers would have not an obvious incentive to use it. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Olive {{orchards}} {{located in}} mountainous or hilly landscapes in Southern Spain {{have been identified}} as one of the major sources of sediments for streams in the region. This paper presents a modeling study of the magnitude and spatial distribution of sources of sediment within a small 6. 1 ha olive orchard forming a microcatchment in a mountainous area. The model used was SEDD, which was calibrated using rainfall, runoff and soil erosion patterns monitored over a 3 -year period. Although the data series are incomplete, 46 events were observed. SEDD permitted an analysis of the erosive behavior and the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) in the catchment on an event scale. High variability in catchment responses was observed, due to differences in the characteristics of storms and the seasonal ground cover. A small group of two or three erosive events, occurring mainly in autumn, were responsible for most annual runoff and sediment loads, while the impact of spontaneous grass cover was apparent in events occurring in spring, where, despite high runoff depth, the sediment loss was low. This bimodal tendency justified the calibration of the SEDD model through the medians of β-values in both the periods September-January and February-June. The results of the calibration (E= 0. 97 and RMSE= 0. 03 tha- 1) confirmed the applicability of SEDD to predict soil loss in the microcatchment and to allow us to complete the data series. Although the annual mean of SDR in the catchment for the study period was 3. 8 %, high spatial variability was found in the geomorphological units identified, with SDR values between 0. 3 % and 21. 7 %. On the event scale, probabilities of 50 % for surpassing an SDR value of 10 % were calculated for only 6 % of the catchment area. The location of these most significant sources of sediment will permit the design of more efficient management plans in order to reduce sediment discharge into streams. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.
