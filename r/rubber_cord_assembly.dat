40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} find out the effect of <b>rubber</b> <b>cord</b> elbow training to the strength of shoulder and arm muscles in volleyball extracurricular of male students of SMP Telekomunikasi Pekanbaru, so that the students be able to make an under service so the ball could reach the opponent area. The population of this experimental research was the male players of volleyball club of SMP Telekomunikasi Pekanbaru. The total number of the active players that joined the training was 10 players. The writer used Total Sampling technique to take the sample where this sampling takes all of the population as the sample (Sugiono, 2008 : 124). The instrument of this research was Expanding Dynamometer, it was aimed to measure the strength of shoulder and arm muscles. Next, the data was processed using statistics, and the writer also used the level of significance 0, 05 α to test the normality by using lilifurs-test. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis was an effect of <b>rubber</b> <b>cord</b> elbow training to the strength of shoulder and arm muscles in volleyball extracurricular of male students of SMP Telekomunikasi Pekanbaru. After being analyzed using t-test formula, the value of tobserve was 14. 07 and the value of ttabel was 1. 812, so Tobserve>Ttabel. Based on the data analysis, the average of pre-test was 14. 7 and the average of pos-test was 17. 5, so the data was normal.

50|$|The {{undercarriage}} of the Styx was fixed, {{with a wide}} track, large {{wheels and}} no cross-axle, making it suitable for roughly prepared landing fields. Each mainwheel was mounted on a V-strut hinged on the lower fuselage frame with a single, shock absorbing oleo landing leg to the upper frame. Undercarriage legs and struts were enclosed in dural fairings. There was a steel-shod, castoring, <b>rubber</b> <b>cord</b> sprung tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the MG-1 was steel {{framed and}} fabric {{covered with the}} exception of a glass fibre engine cowling.

50|$|The tail {{surfaces}} of the Vittoria were constructed, like the wings, with ply covering. The horizontal surfaces were mounted at mid-fuselage, though the tailplane was vestigial, more like a long fillet which carried large, balanced elevators with curved leading edges. The fin was broad and noticeably upswept, bearing a very broad, rounded rudder. Its undercarriage was fixed and conventional, {{with a pair of}} faired-in, wood and ply inverted L-struts on either side carrying a <b>rubber</b> <b>cord</b> sprung steel single axle, fitted with large diameter wheels.

5000|$|In January 1915 Geoffrey de Havilland piloted the D.H.1 {{prototype}} on {{its first}} flight at Hendon. Although the Renault engine left it underpowered, performance was still reasonable and the type was ordered into production, with an initial order of 49 being placed. [...] Airco was already occupied with building and designing other aircraft, so DH.1 production was undertaken by Savages Limited of King's Lynn, which had previously manufactured fairground equipment. These aircraft used a simpler <b>rubber</b> <b>cord</b> suspension, and had a revised cockpit coaming to give a better field of fire for the observer's gun.

50|$|The {{horizontal}} tail {{was mounted}} {{on top of}} the fuselage, braced from the lower fuselage longerons on each side with a pair of parallel struts. Its plan was similar to the wing and the elevators were split, with a cut-out for the deep, broad rudder. The tailplane angle of incidence could be trimmed in flight. The low area fin was broad but unusually low; its angle of incidence could only be adjusted on the ground. The H.28 had conventional, fixed, tailskid landing gear. Its mainwheels, half enclosed by individual semi-circular fairings, were on a single axle and <b>rubber</b> <b>cord</b> shock absorbers enclosed within a streamlined fairing mounted on the lower fuselage longerons by N-form struts and reinforced by the wing bracing struts.

The project emerged from a strategic investment by the University in a number of interdisciplinary fellowships, in this case across Product Design and Textiles. A commercially available but under researched fibre had been identified as a starting point with the potential for contribution to the field.

40|$|Abstract. String-like {{objects in}} our daily lives {{including}} shoelaces, threads and <b>rubber</b> <b>cords</b> exhibit interesting behaviors such as twisting, tearing and bouncing back when pulled and released. In this paper, we present a method that enables these behaviors in traditional string simulation methods that explicitly represent a string by particles and segments. We offer the following three contributions. First, we introduce a method for handling twisting effects with both uniform and non-uniform torsional rigidities. Second, we propose a method for estimating the tension acting in inextensible objects in order to reproduce tearing and flicking (bouncing back); whereas the tension for an extensible object can be easily computed via its stretched length, the length of an inextensible object is maintained constant in general, and thus we need a novel approach. Third, we introduce an optimized grid-based collision detection for an efficient computation of collisions. We demonstrate that our method allows visually plausible animations of string-like objects made of various materials and is a fast framework for interactive applications such as games. ...|$|R
