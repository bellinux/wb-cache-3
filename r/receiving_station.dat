5|$|A <b>receiving</b> <b>station</b> {{was formed}} from the {{immobile}} sections of light horse and mounted rifle brigades' field ambulances, a section from the 1/1st Welsh and the 157th Indian Field Ambulances with an operating unit, the Anzac Field Laboratory, and a detachment from an Egyptian hospital. This <b>Receiving</b> <b>Station</b> {{took over the}} site near Jericho, occupied by the main dressing station during the two Transjordan attacks, which could accommodate 200 patients in mud huts, 400 patients in tents, and 700 patients in the abandoned Desert Mounted Corps headquarters.|$|E
5|$|NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, {{was built}} as a {{high-resolution}} earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution), 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with a ground <b>receiving</b> <b>station</b> in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built {{at a cost of}} over £35 million. This satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in China.|$|E
5|$|The three divisional {{receiving}} {{stations of}} the Anzac, Australian and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions operated in echelon. As soon as one had evacuated all wounded to the rear, they moved ahead {{of the other two}} divisional receiving stations to repeat the process. However, from the beginning there were problems evacuating casualties caused by the lack of linking infrastructure, one <b>receiving</b> <b>station</b> lost all its transport, and the light motor ambulances of another disappeared. The greatest difficulty were of communication and traveling including mechanical breakdowns on the rough roads and tracks which quickly became impassable for motor traffic.|$|E

5|$|The convoys {{of wounded}} were met {{a few miles}} from El Arish by {{infantry}} with sandcarts lent by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, so the wounded who had endured the cacolets travelled in comfort to the <b>receiving</b> <b>station,</b> arriving at 04:00 on 25 December. The 52nd (Lowland) Division supplied medical stores and personnel to assist, but although arrangements were made for evacuation to the railhead two days later, evacuation by sea was planned. This had to be postponed due to a gale with rain and hail on 27 December and it was not until 29 December that the largest single ambulance convoy organised in the campaign, 77 sandcarts, nine sledges and a number of cacolet camels, moved out in three lines along the beach with 150 wounded. A few serious cases, who had not been ready to be moved, were evacuated the following day to begin their journey to Kantara on the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{satellite}} communications had started to take an increasing share of the station's business, and a programme of severe rationalisation began, leading to the closure of two transmitting sites at Leafield and Ongar. In the radio station's penultimate year to March 1999, there were on average, per month, 571 radio telegrams, 533 radio telephone calls and 4,001 radio telex calls. In 1998, British Telecom Maritime Radio Services announced its planned closure of Portishead Radio. The long-range services (HF bands 3–30MHz) ceased at midnight on 31 August 1999. The short-range VHF maritime band services (156–174MHz) closed at 12:00 on Sunday 30 April 2000, and the medium-range services (MF maritime band 1.6–3.0MHz) at 12:00 on Friday 30 June. The station closed in April 2000. The Highbridge station has been demolished. Sedgemoor District Council adopted a local development plan in September 2004 that included the site of the <b>receiving</b> <b>station</b> for future housing development. Planning permission was granted in October 2007 for a development of 190houses and flats on the site and shortly afterwards the old radio station buildings were demolished.|$|E

25|$|The telautograph, {{an analog}} {{precursor}} to the modern fax machine, transmits electrical impulses recorded by potentiometers at the sending station to stepping motors attached to a pen at the <b>receiving</b> <b>station,</b> thus reproducing at the <b>receiving</b> <b>station</b> a drawing or signature made by sender. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper. The telautograph's invention is attributed to Elisha Gray, who patented it in 1888.|$|E

By evening 409 cases had been admitted to the Anzac Mounted Division <b>receiving</b> <b>station</b> and evacuation was going on smoothly. To keep the station clear of casualties, on the following day the motor lorries, general service wagons and some of the light motor ambulances that had been brought inside the bridgehead were used to supplement the heavy cars taking the wounded back for treatment.|$|E

25|$|Teleradiology {{requires}} a sending station, a high-speed internet connection, and a high-quality <b>receiving</b> <b>station.</b> At the transmission station, plain radiographs are {{passed through a}} digitizing machine before transmission, while CT, MRI, ultrasound and nuclear medicine scans can be sent directly, as they are already digital data.

Reports are then transmitted to the requesting clinician.|$|E

25|$|The first satellite-based radio {{navigation}} system developed in the Soviet Union was Tsiklon, which had the purpose of providing ballistic missile submarines a method for accurate positioning. 31 Tsiklon satellites were launched between 1967 and 1978. The main problem with the system was that, although highly accurate for stationary or slow-moving ships, it required several hours of observation by the <b>receiving</b> <b>station</b> to fix a position, making it unusable for many navigation purposes and for {{the guidance of the}} new generation of ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the evening}} of 19 September 2006, while Thaksin was visiting New York City to attend a UN summit and speak at the Council on Foreign Relations, the army took control of Bangkok. At Government House, some 50 {{soldiers}} ordered approximately 220 policemen in the complex {{to lay down their}} weapons. Troops also surrounded the Thaicom satellite <b>receiving</b> <b>station</b> and state-run television station Channel 11. By the morning of 20 September, tanks and military vehicles armed with machine guns were stationed at Government House, the Royal Plaza and government units along Rajdamnoen Avenue.|$|E
25|$|The wounded had to {{be transported}} a few miles back from the front line to {{dressing}} stations by camels and sand carts. From there, they were taken back to collecting stations {{in the foothills of}} the Judean Hills, or along the Jerusalem to Beersheba road, from where they were evacuated to the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions receiving stations near Beersheba. Here, they were joined from 6 November, by the Yeomanry Mounted Divisional <b>receiving</b> <b>station.</b> From these divisional receiving stations, and the main infantry dressing stations, the wounded were sent back to Imara.|$|E
