The behaviour of these residues has also been studied after peeling and cooking and in individual fruits versus composite samples. <b>Residue</b> <b>levels</b> of these compounds for individual fruits suggested that a variability factor up to 3 could be set for the acute risk assessment. Levels of captan decreased more than 90 % after peeling and completely after cooking. Trichlorfon penetrates into the flesh in a proportion of 70 % of the residue at the pre-harvest interval (PHI).

50|$|One-dimensional local {{fields are}} usually {{considered}} in the valuation topology, in which the discrete valuation is used to define open sets. This will not suffice for higher dimensional local fields, since one needs {{to take into account}} the topology at the <b>residue</b> <b>level</b> too. Higher local fields can be endowed with appropriate topologies (not uniquely defined) which address this issue. Such topologies are not the topologies associated with discrete valuations of rank n, if n > 1. In dimension two and higher the additive group of the field becomes a topological group which is not locally compact and the base of the topology is not countable. The most surprising thing is that the multiplication is not continuous, however, it is sequentially continuous which suffices for all reasonable arithmetic purposes.

5000|$|The Anisotropic Network Model was {{introduced}} in 2000 (Atilgan et al., 2001; Doruker et al., 2000), inspired by the pioneering work of Tirion (1996), succeeded {{by the development of}} the Gaussian network model (GNM) (Bahar et al., 1997; Haliloglu et al., 1997), and by the work of Hinsen (1998) who first demonstrated the validity of performing EN NMA at <b>residue</b> <b>level.</b> It represents the biological macromolecule as an elastic mass-and-spring network, to explain the internal motions of a protein subject to a harmonic potential. In the network each node is the Cα atom of the residue and the springs represent the interactions between the nodes. The overall potential is the sum of harmonic potentials between interacting nodes. To describe the internal motions of the spring connecting the two atoms, there is only one degree of freedom. Qualitatively, this corresponds to the compression and expansion of the spring in a direction given by the locations of the two atoms. In other words, ANM is an extension of the Gaussian Network Model to three coordinates per atom, thus accounting for directionality.|$|E
50|$|Glyphosate {{is used as}} a pre-harvest {{herbicide}} {{and harvest}} aid on cereal crops including wheat and oats and on oil seed rape. As a systemic herbicide it is not a true desiccant as it can take weeks rather than days for the crop to die back after application. In the UK, it began to be applied to wheat crops in the 1980s to control perennial weeds such as common couch which was very effective and meant that sowing of the next crop could occur sooner. Use as a harvest aid in the UK increased after the introduction of strobilurin fungicides which prolong the longevity of the leaves, and in 2002, 12% of UK wheat crops were treated. The timing of application is crucial as the moisture content of the grain must be below 30% for the yield of the crop to be unaffected and to minimise uptake of glyphosate by the grain. Yield may be affected and residues increased if applications are made to uneven fields in which some areas have a moisture content over 30%. Although used in weed-free and evenly maturing crops with the aim of reducing the grain moisture content more rapidly to hasten the harvest, {{there is little or no}} advantage in doing so. Glyphosate was found in 5-15 % of cereal crop samples tested in the UK between 2000 and 2004, although never exceeding the Maximum <b>Residue</b> <b>Level</b> of 20 mg/kg. A survey of British wheat in 2006-8 found average levels of 0.05-0.22 mg/kg with maximum levels of 1.2 mg/kg. In July 2013 Austria banned the use of pre-harvest glyphosate citing the precautionary principle. In April 2015 an oat buyer in Western Canada announced that it was refusing oats in which pre-harvest glyphosate had been used.|$|E

Since lugworms are only rarely used in environmental monitoring, {{little is known about}} the natural variation in their body <b>residue</b> <b>levels.</b> In this study, we assessed the importance of seasonal fluctuations, spatial variation and sexual development to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) residues in lugworms. Over a period of 15 mouths, lugworms were sampled along a contamination gradient in the Western Scheldt estuary in the Netherlands. A clear seasonal pattern in the body <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> of PAH was observed, with lowest levels in March and highest levels just prior to the spawning season in September. During the spawning season the body <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> showed a marked decrease. Although this seasonal pattern is apparently related to the reproductive cycle of the lugworm, no clear differences in body <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> were found between animals with or without developed gonads. The contamination gradient, present in the estuary, was clearly reflected in the body <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> of PAH. The expected gradient of internal concentrations was, however, absent in October, when the spawning period was not yet finished. The variation in lugworm body <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> was smaller than the fluctuations in sediment PAH levels.

40|$|Plant {{protection}} products play {{an important}} role in protecting our food supply against pests, diseases and weeds. As global food demand rises, their role in maintaining the quality and quantity of our food production is likely to increase in the absence of other control methods. To manage the risks associated with pesticide usage, EU laws regulate the placing of plant protection products on the market and the monitoring of pesticide residues in food. This involves assessing the potential risks associated with human dietary exposure by conducting dietary risk assessments which take both consumption patterns and <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> of pesticides in and on food items into account. <b>Residue</b> <b>levels</b> will vary from one food item to the next so we need to know what the distribution of residues over food items is in order to assess how high <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> can be. In this thesis we introduce novel statistical approaches that can be used to obtain better estimates of the variation and uncertainty in pesticide <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> on raw agricultural products. The rst approach uses monitoring data and pesticide usage information to model the correlation in pesticide <b>residue</b> <b>levels</b> when multiple pesticides have been used. Next we introduce an approach that can be used to describe the variation in log-residue levels in units, assuming that multiple data sets share a common shape. The nal model describes both within-eld and between-field variation of <b>residue</b> <b>levels.</b> These new approaches, which provide promising alternatives to existing methods, can be implemented in existing dietary risk assessment software and will expand the suite of models available to risk assessors when assessing dietary exposure to pesticides...|$|R
