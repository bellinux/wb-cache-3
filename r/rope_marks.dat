2500|$|Victor was {{initially}} taken to nearby St. Mary's Medical Center (West Palm Beach), then transferred {{two days later}} to Jackson Memorial Hospital's burn center in Miami. He had suffered [...] "severe internal reactions" [...] to the inhalation of toxic fumes in the truck, and had chemical burns over large portions of his body. Doctors also found several previous injuries to the boy, including a broken collarbone, broken arm, scars on his buttocks and lower abdomen, and <b>rope</b> <b>marks</b> on both wrists.

She is unaware that he is the killer posing as the professor, and he strangles her with a <b>rope.</b> <b>Mark</b> and Maggie find her shortly thereafter, but the killer manipulates her voice and body in the darkness {{and the fact that she}} is dead goes unnoticed.|$|R
50|$|Early depth {{sounding}} {{was achieved}} using lead line sounding (or sounding line), where a lead weight {{attached to a}} length of <b>rope</b> <b>marked</b> with depth values. As this method was mechanical in nature, the only correction that {{was applied to the}} sounding was the reduction of the sounding for tidal height. In the mid 20th century, sonar systems were developed to allow the measurement of underwater distances using the two way travel time of an acoustic pulse. This allowed the surveyor to take many more soundings in a given period of time and was less labor intensive than using a lead line.|$|R
5000|$|Physical abuse can be {{detected}} by visible signs on the body, including bruises, scars, sprains, or broken bones. More subtle indications of physical abuse include signs of restraint, such as <b>rope</b> <b>marks</b> on the wrist, or broken eyeglasses.|$|E

50|$|Before each class, or {{the evening}} before the first class, course {{builders}} use course maps provided by the judges to place equipment on the course. The chief course builder is usually an experienced competitor who understands what equipment is legal, how it must be configured, how each must be aligned compared to other obstacles, and can direct several course-building volunteers to efficiently move the equipment into place. To make the job easier, courses are often marked {{in some way to}} correspond to a grid: for example, if course maps are printed on a grid of 10-foot-by-10-foot squares, the posts that hold the ring <b>ropes</b> <b>marking</b> the course's four sides are often set 10 feet apart.|$|R
5000|$|Firstly, the {{surveyor}} can use an air filled {{metal bar}} lowered below the transducer, attached {{at each end}} by a <b>rope</b> <b>marked</b> with depth values. If the values on the rope can be assumed to be correct, then the bar is lowered at set depth intervals and observed on the echo sounder trace. The values of echo sounder depth can be plotted against the [...] "true" [...] depth of the bar. Any fixed offset value would then {{be attributed to a}} draft value correction, and any gradient change seen is {{as a result of a}} difference in sound velocity. This method is called a [...] "Bar Check", and is performed by the surveyor prior to gathering data.|$|R
50|$|While {{she carried}} the child in her womb Colman's mother heard a prophecy that her son would be great man and surpass all others of his lineage. The {{pregnant}} Rhinagh, fearing her husband would seek to harm the child, fled.

The rock with the <b>rope</b> <b>marks</b> is on display by the Kiltartin river.|$|E
50|$|Another {{claim to}} fame {{is that the first}} floor of the inn was reputedly used as a Court of Law where capital {{punishment}} was imposed for certain offences, including sheep stealing. Legend has it that as many as 180 criminals were adjudged guilty of crimes serious enough to warrant the sentence of death by hanging, a sentence that was allegedly carried out at the inn itself, from an oak beam over the well of the staircase. Markings, said to be from <b>rope</b> <b>marks,</b> still exist on the staircase wood.|$|E

Cadfael's search of the area shows <b>rope</b> <b>marks</b> on two trees; the baron was pulled from his saddle by a rope across the path, and strangled as he lay stunned. Joscelin Lucy is suspected. Cadfael determines that Huon died shortly after dawn. The {{strangler}} wore a ring, which cut into Huon's throat. Picard is convinced that Joscelin is guilty, but Iveta says {{that he was in}} prison; when the Picards reveal his escape, she collapses.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth {{match was}} between D'Lo Brown and Gangrel. The match {{went back and}} forth until Brown {{performed}} a low blow, and a running sitout powerbomb. Brown kept the advantage until Gangrel performed a flapjack onto the <b>ropes.</b> <b>Mark</b> Henry then came down to ringside as Gangrel performed a back body drop, and a flying clothesline. As Gangrel ran at the ropes, Henry pulled down the ropes, sending Gangrel outside the ring. Brown distracted the referee as Henry sent Gangrel into the ringpost, and back into the ring. Brown then pinned Gangrel after a Sky High. After the match, Gangrel spat [...] "blood" [...] into Henry's face, attacked Brown, and performed an Impaler on Brown.|$|R
2500|$|Pisces is {{associated}} with Aphrodite and Eros, who escaped from the monster Typhon by leaping into the sea and transforming themselves into fish. In order not to lose each other, they tied themselves together with rope. The Romans adopted the Greek legend, with Venus and Cupid acting as the counterparts for Aphrodite and Eros. The knot of the <b>rope</b> is <b>marked</b> by Alpha Piscium (Î± Psc), also called Al-Rischa ("the cord" [...] in Arabic).|$|R
50|$|The scoring zones may {{be marked}} on the ground. Where this is not practical, a non-stretch <b>rope</b> or chain <b>marked</b> with the radii of the scoring zones is {{attached}} to the flag pole and swept around it to determine which arrows are in which zones.|$|R
50|$|Kraft did {{not kill}} again until January 27, 1983, when he {{abducted}} a 21-year-old hitchhiker named Eric Church. The victim was last seen alive hitchhiking from Orange County to Sacramento the day prior to his murder. His body was found discarded alongside I-605. An autopsy concluded the Connecticut native had ingested high levels of alcohol and Valium and had been sodomized. <b>Rope</b> <b>marks</b> on Church's wrists indicated he had struggled against his restraints before {{he died of a}} combination of ligature strangulation and numerous blows to the side of his skull inflicted by a blunt instrument.|$|E

The teams start with the rope's centre line directly above a line marked on the ground, and once the contest (the [...] "pull") has commenced, attempt to pull the other team such that the <b>marking</b> on the <b>rope</b> closest to their opponent crosses the centre line, or the opponents commit a foul (such as a team member sitting or falling down).|$|R
50|$|Kraft is {{not known}} to have killed again until June 16, 1979, when he {{abducted}} a 20-year-old Marine named Donald Crisel. His body was thrown from a moving vehicle onto the 405 Freeway.

5000|$|At {{the center}} of the ceiling is a shaft, 0.46 meter in diameter, which penetrates 1.7 meters up {{to the surface of the}} Stone above. (It has been {{proposed}} that this is the 4,000-year-old remnant of a shaft tomb. Another theory is that it represents a Crusader [...] "chimney" [...] cut for ventilation to accommodate lighted shrine candles. Still others have tried to make a case that it was part of a drainage system for the blood of sacrifices from the Temple altar. There are no <b>rope</b> <b>marks</b> within the shaft, so it has been concluded that it was never used as a well, with the cave as cistern.) The ceiling of the cave appears natural, while the floor has been long ago paved with marble and carpeted over.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, the Iranian {{government}} {{accused the}} US government of kidnapping him, while Iranian government media later {{reported that he}} was working for Iranian intelligence. After his return to Iran, American sources confirmed he had arrived in, or was taken to, the United States {{with the help of the}} CIA, but insisted he had not been taken or kept against his will. ABC News and the newspaper Haaretz suggested Amiri [...] "wanted to seek asylum abroad." [...] According to a 2011 report by NPR news, he [...] "was believed to be an agent-in-place for the CIA", who decided [...] "he wanted out of Iran", but once in the US [...] "got cold feet" [...] and [...] "made his way back to Iran". Nevertheless, he was sentenced to ten years in prison after returning. Despite this sentence, he was reported as executed in August 2016, and his body was returned to his family with <b>rope</b> <b>marks</b> around his neck.|$|E
5000|$|Peyer's own logbook {{revealed}} a hasty falsification {{about that time}} as well as a change he made to a traffic ticket that was actually written some time later. A rope found in his patrol car seemed to match the <b>rope</b> <b>marks</b> around the victim's neck. Gold fibers found on Knott's dress matched the gold braid on Peyer's CHP uniform shoulder patch. It was assumed that he tried to minimize the fiber transfer by placing her body on the hood of his patrol car so that no evidence of her would be found in his patrol car, but did not notice that the fibers from his shoulder patch were stuck to her dress. Skip Sperber analyzed it. Tire tracks on the bridge showed a car had hastily pulled out leaving black marks on the pavement, as what usually occurs when tire have a hard friction with the surface -- aka [...] "burning rubber". Furthermore, a drop of blood was found on one of Knott's boots which was found to be consistent with Peyer's blood type (AB negative, the rarest type) and other genetic markers, although conclusive DNA testing was not available {{at the time of the}} investigation. Purple and gold fibers were present.|$|E
25|$|England had a {{good time}} between the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Mike Denness {{returned}} to form with 157 not in their innings victory over Tasmania and 99 in a 187 run win over New South Wales. Dennis Amiss made 52 and 124 in the Sydney game and Chris Old took 7/59. Denness therefore returned to the team as England captain, replacing the injured vice-captain John Edrich who was still recovering from his damaged ribs, which had in fact been broken, not just bruised as previously thought. Australia dropped the batsman Ross Edwards in favour of the local leg-spinner Terry Jenner. There was a storm the night before the first day, which ripped the covers off the field and flooded the ground. The nightwatchman had not called the curator, so the damage could not be repaired in time for the first day's play, which had to be abandoned. The ex-Australian umpire Col Egar thought that play might not even start on the second day. What made it more distressing was that a record crowd appeared despite the series having already been won, but had to be turned away. Jim Laker and Ken Barrington were part of the crowd, escorting travel groups of British cricket fans. As it was there was a steady wind which helped dry out the ground overnight, except at the River Torrens end, but the famously long boundary was pulled in with <b>ropes</b> <b>marking</b> a now egg shaped Adelaide Oval. Denness called heads {{and for the first time}} England won the toss. With the pitch still worse for wear he chose to field, the third time the winning captain had taken this unusual course in the series.|$|R
5000|$|Over-the-line is a bat-and-ball sport, a game {{related to}} {{baseball}} and softball. Like those games, {{you have the}} batter, pitcher, and fielders. Because a game requires only three people per team, it is considerably easier {{to get a good}} informal game going. Equipment consists of a <b>rope</b> (or lines <b>marked</b> in the sand), an [...] "official" [...] softball bat and a rubber softball. No ball gloves are allowed except in women's games, however golf gloves may be used when batting. Game play, however, is very different.|$|R

5000|$|Survey usually {{involves}} walking with the instrument along closely spaced parallel traverses, taking readings at regular intervals. In most cases, {{the area to}} be surveyed is staked {{into a series of}} square or rectangular survey [...] "grids" [...] (terminology can vary). With the corners of the grids as known reference points, the instrument operator uses tapes or <b>marked</b> <b>ropes</b> as a guide when collecting data. In this way, positioning error can be kept to within a few centimeters for high-resolution mapping. Early surveys recorded readings by hand, but computer controlled data logging and storage are now the norm.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of multipurpose small earth dams in ensuring equitable and sustainable water supply especially to rural communities cannot be emphasized. Water from small dams is basically meant to improve rural livelihoods of communities dependent on reservoir water. However, {{there are some}} issues of interest {{that need to be}} paid enough attention if small dam development projects are to achieve their intended goals. In Malawi small earth dams are normally not subjected to detailed sediment transport data assessment despite the fact that currently the Malawi Government has embarked on the construction of about 350 new small dams throughout the country. Reports from {{some parts of the country}} show that sedimentation problems of dams have reached levels of great concern leading to anxieties over the availability of useable water resources and examples are given of Nyakamba and Masambanjati Small Earth Dams which were actually silted up. The Ministry of Irrigation and Water Development admits that the problem has reached levels which require serious considerations regarding catchment management issues. This study was therefore carried out at Chamakala II Small Earth Dam in order to assess the impact of sedimentation on water availability for the communities that are dependent on the reservoir water. Field reconnaissance surveys were carried out to collect catchment data on activities carried out by the local communities. Official data was referred to in many cases and interviews mostly unstructured with key informants were conducted. Currently in Chamakala Catchment there are about 8200 people, 1400 cattle, 1100 goats and 200 goats that are said to be direct beneficiaries from the reservoir water especially during dry seasons. The study looked at catchment characteristics and some activities such as cultivation practices, deforestation, land cover, soil characteristics, and grazing practices. Several studies have shown that these parameters are major causes of sedimentation of the small dams in some instances depending on other factors. The dam at Chamakala II had been desilted twice since its rehabilitation works in 2002 but continues to show signs of increasing sediment yield at an alarming average rate of 2250 m 3 /yr. In addition to the methods described above, a hydrographic survey was conducted at the dam in order to determine impacts of sedimentation on water availability in the dam. In this study a small boat, a staff and a <b>rope</b> <b>marked</b> at known intervals of 10 and 20 metres, leveling instrument and many others were used The study found that reservoir capacity was reduced by 38. 7...|$|R

30|$|Seasonal and tidal {{monitoring}} of physicochemical parameters and major nutrients was undertaken for the surface, middle and bottom layers of each water body. For in-situ measurement and laboratory analysis, water {{samples were collected}} from the three discrete layers of the selected measuring stations during post-monsoon, winter and monsoon seasons under both high and low tide conditions. Ruttner Water Sampler and DO Sampler were deployed with <b>marked</b> <b>ropes</b> to collect samples from the required depths. During in-situ measurement, water salinity was measured by refractometer (ATAGO S/Mill-E), while temperature and pH were measured by digital thermometer with stainless steel sensor probe and HANNA Microprocessor pH meter (HI, pH 211), respectively. Winklerâs method (APHA 1992) was followed during measurement of dissolved oxygen (DO), and total dissolved solids (TDS) and conductivity were identified {{with the help of}} a multi-parameter water test kit.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Aaron was a hard-hitting bare-knuckled fighter, but he fought {{in a new}} era under {{different}} rules than his famous father.
