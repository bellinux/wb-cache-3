Both Purkinje fiber and ventricular myocardium showed high density, tissue-specific binding to [3 H]prazosin. In contrast, high density, tissue-specific binding to [3 H]yohimbine was present in Purkinje fibers but not in ventricular myocardium. Membrane fractions showed high affinity, saturable, and displaceable binding with [3 H]yohimbine in preparations from canine cardiac Purkinje fibers but not those from canine cardiac ventricular myocardium. Scatchard analysis of the canine Purkinje membrane α 2 -adrenergic receptor binding showed a Bmax of 54. 9 fmol/mg protein with a Kd of 6. 25 nM. These results confirm the electrophysiological findings that post-junctional α 2 -adrenergic receptors are present in Purkinje fibers...|$|R

In the brief space of an hour she beheld the dirty bales flung off the freight cars on the sidings transformed into delicate fabrics wound from the looms; cotton that only last summer, perhaps, while she sat typewriting at her window, had been growing in the fields of the South. She had seen it torn by the bale-breakers, blown into the openers, loosened, cleansed, and dried; taken up by the lappers, pressed into batting, and passed on to the carding machines, to emerge like a wisp of white smoke in a sliver and coil automatically in a can. Once more it was flattened into a lap, given to a comber that felt out its fibres, removing with superhuman precision those for the finer fabric too short, thrusting it forth again in another filmy sliver ready for the drawing frames. Six of these gossamer ropes were taken up, and again six. Then came the Blubbers and the roving frames, twisting and winding, the while maintaining the most delicate of tensions lest the rope break, <b>running</b> the <b>strands</b> together into a thread constantly growing stronger and finer, until it was ready for spinning.|$|R

40|$|DNA {{fragment}} assembly (FA) is {{an important}} problem in molecular biology. It appears in large-scale DNA sequencing tasks. Research related to the FA problem has mainly focused into two approaches: (1) development of software tools useful in practice but using heuristic methods difficult to analyze formally, and (2) formal modeling through theoretical problems, which captures some {{but not all of}} the real issues in FA. Our goal is to hybridize these two approaches by building a software tool that is useful to the biologists and has well-understood formal properties. 1 Introduction The acronym DNA (which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid) denotes a class of molecules that carry genetic information in living organisms. Chemically, a DNA molecule is composed of two parallel <b>strands,</b> <b>running</b> in opposite directions (Figure 1.)

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} show that a deep <b>strand</b> <b>running</b> through Camus’ {{thinking}} and writing is what could be termed Camus’ own theory of ‘flesh’, comparable in its function and its scope to Merleau-Ponty’s famous notion. As is well known, in Merleau-Ponty the metaphor of ‘the flesh’ first serves ontological and epistemological purposes. It is supposed to characterise whatMerleau-Ponty thinks is the actualmode of access to physical and symbolic worlds. Beyond its primary ontological purpose, Merleau-Ponty’s writings also explore the political and aesthetic implications of the notion. In this article, I attempt {{to show that}} Camus’ absurdist stance contained as its other side a positive ontological and epistemological position, comparable to Merleau-Ponty’s. I try to unveil this other side of the absurd in Camus’ early prose. In these texts, Camus’ unique version of sensualism comes to light most strikingly, as an indissolubly ontological and literary vision. That vision traverses Camus’ novels, and gives them much of their poetic force. 13 page(s...|$|R

Although telomeres in different organisms (or even in the sameorganismunder different conditions) are maintained by different mechanisms, the disparate processes have the common goals of repairing defects caused by semiconservative replication through G-rich DNA, countering the shortening caused by incomplete replication, and postreplication regeneration of G tails.
