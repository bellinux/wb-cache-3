5|$|Silent Hill: Shattered Memories divides its {{gameplay}} {{between two}} different settings. The first section {{is set in}} a psychotherapist's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill. In the first section, the player interacts with Dr. Michael Kaufmann, a therapist who is a non-player character, from a first-person perspective. The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal issues}} of Burger King include several legal {{disputes}} and lawsuits involving the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) as both plaintiff and defendant {{in the years}} since its founding in 1954. These have involved almost every aspect of the company's operations. Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents, the company's <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences. The company's response to these various issues has drawn praise, scorn, and accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of digital marketing and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> views {{have been made}} by Reform and Conservative Jews; they hold that these criticisms are against teachings that do not exist within liberal forms of Judaism, and which are rare in Orthodox Judaism (outside certain Haredi communities, such as Chabad).

25|$|In December 1941, {{prior to}} the split between the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetniks in eastern Bosnia, the two {{overwhelmingly}} Serb forces cooperated in brutal operations against Bosniak villages. The formation of the Hadžiefendić Legion {{was one of the}} Bosniak <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> attacks. By the end of December 1941, the Legion had commenced forming battalions in Bijeljina, Brčko, Gračanica, Puračić, Živinice and Tojšići. The recruits that joined the Legion were largely Muslim conscripts that refused to join the Croatian Home Guard.|$|E
25|$|A multinomial discrete-choice {{model can}} examine the <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> {{questions}} (model G, model H, model I). However, these models are derived under {{the concept that}} the respondent obtains some utility for each possible answer and gives the answer that provides the greatest utility. It might be more natural {{to think that the}} respondent has some latent measure or index associated with the question and answers in response to how high this measure is. Ordered logit and ordered probit models are derived under this concept.|$|E

25|$|On {{account of}} the {{magnitude}} of the Holocaust, many theologians have re-examined the classical theological views on God's goodness and actions in the world. Some believers and former believers question whether people can still have any faith in God after the Holocaust, and some of the theological <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> questions are explored in Holocaust theology. Orthodox Jews have stated their reasons for why they believe the Holocaust happened and, to a more extreme degree, why they felt the Jews of Europe deserved to die.|$|E
25|$|Inconsistencies {{have been}} pointed out by critics and skeptics, {{presenting}} as difficulties the different numbers and names for the same feature and different sequences for what {{is supposed to be}} the same event. <b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> criticisms include the modern documentary hypothesis, two-source hypothesis (in various guises), and assertions that the Pastoral Epistles are pseudonymous. Contrasting with these critical stances are positions supported by traditionalists, considering the texts to be consistent, with the Torah written by a single source, but the Gospels by four independent witnesses, and all of the Pauline Epistles, except possibly the Hebrews, as having been written by Paul the Apostle.|$|E
25|$|Adherents of the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} give varied <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> criticisms. Some {{point to}} what they claim is evidence {{for the presence of}} these items and locations. Others invoke the limited geography model, regarding the events of the Book of Mormon as taking place in such a geographically limited area that no evidence should be expected. Some counter that the words used in the Book of Mormon refer not to the animals, plants and technologies that presently exist but to other similar items that did exist at the time. These views are not directly supported by the LDS Church, but they do motivate archaeological efforts to further understand these situations, including research being performed by Brigham Young University (BYU) professors.|$|E

25|$|Although Klein {{had painted}} monochromes {{as early as}} 1949, and held the first private {{exhibition}} of this work in 1950, his first public showing was {{the publication of the}} artist's book Yves Peintures in November 1954. Parodying a traditional Catalogue raisonné, the book featured a series of intense monochromes linked to various cities he had lived in during the previous years. Yves Peintures anticipated his first two shows of oil paintings, at the Club des Solitaires, Paris, October 1955 and Yves: Proposition monochromes at Gallery Colette Allendy, February 1956. Public <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> shows, which displayed orange, yellow, red, pink and blue monochromes, deeply disappointed Klein, as people went from painting to painting, linking them together as a sort of mosaic.|$|E

2500|$|By early 1974 the {{scientists}} estimated that Genie's grammar was congruous with a typical two {{or two and}} a half year old, although her progress remained unusually slow. Around [...] this time Curtiss found that, unlike most children but similar to adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients, she was completely unable to distinguish between active and passive voice, giving random <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> sentences and never gaining any use of the passive voice. In these sentences Genie would often, though not always, confuse the subject and object, contrasting with her ability to process subject–verb–object sentences in other contexts and her own subject–verb–object sentences, but these reversals were only with certain pronouns and became significantly less common by January 1974. On a test between February 1974 to July 1975, Genie also showed no comprehension of the words many, most, few, or fewest.|$|E
