40|$|Empirical {{analysis}} on wind energy in Denmark {{is used to}} quantify {{the impact of the}} various support policies in place in the last decade and infer the carbon price that would lead to the same level of deployment under the hypothesis of <b>revenue</b> <b>certainty</b> equivalence. Probit {{analysis on}} monthly data is used to test the impact of electricity price and support policies on the observation of new turbine connections to the grid. The support level is the dominant factor while the impact of the past electricity price is limited. A feed-in tariff regime significantly brings in more wind energy than a fixed premium. No difference between the impacts of a variable and a fixed premium is found. The probability of new connections {{as a function of the}} support level and the policy type is used to give an indication of the carbon price level that would support similar renewable deployment...|$|E
40|$|State {{legislatures and}} state utility {{commissions}} trying to attract renewable energy projects are considering feed-in tariffs, which obligate retail utilities to purchase electricity from renewable producers under standard arrangements specifying prices, terms, and conditions. The use of feed-in tariffs simplifies the purchase process, provides <b>revenue</b> <b>certainty</b> to generators, {{and reduces the}} cost of financing generating projects. However, some argue that federal law [...] including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Federal Power Act of 1935 (FPA) [...] constrain state-level feed-in tariffs. This report seeks to reduce the legal uncertainties for states contemplating feed-in tariffs by explaining the constraints imposed by federal statutes. It describes the federal constraints, identifies transaction categories that are free of those constraints, and offers ways for state and federal policymakers to interpret or modify existing law to remove or reduce these constraints. This report proposes ways to revise these federal statutes. It creates a broad working definition of a state-level feed-in tariff. Given this definition, this report concludes there are paths to non-preempted, state-level feed-in tariffs under current federal law...|$|E
40|$|The {{wind power}} {{industry}} in Australia {{is expected to}} grow rapidly over the next decade, primarily due to a forthcoming expanded national renewable energy target (RET) which will mandate that renewable sources provide approximately 20 % of Australia's electricity production by 2020. However, development of new wind generation in Australia has stalled as a result of several barriers to project finance, the mechanism through which most wind farms have been developed historically. This paper provides an overview of wind power financing in Australia in light of recent political and financial trends. Drawing upon existing literature and a series of stakeholder interviews, it identifies three primary barriers to project finance: regulatory risk surrounding legislation of the RET, semi-privatization of electricity retailers in New South Wales, and limited capital availability resulting from the recent global credit crisis. The paper concludes that the confluence of these barriers limits the availability of long-term contracts that provide <b>revenue</b> <b>certainty</b> for pre-construction wind projects, while simultaneously making these contracts a necessity in order to obtain project finance. In an attempt to mitigate these effects, this paper identifies four alternative development strategies that can be pursued. Wind power Project finance Wind development...|$|E
50|$|In 1999 the National Board of Revenue in Bangladesh (NBR) {{negotiated}} with cigarette producing firms a {{minimum amount of}} Value Added Tax (VAT) that should be paid per month even though VAT is an ad valorem tax, {{that is to say}} of variable yield. The NBR took this step because under the self-clearance system monitoring of production and sales of cigarettes proved to be difficult. It was agreed that if the cigarette producing firms paid the minimum revenue fixed by the NBR, physical monitoring would be withdrawn. The NBR resorted to this technique of financial management to avoid the large costs of monitoring while gaining more in <b>revenue</b> with <b>certainty.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{builds a}} {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} yield-based MPCI crop insurance policy for a risk averse rice farmer in Indonesia and presents the comparative statics analysis of policy variables on yield through the coupling, wealth, and insurance effects. Moreover, Using yield data from 1979 to 2014 for the Tuban Regency, this study applies numerical optimization to the model and simulates the effects of different policies on input use, certainty equivalents, indemnity payment, and premiums. The theoretical analysis shows that no coupling effect exists for change in the coverage level, while a coupling effect exists for change in the subsidy implying that farmers can impact {{the size of their}} payments by adjusting inputs and thus yield. For wealth effect, if the price market higher than the average cost of production, the wealth effect is ambiguous. If the price market smaller than the average cost of production, the wealth effect for the coverage levels is ambiguous, while the wealth effect for subsidy levels is negative, indicating a marginal increase in the subsidy reduces input use. For insurance effect, the analysis shows a positive sign for coverage level, revealing that an increase in the coverage level triggers the farmer using more inputs. On the other hand, the insurance effect for subsidy levels generates a negative sign, where higher subsidy cause the farmer to reduce input use. The numerical analysis shows that MPCI crop insurance indicates a moral hazard. At coverage levels of 30 % and above, the farmer does not expect to receive any indemnity payment. However, for coverage levels at or above 40 %, the farmer expects indemnity payments, which triggers a reduction in input use as the farmer tries to maximize both insurance payments and market <b>revenue</b> simultaneously. For <b>certainty</b> equivalent, farmers prefer the highest coverage level. For expected indemnity and insurance payment, farmers receive the highest payment for the largest high coverage level and subsidy. Hence, the result indicates that MPCI insurance with high coverage levels and low premium subsidies is suggested to Indonesian government since such policy results improving the farmersâ€™ wellbeing while mitigating moral hazard facing the insurance provider...|$|R
40|$|The {{costs of}} {{electric}} power projects utilizing renewable energy technologies are highly sensitive to financing terms. Consequently, as the electricity industry is restructured and new renewables policies are created, {{it is important}} for policymakers to consider the impacts of renewables policy design on project financing. This report describes the power plant financing process and provides insights to policymakers on the important nexus between renewables policy design and finance. A cash-flow model is used to estimate the impact of various financing variables on renewable energy costs. Past and current renewable energy policies are then evaluated to demonstrate the influence of policy design on the financing process and on financing costs. The possible impacts of electricity restructuring on power plant financing are discussed and key design issues are identified for three specific renewable energy programs being considered in the restructuring process: (1) surcharge-funded policies; (2) renewables portfolio standards; and (3) green marketing programs. Finally, several policies that are intended to directly reduce financing costs and barriers are analyzed. The authors find that one of the key reasons that renewables policies are not more effective is that project development and financing processes are frequently ignored or misunderstood when designing and implementing renewable energy incentives. A policy that is carefully designed can reduce renewable energy costs dramatically by providing <b>revenue</b> <b>certainty</b> that will, in turn, reduce financing risk premiums...|$|E
40|$|The {{costs of}} {{electric}} power projects utilizing renewable energy technologies (RETs) are highly sensitive to financing terms. Consequently, as the electricity industry is restructured and new renewables policies are created, {{it is important}} for policymakers to consider the impacts of renewables policy design on RET financing. This paper reviews the power plant financing process for renewable energy projects, estimates the impact of financing terms on levelized energy costs, and provides insights to policymakers on the important nexus between renewables policy design and financing. We review five case studies of renewable energy policies, and find that one of the key reasons that RET policies are not more effective is that project development and financing processes are frequently ignored or misunderstood when designing and implementing renewable energy policies. The case studies specifically show that policies that do not provide long-term stability or that have negative secondary impacts on investment decisions will increase financing costs, sometimes dramatically reducing the effectiveness of the program. Within U. S. electricity restructuring proceedings, new renewable energy policies are being created, and restructuring itself is changing the way RETs are financed. As these new policies are created and implemented, it is essential that policymakers acknowledge the financing difficulties faced by renewables developers and pay special attention to the impacts of renewables policy design on financing. As shown in this paper, a renewables policy that is carefully designed can reduce renewable energy costs dramatically by providing <b>revenue</b> <b>certainty</b> that will, in turn, reduce financing risk premiums. ...|$|E
