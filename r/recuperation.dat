40|$|This essay {{deals in}} {{material}} evidence which endorses Umberto Eco’s proposition that “immediately after the official {{ending of the}} Middle Ages, Europe was ravaged by a pervasive medieval nostalgia”. Focusing on religious plays, it draws attention to how the production of many of our manuscript witnesses to “medieval” biblical drama are products of the very early-modern impulse for antiquarian conservation of the past. This impulse, possibly impelled more widely across the arts by the losses attributable to Reformation iconoclasm, make many of our earliest witnesses themselves <b>recuperations.</b> Our manuscripts are, for the most part, not so much acting texts as early critical editions. Embarked on this hypothesis, the essay goes on to look at later endeavours – Romantic, Victorian, and mid twentieth-century – to re-present and comment on the plays understood to form the early English dramatic heritage. It suggests that the historiography of the subject merits study in its own right. It also suggests axiomatically that we should remain alert to the provisionality of our own analyses...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{scholars}} note that racism transforms its shape and character {{at different times}} and places: ideas of "race" and concepts of racism {{have been subject to}} change. I extend the work of one such scholar, Ann Stoler, who further argues that slipperiness in racial discourse – its “polyvalent mobility” – accounts for its longstanding power. The article is staged upon four episodes since World War II, narratives that trace ruptures and <b>recuperations</b> of racial discourse in Alaska through the geographies of state formation. The stories follow the entanglement of two structures used to categorize and govern Alaska’s populations: formations of “race” (particularly, indigenous / white) and the frameworks of space (rural / urban). The first and third episodes sketch the transformation of a language of “equality” for Alaska Natives in the 1940 s into a conservative discourse of “reverse racism” about rural Alaska and subsistence harvest policies in the 1980 s. The other episodes disrupt this narrative from a straightforward history of appropriation and challenge the equation of liberal Alaskan politics with anti-racism. One situates a subtle re-inscription of racial discourse in the progressive project of state formation and the social divisions that were deployed to represent “Alaska” in 1956. Public comments following the other – a discriminatory paintball attack in 2001 – neatly illustrate the slipperiness of racial discourse. This polyvalent mobility has made racism a shifty target for critique and, at the same time, accounts for some of the paradoxical power of racial discourse in modern Alaska...|$|R

In the optimizationwas first of all a full factorial design of two levels (24) was used for preliminary evaluation of four factors, involving the variables: sampling flow rate, elution flow rate, buffer concentration and pH. This design has showed that, for the studied levels, buffer concentration and pH are significant factors. Using the established experimental conditions in the optimization step of: pH 7. 0, buffer concentration of 0. 009 mol L− 1 for elution utilized HCl at 2. 0 mol L− 1, this system allows the determination of cadmium with a detection limit (LD) (3 σ/S) of 0. 05 μg L− 1 and a quantification limit (LQ) (10 σ/S) of 0. 17 μg L− 1, precision expressed as a relative standard deviation (R.

It is the expression of life under cruder and more rigid conditions than ours, lived by people who loved and hated more naïvely, aged sooner and died younger than we do. Solitary persons and single events dominated them as they do not dominate us. We range wider, last longer, and escape more and more from intensity towards understanding. And already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events, as a thing strange and terrible indeed, but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life, part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood. For a time the death of Mary obscured her life for me, but now her living presence is more in my mind again. I begin to see that it is the reality of her existence and not the accidents of her end that matter most. It signifies less that she should have flung out of life when it seemed that her living could only have meant disaster to herself and to all she loved, than that all her life should have been hampered and restricted. Through all her life this brave and fine and beautiful being was for the most part of her possibilities, wasted in a splendid setting, magnificently wasted if you will, but wasted.|$|R
