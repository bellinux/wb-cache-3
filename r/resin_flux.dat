5000|$|The terms <b>resin</b> <b>flux</b> and rosin flux are {{ambiguous}} and somewhat interchangeable, with different vendors using different assignments. Generally, fluxes are labeled as rosin if the vehicle {{they are based}} on is primarily natural rosin. Some manufactures reserve [...] "rosin" [...] designation for military fluxes based on rosin (R, RMA and RA compositions) and label others as [...] "resin".|$|E
40|$|The paper deals {{the effects}} of {{vegetable}} fluxes on the rheological properties of bitumen and asphalt concretes. Two organic fluxes which consist of a methyl ester of fatty acid of sunflower (Oleoflux) and a <b>resin</b> <b>fluxed</b> with esters moalkyl (Greenseal) have been used. The {{results show that the}} additives' content (0 % 0. 5 % and 5 %) infuences highly the viscoelastic properties. The viscoelastic behavior of the bitumen and the asphalt concretes has been modeled with existing models. From the models, it has been found that the increase of the fluxes contents reduces the relaxation time of the bitumen and the asphalt concrete accordingly...|$|R
5000|$|Vehicles - {{high-temperature}} tolerant {{chemicals in}} the form of non-volatile liquids or solids with suitable melting point; they are generally liquid at soldering temperatures. Their role is to act as an oxygen barrier to protect the hot metal surface against oxidation, to dissolve the reaction products of activators and oxides and carry them away from the metal surface, and to facilitate heat transfer. Solid vehicles tend to be based on natural or modified rosin (mostly abietic acid, pimaric acid, and other resin acids) or natural or synthetic <b>resins.</b> Water-soluble organic <b>fluxes</b> tend to contain vehicles based on high-boiling polyols - glycols, diethylene glycol and higher polyglycols, polyglycol-based surfactants and glycerol.|$|R
40|$|As an {{isotropic}} conductive adhesive, that is, {{a hybrid}} Cu paste composed of Cu powder, solder powder, and a <b>fluxing</b> <b>resin</b> system, has been quantitatively characterized. The mechanism of an electrical connection {{based on a}} novel concept of electrical conduction is experimentally characterized using an analysis of a differential scanning calorimeter and scanning electron microscope energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The oxide on the metal surface is sufficiently removed {{with an increase in}} temperature, and intermetallic compounds between the Cu and melted solder are simultaneously generated, leading to an electrical connection. The reliability of the hybrid Cu paste is experimentally identified and compared with existing Ag paste. As an example of a practical application, the hybrid Cu paste is used for LED packaging, and its electrical and thermal performances are compared with the commercialized Ag paste. In the present research, it is proved that, except the optical function, the electrical and thermal performances are similar to pre-existing Ag paste. The hybrid Cu paste could be used as an isotropic conductive adhesive due to its low production cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of diffusion gradients in thin films (DGT) {{was used to}} measure in situ fluxes of metals at fine spatial resolution (1. 25 mm) in the surface sediments (029 cm) and immediately overlying water of Esthwaite Water, UK. DGT measures labile metal species in situ by immobilizing them in a layer of Chelex resin after diffusion through a 0. 4 mm polyacrylamide gel. The measured mass per unit area which accumulates in a known time can be used to calculate an in situ flux from the porewaters to the <b>resin.</b> This <b>flux</b> to the <b>resin</b> can be interpreted to provide porewater concentrations or in situ fluxes of metal from solid sediments to porewaters. Concentrations of Zn and Cd in the porewaters were well buffered by rapid (< min) equilibria with the solid phase, allowing them to be measured by DGT. Particulate Mn was so tightly bound that it was not released to the porewaters within a timescale of hours, supply to the DGT device being solely by diffusion. Nickel, Cu, and Fe represented intermediate cases where there was partial resupply from solid phase to porewaters. In these cases the results from DGT provided a direct measurement of the mean in situ flux (mol cm− 2 s− 1) from solid to solution phase during 24 h deployment: Nickel (0. 5 – 1 × 10 − 15), Cu(0. 5 – 2. 5 × 10 − 16), Fe (1. 5 – 2. 5 × 10 − 8). The generally good in situ availability suggests that porewater concentrations are controlled by adsorption/desorption processes rather than solubility or coprecipitation. These first measurements of trace metals at mm resolution showed tightly defined (< 1. 5 mm) maxima at the sediment water interface. Their location, 1. 5 – 3. 0 mm above the broader Fe and Mn maxima, supports previous evidence which indicated they are due to release of metals from rapidly decomposing organic material. Increased spatial resolution will be required to resolve fully the surface maxima to define the zone of metal release, the concentration gradients to overlying water, and underlying sediments and remobilization fluxes...|$|R
