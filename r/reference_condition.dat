They contain a high number of rare macroinvertebrate species. There are only few species that can not occur in the Netherlands, but their abundances were low. The Polish water bodies are suitable to describe <b>reference</b> <b>conditions</b> for similar Dutch water types.

50|$|Despite these variations, some overall {{trends are}} {{commonly}} seen. The RBE is generally independent of LET for any LET less than 10 keV/µm, so a low LET is normally {{chosen as the}} <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> where RBE is set to unity. Above 10 keV/µm, some systems show a decline in RBE with increasing LET, while others show an initial increase to a peak before declining. Mammalian cells usually experience a peak RBE for LET's around 100 keV/µm. These are very rough numbers; for example, one set of experiments found a peak at 30 keV/µm.|$|E
50|$|Another area of {{interest}} has been the measurement of surface pressure in low-speed wind tunnels. Binary PSP systems are used in low-speed wind tunnel environments where pressure gradients are small and error sources are more significant. Model shift between <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> and loaded condition, variation in paint thickness, lamp instability, and temperature are significant sources of error in PSP data. Binary PSP mitigates many of these error sources by employing a second probe into the paint layer, known as the reference probe. This reference probe is used to ratio out {{the effects of these}} errors producing high quality PSP pressure maps at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|A model {{surface is}} painted with the PSP coating with an {{airbrush}} or automotive type paint gun. The PSP {{consists of an}} oxygen sensitive probe suspended in an oxygen permeable binder. The model is then placed in an oven so the PSP layer can cure. Once cured, the model is placed in a wind tunnel or appropriate test environment. LED lamps of a specific wavelength are used to excite the pressure-sensitive probe within the paint. Once excited, the pressure-sensitive probe is transitioned to a higher energy state where is may either emit a photon or be quenched by local oxygen present. This competing process of emission and quenching determines the intensity response of the paint layer. The result is a dimmer fluorescence where there is higher pressure and brighter response at lower pressures. The intensity emitted from the surface is then recorded through a long-pass filter by a CCD or scientific grade camera and stored for conversion to pressure using a previously determined calibration. Images of the paint layer are recorded at three conditions. A wind-off image at a known <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> which is typically standard atmospheric conditions with the tunnel turned off. A wind-on image at a loaded condition where the wind tunnel is running at condition. And lastly a background image where the ambient light present is captured without the illumination source. The background image is then subtracted from the wind-off reference and the wind-on condition image in data processing. Photographs of the surface {{can be obtained from}} outside the wind tunnel's test section, which means that the model need never be disturbed or touched in order to obtain the pressure distribution. Computer-aided photography can be used to produce false-color images, where the color range corresponds to the pressure variations.|$|E

40|$|For the {{implementation}} of the Water Framework Directive <b>reference</b> <b>conditions</b> have to be established for the various quality element. In this report we outline a number of approaches that can be pursued for establishing <b>reference</b> <b>conditions</b> for hytoplankton at a regional level and discuss the problems associated with their application. This report does not exhaust the topic of establishing <b>reference</b> <b>conditions</b> in the different coastal types of the Baltic Sea, while it should be digested as a source for inspiration when analyses are carried out at a regional level. Phytoplankton has been quantitatively analysed in the Baltic Sea since the 1970 s with increasing frequency of sampling over the last decade. Prior to this only few qualitative studies have been carried out, providing insufficient material to estimate conditions from before the intensification of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea to be considered as <b>reference</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the Gulf of Bothnia, the outer coastal areas have not been substantially impacted by anthropogenic nutrients inputs. Thus the distribution of phytoplankton data from these sites may therefore represent <b>reference</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, adopting this approach for all Finnish coastal waters, summer chlorophyll a <b>reference</b> <b>conditions</b> vary between 1. 2 to 3. 4 μg l- 1. Paleoecological studies from the Laajalahti bay (which is a shallow bay in the south coast of Finland) suggest a reference value for annual summer chlorophyll a of 10 μg l- 1. However, this value may not be representative for other shallow bays in southern Finland. In the Kattegat our investigations suggest reference values of approximately 2. 1 μg l- 1 for the mesohaline coastal waters, although this is only a rough estimate that needs to be supported by other studies. Using relationships between secchi depths and phytoplankton biomass is a feasible approach to establish <b>reference</b> <b>conditions,</b> given that there are sufficiently longtime series of historical secchi depth measurements and that other light attenuating substances would have had trends comparable to that of phytoplankton. In Finnish coastal waters this approach suggests <b>reference</b> <b>conditions</b> from 1. 6 to 2. 0 μg l- 1, i. e. a narrower span compared to the values established from reference sites. Consistent relationships between chlorophyll and secchi depths are found basin-wide in the Baltic Sea, and this approach is an option for establishing <b>reference</b> <b>conditions</b> provided that the underlying assumptions are carefully examined and their implications evaluated.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} my {{most significant}} contributions to the science of ecological assessment of river condition. The thesis traces the development of ecological assessment and shows where my work has made {{a significant contribution to}} knowledge of ecological assessment. I demonstrate the value of bioassessment and the ‘reference condition approach’ by describing applications and evaluation of the Australian River Assessment System (AUSRIVAS), which has been the national standard method of biological assessing river health for over a decade. AUSRIVAS includes a standardized invertebrate sampling method, the <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> approach, predictive models, and software for assessing river health. However, new methods to aid the synthesis of ecological studies are imperative if the increasing body of scientific research is to improve management and outcomes for freshwater systems. My most recent work has contributed to establishing a new causal–criteria analysis method, ‘Eco Evidence’, for assessing evidence for and against environmental cause–effect hypotheses. This thesis reviews bioassessment and AUSRIVAS predictive modelling, the <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> approach, and the origins of Eco Evidence to provide background and context for my research. I have arranged the nine research articles that comprise the body of this thesis in three categories: 1) AUSRIVAS sampling method evaluation; 2) applications of AUSRIVAS; and 3) the synthesis of multiple studies for environmental causal assessment using Eco Evidence. In addition, the final chapter outlines problems encountered and future directions for the work. A major contribution of my research has been to demonstrate the utility of the <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> approach for (i) predicting reference (that is pre-impoundment) biota in the Cotter River (ACT); (ii) establishing reference biota within Kosciuszko National Park (Australia); and (iii) using the <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> approach to assess the condition of Portuguese streams. This body of work is highly relevant to river managers wanting to apply the <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> approach and (a) understand the consequences of sample variability on bioassessment results; (b) allocate resources appropriately for the level of replication required to detect an ecological response; and (c) avoid method-related bias where studies cross multiple jurisdictions that use different sampling methods. This research highlights the significance of standardized sampling of fixed sites (both test and reference) over long periods and demonstrates the value of the <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> approach when assessing the biological response to flow regulation. When applied within a robust study design and an adaptive management framework, the bioassessment program coped with changing questions and unforeseen events, such as extended drought. Application of AUSRIVAS has shown that management actions maintained the ecological resilience of the Cotter River, enabling it to recover when higher river flows returned after the drought. This thesis also describes the recently published Eco Evidence method for systematic review of environmental science literature and draws together some lessons learned about the application of causal analysis to define ecosystem response to flow. The Eco Evidence method was adapted from epidemiological techniques for attributing causation. Such causal assessment can be necessary to inform management actions aiming to improve environmental condition. This work is highly relevant to researchers and environmental practitioners that require a method for quantifying and combining scientific evidence from multiple studies. The Eco Evidence weighting system for individual studies is a major advancement in environmental causal assessment. This research effort is part of a worldwide trend towards facilitating greater use of evidence-based methods in environmental assessment and management. My research has contributed to advancing the understanding of ecological assessment that uses invertebrate predictive models, the <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> approach and causal criteria analysis. Rigorous bioassessment studies and the <b>reference</b> <b>condition</b> approach when applied within the context of adaptive management, long-term assessment, and a framework for causal assessment, can provide the ecological evidence to inform current and future river management...|$|E

Historically, <b>reference</b> <b>conditions</b> have primarily been applied within the U. S.
