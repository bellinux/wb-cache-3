This latter task is dealt by Doug Pengilly (personal communication). This document focused on developing a standardization method based on generalized linear model (GLM) for estimating yearly CPUE index. For this report, we used the observer pot sample data for 1990 / 91 - 2010 / 11 for the whole Aleutian Islands region, east of 174 W, and west of 174 W to test the model selection and CPUE index estimation procedures.

To offset this externality, the mandatory use of veil nets or separator panels was introduced in 2003 for all vessels using an aggregate beam length of more than 8 [*]m.

These studies, however, do not consider the behavioural response by fishers to reduce this impact.

40|$|Self-reporting of {{information}} is an inexpensive means for collecting data on fishing or other human activities, but the accuracy of self-reported data {{can be difficult to}} measure. Logbooks that record fishing activities are a common form of self-reporting that can provide vast amounts {{of information}} about a fishery. Using logbook data from trawlers from Oregon ports operating along the US Pacific coast during 1987 – 2001, this study examined (a) the consistency of reported tow locations and bottom depths and (b) the accuracy of reported <b>retained</b> <b>catches</b> of four groundfish species groups. Because logbook data during this period played no direct role in fishery management or stock assessments, there were no obvious incentives for trawl captains to deliberately report false logbook information. To evaluate consistency between tow locations and corresponding bottom depths, each tow was assigned to a 100 - m bottom depth-band based on the reported tow location on a digital chart. The depth-bands based on the tow locations were then compared one-to-one with the depths reported in the logbooks and analysed to determine factors (e. g., year, quarter, vessel) contributing to the consistency between the reported locations and depths. Consistency was highest in the shallowest depth-bands and there was a strong interaction between depth and vessel. To evaluate the accuracy of the <b>retained</b> <b>catches</b> reported by the captains, the tow-by-tow logbook data were summed to the fishing-trip-level and compared to the official landing weights, recorded at the fish processing plants when the catches were off-loaded and weighed. The logbook weights relative to the corresponding official landing weights were analysed using zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) regression models to determine factors (year, quarter, vessel) that were important explanatory variables. The analysis found strong year, quarter, and vessel effects for all three parts of the ZIGP: the mean value, the dispersion, and the proportion of zeros. The vessel effect was strongest. In a combined analysis, based on results from the other two analyses, vessels that were consistent in recording their depths and fishing locations had only a weak tendency to be accurate in recording their catches.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in southeastern Australia to assess the short-term mortality and stress incurred by juvenile school prawns (Metapenaeus macleayi) discarded from an estuarine trawler. Some 35 % of the prawns died up to 72 h after being caught in a trawl, exposed to air during sorting and separation from the <b>retained</b> <b>catch</b> (as per normal commercial procedures), then discarded into replicate cages. Total mortality was partitioned into that caused by trawling (about 16 % of mortalities), and by subsequent sorting and grading (about 19 %).

40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{explored}} {{the use of}} electronic monitoring (EM) in the shallow and deep set components of the Hawaiian pelagic longline fishery. EM systems, consisting of closed circuit television cameras, sensors (e. g., GPS, hydraulic pressure and winch rotation) and a system control box, were deployed on three vessels, simultaneously monitored with observers, for a collective total of about 320 sea days, 13 fishing trips and 182 fishing events. Overall, the equipment performed well, recording data for 99. 2 % of the time vessels were at sea. A key strength of EM is the continuous sensor data record providing very accurate temporal and spatial information on gear setting and retrieval activities. EM image reviewers were also able to reliably detect hooks deployed and <b>retained</b> <b>catch.</b> About 40 % of the discard catch was not detected by EM image reviewers, because discard releases occurred outside the camera view.

Current catch rate, species composition and size frequency of the catch were determined from interviews with 1 200 angling parties during 2005 - 06. Fishing effort was greatest {{during the summer and}} over the Easter holidays when there were inﬂuxes of tourists to the region. The <b>retained</b> <b>catch,</b> comprising 17 species, was dominated by yellow ﬁn whiting (Sillago schomburgkii, 47 %) and Australian herring (Arripis georgianus, 17 %). Non-compliance with minimum legal length regulations was common, particularly for King George whiting (Sillaginodes punctata) and Australian salmon (Arripis truttaceus). Although current total annual recreational ﬁshing effort (72 000 angling hours) was remarkably similar to the effort recorded in 1974 - 75, the total recreational harvest has declined signiﬁcantly. The current catch rate of 0. 835 (± 0. 044) ﬁsh retained per angler per hour is only 20 % of that recorded in 1974 - 75.

40|$|High-resolution {{fisheries}} data from integrated logbook and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) records have revealed a detailed spatial {{structure in the}} species composition of the <b>retained</b> <b>catches</b> of the Irish demersal otter trawl fleets. Hierarchical cluster {{analysis was used to}} define 8 clusters with relatively homogenous species compositions. These clusters formed 34 distinct spatial regions in the waters around Ireland. Identification of these regions can be useful for a number applications, including spatial stratification of commercial or survey data, defining and characterising fishing grounds for marine spatial planning, evaluation of closed areas and prediction of how fishing effort might be re-allocated following a closure. A casestudy is presented that explores options to reduce cod (Gadus morhua) catches by implementing seasonal closures in two of the 34 regions. Cod are caught by demersal trawlers in a mixed fishery and the catches often exceed the quota, resulting in discarding of marketable fish. Two regions were identified that had relatively low effort and high cod landings. The effects of closing these regions during {{the first quarter of the}} year were explored. Cod catches were likely to be reduced by 8 - 22 % while only 3 - 9 % of the annual demersal otter trawl effort would be displaced. Whiting catches were also likely to be reduced, the change in catches of some other species depended on the assumed effort displacement.

This is a multi-species fishery, carried out by stern bottom trawlers, mainly between June and September, in depths mainly between 800 m to 1600 m. The importance of the fishing activity {{in this area is}} increasing notably. This fishery has been monitored since the beginning in 1996, with the collaboration of the fishing industry, by means of a scientific observer programme. The observers on board provide data on catches, discards, location and depth, haul by haul. Length samples of the main species and biological material are also collected. The species composition of the catches is presented. In terms of weight, the roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the bairdii smoothhead (Alepocephalus bairdi i) are the most important species in the catches. Other less important species are the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and the blue ling (Molva dypterygia).

A total of 91 fish and cephalopod species were recorded in the catches, of which 20 species were always retained, 40 were always discarded and the remaining 31 were selected depending on size (only larger specimens were retained). The most abundant species in the <b>retained</b> <b>catch</b> were Spicara smaris, Atherina hepsetus and Mullus barbatus, while Chromis chromis, Symphodus ocellatus and small specimens of Boops boops dominated the discards.
