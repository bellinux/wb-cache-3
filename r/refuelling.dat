5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player has to take off the runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the {{immediate}} coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and <b>refuelling</b> locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a <b>refuelling</b> plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle <b>refuelling</b> manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|The {{squadron}} operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, {{the first}} of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, <b>refuelling</b> operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air <b>refuelling</b> is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise.|$|E

5|$|While {{these six}} {{aircraft}} provided a limited tanker capability suitable for <b>refuelling</b> fighters, the Mk 20A wing hosereels could only deliver fuel at a limited rate, {{and were not}} suitable for <b>refuelling</b> bombers. Work therefore continued to produce a definitive three-point tanker conversion of the Victor Mk.1. Fourteen further B.1A and 11 B.1 were fitted with two permanently fitted fuel tanks in the bomb bay, and a high-capacity Mk 17 centreline hose dispenser unit with three times the fuel flow rate as the wing reels, and were designated K.1A and K.1 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Each year, 50,000vessels {{pass through}} Malacca Strait. In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} declared Sabang a Free Trade Zone and Free Port, to gain economic benefit by establishing the port as a logistic hub for international vessels {{passing through the}} strait. Infrastructures for a deep water harbour, port, warehousing and <b>refuelling</b> facilities, were developed.|$|E
5|$|Six B.2s {{converted}} for air-to-air <b>refuelling</b> with Mark 17 Hose Drum Unit (HDU) mounted semi-recessed in tail cone. TFR deleted. Fitted {{with three}} bomb-bay drum tanks, {{it was the}} only mark of Vulcan that could jettison fuel in an emergency.|$|E

5|$|The Airbus A330 MRTT is the Multi-Role Transport and Tanker (MRTT) {{version of}} the A330-200, {{designed}} for aerial <b>refuelling</b> and strategic transport. , 46 total orders have been placed for the A330 MRTT by the air forces of Australia, France, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised <b>refuelling</b> system, developed by Flight <b>Refuelling</b> Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was {{the last}} of the V-bombers to be retired, the final {{aircraft}} being removed from service on 15 October 1993. In its <b>refuelling</b> role, the type had been replaced by the Vickers VC10 and the Lockheed Tristar.|$|E

5|$|Three {{additional}} HC Mk2 Chinooks {{were ordered}} with delivery beginning in 1995. Another six were ordered in 1995 under the Chinook HC Mk2A designation; {{the main difference}} between these and the standard Mk2 was the strengthening of the front fuselage to allow the fitting of an aerial <b>refuelling</b> probe in future.|$|E

5|$|During the British scramble, Bf 109s from JG 52 {{which were}} part of a pre-raid sweep, chanced upon RAF fighters out in the open at RAF Manston. Twelve Bf 109s from 2 Staffel II./JG 52, led by Hauptmann Wolfgang Ewald {{attacked}} while the British fighters were <b>refuelling.</b> After two passes, the Germans claimed 10 fighters and three Blenheims destroyed. In fact, just two No. 266 Squadron RAF Spitfires were destroyed with another six Hurricanes damaged but repairable. A single Hurricane was also destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the mission range and flight time for Vulcan operations, in-flight <b>refuelling</b> capabilities were added in 1959 onwards; several Valiant bombers were refurbished as tankers to refuel the Vulcans. Continuous airborne patrols proved untenable, however, and the <b>refuelling</b> mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet fell into disuse in the 1960s. Both Vulcans and the other V-force aircraft routinely visited the Far East, in particular Singapore, where a fully equipped nuclear weapons storage facility had been constructed in 1959. During the Indonesiaâ€“Malaysia confrontation Britain planned to deploy three squadrons of V-bomber aircraft and 48 Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to the region; although this was ultimately decided against, Vulcans trained in the region for both conventional and nuclear missions. Britain regularly deployed Vulcans to the Far East {{as a part of}} their contribution to SEATO operations, often to test the defenses of friendly nations in joint exercises. In the early 1970s, the RAF decided to permanently deploy two squadrons of Vulcans overseas in the Near East Air Force Bomber Wing, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus; the Vulcans were withdrawn as Cypriot intercommunal violence intensified in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|No. 33 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{strategic}} transport and air-to-air <b>refuelling</b> squadron. It operates Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports from RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. The squadron {{was formed in}} February 1942 for service during World WarII, operating Short Empire flying boats {{and a variety of}} smaller aircraft. By 1944 it had completely re-equipped with Douglas C-47 Dakota transports, which it flew in New Guinea prior to disbanding in May 1946.|$|E
5|$|No. 33 Squadron is {{responsible}} for aerial <b>refuelling</b> and long-range transport. It is located at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and controlled by No.86 Wing, {{which is part of}} Air Mobility Group. The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components. As well as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular aircraft service. Heavier maintenance is conducted by Northrop Grumman Integrated Defence Services (formerly Qantas Defence Services).|$|E

Block 2 construction activity is planned to run until 2016, {{after which the}} manufacturing of further developed Block 3 aircraft is planned. In December 2015, {{it was announced that}} the 16th Block II aircraft had been handed over resulting in standing up of the 4th squadron.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a <b>refuelling</b> stop in Munich, Germany.
