The nonuniformity of structures of the deformed surface layer was ascribed to the formation of <b>surface</b> <b>reliefs.</b> The microhardness of <b>surface</b> <b>reliefs</b> was higher than that of adjacent matrixes, so a nonuniformity of micromechanical properties coexisted on the surface of sample subjected to LSP.

50|$|In the {{earliest}} nature prints, inks or pigments were applied {{directly to the}} <b>relief</b> <b>surface</b> of leaves and/or other relatively flat natural subjects in order to capture images of their sizes, shapes, surface textures, and delicate vein or scale patterns. Typically {{both sides of a}} leaf were coated with ink and the leaf was then placed inside a folded sheet or between two sheets of paper. When rubbed by hand or run through a printing press a mirror image was produced of the topside and underside of the same leaf. Often the prints were done in black ink and the flowers later painted or drawn in by the artist. In other cases a flattened, dried leaf or plant was coated once with black ink and then repeatedly printed in a printing press. The initial dark print was used as a work copy or proof print. The subsequent prints, with fainter traces of ink, were hand colored to more closely resemble the appearance of the real subjects. This methodology is generally applicable to making a print from a fish. They also used wood and carved images into that.|$|E
5000|$|PDMS stamps are {{pieces of}} {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS), a silicone, {{that have been}} patterned usually against a master to form a relief pattern used in soft lithography. This PDMS stamp {{can be used in}} either its current form as a <b>relief</b> <b>surface</b> for techniques such as microcontact printing or can also be attached to an external source by tubing so that liquid may be passed through channels on its surface. In this second case it will often be laminated to a surface so that chemistry can be performed on that surface producing a pattern of the PDMS stamp on to the surface. Alternatively a PDMS stamp can be laminated to a second piece of PDMS to form a contained device. It is possible to pattern PDMS with nanometre resolution. PDMS stamps can be procured from some commercial sources such as Research Micro Stamps. [...] Many techniques have been developed to modify the basic setups to perform a range of tasks such as assays on small volumes. These kinds of devices are often referred to as microfluidic devices. Because of the small dimensions of these devices flow is laminar not turbulent which can lead to many useful properties; however, this reduces the ability of fluid streams to mix.|$|E

40|$|Geologic and geomorphic {{data suggest}} that the {{topographic}} growth of the Apennines has been very slow during the crustal shortening phase (Miocene-Pliocene) and greatly accelerated in the Quaternary. Such different uplift rates should have generated peculiar landforms that preserve information regarding the long-term evolution of the landscape. In this framework, we studied the geomorphology of the Corno River drainage basin, focusing on low local <b>relief</b> <b>surfaces</b> and on the river network features. The drainage basin of the Corno River is underlain by overthrusted Tertiary carbonates and marls, that have been offset by normal faults since the end of Pliocene. The topography of the study area is characterized, at elevation between 1000 and 1150 m, by low local <b>relief</b> <b>surfaces,</b> bordered by fluvial or structural steep scarps and locally offset by faults. In the study area extension generated three intermontane basins (Leonessa, Cascia and Norcia), drained by the Corno River and its tributaries. The Cascia and Norcia basins show a higher residual relief with respect to Leonessa basin, reflecting the progressive action of the headward river erosion and its interaction with the activity of the bordering faults. The Corno network appears to be more strongly influenced by faults that generate abrupt changes of the main trunk direction and knickpoints in its long profile. Except in the Leonessa depression and close to Cascia, the river flows in a very narrow and deep valley, showing locally entrenched meanders. Four orders of fluvial terraces have been found, although only the youngest one is widely preserved. On the valley slopes, at elevation between 50 and 170 m above the present valley bottom, we found out several subhorizontal surfaces that could be straths. We interpret the low <b>relief</b> <b>surfaces</b> as relics of an old landscape with relief lower than present, graded to or near base level. This landscape was drained by a river network characterized by wide valleys and internally-drained basins (the intermontane depressions). As a consequence of the strong increase of the uplift rate at the end of lower Pleistocene, the lowering of the base level induced a general deepening and a new organization of Corno basin network, commonly influenced by faults. Alluvial terrace and strath formation follows the general model of hillslope and watershed response to Quaternary climatic changes...|$|R
