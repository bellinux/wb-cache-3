40|$|Abstract- This {{experimental}} study presents {{the variation in}} the strength of concrete when replacing sand by quarry dust from 0 % to 100 % in steps of 10 %. M 20 and M 25 grades of concrete were taken for study keeping a constant slump of 60 mm. The compressive strength of concrete cubes {{at the age of}} 7 and 28 days were obtained at room temperature. Also the temperature effect on concrete cubes at 100 o C on 28 th day of casting was carried out to check the loss of strength. From test results {{it was found that the}} maximum compressive strength is obtained only at 50 % replacement at room temperature and net strength after loss due to hike in temperature was above the recommended strength value due to 50 % replacement itself. This result gives a clear picture that quarry dust can be utilized in concrete mixtures as a good substitute for natural river sand giving higher strength at 50 % <b>replacement.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms- Concrete, quarry dust, river sand, compressive strength.

30|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the interpretation of}} the estimated parameters, in Table  4, the indigenous communities are arranged according to their degree of traditionalism, with the first communities being the most traditional. To determine traditionalism, I used the Ethnolinguistic <b>Replacement</b> <b>Index</b> (ERI; see Ordorica et al. 2009). ERI measures the tendency of the new generations of an ethnolinguistic group to continue to use the group’s language. ERI ranges from 0 to 2, where 2 indicate an increase {{in the use of the}} language, while 0 is a rapid trend toward loss of the language. ERI is important because it indicates the influence of tradition within communities (a higher ERI means that customs and traditions are more influential and, therefore, so is the Cultural Factor we are analyzing); it is also is independent of current income and current economic conditions. Further, if we arrange communities according to their degree of traditionalism, we can divide them into three groups, where the first is the most traditional and the last the least traditional. The Groups are as follows: Group 1 : Tlapanecs, Tzotzils, Tzeltals and Chols; Group 2 : Huastecs, Mixtecs, Mazatecs, Chinantecs, Mixes, Nahuas and Totonacs; Group 3 : Purépechas, Zapotecs, Mayas, Otomies and Mazahuas. I have employed this classification because the groups have certain common characteristics, which will be useful throughout the empirical analysis in this article.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{identify}} predictors of structural valve deterioration after pulmonary valve replacement {{in patients with}} tetralogy of Fallot. MethodsA retrospective review of 227 patients with tetralogy of Fallot who underwent stented bioprosthetic pulmonary valve replacement at Children’s Hospital Boston between 1994 and 2009 was performed. Patient and valve characteristics were assessed as potential predictors of structural valve deterioration by using univariate and multivariable analysis. Freedom from pulmonary valve reintervention and structural valve deterioration were determined by using Kaplan–Meier analysis. ResultsTwo hundred twenty-nine pulmonary valve replacement operations were performed, with no early mortalities. Freedom from reintervention and structural valve deterioration were 94 % (95 % confidence interval, 87 %– 100 %) and 74 % (95 % confidence interval, 63 %– 85 %) at 5 years, respectively, and median time to reintervention was 6. 4 years (range, 2 – 10. 1 years). Younger age and higher indexed valve internal diameter were predictors of reduced time to structural valve deterioration. Among patients aged less than 20 years {{at the time of}} pulmonary valve <b>replacement,</b> <b>indexed</b> valve internal diameter {{was a significant predictor of}} increased risk of structural valve deterioration. Valve manufacturer was not a significant predictor of structural valve deterioration. ConclusionsYounger age at the time of pulmonary valve replacement and valve oversizing in patients less than 20 years of age at the time of pulmonary valve replacement were significant predictors of structural valve deterioration and could potentially affect the timing of pulmonary valve replacement and the extent of valve oversizing in small children.

However, the recipients died when the <b>replacement</b> <b>index</b> (RI) of the human hepatocytes exceeded 50 %. The hosts (chimeric mice) survived at RI > 50 % when treated with a drug that has anti-human complement factor activity, and these mice developed livers with RI values as high as 96 %. In total, 36 chimeric mice were generated, and the rate of successful engraftment was as high as 92 %. The yield of chimeric mice with RI > 70 % was 32 %. The human hepatocytes in the murine host liver expressed mRNAs for a variety of human cytochrome P 450 (hCYP) subtypes, in a manner that was similar to the donor liver. The mRNAs for hCYP 3 A 4 and hCYP 1 A 1 / 2 were induced in the liver in a CYP type-specific manner when the mice were treated with rifampicin and 3 -methylcholanthrene, respectively. These results indicate that human hepatocytes that propagate in mice retain their normal pharmacological responses.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{homozygous}} albumin enhancer/promoter-driven urokinase-type plasminogen activator/severe combined immunodeficient (uPA/SCID) mice as hosts for chimeric mice with humanized livers. However, uPA/SCID mice show four disadvantages: the human hepatocytes (h-heps) <b>replacement</b> <b>index</b> in mouse liver is decreased due to deletion of uPA transgene by homologous recombination, kidney disorders {{are likely to}} develop, body size is small, and hemizygotes cannot be used as hosts as more frequent homologous recombination than homozygotes. To solve these disadvantages, we have established a novel host strain that has a transgene containing albumin promoter/enhancer and urokinase-type plasminogen activator cDNA and has a SCID background (cDNA-uPA/SCID). We applied the embryonic stem cell technique to simultaneously generate a number of transgenic lines, and found the line with the most appropriate levels of uPA expression-not detrimental but with a sufficiently damaged liver. We transplanted h-heps into homozygous and hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice via the spleen, and monitored their human albumin (h-alb) levels and body weight. Blood h-alb levels and body weight gradually increased in the hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice and were maintained until they were approximately 30 weeks old. By contrast, blood h-alb levels and body weight in uPA/SCID chimeric mice decreased from 16 weeks of age onwards. A similar decrease in body weight was observed in the homozygous cDNA-uPA/SCID genotype, but h-alb levels were maintained until they were approximately 30 weeks old. Microarray analyses revealed identical h-heps gene expression profiles in homozygous and hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice were identical to that observed in the uPA/SCID mice. Furthermore, like uPA/SCID chimeric mice, homozygous and hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID chimeric mice were successfully infected with hepatitis B virus and C virus. These results indicate that hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice may be novel and useful hosts for producing chimeric mice for use in future long-term studies, including hepatitis virus infection analysis or drug toxicity studies...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{establish}} an animal model with human hepatocyte- repopulated liver {{for the study}} of liver cancer metastasis. METHODS: Cell transplantation into mouse livers was conducted using alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) -producing human gastric cancer cells (h-GCCs) and h-hepatocytes as donor cells in a transgenic mouse line expressing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) driven by the albumin enhancer/promoter crossed with a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse line (uPA/ SCID mice). Host mice were divided into two groups (A and B). Group A mice were transplanted with h-GCCs alone, and group B mice were transplanted with h-GCCs and h-hepatocytes together. The <b>replacement</b> <b>index</b> (RI), which is the ratio of transplanted h-GCCs and h-hepatocytes that occupy the examined area of a histological section, was estimated by measuring h-AFP and h-albumin concentrations in sera, respectively, as well as by immunohistochemical analyses of h-AFP and human cytokeratin 18 in histological sections. RESULTS: The h-GCCs successfully engrafted, repopulated, and colonized the livers of mice in group A (RI = 22. 0 % ± 2. 6 %). These mice had moderately differentiated adenocarcinomatous lesions with disrupted glandular structures, which is a characteristics feature of gastric cancers. The serum h-AFP level reached 211. 0 ± 142. 2 g/mL (range, 7. 1 - 324. 2 g/mL). In group B mice, the h-GCCs and h-hepatocytes independently engrafted, repopulated the host liver, and developed colonies (RI = 12. 0 % ± 6. 8 % and 66. 0 % ± 12. 3 %, respectively). h-GCC colonies also showed typical adenocarcinomatous glandular structures around the h-hepatocyte- colonies. These mice survived for the full 56 day-study and did not exhibit any metastasis of h-GCCs in the extrahepatic regions during the observational period. The mice with an h-hepatocyte-repopulated liver possessed metastasized h-GCCs and therefore could be a useful humanized liver animal model for studying liver cancer metastasis in vivo. CONCLUSION: A novel animal model of human liver cancer metastasis was established using the uPA/SCID mouse line. This model could be useful for in vivo testing of anti-cancer drugs and for studying the mechanisms of human liver cancer metastasis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{age of the}} {{majority}} of power transformers applied in the western electricity network varies between 25 and 50 years. Depending on the load history and time of operation, replacement on short term is imminent. A technically sound policy concerning the replacement of these assets must be based on knowledge of (i) the life expectancy or reliability of individual components, (ii) how these failure probabilities cumulate to a replacement wave, and (iii) how to manage an expected replacement wave. The population reliability is obtained from individual transformer reliabilities using Arrhenius based modelling of paper insulation degradation. This modelling technique includes measures to cope with inherent uncertainties in available data. Population reliability figures are obtained using an adapted k-out-of-N failure model.

One of the great challenges that manufacturers of electronic products face is trying to measure accurately how a product is performing in the field. Based on a literature review as well as discussions with an electronics company, it was determined that it was necessary to base {{field reliability}} monitoring on field data. The company had a previous reliability issue where a product was performing poorly in the field but by time it was identified and corrective action was taken, it had cost the company millions of dollars. For this company it was important to determine if a product’s reliability in the field was performing well or deteriorating. The relevant literature research was divided into three main fields: Introduction to reliability, field databases in use in industry and finally measuring field data. The field study focused on two products for Company X. The main tools used to measure and model the data were, Rate of occurrence of failures (ROCOF), replacement rate by month trending, <b>replacement</b> <b>index</b> (RI) modelling and control charts. Future prediction was facilitated {{by the use of}} the lognormal distribution plot.

The RI model indicated at a very early stage that there was evidence of wear-out for Product A. The p control chart would have indicated six months before the actual investigation happened that there was a problem with this product.

40|$|OVERVIEW OF THE GOALS OF THE THESISTotal hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) {{has recently}} even been termed the {{operation of the}} century. The reported outcomes are excellent and therefore it seems difficult to improve the performance of hip replacement patients. This performance is however most often investigated by means of 1 single outcome parameter such as functional outcomes or complications. Nevertheless, {{the performance of a}} surgical procedure is not restricted to 1 outcome parameter but {{is the result of a}} complex interplay of various parameters. Narrowing the performance of a surgical procedure to 1 outcome parameter bears the risk that we remain blinded for other potential flaws or shortcomings. This is one of the lessons we learned from the introduction of new technologies such as hip resurfacing. This thesis critically appraises our contemporary outcome assessments and aims to design a more comprehensive outcome platform to fully picture the outcomes of patient cohorts following a THA. The thesis aims to provide evidence that our contemporary outcome assessments are either insufficient or have reached their limits of discriminative capacities to differentiate between 2 well performing surgical techniques (Goal 1). The optimization of outcome assessments is required to detect differences between 2 well performing surgical techniques: the direct anterior and postero-lateral surgical approach (Goal 2). These optimized outcomes should be integrated into a comprehensive outcome platform that aims picturing patient cohorts by means of 5 different outcome parameters: complications, functional outcomes, clinical outcome, biomechanical reconstruction and gait characteristics. The results from this thesis are used to design a multi-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compares both approaches (Goal 3). The data of this RCT, together with a database of outcomes from healthy subjects, will be used to construct an evidence-based hip replacement risk index that allows detecting deviations from the normal or the gold standard already at an early stage (On-going research). The ultimate goal is to provide an evidence-based comprehensive screening tool that can be used to screen new technologies and surgical techniques for early flaws or deviations from the gold standard (Future research). This comprehensive research project combines the expertise of 5 scientific departments into 1 consortium. A research grant for this project was obtained by means of the IWT-TBM research project nr 100786. The thesis should be considered as the first part of this extensive research project. RESEARCH PROJECTS(1) The first chapter presents an extensive literature overview of outcome assessment in RCTs. This review showed that there is room for improvement because the performance of surgical techniques is often narrowed to 1 particular outcome parameter. As a result, we tend to neglect the overall outcome. The literature review on the experiences with hip resurfacing learned that failures of hip procedures are a multi-factorial problem that can only be identified when comprehensive analyses are conducted. It appeared from this review that there could have been an index of suspicion when the results from some reports would have been considered together. Specific failure modes of hip resurfacing were introduced and it was the merit of the national joint replacement registries (NJRR) that large cohorts could allow identifying prognosticators for implant failure. However, the registries have a number of limitations and can therefore not replace well-conducted clinical trials. The registries flagged problems only after capturing 5 - to 7 -year data. It is in this gap of 5 to 7 years that clinical trials can play a crucial role as a screening tool for potential problems. It is by means of the comparison between the direct anterior (DAA) and postero-lateral approach (PLA) that we aim to optimize our outcomes. The current literature failed to detect any significant difference in the outcomes between the both approaches. The poster-lateral approach is considered the gold standard to which an evidence-based DAA technique will be compared. In other words, comparing both approaches can be considered as a test case and validation of optimized outcome parameters that will be implemented in the comprehensive outcome platform. (2) In the second chapter an overview of the objectives and methodology of the thesis is provided. The goal of this thesis is to evaluate whether a comprehensive outcome platform can be created based upon a more global approach towards outcome assessments of surgical approaches in THA. (3) The third chapter provides a proof of concept of an evidence based direct anterior approach. The DAA is not new but is associated with a high complication rate. A novel and stepwise technique was developed to overcome this problem. The anatomic findings of 3 published studies were emerged into 1 femoral elevation strategy. The procedure is conducted on a regular OR table with the help of 1 ipsilateral assistant. The safety and reproducibility of this stepwise technique is investigated and validated by means of (1) a learning curve study of the first author compared to a PLA cohort, (2) a cadaver study of surgeons with different levels of experience and (3) a multi-centre initiation study with 3 surgeons of different surgical volume. The prospectively collected data of the first study will be used to investigate the optimization of other outcome parameters. (4) The fourth chapter investigates the variables that influence functional outcomes in addition to the optimization of the discriminative capacities of functional outcome scores. First, normative age-gender matched reference outcomes were collected from 1. 000 healthy volunteers. This investigation also showed that multiple scores should be used to fully picture patient cohorts. Patient stratification should be evaluated based upon the presence of contra-lateral groin pain and age rather than on gender and BMI. Conventional statistical tests failed to detect significant differences between both cohorts because of the ceiling effect of most outcome scores. However, it was shown that the distribution of the data was different with DAA patients showing a more normative functionality. Alternative methods were used to fully understand the functionality of both procedures. This showed significant differences between both cohorts. We also investigated the incidence of subjective groin pain and clinical peri-articular pain. The forgotten hip concept was introduced and validated. Significantly more DAA patients had a forgotten hip. It was shown that this clinical outcome parameter adds new information to the overall outcome of a hip replacement procedure. In the final section the arguments for designing a multicentre RCT with regards to functional and clinical outcomes are summarized. (5) The fifth chapter aims to investigate by means of a hip resurfacing model, how smaller cumulative changes in component positioning can lead to increased contact stresses of the articulating surface. Cumulative errors of both component displacements could lead to detrimental increases in contact stresses of up to 35 %. Therefore, the hip joint centre of rotation (COR) should be reconstructed within a 5 mm range from the native COR and the socket position should remain as closely as possible to the neutral position. Reconstruction of the soft tissue biomechanics is represented by the reconstruction of the abductor moment arm. Radiographic measurement of the abductor moment arm is validated. The biomechanical profile of the DAA and PLA cohort was compared. The socket anteversion and leg length discrepancy were significantly higher in the PLA cohort, whereas socket inclination was significantly lower in the DAA cohort. No differences in abductor moment arm changes were found. In conclusion, component positioning was not jeopardized during the learning curve of the DAA without the use of fluoroscopy. In depth biomechanical analysis is required to fully understand the clinical relevance of the found differences. (6) The gait characteristics of DAA THA patients were significantly improved compared to matched hip resurfacing (SRA) patients in the sixth chapter. SRA has been promoted to be the hip replacement that allowed for the best recovery towards normal gait. This was not supported in our study. Direct lateral approach SRA showed the most distinct aberrations followed by posterolateral approach SRA. Although DAA patients did not reach the normal level at more than 12 months follow-up, the differences were markedly less pronounced than with hip resurfacing. Gait analysis provided additional information of the functionality following hip replacements. (7) The seventh chapter provides evidence for the design of a long-term follow-up RCT. The lessons learned from a RCT that was initiated 20 years ago showed that the number of patients that should be included to detect a difference in survivorship between 2 THA designs depends on the expected follow-up period and the age of the patient at time of inclusion. Including only patients 65 years would be included. The findings of prospective case series were used in the second section to support the choice for implants with a modular porous coated socket with a 32 mm polyethylene liner. A well performing cemented and cementless stem design will be compared for long-term survivorship. The most important purpose is to design a database of implants that have been shown to be associated with excellent clinical outcome. These databases can then be considered as the gold standard to create the hip replacement risk index that will allow comparing the outcomes of new technologies. (8) In the final chapter the integrated assessment platform is proposed and a summary of future research is provided. GENERAL CONCLUSIONOur continuous search for improved technologies needs to be supported by improved screening tools that allow picturing the overall outcome of a hip replacement procedure. The evidence-based direct anterior procedure and the postero-lateral approach seemed to perform equally well at first glance. However, it was only by means of optimized and multiple outcome assessments that differences between both approaches surfaced. These outcomes will be weighed and integrated into 1 hip <b>replacement</b> <b>index.</b> This index could allow better understanding the position of new technologies or other procedures relative to the gold standard or the normal population. status: publishe...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To determine the in-hospital and 1 -year mortality {{in patients with}} PVE who undergo valve <b>replacement</b> during <b>index</b> hospitalization compared with patients who receive medical therapy alone, after controlling for survival and treatment selection bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were enrolled between June 2000 and December 2006 in the International Collaboration on Endocarditis-Prospective Cohort Study (ICE-PCS), a prospective, multinational, observational cohort of patients with infective endocarditis. Patients hospitalized with definite right- or left-sided PVE {{were included in the}} analysis. We evaluated the effect of treatment assignment on mortality, after adjusting for biases using a Cox proportional hazards model that included inverse probability of treatment weighting and surgery as a time-dependent covariate. The cohort was stratified by probability (propensity) for surgery, and outcomes were compared between the treatment groups within each stratum. INTERVENTIONS: Valve <b>replacement</b> during <b>index</b> hospitalization (early surgery) vs medical therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital and 1 -year mortality. RESULTS: Of the 1025 patients with PVE, 490 patients (47. 8 %) underwent early surgery and 535 individuals (52. 2 %) received medical therapy alone. Compared with medical therapy, early surgery was associated with lower in-hospital mortality in the unadjusted analysis and after controlling for treatment selection bias (in-hospital mortality: hazard ratio [HR], 0. 44 [95 % CI, 0. 38 - 0. 52] and lower 1 -year mortality: HR, 0. 57 [95 % CI, 0. 49 - 0. 67]). The lower mortality associated with surgery did not persist after adjustment for survivor bias (in-hospital mortality: HR, 0. 90 [95 % CI, 0. 76 - 1. 07] and 1 -year mortality: HR, 1. 04 [95 % CI, 0. 89 - 1. 23]). Subgroup analysis indicated a lower in-hospital mortality with early surgery in the highest surgical propensity quintile (21. 2 % vs 37. 5 %; P[*]=[*]. 03). At 1 -year follow-up, the reduced mortality with surgery was observed in the fourth (24. 8 % vs 42. 9 %; P[*]=[*]. 007) and fifth (27. 9 % vs 50. 0 %; P[*]=[*]. 007) quintiles of surgical propensity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prosthetic valve endocarditis remains associated with a high 1 -year mortality rate. After adjustment for differences in clinical characteristics and survival bias, early valve replacement was not associated with lower mortality compared with medical therapy in the overall cohort.

40|$|It {{is known}} that long-standing volume {{overload}} on the left ventricle due to mitral regurgitation eventually leads to contractile dysfunction. However, it is unknown whether or not correction of the volume overload can lead to recovery of contractility. In this study we tested the hypothesis that depressed contractile function due to volume overload in mitral regurgitation could return toward normal after mitral valve replacement. Using a canine model of mitral regurgitation which is known to produce contractile dysfunction, we examined contractile function longitudinally in seven dogs at baseline, after 3 mo of mitral regurgitation, 1 mo after mitral valve replacement, and 3 mo after mitral valve replacement. After 3 mo of mitral regurgitation (regurgitant fraction 0. 62 +/- 0. 04), end-diastolic volume had nearly doubled from 68 +/- 6. 8 to 123 +/- 12. 1 ml (P less than 0. 05).

40|$|As just reiterated in the 2005 Trustees Report, Social Security faces a 75 -year deficit {{equal to}} roughly 2 percent of taxable payrolls. Closing this gap {{requires}} either {{a cut in}} benefits or an increase in taxes. One approach to cutting benefits under consideration by the administration is to change how benefits are indexed. An earlier Just the Facts explored the implications for benefits of moving from “wage indexing” of benefits to “price indexing. ” This Just the Facts describes a proposal for “progressive price indexing. ” The notion is that benefits for low-wage earners would continue to rise in line with wages, while those for maximum earners would rise in line with prices; everyone in between would see some combination of the two. The implication is that replacement rates — benefits {{as a percent of}} pre-retirement earnings — for low earners would remain constant over time, but replacement rates for high earners would decline sharply.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{occurrence of}} herbicide-resistant (HR) Kochia scoparia {{is an increasing}} concern for growers in the US Great Plains and Canada. K. scoparia populations resistant to dicamba {{have been reported in}} six US states. Populations cross-resistant to dicamba and fluroxypyr have been reported from wheat fields in Montana, USA. It is unclear whether resistance to the auxinic herbicides (dicamba and/or fluroxypyr), can alter the fitness traits of K. scoparia. The objectives of this research were to compare the germination dynamics in response to thermal environment, vegetative growth and fecundity characteristics, and the relative competitive ability of dicamba-fluroxypyr-susceptible (S) vs. -resistant (R) K. scoparia selected from within a single segregating population (collected from wheat-fallow field in MT). S and R selected lines were developed after three generations of recurrent group selection. Compared to the S selected line, the R selected line had lower cumulative germination at all constant temperatures except 25 °C, and at all alternating temperatures except 30 / 35 °C. Also, the R selected line had delayed germination relative to the S selected line. The R had lower plant height, plant width, primary branches, total leaf area, stem diameter, and shoot dry weight compared with the S plants in the absence of competition. The reduction in seed production per plant resulted in a 39 % fitness cost. The 1000 -seed weight of R (1. 6 g) was also less than that of S (2. 6 g). When grown in an intraspecific competition at different mixture proportions, <b>replacement</b> series <b>indices</b> for the growth parameters further indicated that the R was less competitive than the S.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} popular {{induction}} scheme for supervised learning {{is also one of the}} oldest. It builds a classifier in a top-down fashion, following the minimization of a so-called index criterion. While numerous papers have reported experiments on this scheme, little has been known on its theoretical aspect until recent works on decision trees and branching programs using a powerful classification tool: boosting. In this paper, we look at this problem from a worst-case computational (rather than informational) standpoint. Our conclusions for the ranking of these indexes’ minimization follow almost exactly that of boosting (with matching upper and lowerbounds), and provide extensions to more classes of Boolean formulas such as decision lists, multilinear polynomials and symmetric functions. Our results also exhibit a strong worst-case for the induction scheme, as we build particularly hard samples for which the <b>replacement</b> of most <b>index</b> criteria, or the class of concept representation, even when producing the same ranking as boosting does for the indexes, makes no difference at all for the concept induced.

So far, empirical research has devoted more attention to their macroeconomic and financial effects while relatively less {{attention has been paid}} to analysing their redistributional implications. We present this line of research using CAPP_DYN, a population-based dynamic microsimulation model. The model stochastically simulates the socio-demographic and economic evolution of a representative sample of the Italian population over the period 2010 - 2050. The initial sample is subjected to a large number of demographic and economic events such as partnership formation/dissolution, birth, education, work, retirement, health and disability and death. While acknowledging the rather complex phasing in of the Notional Defined Contribution system, introduced into the Italian {{social security}} system from 1995, a set of indexes (net present value ratio, Gini <b>index,</b> <b>replacement</b> ratios etc.) is used to evaluate the distributional properties of the reformed pension system in each of the simulated years as well as in a life-time/cohort perspective. Two main critical distributional aspects will emerge. Firstly the model predicts an increase in the old-age pensions dispersion in the transitional phase (2015 – 2030) due to the coexistence of different pension regimes and rules in calculating pensions. Moreover, a problem of adequacy in the public pension system from 2035 emerges as the NDC system will be almost completely phased in. ...|$|R

Because the QT interval and its circadian rhythmicity relative to heart rate is poorly defined in man, we used our new computer-assisted technique to measure QT interval in our analysis of 24 -hour Holter tapes before and after (8 to 12 weeks) thyroxine (T 4) replacement in 10 patients with hypothyroidism; the findings were compared to those in 6 normal control subjects. QTc interval was prolonged (p less than 0. 02) and heart rate decreased (p less than 0. 005) during the hypothyroid state. Data were analyzed for circadian rhythmicity by repeated-measures analysis. Circadian variation in QTc and heart rate was statistically significant during hypothyroid and euthyroid states (p less than 0. 001) as well as in control subjects, but the circadian rhythmicity of QTc interval and heart rate were out of phase; the maximum prolongation of QTc occurred between midnight and 6 A.

In {{the second part of the}} study the stiffness index (k) was calculated in patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation according to: k = 0. 87 ·(max·dS/dt) /Sp·Vcf, where Vcf = normalised midwall circumferential fibre shortening velocity (circ·s− 1). In 22 patients, 10 controls and 12 {{patients with}} aortic stenosis before (pre) and after (post) valve replacement the systolic stiffness index k (circ− 1) was determined using tipmanometry and frame by frame angiocardiography.

To test for evidence of gene-environment interactions, we compared genotypic relative risks for breast cancer across the other risk factors in a large UK prospective study.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly {{divided into three}} {{chapters}}. Even though the three chapters have different aims, they all concern investment environment and process. With respect to the former aspect, we consider how stocks and bonds are traded in securities markets. The second and third chapter deal with markets where a single risky asset is sequentially traded in batch auctions. In the fourth chapter we consider bond markets where transaction costs create frictions. As for the investment process, we study how market participants should choose their investment, and when should it be made. We analyze trading strategies for market participants {{in the second and}} third chapter, while active bond portfolio management is dynamically characterized in the fourth chapter. Chapter 2 develops a dynamic trading game in which fundamental insiders coexist with non-fundamental speculators. We study inclusions in the S&P 500 as an example in which non-fundamental speculation arises due to preannouncing <b>index</b> <b>replacements.</b> Evidence on volume and liquidity is consistent with our theoretical analysis. Chapter 3 deals with asymmetrically informed traders engaging in information sharing about the asset's fundamental value. In the presence of information sharing, trading activity and price volatility both cluster at the end of the trading period, and price informativeness is reduced. Our model predicts a rich variety of patterns for liquidity, volume and return volatility. Chapter 4 focuses on affine term structure models as portfolio management tools. We use returns implied by different models as inputs for an investor's portfolio optimization problem. Each period we determine the optimal investment, and then characterize the financial properties of trading strategies. We show that evaluating term structure models from a financial perspective may yield conflicting results with those arising from a statistical metric...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess how}} left {{ventricular}} (LV) hypertrophy, geometry and function change after stentless aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, and to elucidate the physiological {{mechanism of the}} improvement in stentless valve haemodynamics. METHODS: 81 patients with aortic stenosis (age 75 +/- 6 years, 47 male) underwent aortic valve replacement (plus CABG in 33 patients) with a Freestyle stentless porcine valve (mean size 23 +/- 2 mm). They were prospectively investigated by Doppler echocardiography at 2 weeks, 3 - 6, 12, and 24 months after operation. Two hundred and forty-six echocardiograms were obtained and analysed. Aortic valve performance was assessed from its effective orifice area (EOA), the transvalvular increase in mean flow velocity (delta mV), the deceleration time of aortic flow velocity, and mean pressure drop (mPG). LV hypertrophy was assessed from LV mass index; LV geometry, from the ratio of wall thickness to the radius (T/R ratio) and LV function, from stroke volume index (LVSVI) and myocardial stroke work (SW). RESULTS: By 2 years after operation, LV mass index had fallen from 162 +/- 64 to 109 +/- 36, g/m 2, and T/R ratio from 0. 61 +/- 0. 25 to 0. 43 +/- 0. 10. LVSVI increased from 29. 4 +/- 10 to 42 +/- 17, ml/m 2, and myocardial SW from 3. 1 +/- 1. 6 to 5. 2 +/- 2. 2, mJ/cm 3 (all P < 0. 001 by ANOVA), while LV outflow tract diameter remained unchanged. At the same time, stentless valve EOA increased from 1. 59 +/- 0. 75 to 2. 2 +/- 0. 72, cm 2, and delta mV (from 82 +/- 31 to 49 +/- 24, cm/s) and mPG (from 9. 7 +/- 5. 0 to 5. 2 +/- 3. 7 mmHg) both fell significantly (all P < 0. 001 by ANOVA) : as the deceleration time of aortic flow velocity increased from 153. 6 +/- 64. 1 to 202. 7 +/- 37. 6 ms (P < 0. 001 by ANOVA). CONCLUSION: After stentless aortic valve <b>replacement,</b> LV mass <b>index</b> and wall thickness both fall towards normal, and myocardial stroke work increases. These ventricular remodelling processes are accompanied by a more physiological flow jet at valve cusp level, which permits a greater stroke volume to be ejected with a smaller transvavular velocity increase, so that effective orifice area increases...|$|R
