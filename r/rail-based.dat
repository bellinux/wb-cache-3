5|$|Early on, {{the economy}} {{depended}} greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city {{was the largest}} in Mississippi around {{the start of the}} 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains coming in and out daily. The city's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these <b>rail-based</b> industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely <b>rail-based</b> economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a {{forecast}} by city planners in 1967 which stated {{the need for a}} <b>rail-based</b> urban transport system by 1992. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, then Minister for Communications Ong Teng Cheong, {{came to the conclusion that}} an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country.|$|E
5|$|A {{light rail}} system for Greater Manchester emerged from {{the failure of the}} 1970s Picc-Vic tunnel scheme to obtain central {{government}} funding. A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as the least expensive <b>rail-based</b> transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992, becoming the United Kingdom's first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that had survived up to Metrolink's creation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{proposals}} for a <b>rail-based</b> lift, {{able to carry}} passengers and goods, were made in 1881, although this first scheme {{was to have been}} steam powered.|$|E
25|$|Crunican {{currently}} {{works as}} general manager for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District. BART is a <b>rail-based</b> mass transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|E
25|$|There {{are plans}} by the Penang state {{government}} to introduce more <b>rail-based</b> transportation systems throughout Penang. The Penang Transport Master Plan envisages the following long-term solutions to counter George Town's increasing traffic congestion.|$|E
25|$|The NCR Transport Plan 2021 {{proposed}} a <b>rail-based</b> mass transit system called Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) between Delhi to Meerut with the Shahdara-Ghaziabad section scheduled for construction during 2001-11 and the Ghaziabad-Meerut section scheduled for 2011-21.|$|E
25|$|There {{are plans}} by the Penang state {{government}} {{to bring in}} more <b>rail-based</b> transportation systems throughout Penang. The Penang Transport Master Plan envisages the following long-term solutions to counter the state's worsening traffic congestion, which is compounded by Penang's abnormally high vehicle ownership rate and the state's limited space for urban development.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 the old depot link {{was closed}} and {{partially}} removed when a new 2km metro link line was built from the then present end at Vuosaari metro station, to the VR harbour railway in the new Vuosaari harbour. The old link line will be rebuilt for the light <b>rail-based</b> Jokeri line upgrade, scheduled for 2016 onwards.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, a {{provisional}} Mass Rapid Transit Authority {{was established in}} July 1980, after the debate. However, Mr Ong faced strong opposition from {{other members of the}} cabinet, by Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Tony Tan, due especially to the heavy investments involved. A team of specialists from Harvard University, recommended that an all-bus system would be sufficient into the 1990s, and would cost 50% less than a <b>rail-based</b> system.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{international}} airports are easily accessibly by public transport, with GLA and EDI directly linked by a bus routes from the main bus station, and a direct rail connection to PIK from Glasgow Central Station. A plan to provide a direct rail link to Glasgow International was dropped with the cancelling of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link in 2009, though the Scottish Government is actively, , considering alternative <b>rail-based</b> surface-access possibilities.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} {{following}} its opening in 1981, Singapore Changi Airport relied on taxis and buses as the primary means of public transportation {{to the rest of}} the country. They served the airport well, but concerns over competition from other regional airports, some of which feature quick <b>rail-based</b> services to their city centres, such as the one from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, accelerated the government's plan to build a rail link to the airport.|$|E
25|$|In his response, then Minister for Transport Bob Pearce {{noted the}} {{recommendation}} by the consultants {{for the implementation}} of a bus-based system using an exclusive right-of-way in the median of the Mitchell Freeway. However, he noted that further detailed evaluation of a <b>rail-based</b> option was still being carried out. The report noted that while its preference was to construct a bus expressway, the extension of such a busway beyond Warwick would provide little or no benefits in terms of speed, time, and economics.|$|E
25|$|The {{closure of}} the Turku tram system has been {{subsequently}} widely regarded as a mistake. The recreation of a <b>rail-based</b> public transport system in the city, either {{in the form of}} another tram system or a light rail one, has been discussed since the {{closure of the}} previous tram system in 1972. The Turku city council approved the future construction of a light rail system on 15 December 2009. In the interim the city's public transport system will be rearranged as a bus rapid transport system.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, the Government {{announced}} that the Sungai Buloh – Kajang Line {{will be the first}} to take off. The Sungai Buloh – Kajang Line will run from Sungai Buloh to Kajang through Kuala Lumpur city centre. This route which runs from north-west to south-east of Kuala Lumpur is densely populated and is currently inadequately served by <b>rail-based</b> public transport. Upon expected completion by 2016, the Sungai Buloh – Kajang line will provide service to 1.2 million people with an estimated daily ridership of 442,000.|$|E
25|$|Planning of the Løren Line {{is part of}} a wider {{concept of}} {{building}} additional <b>rail-based</b> services across Groruddalen. There are three lines, two metro lines and the mainline Trunk Line, which run down the valley, but there is no good system for crossing the valley. This is in part caused by both railways and motorways creating barriers. The municipal authorities are therefore looking at future connections between the metro's Grorud Line and the Furuset Line, with a possible transfer station with the Trunk Line.|$|E
25|$|A <b>rail-based</b> {{solution}} to connect Mount Carmel with downtown Haifa was {{envisioned by the}} British mandatory authorities. However, only in 1955, {{under the auspices of}} then-mayor Abba Hushi, did practical talks begin. The French company Compagnie Dunkerquoise d'Entreprises created a detailed plan and proposed to a generous loan for {{a large part of the}} project, and a deal was signed in 1956. The plan was for a funicular system, and the inauguration took place in 1959, attended among others by the French transport minister Robert Buron and Israeli prime minister David Ben Gurion.|$|E
25|$|The Morgantown system, more {{correctly}} {{described as}} a Group Rapid Transit (GRT) type of Automated Guideway Transit system (AGT), has completed 110 million passenger-miles without serious injury. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, AGT systems as a group have higher injury rates than {{any other form of}} <b>rail-based</b> transit (subway, metro, light rail, or commuter rail) though still much better than ordinary buses or cars. More recent research by the British company ULTra PRT reported that AGT systems have a better safety than more conventional, non-automated modes.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} having rail lines which could bring people from {{door to door}} without {{requiring}} the use of road-based buses was much favoured by the government transport planners, especially with the increased emphasis on a <b>rail-based</b> public transport network. For intra town travel, LRTs were favoured over buses because trains run on dedicated elevated guideways, bypassing any traffic congestion and traffic lights on the roads, and do not add to road traffic. Train arrival and departure times are also almost guaranteed this way. It is also cleaner as the trains are electrically powered, and therefore lessens the effects of air pollution.|$|E
25|$|The only <b>rail-based</b> {{transportation}} system in George Town is the Penang Hill Railway, a funicular railway to {{the peak of}} Penang Hill. When completed in 1923, the railway, then utilising Swiss-made coaches, was considered an engineering feat of sorts. It underwent an extensive upgrading in 2010 and was reopened in early 2011.Within the city centre, efforts are being undertaken to promote pedestrianisation {{and the use of}} bicycles as a greener alternative transportation mode. Dedicated cycling lanes have been marked throughout the city and in 2016, George Town became the first Malaysian city to operate a public bicycle-sharing service, with the launch of LinkBike.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, 2013 {{the federal}} {{government}} announced Oklahoma City would receive $13.8M grant from the US Department of Transportation's TIGER program. This is the first ever grant for Oklahoma City for <b>rail-based</b> initiative and {{is thought to be}} somewhat of a turning point by city leaders who have applied for grants only to continuously be denied. It is believed the city will use the TIGER grant along with approximately $10M from the MAPS 3 Transit budget to revitalize the city's Amtrak station becoming an Intermodal Transportation Hub, taking over the role of the existing transit hub at NW 5th/Hudson Ave.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force {{response}} was two-fold. One was WS-199, which explored various options {{to make the}} Air Force's own missiles as immune as the Navy's. The primary method was the air-launched missile, which would be kept on station close to the Soviet Union but outside their defensive range, able to be launched at a moment's notice. They also explored ways to extend the range of ground-launched missiles, so that small mobile missiles {{might be able to}} carry out attacks from the United States without being subject to counterattack. Other options, not part of WS-199, was an active defense using the LIM-49 Nike Zeus and its follow-ons, and <b>rail-based</b> launchers.|$|E
25|$|Metro {{has been}} criticized for {{removing}} railroad tracks that were already in place for a significant length of the Orange Line's route, tracks which could have been revitalized and used as part of a true light rail system. In October 2013, Los Angeles City 4th District Councilman Tom LaBonge introduced a motion to support the repeal of Public Utilities Code section 130265 (1991's SB 211, or Robbins Bill) and support of any legislative and/or administrative action by Metro which would prioritize the development of <b>rail-based</b> transit. The motion was passed by the City Council on October 29, 2013 and approved by the Mayor on November 6, 2013.|$|E
25|$|KRL Jabodetabek or {{commonly}} known as Commuterline is a commuter rail system which serves commuters in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi. The commuter system was started in 2000. The number of passengers in 2014 reached 208 million, rising from 158 million in the previous year. About 280 million commuters used KRL Jabodetabek {{in the year of}} 2016. KRL Jabotabek serves all municipalities in Jakarta excluding the Thousand Islands, as well as Greater Jakarta region. Though during rush hours, the number of passengers greatly exceeds the system's capacity, and crowding is common. Currently KRL Jabotabek is the only <b>rail-based</b> transit system in Jakarta, as the mass rapid transit and light rail transit are still under construction.|$|E
25|$|SEPTA's 50-year {{history has}} often been a tumultuous one, {{a direct result of}} the agency being governed at the local county level rather than the state one. Railpace Newsmagazine {{contributor}} Gerry Williams observed that SEPTA regularly staggers from crisis to crisis, with little support or oversight originating at the state level in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Never progressive in management decisions, notoriously apathetic, and quick to suspend <b>rail-based</b> services indefinitely, SEPTA has historically been at odds with the riding public and both local county and state officials. SEPTA has suffered more labor strikes than any other transit agency in the U.S., occurring in 1977, 1981, 1983, 1986, 1995, 1998, 2005, 2009, 2014, and 2016.|$|E
25|$|Historian Alfred C. Mierzejewski {{argues that}} both area bombing and attacks against fuel plants were {{ineffective}} against Germany's coal- and <b>rail-based</b> economy {{and that the}} bombing campaign only took a decisive turn in late 1944 when the allies switched to targeting railway-marshalling yards for the coal gateways of the Ruhr. His summation is rejected by Sebastian Cox head of the Air Historical Branch (AHB). Cox notes {{that half of the}} oil was produced by Benzol plants located in the Ruhr. These areas were the primary target of Bomber Command in 1943 and the autumn of 1944. Cox concludes that the targets were highly vulnerable to area attacks and suffered accordingly. The American official history notes that Harris was ordered to cease attacks on oil in November 1944, as the combined bombing had been so effective that none of the synthetic plants were operating effectively. The American history also includes information from Albert Speer, in which he points out that Bomber Command's night attacks were the most effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{well-established}} Chennai Suburban Railway network, {{which dates}} back to 1931, began services on the metre gauge line from Beach to Tambaram. Two more suburban networks, Chennai Central–Arakkonam and Chennai Central–Gummidipoondi began operations in 1985. In 1965, the Planning Commission set up a study team on metropolitan transport to assess the adequacy and limitation of existing transport facilities in the cities of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Delhi to determine the feasibility of different modes of transport and recommend phased programmes for development of transport facilities. In a means to supplement the existing suburban rail network in Chennai, a number of surveys were conducted in the 1960s including the surveys by the Madras Area Transportation Study Unit (MATSU), which {{was set up by}} the Planning Commission during 1968–1970 and the Metropolitan Transport Project (MTP), which was established by Indian Railways in July 1971. The surveys and studies identified eight important transport corridors, including the 39-km north–southeastern rail corridor along the Buckingham Canal. These were soon followed by a feasibility study conducted by RITES, an engineering and infrastructure enterprise of the Government of India, on behalf of the state government. The study results were submitted in 1975, suggesting a <b>rail-based</b> mass transit system between Kasturba Nagar and Manali Road.|$|E
500|$|The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation was {{certified}} by the United Nations in 2011 as the first metro rail and <b>rail-based</b> {{system in the world}} to get [...] "carbon credits for reducing greenhouse gas emissions" [...] and helping in reducing pollution levels in the city by 630,000 tonnes every year.|$|E
2500|$|Like most American cities, Kansas City's {{mass transit}} system was {{originally}} <b>rail-based.</b> From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system {{was among the}} top in the country, with over [...] of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.|$|E
2500|$|United Streetcar {{president}} Kevin Clarke {{left the}} company in December 2014, and parent Oregon Iron Works has re-purposed the U.S. facilities for boat construction, though the company has stated that they may return to <b>rail-based</b> equipment in the future (streetcars or otherwise). [...] United Streetcar was dissolved in February 2015 as it had declined to produce an annual report.|$|E
2500|$|Ruter {{has looked}} into the {{possibilities}} of extending a <b>rail-based</b> transit further south in Nordstrand, to serve the existing residential areas of Loftrud and Bjørndal, and the proposed housing areas of Gjersrud and Stensrud. Ruter have suggested either extending the Østensjø Line or the tramway's Ekeberg Line. The metro proposal calls for six new stations, one at Lofthus, [...] south of Mortensrud, one at Bjørnholt, [...] from Mortensburg, two serving Bjørndal (...) , one at Gjersrud (...) and one serving Stensrud (...) [...] Travel time from Mortensrud to Stensrud would be 8 minutes and the proposed terminus would be 32 minutes and [...] from Stortinget.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} major {{changes were made}} on 1 February 1981. [...] The {{new version of the}} Railcard became valid for either one or two adults, with no {{distinction}} in price—so the separate [...] "joint-holder Railcard" [...] ceased to exist. [...] The price was changed to £10.00; the Railcard holder now gained a discount of 50% on off-peak fares; the child flat fare became £1.00; and two other adults (in addition to the holder/s) could travel in the group for half fare. [...] Other than a price rise in 1983, and some discounts on Motorail services, Sealink ferry services to the Channel Islands and <b>rail-based</b> holidays, the conditions remained the same until 1985.|$|E
2500|$|Cycling {{has always}} been one of the main sports of Brittany, but leisure cycling and the {{infrastructure}} to support it have been growing extremely rapidly. An extensive network of cyclepaths and recommended cycleroutes has opened up all over the region. Some of these are routes using mainly smaller roads and both signposted and maintained by communes individually, but many are based on dedicated cyclepaths often formed by converting disused railway tracks. These help form routes such as 'Vélodyssée' from Roscoff to Nantes and several major routes under the 'V' label (following signs V1, V2 etc.). The old tow-path of the Nantes-Brest canal is now open to cyclists along its entire 385km length though in places (unlike <b>rail-based</b> cyclepaths) it is very meandering and leaving the path will both shorten the distance and provide variety ...|$|E
2500|$|During a {{visit in}} 1885 English {{journalist}} George Augustus Henry Sala coined the phrase [...] "Marvellous Melbourne", which stuck {{long into the}} twentieth century and is still used today by Melburnians. Growing building activity culminated in a [...] "land boom" [...] which, in 1888, reached a peak of speculative development fuelled by consumer confidence and escalating land value. As a result of the boom, large commercial buildings, coffee palaces, terrace housing and palatial mansions proliferated in the city. The establishment of a hydraulic facility in 1887 allowed for the local manufacture of elevators, resulting in the first construction of high-rise buildings; most notably the APA Building, amongst the world's tallest commercial buildings upon completion in 1889. This period also saw the expansion of a major radial <b>rail-based</b> transport network.|$|E
2500|$|After a long {{planning}} process {{by the government}} regarding {{the development of a}} mass rapid transit system in Indonesia's capital, the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit infrastructure is currently under construction, with a north–south line between Kota and Lebak Bulus; and an east–west line, which will connect to the north–south line at Sawah Besar station. The Jakarta MRT will be a combination of subways and elevated rails. Preparation work started in April 2012, and groundbreaking was done in October 2013, with the first, 15.2km-long line between Hotel Indonesia and Lebak Bulus scheduled to be operational by 2018, and the north–south line MRT network is scheduled to be operational by 2020. The total length of the network when complete will be approximately [...] The Jakarta city government decided on a <b>rail-based</b> system because of its ability to carry large numbers of people quickly and cheaply. , the mass rapid transit system has an investment of nearly US $1.7 billion to ease the capital's traffic issue in the coming years, including the construction of a subway.|$|E
