5|$|Lady Denman Drive, a roadway {{atop the}} dam wall, {{provides}} a third <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> for the lake. It {{consists of a}} roadway and a bicycle path, and allows residents in western Canberra to cross the lake. This was possible because the dam gates are closed by pushing up from below, unlike most previous designs that wherein the gates were lifted from above.|$|E
5|$|The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing, {{commonly}} known as the Dartford Crossing and until 1991 the Dartford Tunnel, is a major <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> of the River Thames in England, carrying the A282 road between Dartford in Kent to the south with Thurrock in Essex to the north. It consists of two bored tunnels and the cable-stayed Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. The only fixed <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> of the Thames east of Greater London, it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom, with an average daily use of over 130,000 vehicles. It opened in stages: the west tunnel in 1963, the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991. The crossing, although not officially designated a motorway, is considered part of the M25 motorway's route, using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound. Described {{as one of the most}} important road crossings in Britain, it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion.|$|E
5|$|The continual {{congestion}} and requirements for closures and refurbishments {{are unlikely to}} change, as the Blackwall Tunnel remains the only major <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> of the Thames in east London for the short-term future. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge, a new crossing between the Woolwich Ferry and the Dartford Crossing, was cancelled by Boris Johnson when he replaced Livingstone as mayor in 2008.|$|E

5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits. Like many roads in the North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom {{but it is not}} as dangerous as other roads bisecting hilly terrain in this part of England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England.|$|E
5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches of the bridge and gate. In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> to the south enabled the pedestrianisation of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was {{replaced}} by Decimus Burton, whose plans for Bournemouth included {{the construction of a}} garden alongside the Bourne stream, an idea first mooted by Granville. The fields south of the <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> (later Bournemouth Square) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks. Many of these paths, including the Invalids' Walk, remain in the town today. A second suggestion of Granville's, a sanatorium, was completed in 1855 and greatly raised Bournemouth's profile as a place for recuperation.|$|E

The road travels through the City and three London boroughs: Islington, Haringey and Barnet, which include the districts of Islington, Holloway, Highgate, Hendon and Mill Hill, and travels along Upper Street and Holloway <b>Road,</b> <b>crossing</b> the North Circular Road in Hendon, a district in the London Borough of Barnet.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} to the north, NY78 and NY104 fork in different directions, with NY104 following Ridge Road to the northeast and NY78 running along LockportOlcott Road to the northwest. Still {{in the town of}} Newfane, NY78 proceeds northwest as a four-lane (quickly changing to two-lane) residential street. The route passes east of Bent-Wing Airport, continuing northwest through Newfane. The route remains residential for a distance, crossing over a brook on its way into the hamlet of Corwin. In Corwin, NY78 remains a two-lane residential <b>road,</b> <b>crossing</b> over Somerset Railroad tracks that are operated by CSX Transportation (heading for the Somerset Power Plant near Camp Kenan) north of Jacques Avenue.

5|$|By the late-19th century, Charing Cross {{was seen}} as being inconveniently placed. In 1889, the newly-formed London County Council's John Burns {{proposed}} that the station and its approach should be demolished, with a road bridge put in place. The idea gained support with in the council as it would allow the Strand to be widened and put a <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> over the Thames that could bypass Whitehall. When the SECR went to Parliament asking for an act to strengthen the bridge in 1916, Burns suggested the station {{was in the wrong}} place and should be rebuilt {{on the south side of}} the Thames. The following year, an act was passed to reconstruct the bridge, with strict conditions about its appearance and a ban on enlarging the station building itself.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the {{fighting}} around the Hongorai, the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded, while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed. Following the battle, the Australians continued their advance towards Buin {{at the southern end of}} the island. Throughout the remainder of the month and into June, the 15th Brigade advanced along the Buin <b>Road,</b> <b>crossing</b> the Hari on 10 June. Beyond the river, the Japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply, and they consequently occupied a series of deep entrenchments. These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery, and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed Mobiai River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson's 29th Brigade in early July.|$|E

NY132 proceeds north along Old Yorktown <b>Road,</b> <b>crossing</b> through a residential section of Yorktown. After passing a junction with Meadowcrest Drive, the route takes a turn to the northwest then returns to its northerly progression near Strang Boulevard. Remaining a two-lane residential street through Yorktown, NY132 passes Lakeland Copper Beech Middle School and turns northwest once again towards more homes and into a partial diamond interchange with the Taconic State Parkway. At this interchange, there is no access from NY132 to the northbound Taconic, and no access from the southbound Taconic to NY132.|$|E

5|$|The first {{crossing}} {{at what is}} now {{the site}} of the bridge was established in the 11thcentury by Margaret, queen consort of King Malcolm III, who founded a ferry service to transport religious pilgrims from Edinburgh to Dunfermline Abbey and St Andrews. Its creation gave rise to the port towns of Queensferry and North Queensferry, which remain to this day; and the service remained in uninterrupted use as a passenger ferry for over eight hundred years. There were proposals as early as the 1740s for a <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> at the site, although their viability was only considered following the construction of the Forth Bridge in 1890.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a period}} of renewed {{lobbying}} for a <b>road</b> <b>crossing</b> in the 1920s and 1930s, at which time the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating on behalf of the London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop in Clare. The northern half of {{the route of the}} highway is shared with Bus. US10, running concurrently through downtown.
