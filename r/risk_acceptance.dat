Recreational scuba diving is generally limited by diver certification {{to a maximum of}} 40 meters, for reasons of safety. Recreational divers who dive to deeper depths are generally expected by the certification agencies to have technical diver training, while freediving is only limited by the divers ability and willingness to accept the risks. The risks of freediving to these depths are significant, and a major difference is that recreational scuba certification agencies specify depth restrictions to avoid liablity issues, while freedivers are left to make their own choices regarding <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Recreational freediving is practiced by many people ranging from the average snorkeler to the professional freediver.

Similarly, the inclusion of organic product standards juxtaposed to GM food is unknown. This paper attempts to shed some light on this question by examining the decision making process through the use of structural equation modeling (SEM). We use survey data from Spain and a set of theoretical constructs that allow us to identify independent mechanisms underlying individuals’ risk decision making. Our results suggest that the conceptualized model captures the decision making process, and that both perceptions and attitudes toward risk have independent effects on consumer acceptance.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance</b> is defined, {{analysed}} and applied within a recently developed statistical framework for non-expected utility theory (non-EU) based on conceptions of status quo-dependent decision making under uncertainty.

Explicit definitions of various <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance</b> attitudes are introduced, the exact probability-dependent utility function is derived, and basic properties of marginally acceptable risk are discussed along with examples and applications. These include, among other things, the observed variability of <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance</b> attitudes, voluntary and involuntary risk-taking, aversion to catastrophic risks with low probabilities but large potentials for damage, and observed societal attitudes toward technological risks. The results indicate that basic <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance</b> patterns familiar from psychometric and social studies of risk are, to some considerable extent, utility-oriented attitudes.

40|$|Limited {{information}} is available about consumer willingness to pay for genetically modified food products. This in-formation is of immediate interest to the food industry. An experimental auction was conducted to assess willingness to pay for food items labeled as free of genetically modified ingredients and to evaluate the influence {{of positive and negative}} information about the impact of biotechnology on the environment. Two hypotheses were tested and rejected: 1) Participant bids for products labeled with a non-genetically modified ingredient guarantee equal those for tradition-ally labeled products, and 2) Information bias will not influence the willingness-to-pay differential between non-GM and traditionally labeled products. As application of genetic modification in crop varieties grows and expands in scope, participants throughout the marketing channel face new op-portunities and challenges associated with the development, use, and handling of the resultant products. They must evaluate the potential benefits, costs, and associated risks as part of their strategic decision-making process. For example, growers are faced with decisions about whether to grow genetically modified (GM) crops. Biotechnology companies must make investment decisions includ-ing research, commercialization, and marketing of GM technologies, organisms, and products. Food manufacturers must consider the use of commodi-ties produced with biotechnology and determine labeling and promotion strategies for resultant food products. Consumers have new choices as-sociated with food and other products produced with biotechnology. These and other stakeholders will benefit from information about consumer ac-ceptance of biotechnology and factors influencing it.

In this process, the personal judgments of occupational safety and health (OSH) practitioners have great importance. If on one hand, they have the technical knowledge about risk; on the other hand, the decisions can be dependent on their level of <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance.</b> This paper analyzes judgments of OSH practitioners about the level of <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance,</b> using the fuzzy logic approach. A questionnaire to analyze the reported level of <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance</b> was applied. The questionnaire included 79 risk scenarios, each accounting for the frequency of an accident with more lost workdays than a given magnitude. Through the two-step cluster analysis, three groups of OSH practitioners were identified: unacceptable, tolerable, and realistic groups. A further analysis of the realistic group judgments about risk was performed, using the fuzzy logic approach. The fuzzy sets of input and output variables were determined, and the relationship between the variables was mapped through fuzzy rules. After that, the min–max fuzzy inference method was used. The obtained results show that the risk level is acceptable when input variables are at the lowest value and unacceptable when the risk level is high. The obtained results allow us to better understand the modeling of OSH practitioners’ judgments about <b>risk</b> <b>acceptance,</b> noting the uncertainty related to these judgments.
