Every <b>reflexive</b> <b>relation</b> is serial: for a given x, choose y=x. A serial relation can be equivalently characterized as every element having a non-empty successor neighborhood (see the previous section for the definition of this notion). Similarly an inverse serial relation is a relation in which every element has non-empty predecessor neighborhood.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, two {{children}} diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder {{were taught to}} identify <b>reflexive</b> <b>relations</b> across three varying stimuli using procedures outlined in the Promoting the Emergence of Advanced Knowledge Equivalence Module (PEAK-E). Two programs from the PEAK-E module were utilized, programs 2 B and 3 C, both of which incorporated <b>reflexive</b> <b>relations</b> utilizing two differing sensory modalities. Visual relations were directly trained to the participants while the tactile relations were derived and monitored through probes. The same three stimuli were utilized in both PEAK-E programs for each participant; however, those three stimuli varied across participants. All stimuli were retrieved from the participants’ environments and were familiar objects to the participants. The results indicate that only one sense mode, visual, required corrective feedback and praise in order for cross-modal transfer to occur for the second sense mode, tactile. Both participants demonstrated they acquired the reflexive skills for both visual and tactile stimuli. Participant 1 reached mastery criterion for both skills in 36 trials, and participant 2 reached mastery criterion within 20 trials. Limitations and future directions for implication of cross modal transfer are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Outranking {{relations}} such {{as produced}} by the Electre I or II or the Tactic methods {{are based on a}} concordance and non-discordance principle that leads to declaring that an alternative is “superior ” to another, if the coalition of attributes supporting this proposition is “sufficiently important ” (concordance condition) and if there is no attribute that “strongly rejects ” it (non-discordance condition). Such a way of comparing alternatives is rather natural and does not require a detailed analysis of tradeoffs between the various attributes. However, {{it is well known that}} it may produce binary relations that do not possess any remarkable prop-erty of transitivity or completeness. The axiomatic foundations of outranking relations have recently received attention.
