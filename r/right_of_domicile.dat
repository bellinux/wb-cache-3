The introductory chapters are about the legislation since 1848 due to reception of the legislation from the Austria-Hungary (often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources). This inherited legislation is mainly about the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the <b>domicile,</b> health and social care and public health.

Through evaluating the data obtained various aspects of the institute of official address have been explained.

30|$|Germany and Japan are two {{countries}} whose immigration policies {{have traditionally been}} associated with descent (jus sanguinis), a principle which posits that descendants can only be full German or Japanese citizens if born to German or Japanese parents. Both states, in their different ways, have historically adhered to a discourse of belonging called an assimilationist ethno-centrist approach. Both states switched to more restrictive, exclusive regimes for political reasons. Germany had largely been a nation of emigration prior to 1890. Before that, most German states practiced jus domicili (<b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>domicile).</b> It meant that extended residence gave a guarantee to obtain German citizenship. Early forms of state citizenship in Germany were based on residence (domicile)-not on ethnic criteria- simply to exclude incoming poor alien migrants (many of whom were ethnically German) from receiving economic benefits. At the same time, under the Prussian citizenship law of 1842, ten years of continuous residence abroad meant –in principle- the loss of German citizenship. After 1890 the German Reich and its booming economy attracted many foreign labour migrants. These were regarded by the German states as a cheap labour reserve {{that could be used}} to fill labour force gaps. Between 1890 and 1910 the number of foreign nationals had tripled from 430, 000 to 1, 260, 000. Inclusion into the German nation via naturalization was becoming almost impossible with the adoption of the jus sanguinis principle by the new 1913 citizenship law. Indeed, Brubaker (1992) traces the descent-based approach to citizenship and migrants at least to a 1913 law of citizenship - if not to the 1842 Prussian citizenship law. From then, residency (domicile) was not anymore a criteria for citizenship as it used to be. This law was meant to allow German emigres in former German colonies to retain their citizenship.|$|E
