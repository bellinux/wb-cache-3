40|$|We prove global {{existence}} of weak {{solutions for the}} co-rotational FENE dumbbell model and the Doi model also called the <b>Rod</b> model. The <b>proof</b> is based on propagation of compactness, namely if we take a sequence of weak solutions which converges weakly and such that the initial data converges strongly then the weak limit is also a solution...|$|R
40|$|The tie rod of an {{aircraft}} towing tractor failed during trial runs. The tie rod had been circumferentially welded on to a bracket. Microscopic examination {{confirmed that the}} failure was brittle in nature and due to poor quality weld. With a modification of the weld design, the tie <b>rod</b> has withstood <b>proof</b> loading {{and there was no}} cracking after proof loading...|$|R
40|$|We continue, {{and in a}} sense complete, {{our study}} the motion of a rod (line segment) in the plane in the {{presence}} of polygonal obstacles, under an optimality criterion based on minimizing the trace length of a fixed but arbitrary point (called the focus) onthe rod. In an earlier paper, we showed that this problem is NP-hard when the focus is in the relative interior of the <b>rod.</b> Our <b>proof</b> did not cover the case where the focus lies at one of the rod endpoints. Indeed, considerable evidence suggested that this special case might admit a polynomial time solution. In this paper we settle this open problem by proving, by means of a non-trivial adaptation of our earlier construction, that this remaining case is also NP-hard. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{make two}} {{remarks about the}} null-controllability of the heat {{equation}} with Dirichlet condition in unbounded domains. Firstly, we give a geometric necessary condition (for interior null-controllability in the Euclidean setting) which says roughly {{that one can not}} go infinitely far away from the control region without tending to the boundary (if any). The proof builds on heat kernel estimates. Secondly, we describe a class of null-controllable heat equations on unbounded product domains. Elementary examples include an infinite strip in the plane controlled from one boundary and an infinite rod controlled from an internal infinite <b>rod.</b> The <b>proof</b> combines earlier results on compact manifolds with a new lemma saying that the null-controllability of an abstract control system and its null-controllability cost are not changed by taking its tensor product with a system generated by a non-positive self-adjoint operator.
