40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal design of {{insurance and reinsurance}} policies. We first consider reinsurance for catastrophes: risks which are large for any one insurer {{but not for the}} reinsurance market as a whole. Reinsurance for catastrophes is complicated by adverse selection. Optimal reinsurnace in the presence of adverse selection depends critically on the source of information asymmetry. When information on the probability of a loss is private but the magnitude of the loss is public optimal reinsurance employs a deductible-style deductible-style excess-of-loss policy, and when is is private but the proba- bility of a loss is common, optimal <b>reinsurance</b> <b>covers</b> small and large risks, but makes the primary insurer responsible for moderate risks. There is a dramatic divergence between these designs, which suggests that traditional approaches to design may be misguided. We then consider reinsurance for cata- clysms: risks that are so large that a loss can threaten the solvency of re- insurance such as a major earthquake, while others derive from common risks-changes in conditions that affect many individuals-such as the liability revolution or or escalating medical care costs. We argue that cataclysms must be reinsured in either broad securities markets or by the government. Beyond their one- period loss potential, cataclysms pose another risk: risk levels change over time. A simulation model traces the implications of evolving risk levels for long-term patterns of losses and premiums, where the latter reflect learning learning about loss distributions. Premium risk emerges as an important part of risk, which reinsurance and primary insurance markets do not adequately diversify. "...|$|R
40|$|Concern {{over the}} {{possibility}} of an American style medical malpractice "crisis" in the United Kingdom has recently been voiced by members of both medical and legal professions. The validity of such fears is examined by reviewing the conditions that have given rise to the current American difficulties. It is argued that the rise in malpractice insurance premiums and associated restrictions in availability should be seen against the background of underwriting problems specific to medical liability in conjunction with a general decline in <b>reinsurance</b> <b>cover.</b> The evidence in relation to the clinical and resource implications of malpractice is analysed. In particular, arguments that increased litigation has influenced the practice of "defensive" medicine and the choice of specialty are critically examined. Medical malpractice claims and insurance are only part of a professional environment which is undergoing dramatic social and economic changes, many of which seem more plausible candidates to be treated as important influences on the nature and organisation of health care in the United States...|$|E
40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that banking supervision and resolution {{have to be}} organised at the same level. It is often argued, however, {{that there is no}} need to tackle deposit insurance because it is too politically sensitive. This note proposes to apply the principles of subsidiarity and re-insurance to deposit insurance: Existing national deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) would continue to operate much as before (with only minimal standards set by an EU directive), but they would be required to take out re-insurance against risks that would be too large to be covered by them. A European Reinsurance Fund (EReIF) would provide this reinsurance financed by premia paid by the national DGSs, just as any reinsurance company does in the private sector. The European Fund would pay out only in case of large losses. This ‘deductible’ would provide the national authorities with the proper incentives, but the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>cover</b> would stabilize depositor confidence even in the case of large shocks. Ideally the national DGSs would be responsible also for resolution. Experience has shown banking systems are more stable if deposit insurers are also responsible for resolution. The approach proposed here could thus be also used to design the ‘Single Resolution Mechanism’ (SRM) which is being discussed as a complement to the ‘Single Supervisory Mechanism’ (SSM). It will of course take time to build up the funding for such a reinsurance fund. This approach is thus not meant to deal with legacy problems from the current crisis...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the joint impact of earnings management incentives (i. e., income smoothing, solvency management and tax management) and reinsurance, {{together with other}} institutional factors, on the magnitude and direction of claim (loss) reserves errors in the UK’s property-liability insurance industry. Two reserve error definitions, found in literature, are employed to conduct the analysis. Furthermore, a panel data generalised methods of moments (GMM) estimator is employed to incorporate the dynamic nature of current and past loss reserving errors. Using the GMM estimator in a panel of 151 firms over a period from 1991 and 2005, the study finds support for the conclusions of some prior studies but also inconsistencies with other previous research. The present study finds that the inferences drawn from empirical analyses can {{be influenced by the}} definition of loss reserving errors and to some extent how other incentive variables are defined. The {{results of this study suggest}} that discretionary loss reserving behaviour tends to persist from one year to another. Therefore, ignoring the dynamic nature of loss reserving errors could lead to biased and unreliable conclusions. The empirical results of this study also find that property-liability insurance managers manipulate claims reserves in order to smooth company’s earnings across accounting periods. Furthermore, empirical evidence is found which indicates that high levels of reinsurance ceded help to reduce the incidence of error in loss reserves. Contrary to expectations, the evidence presented in this thesis suggests that highly solvent insurers under-estimate their claims liabilities. However, no empirical support is found to indicate that insurers over-reserve in order to reduce and/or postpone period tax liabilities. The study also produced mixed results regarding the relation between the type of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>cover</b> used and claim reserve errors. Nevertheless, the empirical results show that firm-specific effects, such as company size and product mix, can have effect on the accuracy of insurers’ reserves. Finally, as this study gives an important insight on discretionary loss reserve manipulation, its conclusions could be of interest and relevance to the business decisions of investors, policyholders, regulators, and other interested parties (e. g., credit rating agencies and accounting standard settlers) ...|$|E
50|$|Since the 2005 {{pull back}} by {{insurance}} giants Allstate, State Farm, etc., small, in-state {{companies have been}} taking {{a larger share of}} policies. These start-ups have not followed the traditional insurance model by accumulating cash reserves to cover expenses in high claim years. Instead, they pay as much as half of the policy premium for reinsurance to offshore companies to cover claims. In the seven years since the last major Florida hurricane, profits have risen, but many small companies shifted that money into affiliated businesses and ignored the need for a reserve. Insurance rates were based on the company making a reasonable profit after expenses, which included funding a reserve. The OIR suggests that insurance companies have reserves and <b>reinsurance</b> to <b>cover</b> a once in 100-year storm.

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} and banks are {{of great importance}} to the economy, which is why their stability must be ensured. In order to prevent bankruptcies in the financial sector, these companies are subject to strict regulations, which set standards for risk management {{and the amount of}} reserve capital required. Such capital reserves act as safety buffers to protect the customers from extraordinary events. In the insurance industry, the reserve capital {{is referred to as the}} solvency margin. Solvency II is new set of insurance regulations that aims to set a common standard regarding solvency capital and risk management for insurance companies within the European Union. The potential costs and benefits of the regulations are of importance not only to insurance companies but also to those firms that offer services and products to the insurance industry in the field of risk management. Solvency II is often compared to the Basel II accord for banks, which had a strong business case in the way that banks could significantly lower their reserve capital and use it for other purposes. The question is, however, whether insurance companies can expect similar benefits from Solvency II. The purpose of this study is therefore to explain how the Solvency II regulations will affect risk management in the Swedish non-life insurance industry, and whether these changes can result in opportunities for insurance companies. This is achieved by studying the new regulations and conducting a number of interviews with insurance company representatives as well as industry experts. Four potential effects of Solvency II have been investigated: capital levels, insurance pricing, credit ratings and reinsurance. The findings of the study indicate that no obvious benefits related to the potential effects above can be realised by complying with Solvency II. The future capital requirements will come close to those already enforced by supervisors today, resulting in a minor change that can go both ways. Neither credit ratings nor <b>reinsurance</b> <b>covers</b> seem to become notably affected by Solvency II. As for insurance pricing, an increasingly sophisticated risk-based allocation of the cost of solvency capital provides the most notable opportunity of Solvency II, but at present, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of such changes. On the other hand, Solvency II will put pressure on improving systems to ensure the quality and traceability of data. Thus, the actual changes in risk management practices are not expected to be substantial among Swedish non-life insurance companies, and it therefore seems unlikely that insurance companies would be willing to invest as heavily in reaching Solvency II compliance as banks have done in Basel II...|$|R

Reinsurance can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as facultative reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance can be written on either a quota share or excess of loss basis. Facultative reinsurance contracts are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard reinsurance treaties due to their exclusions. The term of a facultative agreement coincides with the term of the policy. Facultative reinsurance is usually purchased by the insurance underwriter who underwrote the original insurance policy, whereas treaty reinsurance is typically purchased by a senior executive at the insurance company.|$|R

50|$|Since its inception, {{the scheme}} has adapted to {{changing}} circumstances {{in the insurance}} market. The most significant changes occurred after the attacks in America on September 11th 2001, which caused insurers and reinsurers to reconsider the way terrorism coverage should be offered. Until that date the conventional insurance and reinsurance market {{had been willing to}} dovetail the cover they provided with that available from the Pool Re scheme. Pool Re’s cover to insurers was restricted to damage caused by acts involving fire or explosion, and the international <b>reinsurance</b> market <b>covered</b> other types of terrorism. After 9/11, however, reinsurers were no longer {{in a position to do}} so. Had Pool Re continued with these restrictions, insurers would have been unable to provide their customers with cover for terrorist events not involving fire or explosion. In an attempt to avoid this situation, there were discussions between representatives of the insurance industry, buyers of insurance, the UK government, Pool Re and others. In July 2002 an agreement was reached to widen cover and amend certain other features of the scheme in a way that responded to these changing needs. In particular, Pool Re’s cover was extended to an “all risks” basis, and no longer restricted to fire or explosion. In addition, exclusions relating to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) attack were removed. Risks related to war and cyber threats are still excluded.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} London Market Excess of Loss Spiral (“LMX Spiral”), a {{phenomenon}} based upon {{excess of loss}} reinsurance contracts that developed within the London reinsurance market of the 1980 s. The unwinding of the LMX Spiral was {{a key factor in}} the crisis the Lloyd’s insurance market had to face in the early 1990 s. However, whilst the crisis resulted in a wave of litigation in the English courts, there is no legal appraisal of the additional element of risk brought by the LMX Spiral itself. The case law instead focuses on the duties of the underwriters and various agents that fuelled its development. This situation is unsatisfactory for two reasons. Firstly, reinsurance spirals are a potential side-effect of XL reinsurance markets and therefore other spirals may develop in the future. Secondly, this thesis shows that once a reinsurance spiral reaches a certain point, it becomes unsustainable, generating instability within the relevant reinsurance market. This thesis provides a detailed legal appraisal of reinsurance spirals and a new analysis of excess of loss reinsurance contracts. The first part sets out the relevant legal principles and describes the LMX Spiral and its impact; listing, for the first time, the “Spiral Effects” identified through reports and actuarial models. The second part reviews the case law and assesses the legal nature of the excess of loss “Spiral Contracts” at the core of any reinsurance spiral, concluding that the Spiral Effects can distort the Spiral Contracts {{to the point where they}} become simple contracts of indemnity.

5000|$|The Marine Insurance Act includes, as a schedule, a {{standard}} policy (known as the [...] "SG form"), which parties were {{at liberty to}} use if they wished. Because each term in the policy had been tested through at least two centuries of judicial precedent, the policy was extremely thorough. However, it was also expressed in rather archaic terms. In 1991, the London market produced a new standard policy wording known as the MAR 91 form using the Institute Clauses. The MAR form is simply a general statement of insurance; the Institute Clauses are used to set out the detail of the insurance cover. In practice, the policy document usually consists of the MAR form used as a cover, with the Clauses stapled to the inside. Typically, each clause will be stamped, with the stamp overlapping both onto the inside cover and to other clauses; this practice is used to avoid the substitution or removal of clauses.because marine insurance is typically underwritten on a subscription basis, the MAR form begins: We, the Underwriters, agree to bind ourselves each for his own part and not one for another .... In legal terms, liability under the policy is several and not joint, i.e., the underwriters are all liable together, but only for their share or proportion of the risk. If one underwriter should default, the remainder are not liable to pick {{his share of the}} claim. Typically, marine insurance is split between the vessels and the cargo. Insurance of the vessels is generally known as [...] "Hull and Machinery" [...] (H&M). A more restricted form of cover is [...] "Total Loss Only" [...] (TLO), generally used as a <b>reinsurance,</b> which only <b>covers</b> the total loss of the vessel and not any partial loss. Cover may be on either a [...] "voyage" [...] or [...] "time" [...] basis. The [...] "voyage" [...] basis covers transit between the ports set out in the policy; the [...] "time" [...] basis covers a period, typically one year, and is more common.|$|R
40|$|Natural hazards affect human {{well-being}} {{in several}} ways. They destroy livelihoods, cause huge losses in production, reduce income and damage property. Many {{poor people in}} developing countries are especially vulnerable to natural risks, {{not only because they}} depend on agricultural production as their major source of income, but also because they are often obliged to settle in risk-prone areas such as hillsides, river basins, etc. It has become even more important to find adequate means to manage natural risks because climate change is causing many of them to increase in frequency and degree. Micro-insurance for natural risks has been proposed as a helpful tool to improve poor peoples’ risk management, and several development-cooperation projects have been initiated in order to promote micro-insurance for natural risks. However, it is not yet clear which risks are insurable in micro-insurance and which are not. This paper therefore analyses which natural risks could be covered by micro-insurance and shows how this can be done. In order to determine the natural risks that could be covered by micro-insurance, a conceptual framework has been developed that adapts current work on the insurability of risks to the case of micro-insurance. This framework is then applied to four different natural risks that can serve as examples for most other natural risks. For example, drought risk can be insured similarly to extreme fluctuations in temperature. The insurability of hail risk, in turn, is representative for storm and typhoon risks, while flood risk poses the same difficulties to micro-insurance as the risk of tsunamis, landslides and volcanic eruptions. Finally, the results from analysing the insurability of livestock diseases are equally applicable to other pests and diseases. Six criteria determine if a risk is insurable in micro-insurance or not. Different microinsurance schemes are best suited to cover the risk – depending on {{the degree to which the}} following criteria are fulfilled: First, the loss must be accidental and unintentional. If it cannot be clearly observed, whether or not the loss was unintentional, only community-based schemes can cover the risk because these schemes are better suited to prevent moral hazard. Second, the chance of loss must be calculable – by using a wide range of information about the probability of occurrence and the expected loss. Third, in order to prevent adverse selection, the insurer needs to be able to classify policyholders according to their individual risk profiles. Because community-based schemes have better access to information about the insured, they might have comparative advantages in assessing the risk profile of the insured. Fourth, the losses should be determinable and measurable at relatively low cost. If this is not possible, an index must be used to approximate losses. In most cases, only full-service insurers have the technical capacity to offer index insurance. Fifth, in order to adequately diversify the risk a sufficiently large risk pool must be formed. For highly covariant risks, for example, only large insurance companies with access to international reinsurance are able to guarantee sufficient risk pooling. And sixth, micro-insurance should be the most adequate risk-management strategy, which means that no other risk-management strategy (such as risk prevention, mitigation or coping) should be superior to it in terms of costefficiency and effectiveness. Applying this framework to natural risks shows that only losses in agricultural production can be covered by micro-insurance, while property damages cannot be covered. Differentiating by the cause of risk, the following results are derived: – Drought risk can be insured in micro-insurance by a full-service insurer. The production losses need to be approximated by an index because on-the-ground loss assessment would be too expensive and allows for moral hazard. Due to the high covariance of this risk, only large insurance companies with access to international <b>reinsurance</b> can <b>cover</b> it. – Hail risk is also insurable in micro-insurance but can only be covered by an innovative micro-insurance scheme. Since the loss assessment requires on-the-ground visits, group insurance must be introduced in order to hold down transaction costs. This risk is not currently covered by micro-insurance because large insurance companies prefer providing index-based micro-insurance, as these are easier to manage and because community-based schemes cannot cover this risk. – The risk of river flood is theoretically insurable, but requires very precise topographic data in order to prevent adverse selection: Advanced technologies have to be used in order to assess the losses in agricultural production through remote sensing. Because the precise data and technology required are not yet available in many developing countries, it is still difficult to insure river flood risk in micro-insurance. – Livestock diseases, finally, are not easily insurable, since most of them can be prevented by sound management practices. Only a very few diseases are insurable, and these risks have to be covered by community-based schemes in order to guarantee immediate loss assessment. Despite the fact that different natural risks can be covered by micro-insurance, there is room to improve the outreach and efficiency of micro-insurance for natural risks by creating an innovative micro-insurance scheme. A promising way to organise a more comprehensive scheme is a national micro-insurance scheme that incorporates community-based insurance schemes in a national umbrella organisation. In such a national micro-insurance scheme, idiosyncratic risks could be covered by the community-based schemes, while the national umbrella would be responsible for covering covariant risks. Such a comprehensive micro-insurance scheme would be able to cover a wider range of natural risks by combining the advantages of existing schemes. Idiosyncratic risks such as certain pests and diseases could be covered, as well as covariant risks such as hail, storms, river floods, tsunamis and landslides. Droughts and fluctuations in temperature could still be covered by index-based micro-insurance. That way, the scheme would not only be able to cover in one contract those risks that have already been insured in micro-insurance, but could also extend the range of insurable risks to cover such risks as hail and storms that are theoretically insurable in micro-insurance, but for which no coverage yet exists...|$|R
