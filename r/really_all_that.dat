25|$|The above {{example of}} a curve winding around a point has a simple topological interpretation. The {{complement}} of {{a point in the}} plane is homotopy equivalent to the circle, such that maps from the circle to itself are <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> need to be considered. It can be shown that each such map can be continuously deformed to (is homotopic to) one of the standard maps , where multiplication in the circle is defined by identifying it with the complex unit circle. The set of homotopy classes of maps from a circle to a topological space form a group, which is called the first homotopy group or fundamental group of that space. The fundamental group of the circle is the group of the integers, Z; and the winding number of a complex curve is just its homotopy class.|$|E

Robert Abele of LA Weekly {{thought the}} pilot was average, {{containing}} [...] "fashionable gore, occasionally witty dialogue, serviceable suspense and boilerplate police-department politics".

500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E

[...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E

The parish church of Saint-Pierre, which had been built in 1870 to replace the {{existing}} 17th-century church, was left in ruins and ultimately rebuilt in 1950. The Calvary had been built between 1602 and 1604 to {{mark the end of}} the bubonic plague epidemic of 1598 and has been classified as a [...] "monument historique" [...] since 1889. The Calvary stands in the centre of Plougastel-Daoulas, just by the parish church. The name of the Calvary in Breton translates as the [...] "Cross of the Plague". It was on 23 August 1944 that the area was bombarded by the American forces as they advanced towards Brest. Several of the statues on the Calvary were badly damaged, as were the three crosses. John D. Skilton, an Army Officer and a curator at the Washington Museum in civilian life, was in Plougastel-Daoulas {{at the time of the}} bombing, saw the damage done and resolved to restore the Calvary. When back in the USA, he formed the [...] "Plougastel Calvary Restoration Fund Inc" [...] to raise the funds needed for the Calvary's restoration and, sufficient funds having been raised, the restoration started in 1949 under the direction of the Ministère des Beaux-Arts et des Monuments Historiques who used the services of the sculptor Millet. Further restoration was carried out between 2003 and 2004. The Calvary is 10 metres high. The various scenes depicted are arranged along the lines of the cardinal points. The scenes relating to the birth of Christ and his burial are grouped on the eastern side, whilst on the northern side are scenes dealing with Christ's suffering. On the southern side the scenes deal with Passover, (the [...] "Last supper"), Jesus' washing of Peter's feet and the [...] "chemin de croix" [...] (the path to Calvary). On the western side we encounter scenes of Christ's death and resurrection.|$|E

It would have been better, perhaps, had he simply stated that it was fortuitous, although I can understand that the court might have hesitated to accept such a statement. That, however, is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> concerns the matter. Colonel Grant happened to be there. That is all that the court need remember.

60|$|I {{have paid}} no poll tax for six years. I {{was put into}} a jail once on this account, for one night; and, as I stood {{considering}} the walls of solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I wondered {{that it should have}} concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to, and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through before they could get to be as free as I was. I did not for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax. They plainly {{did not know how to}} treat me, but behaved like persons who are underbred. In every threat and in every compliment there was a blunder; for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations, which followed them out again without let or hindrance, and they were <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog.

'The College is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is {{necessary}} for a thoroughly good and complete place of education; the hall all lined with kauri pine wood, a large handsome room, collegiate, capable of holding two hundred persons; the school-room, eighty feet long, with admirable arrangements for holding classes separately. There are two very cosy rooms, which belong to the Bishop and Mrs. Selwyn respectively, in one of which I am now sitting.... On the walls are hanging about certain tokens of Melanesia {{in the shape of}} gourds, calabashes, &c., such as I shall send you one day; a spade on one side, just as a common horse halter hanging from Abraham's bookshelf, betokens colonial life. Our rooms are quite large enough, bigger than my room at Feniton, but no furniture, of course, beyond a bedstead, a table for writing, and an old bookcase; but it is never cold enough to care about furniture... I clean, of course, my room in part, make my bed, help to clear away things after meals, &c., and am quite accustomed to do without servants for anything but cooking. There is a weaving room, which used to be well worked, a printing press (from C. M. S.) which has done some good work, and is now at work again--English, Maori, Greek and Hebrew types. Separate groups of buildings, which once were filled with lads from different Melanesian isles--farm buildings, barns, &c. Last of all, the little chapel of kauri wood, stained desk, like the inside of a really good ecclesiastical building in England, porch S.W. angle, a semicircular apse at the west, containing a large handsome stone font, open seats of course. The east end very simple, semicircular apse, small windows all full of stained glass, raised one step, no rails, the Bishop's chair on the north side, bench on the south. Here my eye and my mind rested contentedly and peacefully. The little chapel, holding about seventy persons, is already dear to me. I preached in it last night at the seven o'clock service. We chanted the Unity Psalms CXXII, CXXIII, CXXIV, and CL, heartily, all joining to a dear old double chant in parts. I felt my heart very full as I spoke to them of the blessedness of prayer and spiritual communion. I was at Tamaki in the morning, where I read prayers, the Archdeacon preaching. A little stone church, very rude and simple, but singing again good, and congregation of fifty-one, attentive. At Panmure, about three miles off, in the afternoon, a tiny wooden church--where Abraham took all the duty. In the evening, in the chapel, he read prayers, and I preached to about thirty-five or forty people. We left the chapel just as you were getting ready for breakfast, and so passed my first Sunday in New Zealand. To-day I have had hard work; I walked with Abraham to Auckland--six miles of rough work, I promise you, except the two last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Eustace retired about half-past ten. The {{servants}} {{had already}} gone to their quarters. Only my maid was up, and she had remained in her room {{at the top of}} the house until I needed her services. I sat until after eleven in this room, absorbed in a book. Then I walked round to see that all was right before I went upstairs. It was my custom to do this myself, for, as I have explained, Sir Eustace was not always to be trusted. I went into the kitchen, the butler's pantry, the gun-room, the billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the dining-room. As I approached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open. I flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad-shouldered elderly man, who had just stepped into the room. The window is a long French one, which really forms a door leading to the lawn. I held my bedroom candle lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first man I saw two others, who were in the act of entering. I stepped back, but the fellow was on me in an instant. He caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat. I opened my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. I must have been unconscious for a few minutes, for when I came to myself, I found that they had torn down the bell-rope, and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-table. I was so firmly bound that I could not move, and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from uttering a sound. It was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room. He had evidently heard some suspicious sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as he found. He was dressed in nightshirt and trousers, with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand. He rushed at the burglars, but another--it was an elderly man--stooped, picked the poker out of the grate and struck him a horrible blow as he passed. He fell with a groan and never moved again. I fainted once more, but again it could only have been for a very few minutes during which I was insensible. When I opened my eyes I found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there. Each of them had a glass in his hand. I have already told you, have I not, that one was elderly, with a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. They might have been a father with his two sons. They talked together in whispers. Then they came over and made sure that I was securely bound. Finally they withdrew, closing the window after them. It was quite a quarter of an hour before I got my mouth free. When I did so, my screams brought the maid to my assistance. The other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent for the local police, who instantly communicated with London. That is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> I can tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again." ...|$|E
