40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{scattering}} characteristics of <b>ridging</b> <b>patterns</b> in agriculture {{by the use}} of C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. The polarimetric signatures of periodic potato fields and row wheat in different directions are highlighted using a set of polarimetric parameters. Enhanced coherent scattering is observed when the alignment direction of the <b>ridging</b> <b>patterns</b> is perpendicular to the radar's line of sight (LOS). The dominant backscattering mechanism of the <b>ridging</b> <b>patterns</b> is deduced by evaluating different polarimetric parameters. The increased copolarized backscattering coefficients and copolarized correlation coefficient, and the reduced entropy and polarimetric alpha angle, indicate a strong contribution of odd scattering to <b>ridging</b> <b>patterns</b> aligned perpendicular to the LOS. We also compare the dominant contributions to the backscattering of <b>ridging</b> <b>patterns</b> in different phenological stages. Although the canopy changes of potato and wheat with time are significant, the underlying periodic surface changes the dominant scattering mechanism of potato fields over all the phenological stages, and the wheat aligned parallel with the flight direction of radar still has relatively high coherent scattering in the different vegetation development stages. The variability analyses undertake in this study allow a more detailed documentation of the physical scattering process of the <b>ridging</b> <b>patterns</b> in agriculture, and will improve the applicability of synthetic aperture radar images in agriculture.

40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the use of}} condoms by sexual offenders has been observed. This is likely to be due both to the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and to prevent the transfer of DNA evidence. In this scenario the detection of condom lubricants at a crime scene could aid in proving corpus delicti. Here we show a novel application of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI MSI) for mapping the fingermark <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern</b> simultaneously to the detection of the condom lubricant within the fingermark itself. Two condom brands have been investigated to prove the concept. Condoms were handled producing lubricant-contaminated fingermarks. Images of the <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern</b> were obtained simultaneously to the detection of two lubricants, even several weeks after the fingermark deposition. The results therefore show the potential of MALDI MSI to link the suspect (identification through fingermark <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern)</b> to the crime (detection of condom lubricant) in one analysis. This would enable forensic scientists to provide evidence with stronger support in alleged cases of sexual assault...|$|R

The percentage of similarity on minutiae distribution is around 22. 00 %- 46. 07 %.

40|$|Background The {{parallel}} <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern</b> (PRP) {{is considered}} the dermoscopic hallmark of acral melanoma (AM). However, it was recently shown that approximately one-third of AMs do not display a PRP dermoscopically, rendering their detection more troublesome. Objectives To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopic criteria for the diagnosis of AM. Methods Dermoscopic images of consecutive cases of histopathologically diagnosed AMs and acral naevi with histopathological diagnosis or with at least 1 year of follow-up were evaluated by three independent investigators {{for the presence of}} predefined criteria. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals were calculated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to choose among competing classification schemes. Results In total 603 lesions (472 naevi and 131 AMs) were included in the study. A scoring system (named BRAAFF) composed of six variables was associated with optimal area under the curve and sensitivity for the diagnosis of AM. This method includes four positive (irregular blotches, <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern,</b> asymmetry of structures and asymmetry of colours) and two negative predictors (furrow pattern and fibrillar pattern). Conclusions The BRAAFF checklist significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy for the diagnosis of AM...|$|R
40|$|Latent fingermarks are {{impressions}} of the skin <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern</b> that are transferred by the accidental contact of fingertips with a deposition surface. The ability to enhance, lift and produce {{an image of a}} latent fingermark, for comparison and suspect match against a central fingerprint database, provides forensic investigators with what is still {{considered one of the most}} powerful means of biometric identification to date. Identification relies on the recovery, visualisation, extraction and comparison of local characteristics of the <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern</b> (minutiae) that are unique to individuals. Therefore, both for manual inspection of the minutiae and using automated ridge extraction algorithms, the clearer the ridge details, the more reliable and successful the match. Overlapping fingermarks pose a remarkable challenge in this context and are often encountered when developing marks from crime scenes. Here we propose the use of Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI MSI) to separate overlapping fingermarks using ion signals that are characteristic of each fingermark and that may be endogenous or exogenous in nature. In this work we show that the methodology works in a number of different scenarios both using manual inspection of the spectrum profile or a much quicker multivariate statistical analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} of “Level 2 ” detail — ridge terminations, ridge bifurcations, bridges etc. — from digitised images of fingerprints requires an accurate segmentation {{of the image}} into ridges and valleys. Small breaks and irregularities in the <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern</b> occur {{as a result of}} imperfections in the print capture process that, if not rectified, give rise to many false level 2 features at later stages of the analysis. We propose a method for enhancing the <b>ridge</b> <b>pattern</b> by applying a process of oriented diffusion, which is an adap-tation of anisotropic diffusion. This acts to smooth the im-age only in the direction parallel to the ridge flow. The re-sult is an image in which intensity varies smoothly as one traverses along the ridges or valleys, with most of the small irregularities and breaks removed, but with the identity of the individual ridges and valleys preserved. The method offers the advantage of requiring no prior estimate of the ridge frequency. Results show improved performance by comparison with the method of enhancement using frequency-tuned filters, which sometimes performs well but may produce erroneous results if the filter is tuned to a frequency that does not match the actual ridge frequency. ...|$|R
