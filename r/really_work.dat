In a YouTube video published on September 22, DiBiase introduced his new gimmick to hold tailgating parties with fans just before WWE events, terming those who tailgated with him as the [...] "DiBiase Posse"; DiBiase also acknowledged that mimicking his father's rich gimmick [...] "didn't <b>really</b> <b>work</b> out".|$|E

[...] The Times critic Dominic Maxwell thought the [...] "languid timing that Gervais brings to Extras and The Office was wrong here. Simpsons cameos are normally lean, but Gervais's shtick ran rampant through the second half, turning the regulars into extras." [...] Maxwell did find the episode entertaining though, stating that [...] "it was a decent late-period Simpsons episode" [...] and that it featured [...] "some fine jokes." [...] He concluded that [...] "even a middling Simpsons episode is still bright and tight and brilliantly rendered.

Overall he said that the [...] "first season ends, not with a bang, but with a whimper". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club felt that the previous episode, , would have served better as an end to the first season as [...] "The Neutral Zone" [...] wasn't the worst so far, [...] "but it may possibly be the most frustrating, because it has two storylines". He felt that the Romulan plot would have been sufficient alone and described the storyline featuring the cryogenic survivors as [...] "extremely painful comic relief".

500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things <b>REALLY</b> <b>work</b> in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E
500|$|Itchy and Scratchy {{cartoons}} {{are often}} added when a show needs expanding or {{when there is}} an issue that the writers wish to satirize. In some cases, notably in [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show," [...] the writers use Itchy & Scratchy as a way to comment on The Simpsons. The shorts are often difficult for the writers, and take much time to develop and devise a title, and in the end they fill little time. Writing the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons is quite often a group effort, with it being pitched out one gag after another. Itchy & Scratchy are a favorite of John Swartzwelder, who has written many of the episodes that center on them and quite often pitches the ideas for the shorts. In the early seasons, fans wanted more Itchy & Scratchy, so the writers decided to do [...] "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge," [...] an episode also dealt with censorship issues which would allow them to show several cartoons. The cartoons are often kept short, because according to David Silverman, [...] "it doesn't <b>really</b> <b>work</b> as a long cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. The two were {{critical}} of the storyline, noting that it [...] "doesn't <b>really</b> <b>work</b> as either a Don't Look Now ghost story or as a conspiracy piece", but praised the acting of Pileggi and the dialogue written by Gordon; the two called the former [...] "great" [...] and the latter [...] "so terse and so real". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She referred to the scenes between Skinner and Sharon as [...] "contrived" [...] and derided Skinner's bedside confession as [...] "simply poor writing". Vitaris was positive of Duchovny and Hetrick's acting, and wrote that Pileggi gave [...] "his best" [...] {{despite the fact that}} there was little chemistry between the characters to make it effective. David Duchovny, on the other hand, was very pleased with the episode and Mitch Pileggi's performance; he later noted, [...] "It was nice for Mitch, and I think he deserved an episode after two years. He did a great job".|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club Zack Handlen {{rated the}} episode a [...] "B-". Handlen {{considered}} that while [...] "'Synchrony' {{has all the}} pieces of my favorite kind of episode, [...] doesn't <b>really</b> <b>work</b> {{as well as it}} should" [...] due to an emotional detachment that made him not care about the scientists and their story, and his finding Old Jason's actions to be illogical. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave [...] "Synchrony" [...] two out of four stars, considering it a middling episode with some effective moments, but complaining about plot holes, [...] "not particularly compelling" [...] supporting characters, and feeling that time travel [...] "takes away from the reality that is this show's foundation". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode {{two and a half stars}} out of five, praising the [...] "high concept that is told without pretension". The two also called the episode [...] "solid and watchable" [...] despite flaws such as the underdevelopment of the script and not fully exploring the [...] "concept with such potential" [...] that is time travel.|$|E
500|$|Although {{having written}} about eight songs while on tour in 2005, Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy {{decided to write}} new music because they wanted the album to be [...] "...quite new, to be quite {{different}} sounding from everything we've ever done before." [...] Despite having recorded their second album in {{a short amount of}} time, Kapranos stressed that the band wanted to take their time. He voices, [...] "This time we wanted to spend more time developing, and also, I suppose, allowing songs and sounds to evolve more before we ended up writing an album, and absorbing more music and ideas and, I suppose, life itself. And when I say life, I mean life off the road, because I wouldn't classify life on the road as real life." [...] Franz Ferdinand began working on Tonight in early 2007. Franz Ferdinand was supposed to record the album with producer Brian Higgins, yet in March 2008, the two entities parted ways. The drummer, Paul Thomson, says [...] "We wrote with Higgins for a while and initially we thought we'd work more with him but it didn't <b>really</b> <b>work</b> out. We just realized that we're not really a pop group." [...] However, they also commented they have not given up on the pop concept. The songs on the album were written and recorded at the old town hall of Govan, Scotland as well as Mr. Dan's Studio in Buckeye, Arizona. The band first moved into Govan's old town hall following a year of touring in support of their second studio album and mostly used it for storing and rehearsing.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} her {{disfigured}} face, Mileena is often rated among the most attractive characters in video games. UGO Networks counted Mileena among the best-looking female ninja-type characters in all media, and ranked her as the [...] "seventh-finest" [...] female fighter in 2010, but advised to [...] "be careful around that big scary demon mouth she keeps under the skarf."

[...] Mileena's breasts placed 31st and ninth on the lists of the finest chests in gaming by GameFront's Ross Lincoln in 2011 and Complex's Drea Avellan in 2012, respectively.
