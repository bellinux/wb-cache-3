5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially {{to gain control}} of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania {{on a collision course with}} Moscow and other <b>regional</b> <b>powers,</b> which had also attempted expansion in that area.|$|E
5|$|A wealthy {{resident}} of al-Rahba, Ibn Mahkan, revolted against the Fatimids and {{took control of}} the town shortly after Lu'lu departed. Though able to oust the Fatimid governor, Ibn Mahkan was unable to hold the town without outside support since al-Rahba was located amid the crossroads of several <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> who coveted the town. Thus, he gained the backing of the Mirdasid emir of the Banu Kilab tribe, Salih ibn Mirdas. Conflict arose between Ibn Mahkan and Salih leading the latter to besiege al-Rahba. The two reconciled and then Ibn Mahkan and his men captured the fortified town of Anah in Anbar. However, when Ibn Mahkan sought Salih's support in suppressing a revolt in Anah, the latter used the opportunity to kill Ibn Mahkan.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> interact with one another.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{position of}} Iran in the Middle East {{and is trying}} to find out whether Iran is <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> or not. In the first part the key concepts for defining <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> are explained. Because of absence of unified view on phenomenon of <b>regional</b> <b>power,</b> our own characteristics of it are introduced. Second part is focused on Iran and its position as an actor of international relations in five areas: identity, geopolitical position, foreign policy, regional security and economy. In next part the characteristics of <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> defined in the first part are applied on the findings about Iran. Based on this application, the thesis comes to an opinion that Iran can be marked as <b>regional</b> <b>power.</b> However, it still faces challenges, which are shortly indicated in the final part of the thesis...|$|R
5|$|Alboin first {{distinguished}} {{himself on}} the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the Battle of Asfeld (552), he killed Turismod, son of the Gepid king Thurisind, in a victory {{that resulted in the}} Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival <b>regional</b> <b>powers.</b> After the battle, according to a tradition reported by Paul the Deacon, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. Walter Goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical topos of an epic poem.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{as a small}} {{settlement}} in the seventh millennium BC, Tell Brak evolved during the fourth millennium BC {{into one of the}} biggest cities in Upper Mesopotamia, and interacted with the cultures of southern Mesopotamia. The city shrank in size {{at the beginning of the}} third millennium BC with the end of Uruk period, before expanding again around c. 2600 BC, when it became known as Nagar, and was the capital of a regional kingdom that controlled the Khabur river valley. Nagar was destroyed around c. 2300 BC, and came under the rule of the Akkadian Empire, followed by a period of independence as a Hurrian city-state, before contracting at the beginning of the second millennium BC. Nagar prospered again by the 19th century BC, and came under the rule of different <b>regional</b> <b>powers.</b> In c. 1500 BC, Tell Brak was a center of Mitanni before being destroyed by Assyria c. 1300 BC. The city never regained its former importance, remaining as a small settlement, and abandoned at some points of its history, until disappearing from records during the early Abbasid era.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Rome: Total War, Europa Barbarorums strategic campaign sees the player take control of a particular faction and then compete for territory and resources against all the other factions, which are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The player is presented with a map of Europe, North Africa and the Near East in which territory is divided into 200 provinces, each of which contains a province capital, which will at any given point be controlled either by the player's faction, a rival playable faction, or the non-playable Eleutheroi faction, which represents the world's minor kingdoms, <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> and rebel states. If a faction should at any point find itself not in control of any provinces, it is eliminated from the game. Gameplay is turn-based, each turn representing the passage of three months on the campaign map (unlike the six months of {{the original}} Rome: Total War) and alternating between the player managing their empire and the artificial intelligence making all the other factions' moves. A key game mechanic of the campaign map is the annexation of territory, which is done province-by-province, either by successfully besieging the province capital, or by acquiring it from another faction through diplomacy. Once a faction has acquired a province, they may construct buildings in the province capital which either enable the recruitment of certain military units or grant various bonuses to the city such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of the province rebelling. Provided the city contains the appropriate buildings, the player may recruit military units in the city {{at the same time as}} undertaking construction projects. The aim of the game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and/or eliminate specified rival factions (in Europa Barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each faction), whilst avoiding being eliminated by the other factions.|$|E

25|$|The state {{declined}} {{beginning in}} the late 11th century and during the 12th century, disintegrating into various rival <b>regional</b> <b>powers.</b> It was further weakened by economic factors such as the collapse of Rus' commercial ties to Byzantium due to the decline of Constantinople and the accompanying diminution of trade routes through its territory.

25|$|In 981–82, {{relations}} between the Jarrahids and the Fatimids collapsed and the former were driven out of Palestine. They sacked a Hajj pilgrim caravan later in 982, then annihilated a Fatimid army at Ayla, before being defeated and forced to flee north toward Homs.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Over {{the past}} few years the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has been facing <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> {{shortages}}. These <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> shortages currently being experienced within the SADC region have been partly {{due to a lack of}} generation capacity and transmission capacity constraints. This situation has been further aggravated by the unanticipated economic growth within the SADC region. In order for the SADC region to meet its electricity demand, the region needs to invest in new generation and transmission projects. However, due to the inability of regional utilities to raise funds to finance these projects, the projects tend to not reach financial close resulting in the increase of the <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> deficits. Although these <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> shortages have been attributed to the lack of adequate investment in power generation projects and power transmission interconnector projects, this research report was limited to the development and financing of power transmission interconnector projects. The objective of this research report was to identify the dynamics that prohibit <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> transmission interconnectors from reaching financial close and to recommend possible solutions on how best to develop and package these projects. The research used the proposed developmental approach of the ZIZABONA transmission interconnector project as a case study to develop a generic model that could be utilised on other regional transmission interconnector projects. Based on the research presented in this research report, the study has highlighted project finance as a viable funding strategy. Regional utilities can utilise this funding strategy to package and finance joint transmission regional interconnectors to alleviate the current <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> shortages by facilitating regional electricity trade...|$|R
