He supported an amendment by Senator Richard Russell, Jr. to remove funds for the Nike-Zeus antimissile system from a defense procurement bill, and endorsed a motion by Senator Margaret Chase Smith to add $134,000,000 for two additional nuclear submarines to the same bill. He sponsored the law creating share-draft checking accounts for savings institutions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Brownfield land {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{exploited}} resources forurban development in a number of Eastern European countries. Establishing a rational strategy for redeveloping brownfields is an unambiguously complex task that requires considering a number of different economic, social, physical and environmental factors. The strategic decision-making has a long term impact on the quality of life, ecological balance and urban structure. Therefore, the paper is aimed at developing a comprehensive set of criteria that contribute to the redevelopment of brownfield land in urban areas. Itfocuses on six main development strategies that embrace creating residential, green, commercial, recreational activity and industrial areas or leaving land as a reserve. Geographic information system (GIS) tools are employed to collect thespatial information, obtain the initial set of criteria and derive the statistical data. Expert’s evaluations along with a statistical method of gauging the level of concordance of their opinion combined with Delphi method areusedfor determining significance of criteria within economic, social, physical (urbanistic) and environmental criteria groups. This studyestablishes the most significant criteria for implementing different scenarios of the brownfield land redevelopment in Vilnius, Lithuania. Developed framework will support the decision-making process in the brownfield land <b>redevelopment</b> <b>aiding</b> a sustainable urban planning...|$|R

500|$|The 7 Subway Extension is {{a subway}} {{extension}} of the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line. The extension stretches [...] southwest from its previous terminus at Times Square, at Seventh Avenue and 41st Street, to one new station at 34th Street and Eleventh Avenue. A second station at 10th Avenue and 41st Street was dropped from the plans in October 2007. The entirety of the extension is located within the New York City borough of Manhattan and is served by the [...] local and [...] express services. The extension, {{a key part of}} the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, is expected to bring business and entertainment into the area, as well as <b>aid</b> <b>redevelopment</b> of nearby Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen, located around the Long Island Rail Road's West Side Yard. The extension also serves the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.|$|R
50|$|Ridley-Thomas {{would have}} been forced to leave the council in 2003 because of city term limits that {{prevented}} him from running for reelection, so he chose instead to run for a seat in the California State Assembly representing California's 48th district. In his 2002 election, he defeated his Republican opponent, Gerard T. Robinson, with more than 80% of the vote. In the Assembly, Ridley-Thomas served as chair of the Democratic caucus and was a major proponent of efforts to encourage an NFL team to move to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is located in his district. He also sponsored a law that <b>aided</b> <b>redevelopment</b> in Exposition Park as part of a failed effort to attract a team. In the Assembly, Ridley-Thomas, as chairman of the Select Committee on the Los Angeles County Health Care Crisis, was a leader in addressing the problems facing the hospitals and health care system of Los Angeles, sponsoring a bill that would create the Office of Inspector General in an effort to detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in government agencies.|$|R

They must support Southern voter registration and Negro political candidates and demand that Democratic Party liberals do the same (in the last Congress, Dixiecrats split with Northern Democrats on 119 of 300 roll-calls, mostly on civil rights, area <b>redevelopment</b> and foreign <b>aid</b> bills; and breach was much larger {{than in the previous}} several sessions). Labor should begin a major drive in the South. In the North, reform clubs (either independent or Democratic) should be formed to run against big city regimes on such issues as peace, civil rights, and urban needs. Demonstrations should be held at every Congressional or convention seating of Dixiecrats. A massive research and publicity campaign should be initiated, showing to every housewife, doctor, professor, and worker the damage done to their interests every day a racist occupies a place in the Democratic Party. Where possible, the peace movement should challenge the [...] "peace credentials" [...] of the otherwise-liberals by threatening or actually running candidates against them." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} opportunities in rural development. Often {{we think of}} development {{as a function of}} location. In the pursuit of economic development, analysts and practitioners tend to consider the advantages [...] economic, geographic, and institutional [...] of one location over another. Rural areas often weigh in toward the bottom of such analyses because they enjoy few of the traditional, i. e., location-dependent, resources for development. The general question underlying this dissertation is: How do rural communities find opportunities for economic development without the traditional resources to serve as stimuli? Local responses to air force bases closures during the 1990 s are examined, first, through a comparative analysis between the groups of six rural and 26 metropolitan host communities of closed bases and, second, through case studies of four host communities [...] three rural and one metropolitan. Principle findings included:(cont.) *Surprisingly, the rural host communities achieved success in base redevelopment comparable to metropolitan host communities despite significant economic, geographic, and institutional gaps between the two groups in the study. *Residents mobilized in response to base-closure crises in every community. Through participation in base reuse planning activities, residents grew knowledgeable in base-related issues that, ultimately, <b>aided</b> <b>redevelopment</b> and compensated for the lack of more formal local development expertise. *Host communities capitalized upon much-needed development assets they derived from federal resources [...] grants, technical assistance, and base property. *By {{the end of the study}} period, the rural host communities, in particular, had improved their capacity to plan and manage future development through the accumulation and capitalization of assets derived from local and federal resources in base redevelopment. by Lois A.
