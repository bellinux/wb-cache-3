5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the <b>Rome</b> <b>Convention</b> sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E

The {{construction}} of the European information market has justified the adoption of several harmonizing measures on copyright law. The approach followed is to establish minimal standards and minimal harmonization. However, media analysis activities claim special rules of protection, having in consideration the Bern and the <b>Rome</b> <b>Conventions,</b> concerning the exclusive right of reproduction, the protection of fait divers and the principle of copyright fair use. Media analysis is an information service that includes monitoring and clipping activities. Some argue that these businesses could be justified under the private copy exception as mandates of their clients. However, the commercial nature of this use seems notorious. Perhaps it should be more adequate {{to establish a system}} of compulsory licenses for these activities, in exchange for an equitable compensation to copyright holders. Moreover, it is remarked that the free flow of information should not be eclipsed in the interpretation of the EC Directive on database protection. In any case, the solution to the conflict of interests placed by these activities should take in due consideration not only the interests of media analysis undertakings and the interests of their clients, but also the interests of the right holders and the general interes...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the few}} general {{concepts}} of European private law {{is the concept of}} the term consumer which can be found in various EC contract law directives {{as well as in the}} Brüssels and <b>Rome</b> <b>Conventions.</b> There are, however, certain tensions between the concept of the term consumer and traditional civil law thinking. An analysis of these tensions leads to the argument that European Consumer Law directives could be transformed into national contract law more smoothly if these tensions can be avoided. Therefore this article argues that the term consumer should be construed in a way which is in accordance with basic principles of private law. Based on this anaylsis, the article discusses different concepts for an interpretation of the term consumer. This discussion leads to the conclusion: The best way to make European consumer contract law more compatible with national laws would be a construction of the term consumer which is based on legal interest analysis as opposed to purely sociological or economic concepts. Such a legal interest analysis has to take into consideration that according to sources of European law consumers are protected only in certain situations (e. g. doorstep selling; temptation by credit offers; use of preformulated contract terms). A common feature of these situations is that they create handicaps to freedom of contractual choice. As a consequence, a non-consumer is somebody who is able to cope with these handicaps because of his personal skills, his personal experiences or knowledge. The purpose of the term consumer is to typify those persons who lack such personal skills, experience or knowledge. This concept of consumer contracts is then applied to cases in which it is doubtful whether somebody can be called a consumer (e. g. credit contracts of a person who want to become self-employed or the sale of a whole business in order to retreat into private life or "mixed contracts", with which somebody buys goods for both private and business use) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{neighbouring}} rights, introduced for {{the first}} time in the 1991 Fundamentals, were much expanded and clarified in the 1993 copyright law, following the provisions of the <b>Rome</b> <b>Convention</b> and in some cases also the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT).

25|$|The {{changing}} {{economy in}} the Soviet Union led to {{the conclusion of a}} trade treaty between the USSR and the United States, signed by presidents Gorbachev and Bush on June 1, 1990. In this treaty, the U.S. imposed a number of measures in the field of intellectual property in exchange for granting the USSR most-favoured-nation status. The treaty obliged the USSR to accede to the Berne Convention and to implement in its law a neighbouring rights scheme similar to what the <b>Rome</b> <b>Convention</b> laid down. The USSR agreed in the treaty to take substantive steps to amend its legislation in that sense by 1991. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. on December 23, 1991. The Soviet side no longer could do so, but the Russian Federation did so on June 12, 1992.|$|E
25|$|Performers {{are granted}} the {{exclusive}} rights to their performance, including a right to remuneration for any uses of a performance or a recording thereof. Besides the right to perform a performance and to deny others to perform it, these exclusive rights cover also the live broadcasting of a performance, and the video or audio recording of a previously unfixed performance. As in article 7(1)(c) of the <b>Rome</b> <b>Convention</b> for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, performers' rights also cover the reproduction of non-authorized recordings, and also the reproduction of recordings for purposes other than those agreed upon, including the broadcast of a recording made for non-commercial purposes only. For broadcasts of records made for commercial purposes, the performers, together with the phonogram producer, have only a remuneration right on this secondary use of phonograms.|$|E

25|$|While the Hasbro case {{considered}} {{a special case}} of the applicability of rule of the shorter term {{in the context of}} the UCC, the case of Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc. (4 N.Y.3d 540, 2nd Cir. 2005) had the occasion to consider the matter under Berne Convention. In this case, Capitol Records claimed copyright on old British sound recordings from the 1930s, on which the copyright in the United Kingdom had expired in the late 1980s. Naxos Records, which also and in competition to Capitol distributed restored versions of these recordings, challenged this copyright claim. Sound recordings are a special case because pre-1972 sound recordings in the United States are not covered by federal law but by state law. The court concluded that since federal law did not apply, and because nothing in the Berne Convention (which is inapplicable to sound recordings anyway) or the <b>Rome</b> <b>Convention</b> usurped the State of New York's law, the works were under copyright pursuant to New York common lawwhile the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and US statutes did not, and had never, offered protection to these works; the fact that they were not under copyright in the UK as of 1996 was completely irrelevant.|$|E

2500|$|To apply one {{national}} legal system as against another {{may never be}} an entirely satisfactory approach. The parties' interests may always be better protected by applying a law conceived with international realities in mind. The Hague Conference on Private International Law is a treaty organization that oversees conventions designed to develop a uniform system. [...] The deliberations of the conference have recently {{been the subject of}} controversy over the extent of cross-border jurisdiction on electronic commerce and defamation issues. There is a general recognition {{that there is a need}} for an international law of contracts: for example, many nations have ratified the Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods, the <b>Rome</b> <b>Convention</b> on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations offers less specialized uniformity, and there is support for the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, a private restatement, all of which represent continuing efforts to produce international standards as the internet and other technologies encourage ever more interstate commerce. But other branches of the law are less well served and the dominant trend remains the role of the forum law rather than a supranational system for Conflict purposes. Even the EU, which has institutions capable of creating uniform rules with direct effect, has failed to produce a universal system for the common market. Nevertheless, the Treaty of Amsterdam does confer authority on the Community's institutions to legislate by Council Regulation in this area with supranational effect. Article 177 would give the Court of Justice jurisdiction to interpret and apply their principles so, if the political will arises, uniformity may gradually emerge in letter. Whether the domestic courts of the Member States would be consistent in applying those letters is speculative.|$|E
