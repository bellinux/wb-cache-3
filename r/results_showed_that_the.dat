5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire {{wolves in}} two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. The <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 15,000YBP dire wolves had {{three times more}} tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the free}} {{population}} 23.4% {{of males and}} 13.4% of females were considered literate. Men represented 52% (5,123,869) of the total population. Figures for the population by age showed 24.6% were children younger than 10 years old; 21.1% were adolescents and young men between 11 and 20; 32.9% were adults between 21 and 40; 8.4% were between 41 and 50; 12.8% were between 51 and 70; and lastly, only 3.4% were over 71. The residents in the combined northeast and southeast regions comprised 87.2% of the nation's population. The second national census was held in 1890 when the Brazilian republic {{was only a few}} months old.

5|$|In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} {{mitochondrial}} analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the lesser kudu basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala (T. angasii). On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. On the other hand, the nuclear data shows that lesser kudu and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, the <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was {{along the lines of}} social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E

In this double-blind RCT, 499 primarily breast-fed infants were fed for 6 months with a daily milk-based complementary food that included either whey protein concentrate enriched in MFGM, or {{an equal amount of}} additional protein from skim milk (control). <b>Results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group with the MFGM-supplemented diet had a significantly lower prevalence of diarrhea during the study compared to the control group (3.84% vs 4.37%; P<0.05), as well as a significant reduction (46%) in episodes of bloody diarrhea compared to the control group (P=0.025).|$|E

25|$|In a {{study of}} women {{experiencing}} Premenstrual Syndrome, they were either given a placebo beverage or a carbohydrate-rich one.

The <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> carbohydrate-rich beverage significantly decreased self-reported depression, anger, confusion, and carbohydrate craving 90 to 180 minutes after consumption. Memory word recognition also improved significantly.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Algeria {{held its}} first multiparty {{elections}} since independence. Ahmed Zaoui stood {{as a candidate for}} the Islamic Salvation Front (Front Islamique du Salut or FIS). However, the government cancelled 1991 elections after the first round <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FIS would win, citing fears that the Islamist party would end democracy. When the government then banned the FIS and arrested thousands of its members, Islamist guerrillas rapidly emerged and began an armed campaign against the government and its supporters which became the Algerian Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Human {{soft tissue}} is highly deformable, and its {{mechanical}} properties vary significantly {{from one person}} to another.

Such properties may be useful for forensics investigation when contusions were induced. When solid object impact a human soft tissues, the energy of the impact will be absorbed by the tissues to reducing effect of the impact or the pain level, therefore; subjects with more soft tissue thickness tended to absorb the impacts with less aversion.|$|E

However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related to childhood experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participant's relationship with their fathers.|$|E
25|$|Homfray {{believes}} that {{the first of the}} mines to be worked was at the village of Hattoreah Aytoorah, being a place where the coal seam came to the surface. By September 1775 around 2500 maunds (91.5 imperial tons) of coal had been sent by river to Calcutta for testing. These tests were delayed, at least in part because the partners in the business were also engaged in their duties on behalf of the East India Company. Some prompting in 1777 caused the tests finally to be undertaken in January 1778. The <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coal was of too poor a quality for use by the Company, producing 50% less heat than British coal.|$|E

Campaigning wrapped up 7 March 2008 for general elections that could see gains for Malaysia's opposition amid anger over race and religion among minority Chinese and Indians. Malaysians voted 8 March 2008 in parliamentary elections. Election <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ruling government suffered a setback when it failed to obtain two-thirds majority in parliament, and five out of 12 state legislatures were won by the opposition parties. Reasons for the setback of the ruling party, which has retained power since the nation declared independence in 1957, were rising inflation, crime and ethnic tensions.|$|E

25|$|The first Bf 109 in serial production, the Bf 109 B-1, {{was fitted}} with the 670PS (661hp, 493kW) Jumo 210D engine driving a two-bladed {{fixed-pitch}} propeller. During the production run a variable-pitch propeller was introduced and often retrofitted to older aircraft; these were then unofficially known as B-2s. The Bf 109B saw combat with the Legion Condor during the Spanish Civil War, {{although it was}} apparent that the armament was still inadequate. Several aircraft were produced with an engine-mounted machine gun but it was very unreliable, most likely because of engine vibrations and overheating. Thus the Bf 109 V8 was constructed to test the fitting of two more machine guns in the wings; however, <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wing needed strengthening. In the following V9 prototype, both wing guns were replaced by 20mm MG FF cannons.|$|E
