The BBC regularly broadcast sports programmes with an outside studio team, occasionally from two or three separate locations. Production assistant Bryan Cowgill put forward {{a proposal for a}} programme lasing three hours; one hour dedicated to major events and two hours showing minor events. Outside Broadcast members held a meeting in April 1958 and Cowgill further detailed his plans taking timing and newer technical facilities into consideration. During the development of the programme, problems arose over the proposed schedule which would result in the programme ending at 4:45pm to allow the <b>recreational</b> <b>programme</b> Children's Hour to broadcast.

This movement, which originated in an environment of Liberal Nonconformity, 'muscular' Christianity, and adolescent-centred educational and social outreach, was linked initially {{to the needs of the}} Sunday School movement in urban Scotland. From its evangelical and Volunteer base, the Brigade expanded into an international interdenominational youth organisation, establishing specific roots in South Africa. The present study pays attention to the composition, philosophy, •and objectives of the B.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} a scripted modular intervention programme called Speaking Out. Speaking Out is administered by trained volunteers in the home and focuses on the everyday communicative activities of aphasic stroke patients. The experimental design used repeated measures to examine the effect of counterbalanced treatments across individual subjects and across two matched groups. One group improved significantly on the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) after the Speaking Out programme but there were no significant differences on any of the functional communication measures. Some change to health status scales was however found. There was a significant difference on both the WAB and the ASHA Functional Assessment of Communication Skills (ASHA FACS) for the other group following the Speaking Out programme. They also demonstrated some positive changes on the health status scales following the programme. There were more significant differences on intragroup comparisons than intergroup comparisons. For group 2, the ASHA FACS and the SF- 36 showed significant differences between the Speaking Out programme and the <b>recreational</b> <b>programme</b> or no treatment at all. It was concluded that long standing aphasic speakers may benefit from a 10 week functional communication therapy programme delivered by trained volunteers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Soweto {{is a place}} “caught between old {{squatter}} {{misery and}} new prosperity, squalor and an upbeat lifestyle” (Group, n. d.) and the continued forging of lives through ‘hustling’. The Hustler is an integral character in any township and is the embodiment of resilience theory (Salt & Walker, 2006). The opportunity to intervene in this context lies {{in the nature of}} the ‘hustle’ between the wetland as a resource and the people who would promote its well-being as such. The premise of this study is that through an architectural intervention that speaks to the land and the people, a greater appreciation of the relationship between the natural and human systems will be developed and continued. The community’s desire for self-improvement yields the opportunity for a building to become a distributor of skills within the local community and beyond the immediate context. The focus area for the site is the vacant concrete beam and column infrastructure formerly used by the power station present on site east of the Heroes’ Bridge and Nomzamo Informal Settlement. The structure is optimally positioned in relation to the wetland, the settlement, the formal housing, and schools and offers an opportunity for adaptive reuse through a new programme. Its prime location also affords the opportunity in stitching together the aforementioned areas to create connected reliant relationships. The proposal deals with relationships on spatial, programmatic and material layers where the context dictates what is needed and how it should be integrated into existing systems. It will enhance existing economic networks around the site by nurturing reliable economic dependencies with the wetland. Programmatically, the intervention contains a skilled trade and art centre, including a library, day care and after school centre which supports <b>recreational</b> <b>programmes.</b> The entire structure doubles up as a community centre with the architectural design being inspired by the notion of a repository of the exchanges between natural and human systems [...] .

40|$|Children are {{vulnerable}} {{due to their}} age and developmental level. They rely on parents and other adults for survival and care. However, some children become more vulnerable than others as parents and families are poor and cannot afford {{to provide for their}} basic needs. Poverty can make children vulnerable by depriving them of their right to have their basic needs met, such as food, health care, clothing and shelter. While this situation is affected by high rates of unemployment it is also compounded by chronic illness such as HIV and AIDS. The effects of poverty, unemployment, and HIV and AIDS can {{have a negative impact on}} children’s physical, psychological, social and intellectual development. In its quest to protect and promote the rights of vulnerable children, the South African government makes provision for the establishment of drop-in centres (Children’s Act 38 of 2005). Drop-in centres are facilities aimed at addressing the physical, emotional, psychological and social developmental needs of vulnerable children within their communities and closer to their homes. Drop-in centres provide basic services such as food, clothing, school support and hygiene, as well as optional services such as counselling, guidance, life skills development and educational and <b>recreational</b> <b>programmes.</b> The goal of this study was to explore the experiences of vulnerable children regarding services they receive from drop-in centres. A qualitative research approach was followed and in-depth interviews were conducted to obtain information from a group of 12 adolescent participants on their experiences of the services they received from drop-in centres. The participants were selected based on stratified random sampling. The findings of the study indicate that participants received basic services such as food, clothing and school attendance support, as well as psychosocial support services from the drop-in centres. The participants were of the opinion that the services they received at the drop-in centres resulted in an improvement in their general appearance, self-esteem, school performance, health, friendships and life skills. It can be concluded that participants’ experiences of the services provided by drop-in centres proved positive on a number of aspects. The services enhanced their quality of life, their dignity and their general sense of well-being. The findings suggest that drop-in centres can attain their purpose as an intervention strategy for providing accessible, community-based services to meet the physical, emotional and social developmental needs of vulnerable children. The participants as a group of vulnerable children, benefited from the services which they received, which is in support of developmental social welfare. It is important that services are provided within an environment in which children’s rights to confidentiality and respect are upheld. Recommendations include that increased funding is essential for maintaining the basic services of drop-in centres, as well as expanding the optional services such as sport and recreation programmes. As the findings of the study cannot be generalised because of the small sample size, further research on the topic is recommended.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the role of the {{teaching}} assistants in a school in Sweden by highlighting their deployment, employment and the needs of this role. This aim stems from the limited research on teaching assistants, the paucity in research that could not support decision making of the policy-makers and the belief that teaching assistants are under-used resource. Activity theory will be used for the above purposes as it investigates the complexities of real life and it has been used in case studies. This study will, also, produce a model of the TA activity and explore how activity theory could be used relating the development of the TAs in their workplace. For investigating this role, ethnographic case study was chosen in order to reveal the complexity of the situation and to highlight the regularities and patterns in the behaviour of the participants. The semi-structured interviews and participant-observation provided the study with valuable data which composed a holistic perspective of the situation. Data were organised in categories and then analysed with content analysis. The findings, which were generated from the analysis, concern the name of the TAs, their activity, the relationships between the TAs and the teachers, the training of the TAs and the employment conditions of this job position. To be more specific, the name does not affect the TA activity but it affects their employment as it can be misleading. TA activity entails the tasks that TAs have and the factors that interact for achieving the objectives. The findings of this study highlighted the nature of the tasks that the TAs have. They have not only practical and social tasks but also tasks that involve teaching. Two of the factors that affect their activity are the communities to which they belong and, mostly, the teachers. Although, assistants do not reduce teacher workload with their activity, teachers emerge as an important factor in TA role as they cooperate a lot. This cooperation brings up issues regarding the communication and time which need to be addressed in order to work efficiently. The training of the TAs is highlighted as another issue that needs to be addressed as assistants do not always have the qualification to fulfill their tasks. Last, the findings indicate an employment that depends on school criteria, the characteristics of the local labour market, no job description, positions’ stability for young classes and a job position that is combined with the <b>recreational</b> (fritids) <b>programme...</b>|$|R

Sixty-four participants completed the randomized controlled trial and were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups: a soccer training group (SOC; n= 20), a running group (RUN; n= 21) or a control group performing no physical training (CON; n= 23). Training programmes for SOC and RUN lasted 12 -week with 3 training sessions per week. Soccer sessions consisted of 60 min ordinary five-a-side, six-a-side or seven-a-side matches on a 30 - 45 m wide and 45 - 60 m long plastic grass pitch. Running sessions consisted of 60 min of continuous moderate intensity running at the same average heart rate as in SOC (~ 80 % HRmax). All participants, regardless of group assignment, were tested for each of the following dependent variables: body weight, body height, body mass index, percent body fat, body fat mass, fat-free mass and total body water. In the SOC and RUN groups there was a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) in body composition parameters from pre- to post-training values for all measures with the exception of fat-free mass and total body water. Body mass index, percent body fat and body fat mass did not differ between groups at baseline, but by week 12 were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in the SOC and RUN groups compared to CON.
