5|$|Overgrazing, {{agriculture}} {{and the loss}} of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.|$|E
5|$|The Richmond Hill and Milton lines {{continue}} to operate during rush hours only, {{although there has been}} an increasing number of trips on these lines in <b>recent</b> <b>years.</b> <b>As</b> part of the Regional Express Rail plan, there are plans to eventually offer two-way, all-day 15-minute service on the central sections of the remaining five lines. Nevertheless, rush-hour service accounts for over 90% of GO Train ridership.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E

5|$|The African crake {{has a huge}} {{breeding}} range estimated at 11,700,000km2 (4,500,000mi2). Its population is unknown, but it is common in most of its range, and its numbers appear to be stable. It is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Overgrazing, agriculture {{and the loss of}} wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions.

The table also shows the train operators who currently serve each station, and the final two columns give information on the number of passengers using each station in <b>recent</b> <b>years,</b> <b>as</b> collated by the Office of Rail and Road, a Government body. The figures are based on ticket sales, and are given to the nearest 100.|$|E
5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> a result of the availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E

Also in the City, a skyscraper at 100–112 Leadenhall Street, to be designed by SOM architects, is {{in the early stages of}} design and planning.|$|E
5|$|There is some dispute as to if this pyramid was Ahmose's burial place, {{or if it}} was a cenotaph. Although earlier explorers Mace and Currelly {{were unable}} to locate any {{internal}} chambers, it is unlikely that a burial chamber would have been located {{in the midst of the}} pyramid's rubble core. In the absence of any mention of a tomb of King Ahmose in the tomb robbery accounts of the Abbott Papyrus, and in the absence of any likely candidate for the king's tomb at Thebes, it is possible that the king was interred at Abydos, as suggested by Harvey. Certainly the great number of cult structures located at the base of the pyramid located in <b>recent</b> <b>years,</b> <b>as</b> well as the presence at the base of the pyramid of a cemetery used by priests of Ahmose's cult, argue for the importance of the king's Abydos cult. However, other Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was constructed (like Tetisheri's pyramid at Abydos) as a cenotaph and that Ahmose may have originally been buried in the southern part of Dra' Abu el-Naga' with the rest of the late 17th and early 18th Dynasties.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000–01 season Liverpool {{won three}} {{competitions}} {{to complete a}} unique treble of trophies. The first trophy was the League Cup, when they beat Birmingham City 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after the match had finished 1–1. They then won the FA Cup, as Owen scored two goals {{in the last ten}} minutes to overturn a one-goal deficit to win the match against Arsenal 2–1. The final trophy the club won was the UEFA Cup. An own goal in the last minute of extra time by Delfí Geli secured a 5–4 victory over Spanish team Alavés. Liverpool finished the league in third place, securing a return to the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) {{for the first time since}} the Heysel Stadium disaster. Liverpool's participation in the UEFA Champions League in the 2001–02 season saw the club reach the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by German team Bayer Leverkusen 4–3 on aggregate. The season was Liverpool's best in the league in <b>recent</b> <b>years,</b> <b>as</b> they finished second, seven points behind Arsenal. Despite their improved performance in the league, Liverpool were unable to defend the FA and League Cup, exiting in the fourth and third rounds respectively. The season was overshadowed by Houllier's heart problems. He suffered chest pain at half-time during a match with Leeds at Anfield. He had an eleven-hour operation to fix an acute dissection of the aorta and did not return until February. His assistant Phil Thompson took charge of the team in the interim.|$|E
