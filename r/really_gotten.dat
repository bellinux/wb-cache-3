2500|$|After Oscar Wao, Diaz {{began work}} on a second novel, a science-fiction epic with the working title Monstro. Diaz had {{previously}} attempted to write a science fiction novel twice prior to Oscar Wao, with earlier efforts in the genre [...] "Shadow of the Adept, a far-future novel in the vein of Gene Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer, and Dark America, an Akira-inspired post-apocalyptic nightmare" [...] remaining incomplete and unpublished. Part {{of the appeal of}} science fiction to Diaz, he explained in an interview with Wired, is that science fiction grapples with the idea of power in a manner other genres do not: [...] "I didn't see mainstream, literary, realistic fiction talking about power, talking about dictatorship, talking about the consequences of breeding people, which of course is something that in the Caribbean is never far away." [...] In an interview with New York Magazine prior to the release of This Is How You Lose Her, Diaz revealed that the work-in-progress novel concerns [...] "a 14-year-old 'Dominican York' girl who saves the planet from a full-blown apocalypse". but he also warned that the novel may never be completed: [...] "I'm only at {{the first part of the}} novel, so I haven't <b>really</b> <b>gotten</b> down to the eating," [...] he says, [...] "and I've got to eat a couple cities before I think the thing will really get going." [...] As of June 2015, the novel-in-progress appears to be abandoned– in a June 2015 interview for Words on a Wire, when asked about his progress on Monstro, Diaz said [...] "Yeah, I'm not writing that book anymore..." [...] Diaz's next book, Islandborn, is to be a children's book, due for publication in March 2018.|$|E

5000|$|I {{was pretty}} burnt on Exhumed. The {{fact that the}} band hadn't <b>really</b> <b>gotten</b> any bigger from album to album, along with the Anatomy line-up falling apart were really frustrating, {{especially}} in light of how much work we had done. I felt like without Col in Exhumed, the band didn't really have any credibility any more, and I was just tired of teaching new people the songs and hoping that they would [...] "get" [...] where the band was coming from.|$|E

But it's different than Fall Out Boy, and it's different than stuff we've done before, so ... with Fall Out Boy, it'd be like, 'OK, this is rollout, we've got it, we'll go around the world.' And with this, it's new and it's new territory, so we're working with new people and it'll be exciting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tolkien {{approached}} {{it as an}} academic, and he was writing it as an academic effort, not as popular fiction. I’m a popular fiction writer, that's the way I {{approached it}}.

He helped Simon the chimp (slave name Peanuts) switch places with a chimp in a zoo, so he could be re-united with his girlfriend. It was Jimmy who realised the real reason why Simon wanted to escape whereas The Lone Gunmen were following the idea that the chimps were being trained as assassins. Jimmy often became the heart of the group as he was more inclined to see the good in people, particularly Yves Adele Harlow and senator Jefferson. Contrary to Frohike and Langly, he also showed no disgust or prejudice towards Byers' transgender college roommate.|$|E
5000|$|Kayla was skeptical, but Steve, at first, was oblivious; {{he was so}} overjoyed {{at having}} his memory back, trying to tell her every memory at once. He soon noticed that she was crying, and was shocked, asking her what was wrong. Kayla replied that she didn't know if she could believe that he had <b>really</b> <b>gotten</b> his memory back, {{especially}} not after how he had previously pretended to remember her. Horrified, Steve grabbed her and assured her that he, Steven Earl Johnson, her [...] "one-eyed tomcat" [...] was indeed back. Overcome, Kayla {{ran out of the}} bungalow, crying, with Steve chasing her. Coming back, she nearly fainted—still recovering from the biotoxin poisoning—and he caught her, holding her close and assuring her that everything would be fine.|$|E

5000|$|Kleyla {{had been}} wanting to create a {{documentary}} about Indiana Jones fandom, {{and it was the}} announcement of the fourth film of the series that acted as his impetus. [...] As a self-professed fan of the Indiana Jones films, director Kleyla made note that while there are fan conventions for Star Wars and Star Trek films, there are none for Indiana Jones films. [...] In the summer of 2007, he began work to create a documentary about those he refers to as [...] "the felt-hatted faithful".

I've lasted longer by several years {{than almost any other}} ADA the Law & Order universe. So every year I've been like, 'Is this {{going to be the one}} when I leave?' Dick Wolf is known for replacing his cast regularly. And the truth is, I'm really looking forward to the future." ...|$|E
