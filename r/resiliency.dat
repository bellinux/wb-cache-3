40|$|The religio-cultural {{community}} of migrants from minority ethnic backgrounds often plays a strong {{role in their}} post-migration adaptation. While religion itself has been said {{to play an important}} role in construction of resilience (Abdel-Khalak, 2007; Moreira-Almeida, A., Neto, F. L., & Koenig, 2006; Bhugra, 2004; Davydov, D. M., Stewart, R., Ritchie, K., & Chaudieu, I., 2010, Dein, 2010), the social support network created through involvement in a religious community may also protect against development of mental health conditions (Pumariega, A., Rothe, & Pumariega, J., 2005; Bhugra et al, 2004; Dew et al, 2008). This is particularly relevant for immigrant communities who may encounter threats to mental health due to the migratory experience (Pumariega, A., Rothe, & Pumariega, J.,, 2005; Jibeen & Khalid, 2010). Much work has looked at the case of refugees and mental health outcomes and <b>resiliencies</b> (ie: Watters, 2001), yet little at the post-migratory experience on mental health for young immigrants, who often migrate for economic and educational opportunities, and the second-generation, who may encounter cultural and acculturative challenges (Pumariega, A., Rothe, & Pumariega, J., 2005; Bhugra et al, 2004). This is striking given the many changing life circumstances facing youth and the potentiality of development of mental health conditions (Bhugra, 2004; Patel, Flisher, Hetrick., & McGlory, 2007). Thus, it becomes important to examine the <b>resiliencies</b> of these recent-immigrant and second-generation youth and their strategies for mental well-being. This paper examines the case of the diasporic and post-diasporic Ismaili Muslim youth in Australia, the so-called recent and second-generation immigrant. It illustrates how they respond to mental health challenges encountered in the migratory experience, and examines the role of their faith-based community in the development of their mental health <b>resiliencies.</b> It builds upon the work of Moosa-Mitha (2009), in her study of Canadian Muslim immigrant youth, particularly engaging with her themes of “visibility” and “voice”, to showcase how Australian Muslim youth utilize concepts such as engagement with their faith and civic participation to develop positive mental health <b>resiliencies</b> when engaging with contemporary threats to mental health encountered through the migratory and acculturative experience...|$|R

5|$|A {{study by}} Eric Snively and Anthony P. Russel {{published}} in 2003 {{also found that}} the tyrannosaurid arctometatarsals and elastic ligaments worked together in what he called a 'tensile keystone model' to strengthen the feet of Tyrannosaurus, increase the animal's stability and add greater resistance to dissociation over that of other theropod families; while still allowing <b>resiliency</b> that is otherwise reduced in ratites, horses, giraffids and other animals with metapodia to a single element. The study also pointed out that elastic ligaments in larger vertebrates could store and return relatively more elastic strain energy, which could have improved locomotor efficiency and decrease the strain energy transferred to the bones. The study suggested that this mechanism could have worked efficiently in tyrannosaurids as well. Hence, the study involved identifying the type of ligaments attached to the metatarsals, then how they functioned together and comparing it to those of other theropods and modern day analogs. The scientists found that arctometatarsals may have enabled tyrannosaurid feet to absorb forces such as linear deceleration, lateral acceleration and torsion more effectively than those of other theropods. It is also stated in their study that this may imply, though not demonstrate, that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus had greater agility than other large theropods without an arctometatarsus.|$|E

40|$|Global {{projections}} for climate change impacts produce a startling {{picture of the}} future for low-lying coastal communities. The United States’ Chesapeake Bay region and especially marginalized and rural communities will be severely impacted by sea level rise and other changes over the next one hundred years. The concept of resilience has been theorized {{as a measure of}} social-ecological system health and as a unifying framework under which people can work together towards climate change adaptation. But it has also been critiqued for {{the way in which it}} does not adequately take into account local perspective and experiences, bringing into question the value of this concept as a tool for local communities. We must be sure that the concerns, weaknesses, and strengths of particular local communities are part of the climate change adaptation, decision-making, and planning process in which communities participate. An example of this type of planning process is the Deal Island Marsh and Community Project (DIMCP), a grant funded initiative to build resilience within marsh ecosystems and communities of the Deal Island Peninsula area of Maryland (USA) to environmental and social impacts from climate change. I argue it is important to have well-developed understandings of vulnerabilities and <b>resiliencies</b> identified by local residents and others to accomplish this type of work. This dissertation explores vulnerability and resilience to climate change using an engaged and ethnographic anthropological perspective. Utilizing participant observation, semi-structured and structured interviews, text analysis, and cultural domain analysis I produce an in-depth perspective of what vulnerability and resilience means to the DIMCP stakeholder network. Findings highlight significant vulnerabilities and <b>resiliencies</b> inherent in the local area and how these interface with additional vulnerabilities and <b>resiliencies</b> seen from a nonlocal perspective. I conclude that vulnerability and resilience are highly dynamic and context-specific for the local community. Vulnerabilities relate to climate change and other social and environmental changes. Resilience is a long-standing way of life, not a new concept related specifically to climate change. This ethnographic insight into vulnerability and resilience provides a basis for stronger engagement in collaboration and planning for the future...|$|R

40|$|Lesbian and {{gay people}} are more likely to {{experience}} long-term health problems and less likely to have relationships that typically provide informal care. Whilst some researchers have suggested that care is provided by family-of-choice relationships (i. e. a network of very close friendships), there has been no research looking at what determines the organisation of care. Grounded theory was used to explore what determines the organisation of informal care for older lesbian and gay people with health problems. Fourteen mid-later life lesbian and gay people were interviewed who had experience of providing/receiving care, or running groups for these populations. Findings suggest that this population experience losses to their network related to their sexuality as well as due to ageing and the impact of their health problem. This means that except for those living with others (partners, ex-partners or housemates), people often experience their care needs being “left to” them. In response, people seek connections or alternatives to support. Support arrangements developed for those living alone tends to be distributed across multiple people. Strategies and attitudes developed from managing being lesbian or gay influence choices and <b>resiliencies</b> in navigating these challenges. The results suggest that older lesbian and gay people have unique strengths and challenges in accessing care in the context of long-term conditions.

40|$|Background: Transgender women {{experience}} {{higher rates of}} incarceration than their cisgender counterparts, and this cycle of incarceration and poor health is understudied. Lack of continued healthcare, housing, and employment, {{as well as economic}} marginalization, are barriers associated with populations re-entering from incarceration. Additionally, transgender women have unique challenges that may not be addressed in standard re-entry programs. The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to understand the experiences, needs, and <b>resiliencies</b> of previously incarcerated transgender women. Methods: We use qualitative interviews and mapping to describe lack of access to resources, as well as challenges regarding finding housing, accessing healthcare, and meeting probation and parole requirements. We interviewed 6 transgender women, all of whom are previously incarcerated adults residing in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Additionally, we mapped Allegheny County neighborhoods, mental health providers, and trans-inclusive resources using geographic information system (GIS) software to explore barriers related to transportation and access. Results: Results indicate that access to healthcare, housing, transportation, and trans-inclusive community support are the most significant barriers to successful re-entry. Furthermore, mapping resources, or the lack thereof, and examining the spatial relationship between low-income neighborhoods and proximity to these resources gives us insight to the challenges or <b>resiliencies</b> faced by transgender women. These analyses suggest that transgender women residing outside the central downtown area of Pittsburgh have increased difficulty regarding access to probation and parole offices, trans-inclusive healthcare, and LGBT community spaces. Conclusions: Future multilevel public health interventions should incorporate healthcare, trans-inclusive community support, access to stable housing, and the alleviation of transportation barriers in order to break the cycle of incarceration and poor health for transgender women...|$|R
