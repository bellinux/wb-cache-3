30|$|Field retting and P. radiata Cel 26 retting of hemp were {{assessed}} in hemp fibre/epoxy composites and {{compared with a}} pure enzymatic retting approach. It {{was found that the}} abundance of fungi decreased with extended field retting duration, while the abundance of bacteria increased. Field retted fibres exhibited much higher glucanase and lower polygalacturonase activities than P. radiata Cel 26 retted fibres. As a result, retting with P. radiata Cel 26 could degrade non-cellulosic components from hemp fibres at highest selectivity. Composites with P. radiata Cel 26 <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> fibres had significantly higher strength (307  MPa) than composites made with field <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> fibres (248  MPa). However a pure pectinase approach resulted in even higher composite strength (325  MPa) (Liu et al. 2016 b). Despite this disadvantage the fungal treatment has the advantage of giving more pure cellulose and avoiding costs of enzymes for the process.|$|E
30|$|It can thereby be {{hypothesized}} that higher cellulase activities would be detected in enzyme extracts from field <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> fibres compared to P. radiata Cel 26 retted fibres {{and that any}} higher cellulase activity in field retted samples would correlate to decreased mechanical properties. As a result, it can be expected that fibres with low mechanical properties should be obtained after field retting.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} {{residual}} gum exists in degummed or <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> fibres. Gum removal results in improvement in fibre fineness and {{the properties of the}} resultant hemp yarns. However, it is not known what correlation if any exists between the residual gum content in <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> fibres and the fibre fineness, described in terms of fibre width in this paper. This study examined the mean width and coefficient of variation (CV) of fibre width of seventeen chemically <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> samples with reference to residual gum content. The mean and CV of fibre width were obtained from an Optical fibre diameter analyser (OFDA 100). The linear regression analysis results show that the mean fibre width is directly proportional to the residual gum content. A slightly weaker linear correlation also exists between the coefficient of variation of fibre width and the residual gum content. The strong linear co-relation between the mean of fibre width and the residual gum content is a significant outcome, since testing for fibre width using the OFDA is a much simpler and quicker process than testing the residual gum content. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) reinforces the OFDA findings. SEM micrographs show a flat ribbon like fibre cross-section hence the term “fibre width” is used instead of fibre diameter. Spectral differences in the untreated dry decorticated skin samples and chemically treated and subsequently carded samples indicate delignification. The peaks at 1370 cm − 1, 1325 cm − 1, 1733 cm − 1, and 1600 cm − 1 attributed to lignin in the untreated samples are missing from the spectra of the treated samples.

40|$|Fungi are {{believed}} to be responsible in great measure for the field <b>retting</b> of <b>hemp</b> in Iowa. Species of various genera commonly found on <b>retting</b> <b>hemp</b> were described by Fuller and Norman (1944). In the early fall of 1944, during a warm and unusually humid period, Trichothecium roseum, either alone or, not infre-quently, associated with Cephalosporium, was observed to be dominant on local areas of some hemp stalks. The ubiquitous species of retting fungi, previously described, seemed to be absent from these local areas, though present on other parts of the stalks. It was further noted that the fiber in these local areas be-came exceptionally weak or almost completely deteriorated, in contrast to that of the remainder of the stalk where retting appeared normal. In certain Iowa counties a considerable amount of the hemp was damaged in this manner. It therefore appeared to be of interest to investigate the relative activity of these organisms with other pure cultures of fungi isolated from <b>retting</b> <b>hemp.</b> The biochemical changes brought about in the fiber-containing tissues of the hemp stalk under optimum conditions have therefore been determined.

30|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{degradation}} of cellulose and reduction of fibre mechanical properties microbiologically controlled retting using selected fungi to degrade non-cellulosic components in the fibres has been investigated (Thygesen et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2015 b). Phlebia radiata Cel 26 and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, belonging to the Basidiomycota phylum, produce less cellulase enzymes compared to their wild types (Nyhlen and Nilsson 1987). P. radiata Cel 26 has been found most selective in pectin degradation resulting in higher fibre strength (Liu et al. 2015 a).

40|$|<b>Retting</b> of <b>hemp</b> is a {{biological}} process {{that results in}} {{the separation of the}} fiber bundles of the outer cortical sheath from the woody core and from each other by decomposition of the surrounding less resistant thin-walled cell~. Since the decomposition process is a continuing one, it must be terminated before damage to the fiber has commenced and yet it must be allowed to continue sufficiently long so that the fibers come away readily from the woody stalk and upon hackling separate from each other. The quality of the fiber is largely dependent upon the success of retting and the proper decision as to its end-point. Fiber from field-retted hemp cannot be expected to approach the uniformity and quality of that retted by controlled methods. Field retting in Iowa is dependent upon dew and rain to supply moisture for the activity of the microorganisms, which are predominantly fungi (8). Dew alone is usually quite insufficient to permit the <b>hemp</b> to <b>ret</b> completely. <b>Hemp</b> <b>rets</b> unevenly in the field because dew is deposited on the exposed surface of the stalks, causing retting to proceed more rapidly in this region than on the under side. This is partly overcome by turning the hemp during the process of retting, but in spite of this practice, retting is by no means uniform. When frequent rains accompanied by warm weather occur early in the fall, there is some danger of damage to the fiber through over-retting (7). Thus, field-retted hemp usually is a mixture of unretted, partly retted, well retted and overretted material...|$|R

Finds of seeds, stems and pollen of C. sativa from a waterlogged context on a settlement dating to the Roman Iron Age demonstrate that the plant was locally cultivated and processed during the 1 st- 2 nd centuries AD. An introductory phase in Scandinavia is proposed (c. AD 1 - 400) during which the cultivation of hemp was apparently small scale and processing was probably carried out within settlements. In the succeeding centuries, c. AD 400 - 550 (the Migration Period), remains of hemp are mostly found in pollen records from lake sediments, and less frequently in the archaeological record.

Its fibers have long been used for textiles and rope making, which requires prior stem retting. This process is essential for extracting fibers from the stem of the plant, but can adversely affect the quality of surface waters. The history of human activities related to hemp (its domestication, spread, and processing) is frequently reconstructed from seeds and pollen detected in archaeological sites or in sedimentary archives, but this method does not always make it possible to ascertain whether <b>retting</b> took place. <b>Hemp</b> is also known to contain phytocannabinoids, a type of chemicals that are specific to the plant. Here we report on the detection of one of these chemicals, cannabinol (CBN), preserved in a sediment record from a small lake in the French Massif Central covering the last 1800 years. We demonstrate that the presence of this molecule in the sedimentary record is related to retting.

40|$|Information as to {{the nature}} of the {{chemical}} changes that occur during the biological retting of hemp is scanty. Flax retting has been far more extensively studied, mostly by European workers; but it has frequently been implied that the principles involved and the problems met with are similar in flax and hemp retting. This subject is well reviewed by Thaysen and Bunker (9). It has been repeatedly stated that the essential biochemical change is the decomposition of the pectic substances present in the middle lamella of the parenchymatous tissue cells as a result of which the bundles become readily separable from the wood and the epidermis. It cannot be said, however, that there is clear analytical evidence for this statement. Moreover, there must be concurrent utilization of other tissue constituents, and progressively an attack on the fiber bundles, manifest in practice by the ultimate weakening and deterioration that occurs in over-retting. The processes that occur in retting constitute in fact the first stages in the decomposition of the hemp straw. Desirable changes that result in the liberation of the fibers pass imperceptibly into undesirable changes that result in impairment of quality. There is no certain way of determining when retting is complete. Reliance ordinarily is placed upon the judgment of the observer, which is based on the appearance of the straw and on simple mechanical tests. Whether the completion of retting under controlled conditions in tanks can properly be judged by standards similar to those applied to field-retted material is doubtful. Although the ultimate result is similar in that the fibers can be separated from the straw, it is not necessarily to be expected that the biochemical changes brought about by populations so different in character as those active in field retting, and those in deep tanks, are identical. In order to obtain information on the nature of the changes that occur to the constituents of the straw, samples of field retted and controlled <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> have been analyzed in some detail...|$|E

Therefore, a better understanding and knowledge of moisture adsorption equilibrium is of importance. The moisture adsorption equilibrium of several different plant fibres is examined in paper I. Differences in moisture adsorption equilibrium was found between unretted and <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> fibres, while differences between varieties were small. An example of a renewable composite material, investigated in this thesis, is a wheat gluten plastic reinforced with hemp fibres. Paper II shows the effect of hemp fibre reinforcement on the mechanical properties of a wheat gluten based plastic film. Different fibre contents and fibre quality levels were tested. It was found that the fibres did improve the mechanical properties of the plastic and that fibre content was {{the most important factor in}} creating a stronger material. However, there were problems encountered with regards to fibre distribution in the material, poor adhesion between the fibres and plastic and a large variation in the material properties. In paper III, we attempted to improve the fibre distribution by using a high speed grinder to mix the fibres and the plastic. Further a diamine was used as a cross linker between the fibres and the plastic to improve the bonding. It was found that the grinder did improve the fibre distribution but not sufficiently to avoid clusters of fibres. The diamine did not improve the interaction between the fibres and the plastic but it did strengthen the plastic itself to a certain degree. It is concluded that hemp fibres can be used to improve the mechanical properties of wheat gluten plastics. However, the fibre distribution and interaction with the plastic needs to be much improved. A possible solution for the fibre distribution problem might be to decrease the viscosity if the wheat gluten dough while the fibre-plastic interaction might be improved by selecting a different cross linking substance...|$|E
40|$|Sowing {{density and}} harvest time are {{considered}} important crop management factors influencing fibre {{quantity and quality}} in hemp (Cannabis sativa). We investigated whether {{the effects of these}} factors are essentially different or that both factors affect stem weight and thereby total and long-fibre content. The effects of all combinations of three sowing densities and three harvest times were studied for six different stem parts. Almost 500 samples consisting of stem parts from 50 plants and with a length of 50 cm were tested. Fibres were extracted by a controlled warm-water retting procedure, followed by breaking and scutching. The initial sample weight was fractionated into retting losses, wood, tow and long fibre. In both Italy and the Netherlands, crops were successfully established with different stem densities (99 – 283 m- 2), plant heights (146 – 211 cm) and stem diameters (4. 5 – 8. 4 mm) at harvest. Stem dry matter yields (6. 8 – 11. 7 Mg ha- 1) increased with a delay in harvest time but were not affected by sowing density. Retting loss percentages were lower in lower stem parts and decreased with later harvest because maturation was associated with increasing amounts of fibre and wood. Within a certain stem part, however, the absolute retting losses were constant with harvest time. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the amount of fibre in a hemp stem is almost completely determined by the weight and the position of that stem part. When the plant grows, the increase in dry matter is split up into fibres and wood in a fixed way. This total fibre/wood ratio was highest in the middle part of the stem and lower towards both bottom and top. Sowing density and harvest time effects were indirect through stem weight. The long-fibre weight per stem increased with the total fibre weight and hence with stem weight. Stem weight increased with harvest time; as harvest time did not affect plant density, the highest long-fibre yields were obtained at the last harvest time. The long fibre/total fibre ratio was lowest in the bottom 5 cm of the stems but similar for all other parts. Sowing density and harvest time effects again were indirect. Fibre percentages in <b>retted</b> <b>hemp</b> decreased with increasing stem weights towards a level that is presumably a variety characteristic.

For field retting a classification of the microbial evolution (by gene sequencing) and enzyme profiles were conducted. By phylogenetic frequency mapping, different types of fungi, many belonging to the Ascomycota phylum {{were found on the}} fibres during the first 2  weeks of field retting, and thereafter, different types of bacteria, notably Proteobacteria, also proliferated on the field retted fibres. Extracts from field retted fibres exhibited high glucanase activities, while extracts from P. radiata Cel 26 retted fibres showed high polygalacturonase and laccase activities. As a result, fungal retting gave a significantly higher glucan content in the fibres than field retting (77 vs. 67 %) and caused a higher removal of pectin as indicated by lower galacturonan content of fibres (1.6 %) after fibres were retted for 20  days with P. radiata Cel 26 compared to a galacturonan content of 3.6 % for field retted fibres. Effective fibre stiffness increased slightly after retting with P. radiata Cel 26 from 65 to 67  GPa, while it decreased after field retting to 52  GPa. Effective fibre strength could not be determined similarly due to variations in fibre fracture strain and fibre-matrix adhesion.

Varve counts on sediment thin-sections and 210 Pb, 226 Ra, and 137 Cs dating provided a reliable chronology for the past 200 years. The main pollen-inferred land-use changes showed a sharp decrease of <b>hemp</b> <b>retting</b> around AD 1900, {{as well as a}} gradual change to less intensive agriculture and increasing abundance of exotic plants since AD 1970.

After AD 1950, TP values increased distinctly and continuously, culminating in the late 1960 s with concentrations of 150 lg l 1. Subsequently, diatoms implied a linear decrease of TP, with an inferred value of 40 lg l 1 in the surface sediment sample.

The limits of non-pollen palynomorph biozones {{are consistent with the}} main environmental changes reported earlier in the Pre-Pyrenean Lake Estanya. The non-pollen palynomorph diagram from Lake Estanya Gran shows that changes in human activity during the last 2000  years are reflected in lake responses. Palaeoecological data from non-pollen palynomorphs have helped to determine the causes of these environmental changes, e. g. the lake use for hemp water-retting and its limnological impacts. The main change in the non-pollen palynomorph diagram is the expansion of Desmidiaceae, indicating more acid water conditions between 1220 AD and 1760 AD. The onset of Desmidiaceae in 1220 AD may be attributed to the development of farming and probably to the construction of water channels. Desmidiaceae undergo a considerable decline after 1760 AD, coinciding with the fall in hemp production in the XVIIIth century. Consequently, the lake water recovered the oligotrophic status that had prevailed before 1220 AD.

40|$|The {{importance}} of industrial hemp {{as a source}} of highly valuable textile fi bres is briefly presented through its use for textiles and composites and its increasing cultivated areas in the 21 st century. On the territory of present Slovenia, about 160 ha of agricultural area was cultivated with hemp before WWII, then it quickly began to decline {{and at the end of}} the 1970 s, it was no longer cultivated. Revitalization of industrial hemp in Slovenia with fi eld experiments started already in the years 2000 / 2001 for producing seeds, whereas hemp fi bres were used only as an insulation for buildings. The textile technological properties of hemp fi bres from diff erent varieties grown in Slovenia have not been examined till now. They are important for using hemp fibres in highly valuable textile products. The properties of green hemp fi bres extracted mechanically from non-retted hemp stems of Cannabis sativa L. var. sativa (varieties: Novosadska, Juso- 11, Bialobrzeskie, Unico- B and Beniko) were determined. All the analysed varieties except Beniko had stem height over 200 cm. The highest yield of green fibres was 33. 1 % (Novosadska). The analysed green fibres’ content was 1. 24 – 3. 26 % of ash, 7. 77 – 8. 50 % of moisture regain, 10. 69 – 13. 92 % of water-soluble substances and 8. 45 – 10. 83 % of pectin. Through a biodegradation process of <b>retting</b> green <b>hemp</b> fibres in tap water at temperature 35 °C, 9. 01 – 18. 89 % of dry mass was removed after ten days. Average linear density of green hemp fi bres was very high, around 200 tex. Tenacity of fi bres’ bundles was in the range of 167 – 272 MPa, but tenacity of elementary fibres was 548 – 672 MPa. From the curves of specific stress-strain, it is seen that green hemp fibres from all five varieties had similar superstructure. All analysed green hemp fibres had high linear density and low mechanical properties. For textile application, they should be further processed into finer fibres in order to increase their tensile stress and become also more flexible and soft...|$|R
40|$|A short {{sediment}} core from Lago Grande di Avigliana (Piedmont, Italy), {{the second}} most eutrophied lake in Italy, was analysed for pollen and diatoms to reconstruct land-use changes and to estimate baseline conditions for total phosphorus (TP) in the water column. Varve counts on sediment thin-sections and 210 Pb, 226 Ra, and 137 Cs dating provided a reliable chronology for the past ~ 200 years. The main pollen-inferred land-use changes showed a sharp decrease of <b>hemp</b> <b>retting</b> around AD 1900, {{as well as a}} gradual change to less intensive agriculture and increasing abundance of exotic plants since AD ~ 1970. Diatom-inferred TP reconstructions indicated stable TP concentrations until AD ~ 1950, revealing baseline mesotrophic conditions (TP < 25 µg l− 1). After AD ~ 1950, TP values increased distinctly and continuously, culminating in the late 1960 s with concentrations of 150 µg l− 1. Subsequently, diatoms implied a linear decrease of TP, with an inferred value of 40 µg l− 1 in the surface sediment sample. Comparison with instrumental TP measurements from the water column since AD 1980 showed a rapid recovery and allowed a direct validation of the diatom TP inference. However, although the TP concentration has decreased considerably, baseline conditions have not yet been reached. When compared to the limnological effects of sewage discharges on inferred-TP concentration, our results indicated that agricultural land use played a minor role in the lake’s eutrophication...|$|R
40|$|Presently {{there are}} two forms of {{biological}} fibre extraction, water retting or dew retting, which use bacteria or fungi, respectively. Microbial action results in release of the cellulose fibres due to modification of the pectin, hemicellulose and lignin content from parenchyma cells and the middle lamellae. Water retting results in pollution, high costs associated with labour and drying, as well as significant waste water production, while disadvantages to dew retting include the need for appropriate climates, variable and inferior fibre quality, risks of over-retting as well as health effects due to dust and fungal contaminants. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to explore silage retting as a new pre-processing technique allowing use of available farm infrastructure and contained retting conditions to produce plant-derived fibres with improved physical and chemical characteristics suitable for application in biocomposites. The corn processing ability of the <b>hemp</b> <b>retting</b> agents Clostridium felsineum and Bacillus subtilis was also investigated. Pleiotropic and/or crop management practices were assessed by comparing the physico-mechanical properties and the microbial populations during silage fermentation of genetically equivalent conventional, Roundup Ready® (RR) and Bt-Roundup Ready® (Bt-RR) corn isolines. Potential recovery of volatile organic acids in silage retting effluent as value-added chemicals was also explored. The results indicated that C. felsineum is an effective corn retting agent given the effective release of the fibre bundles from the corn pith, with B. subtilis contributing to the retting process by reducing the oxygen content and providing the required anaerobic conditions for clostridial growth. The native microflora present in the plant phyllosphere also showed some retting ability. Composition, thermostability and mechanical properties of the biocomposites produced using the fibres from the retted corn were all found to vary depending on the variety of corn. Specifically, retted Bt-RR cornstalk showed a 15 °C increase in onset of degradation. Divergences between corn silage microbial communities analyzed by community-level physiological and enzyme activity profiling indicated that metabolic shifts were time-, region-, and contaminant-sensitive. Acetic and butyric acid production in silage retting effluent was found to be highest under anaerobic conditions and was also influenced by corn hybrid variety, although a specific variety was not identified as most or least favourable for organic acid production due to high variability. Bt-RR cornstalk material was found to have higher cellulose content and better thermostability with an onset of degradation of up to 45 °C higher than its genetic RR and conventional counterparts. However, fibres from the RR corn isoline produced biocomposites with the highest flexural strength and modulus. RR cornstalk-reinforced polypropylene showed a 37 and 94 % increase in flexural strength and modulus, respectively when compared to the mechanical properties of the pure polypropylene. The Bt-RR and conventional varieties produced biocomposites with an average increase of 26. 5 % in flexural strength and 83. 5 % in flexural modulus. The thermostability of ensiled corn biomass was found to be influenced by region, use of inoculants and silage treatment, while the silage treatment accounted for most of the variability in corn biomass composition. Polypropylene matrix biocomposites produced with (30 wt%) pre- and post-silage corn did not show significant differences in mechanical properties. However, ensiled corn resulted in an increase in fibres and potential microbial biomass of smaller particle sizes with more optimal thermostability and purity, producing biocomposites with higher flexural strength and modulus especially at higher extrusion temperatures. Cornstalk is an effective reinforcement material, producing biocomposites with higher flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength. Whole corn biomass presents a potential alternative to other plant fibres, especially as filler material. Silage retting resulted in fibres with a higher thermostability and smaller particle size distribution that, given their already smaller aspect ratio, could result in better mechanical properties in thermoplastics with a higher melting temperature or biocomposites requiring higher shear for mixing...|$|R
40|$|Bast fibrous {{renewable}} materials, {{as commercial}} crops for {{the manufacture of}} textile based and other products, {{have been used for}} thousands of years to satisfy certain human needs, such as for shelter, clothing, source of energy and tools, and to sustain the livelihood of many communities in countries, such as in Asia, Europe and Africa. Concern for the environment has led to a number of global initiatives that favour the use of natural fibres. It is forecast that the global fibre demand by 2050 will be 130 million tonnes, which the cotton and synthetic fibre production {{will not be able to}} meet. Other than the environmental concerns, the renewed global interest in natural fibres, such as flax and hemp, forms part of a strategy to satisfy the fibre demand. South Africa, notwithstanding the fact that the flax and hemp industries have long been established for thousands of years in Europe, Asia and Egypt (Africa), has no history of the breeding, growing, processing and production of these cash crops. The renewed global interest in these crops has also stimulated interest from South Africa with respect to the development of a flax and hemp fibre industry so as to address some of the socio-economic challenges confronting the country today in its attempts to bring about real development in the rural areas through the cultivation and complete beneficiation of these fibre crops. In this regard, the relevant stakeholders, namely government, research councils, tertiary education institutions, farmers and communities worked together to investigate whether South Africa has the agronomic and climatic conditions, technical expertise as well as the necessary processing and production infrastructure to support the development of a local flax and hemp agro-industry. The purpose of this study was firstly to evaluate the performance of EU flax and hemp cultivars grown under different agronomic conditions in South Africa, and their effect on straw biomass yield, fibre yield and total fibre yield per hectare as well as associated fibre properties, and secondly to undertake mechanical fibre modification trials aimed at producing flax and hemp fibres with fibre diameters close to those of cotton. The minimum fibre diameter targeted being 20 μm. In accordance with the project objectives and work plan, selected dew <b>retted</b> flax and <b>hemp</b> straw samples from the various planting sites selected by the Agriculture Research Council – Institute for Industrial Crops, representing all the agronomic conditions under investigation, were taken to the CSIR for fibre extraction and testing. A relatively inexpensive and easy to operate Russian designed and manufactured machine, the CMT- 200 M breaker-cum-scutcher, was used for fibre extraction and the resultant extracted fibre bundles were further refined, using a steel comb, to obtain optimal fibre separation before their physical and chemical properties were evaluated. Results obtained in this research study proved that the climatic and agronomic conditions in South Africa were suitable for the cultivation of flax and hemp, notwithstanding the fact that the fibre yields achieved for hemp were lower than the minimum criteria of 23 percent, and that for flax only just exceeded the 25 percent minimum. The lack of local technical expertise on the growing and retting of flax and hemp, contributed to the low fibre yields. The planting parameters which were found to produce good results for the cultivation of hemp were the October planting date, using a row spacing of between 12. 5 to 25 cm, with a seeding density of between 80 – 100 kg, and the application of 50 – 100 kg nitrogen fertiliser. The use of extra artificial lighting and herbicide treatment did not appear to beneficially improve the hemp fibre yields. Similar considerations for flax cultivation in the Southern Cape region, particularly Oudtshoorn and Outeniqua, indicated that May to July planting dates, using inter-row spacing of 25 cm and sowing density of 63 kg seed. haˉ¹, produced a fibre yield and total fibre yield per hectare above the minimum values of 25 percent and 0, 8 tonnes per hectare, respectively, quoted in the literatur...|$|R
