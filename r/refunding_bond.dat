40|$|Refunding efficiency, {{a measure}} of the {{optimality}} of a refunding decision, is widely used in the call exercise decision for agency, corporate and municipal bonds. The original definition of efficiency assumes that the <b>refunding</b> <b>bond</b> is optionless. However, in practice, the <b>refunding</b> <b>bond</b> is often callable. We show that the commonly used method of incorporating the value of the refunding bond's call option into the efficiency calculation can lead to paradoxical results, and then suggest a new definition of refunding efficiency that overcomes this problem. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{integrate}} {{previous work}} in this area and develop a multiperiod model that simultaneously determines bond <b>refunding,</b> <b>bond</b> issuance, maturity structure, cash holdings, and bank borrowing policies. The focus here is on providing the required debt funds in the most cost efficient fashion. A strength of the model is that it allows for time varying interest costs, transaction costs, issuance costs, and refunding costs to be firm specific. The output of the model lays out the optimal financing decisions for each time interval that minimize the total discounted cost of providing the funds that match the requisite funds. By limiting the surplus funds available, the model minimizes the management incentive to over invest and thereby reduces the agency costs. The model has economic implications for the financing decisions and the firm's default risk, growth opportunities, riskiness of cash flows, and firm size.

40|$|When a {{corporation}} <b>refunds</b> a <b>bond</b> issue, choices {{have to be}} made between fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds based on expectations of future interest rates. Whether it is financially viable to <b>refund</b> a <b>bond</b> issue depends on many factors, including the magnitude of the decline in interest rates, the call premium, flotation costs, overlapping interest and the corporate tax rate, and all of these factors should be considered in the decision making process. This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative model that will assist the corporation to decide whether to refund and to select the best refunding option.

50|$|In the {{reconstruction}} era, {{the issue of}} <b>refunding</b> the <b>bonds</b> along with the infrastructure bills would be the centerpiece of Republican policy. The bonds were tied up {{in a lot of}} real estate in the state and the carpetbagger government was looking for ways to fund infrastructure projects, many of {{which turned out to be}} phony ways to funnel money into their own pockets. The Arkansas legislature passed laws to <b>refund</b> the <b>bonds</b> on April 6, 1869 with 30 years interest. Afterward they were contested on the grounds of there being fraud and breach of faith in their sale by the trust company. Governor Baxter's veto of a refunding bill that included the Holford bonds would tip off the Brooks-Baxter War in 1874. It wasn't until 1884 that the Fishback Amendment, named for its author William M. Fishback of Fort Smith, Arkansas, was passed prohibiting their payment, and added to the Constitution of Arkansas.|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} {{substantial}} research on optimal <b>bond</b> <b>refunding,</b> an important real-life feature is missing from the existing literature: imperfect adjustment or 'stickiness' of bond yields to short term interest rate changes. Our model takes this behavior into account, and also {{has the ability to}} handle mean reverting interest rates. The results indicate that the former has a significant effect on the optimal refunding policy (especially for longer maturities), but the latter does not. By incorporating these features, our model will hopefully offer a fairly complete and easily implementable guide to managers with regard to the <b>bond</b> <b>refunding</b> decision.

30|$|A {{preferred}} {{mechanism of}} a reclamation bonding {{system is that}} the bond amount be sufficient for a third-party to do the reclamation work and supervised by the administrative authority. The cost should also include all administrative, maintenance, and monitoring costs (World Bank Group 2008). In Canada, the lack of calculating the reclamation bond with a third-party and administration cost analysis has decreased incentives for companies to act responsibly and complete reclamation and closure, and therefore increases the risk to public financial resources and health (CCSG Associates 2001). In China, few mining companies reclaim the disturbed land, or {{have any of the}} <b>bond</b> <b>refunded,</b> because the <b>bond</b> amount paid is lower than the reclamation costs (Xiao et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2012). This defeats the original intention of a bonding system which should be to encourage mining companies to fulfill reclamation obligations and have the bond money returned. Bond calculations based on a third-party reclamation cost provides an incentive for a company to complete reclamation work by itself because it can do so less expensively than a third-party (CCSG Associates 2001). A unified bond calculation method can help to ensure the adequacy of bond amounts and will contribute to fairness among mining companies for reclamation.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{addresses}} {{the impacts of}} electronic tenancy databases upon social relations {{in the field of}} private rental tenancy in Australia. Insights arise from research carried out, in 2002 – 3, in the eastern, mainland states of Australia that included interviews with tenants and property managers in the private rental sector. Property managers viewed tenancy databases as a tool for efficient, effective and professional risk management, and ‘professional’ practice was held to render misconduct or improper listings extremely unlikely. In this context, tenants were individualized and expected to actively work to construct, maintain and document their reputation as a ‘good tenant’. For tenants, tenancy databases could have a particular, definitive effect. ‘Not being listed’ (along with getting a full rental <b>bond</b> <b>refund,</b> references from previous landlords, and so on) is an indicator that helps build a satisfactory, personal rental history. On the other hand, being ‘listed’ is read as a prime indicator of risk and effectively overriding other aspects of a tenant’s application for tenancy. ‘Listed’ tenants find themselves being forced to shift further and further away from the formal rental market and ultimately into insecure and inappropriate housing arrangements at the periphery...|$|R
40|$|The Archer Daniels Midland {{litigation}} {{and its aftermath}} highlighted the oddity of the continued use of the <b>refunding</b> clause in <b>bond</b> covenants, despite its legal ineffectiveness. This Note suggests three reasons for why the refunding clause might have retained value despite judicial curtailment of its legal reach: investor ignorance of the legal details of bond indentures, discounted but residual legal value, and extra-judicial reputation-based enforcement. The reputation-based hypothesis construes the refunding clause as a division of benefits between issuers and investors, where issuers retain the right to call -bonds for 2 ̆ 2 legitimate 2 ̆ 2 business purposes, but investors are promised all gains from market interest rate movements. In this view, the refunding clause is an implicit pledge by issuers not to appropriate bondholders 2 ̆ 7 market gains. As this line is too fine for courts to police, the understood pact is enforced via investor retaliation against future bond issues and other reputation effects. Initial empirical observations yield mixed results: There is support for the preconditions of the reputation-based hypothesis as to investors, but observations of bond issuances are less supportive, suggesting {{that the use of}} the refunding clause, while still done by some companies, decreased sharply following the Archer Daniels Midland decision. These observations also suggest, however, that many other factors were at work and that this drop in use might be the result of changes aside from the clause 2 ̆ 7 s legal value...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to assess the {{long-term}} common stock performance of the parent firms that underwent divisional buyout (DBO) and had event risk covenant (ERC) bonds outstanding at the announcement of the DBO. The final sample of 46 parent firms exhibit a common characteristic where all the ERC bonds were redeemed (either called above par or put on the firm at par) or restructured at a higher cost to the firm around DBO announcement date due to the presence of ERCs. ERCs are triggered since the parent firms that divest their assets through a DBO reveal future cash flow volatility, which has potential to lower the value of existing <b>bonds.</b> This <b>refunding</b> of the <b>bonds</b> leads to costly refinancing for the parent firms, which has long-term implications. I find significantly negative cumulative abnormal returns at the issue date of the ERC bonds for these firms due to potential managerial entrenchment and foregone transfer of wealth from bondholders to stockholders. Consistent with the finance literature, I find significantly positive cumulative abnormal returns for parent firms at the announcement of the DBO. These positive short-term returns at the announcement do not translate into long-term positive returns. The common stock of these parent firms significantly underperforms the market over the periods three, four, and five years after the DBO date. This dichotomy can be attributed to the security market overreaction to the announcement of DBO. The long-term underperformance can be attributed to the costly refinancing of the ERC bonds...|$|R
