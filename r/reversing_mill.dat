5000|$|Strip Steel or {{cold rolled}} strip is a steel product that is {{produced}} from a hot rolled strip that has been pickled. The coil is then reduced by a single stand cold roll steel mill straight away or <b>reversing</b> <b>mill</b> or in a tandem mill consisting of several single stands in a series. The strip is reduced to approximately final thickness by cold-rolling directly, or with the inclusion of an annealing operation at some intermediate thickness to facilitate further cold reduction or to obtain mechanical properties desired in the finished product. High carbon strip steel requires additional annealing and cold reduction operations. The coil is then slit to the desired width {{through the process of}} roll slitting.|$|E

The Syracuse plants were consolidated in 1946 into the Sanderson-Halcomb Works. In 1949, Crucible began operations in an $18 million sheet and strip mill at the Midland works, becoming the first steel mill to use hot and cold rolling of stainless and high-alloy sheet and strip. Iron Age, manufacturer of the hot <b>reversing</b> <b>mill,</b> called this a transition from a curiosity to standard production practice; ovens {{on both sides of}} the rolls could better control the steel's temperature.|$|E
50|$|Mills are {{designed}} {{in different types}} of configurations, with the most basic being a two-high non-reversing, which means there are two rolls that only turn in one direction. The two-high <b>reversing</b> <b>mill</b> has rolls that can rotate in both directions, but the disadvantage is that the rolls must be stopped, reversed, and then brought back up to rolling speed between each pass. To resolve this, the three-high mill was invented, which uses three rolls that rotate in one direction; the metal is fed through two of the rolls and then returned through the other pair. The disadvantage to this system is the workpiece must be lifted and lowered using an elevator. All of these mills are usually used for primary rolling and the roll diameters range from 60 to 140 cm.|$|E

In 1995 hot strip mill with Continuous Strip Processing (CSP) technology was installed at Dolvi. In 1998, integrated steel plant for the production of hot rolled coils was launched, using technologies such as the Conarc Process for steel making and the Compact Strip Process. Year 2000 saw the erection and commissioning of a 2 MTPA blast furnace at the Dolvi steel complex. Sponge iron capacity was increased from 1.2 MTPA to 1.4 MTPA in the year 2003.

40|$|Abstract: It {{is still}} common {{practice}} in industry to handle the thickness control problem of a rolling mill around a working point. The assumption of linearity is no longer valid if the mill is operated in a wider working range. In a <b>reversing</b> <b>mill</b> this is especially the case when the plate enters and leaves the mill stand from pass to pass. A non-linear control strategy is proposed to improve the regularity of the thickness {{at the ends of}} the plate in order to decrease the amount of the plate to be cut off by the crop shear. The performance of the controller is examined using an advanced simulation model of a finishing mill. Copyright c ° 2005 IFA...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of heavy}} gauge steel sheets for {{structural}} applications often requires a combination of high yield strength and adequate toughness. The most cost effective way to achieve high yield strength and high ductility in low alloyed steels is through grain refinement. In industrial practice, such refinement is commonly obtained by thermomechanical controlled processing (TMCP). This approach comprises slab reheating to well defined temperatures, {{a large amount of}} hot deformation below the non-recrystallisation temperature T-nr and accelerated cooling. In practice, the T-nr is generally raised by the addition of microalloying elements such as Nb and Ti. As these elements contribute substantially to the alloying costs, optimisation of their use allows for a decrease in production cost. Better understanding of the T-nr assists in tuning the rolling process so that optimum mechanical properties can be produced. One area of importance is to recognise that the concept of the T-nr was originally developed for <b>reversing</b> <b>mills</b> and the production of plate steels. Methods of defining and determining it must be modified {{if it is to be}} applied to strip mills and their associated short interpass times. The main goal of this review is to provide a concise and complete overview of the current understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control the T-nr and to address the different methods that can be used to determine it...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the problem of shape (or flat-ness) control for Sendzimir 20 -roll {{cold-rolling}} steel mills. Such mills, with a variety of shape actuators, offer the control engineer considerable choice in the configuration and design of a shape con-trol system. In addition, the Sendzimir mill is a <b>reversing</b> <b>mill,</b> with shape measurement devices {{at either end of the}} mill, providing a facility for feedforward of incoming shape disturbances. The mul-tivariable problem presented by the mill has a significant singu-larity problem, which is tackled in this paper using a variety of ap-proaches, motivated by both practical (operational) considerations and formal theoretical procedures. A final challenge lies in the de-sire to economize on the number of controllers required to cover the mill over its wide range of operating conditions.

40|$|The hot torsion {{simulator}} {{has been}} extensively used {{as a means to}} understand the microstructure evolution of different steel grades during hot rolling. The test is suitable to simulate ‘real’ industrial schedules as well as schedules designed to obtain information regarding the intrinsic properties of the materials. For example, it is common to apply ‘average’ schedules, in which deformation per pass, interpass time, strain rate and cooling rate are kept constant, to determine the characteristic temperatures Ar 3, Ar 1 and Tnr (start and finish of the austenite transformation and no recrystallization temperatures) of steels. In this work, both a ‘real’ schedule simulating a rolling schedule in a <b>reversing</b> <b>mill</b> and an ‘average’ schedule were applied to a series of Ti and Nb microalloyed steels. In general, the steels exhibited somewhat different behaviours for the different thermomechanical schedules, e. g. the pancaking temperature region is easily detectable after an ‘average’ schedule, while for the ‘real’ schedule some softening can be detected in the pancaking region, which is strongly dependent on the strain and interpass time. Moreover, the paper analyzes a new approach to stress-strain curves, which is used to better understand the sequence of events which take place during rolling and their dependence on rolling parameters.
