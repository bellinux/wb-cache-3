5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the sensitive imprinting period {{and the influence of}} early experience on feather-pecking behaviour of young chicks. The experiment included 8 treatment-groups: one group of chickens (0 F) were <b>reared</b> on sandy <b>floor</b> during the whole experiment period (0 – 14 weeks); one group (0 P) were reared on barren floor; three groups were <b>reared</b> on barren <b>floor</b> for 2 weeks (3 P), 4 weeks (5 P), or 6 weeks (7 P), respectively, and then <b>reared</b> on sandy <b>floor</b> till 14 weeks; the other three groups were <b>reared</b> on sandy <b>floor</b> for 2 weeks (3 F), 4 weeks (5 F), or 6 weeks(7 F), respectively, and then <b>reared</b> on barren <b>floor</b> till 14 weeks. Feather-pecking, ground-pecking, object-pecking and staring at object were measured. The results showed that the most important period of imprinting for feather-pecking behaviour was during first four weeks after birth, especially week 3 and week 4. It was found that the early environmental experience can modify feather-pecking behaviour at later age, but can not completely change it. On the other hand, the environmental conditions seemed not to affect object-pecking and staring at object in this study [Acta Zoologica Sinica 54 （ 6 ）： 955 – 963, 2008]...|$|R

25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} clarify the effect of two management systems (cages Vs floor system) on welfare status and economics of broiler chicks. Two commercial flocks each of about 12375 day old Hubbard broiler chicks of mixed sex were housed in two fully environmentally controlled pens (cage and floor pens) from 0 - 6 weeks of age. Welfare was assessed through bird's performance, behavior, fearfulness and Heterophil: lymphocyte ratio (HLR). Compared to cage <b>reared</b> group, <b>floor</b> <b>reared</b> broilers recorded significantly heavier final body weight, body weight gain, better feed conversion and lower mortalities throughout the whole rearing period (0 - 6 weeks). Behavioral data showed that, caged birds were more often standing and stereotyped drinking, however <b>floor</b> <b>reared</b> group showed more walking, feeding and pecking. Total prevalence of gait problems and (HLR) were significantly higher in cage than floor group. Economic analysis revealed that, <b>rearing</b> broilers on <b>floor</b> was more profitable than cage rearing system. Data obtained in this experiment suggested that the welfare status of broilers was compromised under cage conditions as indicated by impaired performance, increased mortalities, higher prevalence of leg problems, stereotyped behavior and higher (HLR). In conclusion, cages are not recommended as a management system for rearing broilers from both the economic and welfare points of view...|$|R

2500|$|The sports-oriented model, {{known as}} the [...] "SE" [...] in North America and [...] "Sportivo" [...] in Australasia, was {{developed}} by Toyota Australia. It features a black [...] "honeycomb" [...] grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels. To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> and fuel tank undercovers. Handling-specific upgrades see the use of firmer shock absorbers, a rise in spring rate, thicker anti-roll bars, additional floor and body side bracing, and a [...] "V"-brace behind the rear seat (which prevents the rear seat from folding down, offering a ski-pass only).

2500|$|Upon introduction, {{the model}} {{had only one}} trim level, which would later {{be known as the}} LX model trim; it was powered by the 2.0L straight-four B20B {{producing}} [...] at 5400rpm and [...] of torque at 4800rpm. Outer dimensions for this engine would be identical to the Integra's 1.8L engine, but internally the engine had a larger [...] bore to add the extra displacement needed to produce more torque. The engine utilized a one-piece cylinder sleeve construction unique from any other B-series engine. The chassis was a unibody design with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension. Inside, the rear seats were able to fold down, and a picnic table was stowed in the <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> area. A common external trait that was visible with this generation was plastic cladding covering the front bumper, rear bumper, and fender wells. In most countries, CR-Vs had a chrome grille; however, in the United States, the grille was made out of the same black plastic as the bumpers. A major difference between the LX and EX trims was that the EX had anti-lock brakes and 15inch alloy wheels while the LX did not. Drivetrain options were front-wheel drive or Honda's Real Time AWD.|$|E

2500|$|The Moke's {{construction}} is simple. The body mainly {{consists of two}} box-section [...] "pontoons" [...] or [...] "sideboxes" [...] running between {{the front and rear}} wheels, and include (non-hollow) extensions of that {{from the back of the}} car all the way up to the front. These are connected by the floor pan, the firewall and a sturdy lateral torque box that runs under the front seats and stiffens the body in torsion. The left-hand pontoon contains the fuel tank; the right-hand has a compartment for the battery and a small lockable storage area. The 1972 [...] "Moke, Special Export", commonly referred to as a [...] "Californian" [...] Moke, has an Austin Sprite/MG Midget type fuel tank fitted beneath the <b>rear</b> <b>floor</b> area to meet the American FMVSS safety requirements of the time. Standard Mokes of the same period and later Californian Mokes use the conventional tank mounted in the left sidebox. Later Portuguese Mokes have additional lockable storage space at the rear of the vehicle. The optional cloth canopy has plastic side windows, and is held up by a thin tubular structure that can easily be removed when not needed. In later versions this was replaced with a more solid roll cage. The windscreen can easily be unbolted and removed if not needed. There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the bonnet, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction. This makes it relatively straightforward to reproduce and replace Moke body components without access to sophisticated machine tools.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of protein level fed from 6 to 20 weeks of age on the performance of cage <b>reared</b> and <b>floor</b> <b>reared</b> replacement pullets. The protein level of rations containing 2800 to 3000 kcal. metabolizable energy per kilogram was varied by 2 % increments from 18 to 12 %, 18 to 12 % and 16 to 10 % during the periods from 6 to 10, 10 to 14 and 14 to 20 weeks of age, respectively. Data from these two experiments indicate that replacement pullets fed a 20 % protein ration to 6 weeks of age require a 14 - 14 - 12 or 16 - 12 - 12 percent protein level sequence from 6 to 10, 10 to 14 and 14 to 20 weeks of age, respectively, to maximize 20 -week weight and efficiency of feed utilization and minimize the days required to reach 50 % egg production. Feeding lower protein levels, i. e., 20 - 14 - 12 - 12, 20 - 12 - 12 - 12 and 20 - 14 - 12 - 10 percent protein level sequences resulted in inferior performance of replacement pullets to 20 weeks of age. The data also show that even though feeding a 20 - 14 - 12 - 12 or 20 - 12 - 12 - 12 percent protein level sequence resulted in a smaller bird at 20 weeks of age which required more days to reach 50 % egg production, the subsequent production during the following 42 -week laying cycle was not significantly reduced. The influence of protein level on the performance of replacement pullets was similar for cage <b>reared</b> and <b>floor</b> <b>reared</b> pullets even though pullets reared in cages were heavier at 20 weeks of age, consumed more feed, were less efficient in the utilization of feed and required fewer days to reach 50 % egg production compared to pullets <b>reared</b> on the <b>floor...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Poultry {{farmers in}} the southeastern of Mexico {{consider}} that the productivity of the hens that comes from <b>rearing</b> on <b>floor</b> has a higher productive performance than reared hens in cages, mainly due to higher percentage of egg laying and lower mortality. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the productive performance of the laying hen in relation to the type of rearing. A total of 79680 pullets Bovans White of 17 weeks of age were housed in cages with five pullets cage- 1 (405 cm 2 pullet- 1). They were divided in two treatments according to their type of <b>rearing</b> (<b>floor</b> vs cage) with four replicates. The study period was from week 20 to week 40 of age. The variables evaluated were daily (%) and cumulative mortality (%), egg production (%), egg weight (g), feed intake (g pullet d- 1), cumulative feed intake (g pullet- 1), daily and cumulative egg mass, number of eggs per hen housed, egg loss (%) and productivity index. The variables were analyzed using a randomized block design. It was observed that daily and cumulative mortality, feed intake and egg loss was higher (p< 0. 05), while the number of eggs per hen housed and productivity index (p< 0. 05) was lower for hens in cages.
