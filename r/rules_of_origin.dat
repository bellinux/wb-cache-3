For wood products too, Malaysia has specialization in downstream products, which has a significant market shares in the USA and Japan.

40|$|In this study, {{we measure}} the {{utilization}} costs {{of free trade}} agreement (FTA) tariff schemes. To do that, we use shipment-level customs data on Thai imports, which identify not only firms, source country, and commodity but also tariff schemes. We propose several measures {{as a proxy for}} FTA utilization costs. The example includes the minimum amount of firm-level savings on tariff payments, i. e., trade values under FTA schemes multiplied by the tariff margin, in all transactions. Consequently, the median costs for FTA utilization in 2008, for example, are estimated to be approximately US$ 2, 000 for exports from China, US$ 300 for exports from Australia, and US$ 1, 000 for exports from Japan.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of free trade}} agreements (FTAs) {{in the last decade}} has resulted in an accompanying increase in dispute settlement regimes pertaining to those agreements. One obvious consequence is that increasingly, states are exposing themselves to such complaints, and not necessarily with the limitations that have been imposed on the at General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) /World Trade Organization (WTO). The inherent ambiguity surrounding non-violation complaints at the WTO, and other risks relating to such complaints, are being multiplied manifold by these FTAs. The non-violation concept appears to have originated even before the GATT came into being. Developing-country FTA parties are therefore even more vulnerable in terms of dispute settlement, under the FTAs. Issues to be expected include how non-violation nullification and impairment will be applied to benefits accruing in areas such as intellectual property rights and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origins...</b>|$|R
