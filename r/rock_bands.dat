5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E

5|$|The loud {{volume of}} the band's live show {{influenced}} the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. Proto punk and punk <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Ramones the Sex Pistols, the Clash and Green Day cite the Who as an influence. The Who inspired mod revival bands, particularly the Jam, which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular. The Who influenced hard <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> such as Guns N' Roses. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who. The Who have also influenced pop punk band Panic! at the Disco.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of music groups and <b>rock</b> <b>bands,</b> traditional folk music remains widely popular. The works of the national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and national anthem writer Rabindranath Tagore have a widespread following across Dhaka. The Baily Road area is known as Natak Para (Theatre Neighbourhood) which is the center of Dhaka's thriving theatre movement. Indian and Western music and films are popular with large segments of Dhaka's population.|$|E
500|$|For Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners, {{every song}} in Green Day: <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> can be {{exported}} for use within <b>Rock</b> <b>Band,</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 2, Lego <b>Rock</b> <b>Band,</b> and <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3. The Wii version can only export songs into <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3. Although <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> and <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 2 {{do not support}} vocal harmonies, <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3 does and the exported Green Day tracks can be played with all vocal parts in that game. Only 11 of the songs, which are considered [...] "family friendly", can be played in Lego <b>Rock</b> <b>Band.</b> Each song was also made available, as of November 13, 2012, as an individual download outside of this game, however these downloads will only work in <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3 and <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> Blitz. [...] "Song of the Century", {{which serves as a}} prelude to the title track of 21st Century Breakdown, was made into a separate song, and is unique among the entire <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> catalog in which it is the series' only song a cappella, i.e. it only has vocal tracks.|$|R
25|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> also {{supports}} migration of content across games. This enables players to access music that {{was featured in}} other <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> titles within a single game. <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 2 currently supports content imported from the original <b>Rock</b> <b>Band,</b> Lego <b>Rock</b> <b>Band,</b> and Green Day: <b>Rock</b> <b>Band.</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3 allows players to not only access these songs but content exported from <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 2 as well. While Lego <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> and Green Day: <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> allow players to export the full soundtrack from each game, <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> loses three songs from its soundtrack (four in the European version) during the export process due to licensing restrictions. <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 2, likewise, will not allow players to export fourteen of the eighty-four songs offered on the disc (however nine of these missing songs were offered as a free download following the release of <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3). Two additional songs from the original <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> export were previously unavailable within <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3, however they have since been returned to availability through a patch. Two further songs which were released on-disc in the European version are unavailable in <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3, {{regardless of whether the}} songs were obtained through a disc export or through purchase as DLC (for the North American region). Due to the licensing agreement with Apple Corps, The Beatles: <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> does not allow any exporting of its content whatsoever. <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> Blitz shipped with twenty-five songs on its soundtrack (twenty-three of which are new, two of which were offered in <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 2 but not exportable to 3) and all twenty-five songs are cross-compatible with <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3. Blitz itself is also able to use the full range of content offered on the <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> downloadable content catalog (including future content, previous imports, and RBN songs), integrating the existing charts into its own gameplay system. Harmonix is working to assure that as much as a player's existing song library will be playable within <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4 within the same console family.|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the Malvern Winter Gardens {{was a major}} {{regional}} {{venue for}} concerts by popular <b>rock</b> <b>bands,</b> including The Rolling Stones, Dave Berry, T-Rex, The Jam, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, The Undertones, and Joy Division. Many of the 1960s concerts were staged by Bannister promotions while later events were promoted by Cherry Red, a London-based independent record label formed in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Many {{prominent}} progressive <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> {{got their}} initial exposure at large rock festivals that {{were held in}} Britain during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Emerson, Lake & Palmer debuted at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, at which Supertramp, Family and Jethro Tull also appeared. Jethro Tull were also present at the 1969 Newport Jazz Festival, the first year in which that festival invited <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> to perform. Hawkwind appeared at many British festivals throughout the 1970s, although they sometimes showed up uninvited, set up a stage {{on the periphery of the}} event, and played for free.|$|E
5|$|The Killers {{are seen}} {{as one of the}} biggest <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> of the 21st century, and the most {{successful}} rock band to ever emerge from the state of Nevada, having sold an estimated 22 million records worldwide.

5|$|Christchurch {{holds an}} annual music festival {{on the first}} weekend in July. Originally a folk festival, the event has evolved to cater for {{a wider variety of}} tastes: clog and morris dancing groups and salsa and belly dancing {{exhibitions}} have featured. <b>Rock</b> <b>bands</b> and soul groups have been included alongside the more traditional types of music. The festival's format changes annually but usually takes place on and around the town quay where a large marquee contains the main stage. Local bars often host smaller bands and dancing and exhibitions take place throughout the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{alternative}} rock's declining popularity, {{some artists}} retained mainstream relevance. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into {{the start of}} the 21st century, when bands like Creed and Matchbox Twenty became among the most popular <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> in the United States. At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.|$|E

5|$|Grunge fuses {{elements}} of punk rock and heavy metal, {{such as the}} distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire for freedom.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metal {{is a form}} {{of music}} {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms and highly amplified distorted guitars, generally with grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal is a development of blues, blues rock, rock and prog rock. Its origins lie in the British hard <b>rock</b> <b>bands</b> who between 1967 and 1974 took blues and rock and created a hybrid with a heavy, guitar-and-drums-centered sound. Most of the pioneers in the field, like Black Sabbath, were English, though many were inspired by American performers like Blue Cheer and Jimi Hendrix.|$|E
25|$|Harmonix {{aimed to}} provide {{a wide range of}} music to players through {{additional}} content, stating that <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> is a music platform for discovering music. The developer released new songs, compatible with both games, through regular weekly downloadable content (DLC). including various singles, artist packs featuring three or more songs from the artists, and full albums. Downloadable songs are compatible with <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> and <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 2. A portion of the downloadable song catalog is also compatible with Lego <b>Rock</b> <b>Band,</b> based on the songs' appropriateness for the game's family-friendly content rating. While The Beatles: <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> also supports downloadable content, the game does not share such content with the other <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> games, nor can it use content from the other <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> games. Green Day: <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> does not have its own catalog of downloadable content but a select number of songs from the 21st Century Breakdown album were released to the Music Store prior to the game's release. These songs integrate with Green Day: <b>Rock</b> <b>Band,</b> enabling the player to play the complete 21st Century Breakdown album in the game. Downloadable content released on or after October 26, 2010 is restricted for use with <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3, <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> Blitz, and <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4 while content released on or after October 6, 2015 is restricted for use with <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4 only.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4 {{ships with}} 65 songs on disc, {{spanning}} from the 1960s to the 2010s. The studio also worked {{to ensure that}} as much of its existing library of downloadable songs would be compatible with the game upon its release as possible; 1,500 songs were available at launch. Nearly all existing official <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> DLC is compatible with <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4 within the same console family (i.e. PlayStation 4 can only import songs purchased on PlayStation 3, and Xbox One can only import songs purchased on Xbox 360). Previous disc exports from the previous disc-based games in the series (excluding The Beatles: <b>Rock</b> <b>Band),</b> the Track Packs, and from <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> Blitz will eventually be available for players, {{as long as they}} have previously performed the disc export; there will be no option to export these songs into <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4. <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3 on-disc songs are expected to be exportable into <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4 in December 2015. [...] "If you bought a <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> song, it should be yours in <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4," [...] said Sussman. [...] "Everything that you have already exported will come over." [...] Harmonix has stated they will explore the logistics of bringing songs created by the <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> Network into <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4 after completing the transition of all official DLC, packs, and disc exports. In most cases, existing songs will be updated to use both Freestyle Guitar and Vocals within <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> {{features}} instrument controllers {{designed for}} the game. [...] However, Harmonix and other companies have attempted to provide compatibility between competing instrument controllers and music games, allowing <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> to be playable without use of specific controllers, and to reuse <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> controllers in other music games. Prior to <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 3, most instrument controllers were made by MTV Games and Harmonix, with several third-party vendors supply alternate versions. On January 4, 2008, video game peripherals manufacturer Mad Catz announced it had reached an agreement with MTV and Harmonix to produce peripherals for <b>Rock</b> <b>Band.</b> This agreement also gives MadCatz the ability to bundle and sell their products with <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> game titles. Mad Catz continued to support the series {{for the release of}} <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4 in 2015, but in early 2016 announced financial difficulties due to weak sales of <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4. Harmonix subsequently announced that starting in 2016, Precision Designed Products will be producing and supporting instrument hardware for <b>Rock</b> <b>Band</b> 4.|$|R
