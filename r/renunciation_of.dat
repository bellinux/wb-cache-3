5|$|Nirjarā is {{possible}} through tapas, austerities and penances. Tapas {{can be either}} external or internal. Six forms of external tapas are—fasting, control of appetite, accepting food under certain conditions, <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> comforts. Six forms of internal tapas are—atonement, reverence, rendering of service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.|$|E
5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} {{allusion to the}} theatre as an indication that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine Jain attitudes toward {{renunciation}} {{in the final two}} books of the Tri~a 9 tisalaka. puru?acaritra, the Parsvanathacaritra and the MahavTracaritra, through the creation of a typology of the stories <b>of</b> male <b>renunciation.</b> I argue that tensions exist between the two distinct models <b>of</b> <b>renunciation</b> found in the text- spontaneous renunciation early in life, and late, stage <b>of</b> life based <b>renunciation.</b> Such tensions also exist between the models <b>of</b> <b>renunciation</b> advocated by the heterodox and orthodox traditions of India.

Muhammad became anxious about their conduct, and realised the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his pact with the Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims' border with the tribe. The Qurayza also possessed weaponry: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armour, and 500 shields.|$|E
5|$|Other critics view Motörhead as {{the first}} {{significant}} exponent of the movement and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal. Their fast music, the <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans. Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour, and they also shared the stage with Lemmy's friends punk band The Damned. Motörhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.|$|E

These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation.

5|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1832, The Destroying Angel was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were {{divided on the}} subject matter. Some praised its vividness and ability to mix fear and beauty without lowering into tastelessness; others criticised its thematic matter as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talents. The painting changed {{the manner in which}} art critics viewed the artist; some saw it as indicating previously unseen character depths, others considered it a <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> his previous works. In 1854 Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Coloman sent envoys to the Council of Guastalla, {{which had}} been convoked by Pope Paschal II. In October 1106 the envoys solemnly {{informed}} the pope of their king's <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> his royal prerogative to appoint the prelates of his realms. According to historians Ferenc Makk and Márta Font, without this declaration the Holy See would not have acknowledged Coloman's conquest of Dalmatia. During the civil war between BoleslawIII and his brother Zbigniew, Coloman intervened on the former's behalf and helped him overcome the latter's army in Mazovia in 1107. Coloman also sent Hungarian reinforcements to the Byzantine Emperor AlexiosI Komnenos against Bohemond I of Antioch, who had invaded Byzantine territories in October 1107. After suffering a sound defeat, Bohemond withdrew his troops and acknowledged the emperor's suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch in the Treaty of Devol in 1108.|$|E

5|$|In 1422, Władysław fought another war, {{known as}} the Gollub War, against the Teutonic Order, {{defeating}} them in under {{two months before the}} Order's imperial reinforcements had time to arrive. The resulting Treaty of Melno ended the Knights' claims to Samogitia once and for all and defined a permanent border between Prussia and Lithuania. Lithuania was given the province of Samogitia, with the port of Palanga, but the city of Klaipėda was left to the Order. This border remained largely unchanged for roughly 500 years, until 1920. The terms of this treaty have, however, been seen as turning a Polish victory into defeat, as a result of Władysław's <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> Polish claims to Pomerania, Pomerelia, and Chełmno Land, for which he received only the town of Nieszawa in return. The Treaty of Melno closed a chapter in the Knights' wars with Lithuania but did little to settle their long-term issues with Poland. Further sporadic warfare broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, the Polish {{government}} {{issued a}} threatening statement accusing Lithuania of provocation.

Upon receiving news that Poland was considering extreme measures, President Smetona was verging towards agreeing to discuss diplomatic relations, but changed his mind at almost the last minute. On the night of March 14, the Lithuanians, acting through France's envoy to Warsaw, proposed a commission to investigate the shooting incident and to agree on measures to avoid such incidents in the future. This was a partial measure that clearly did not satisfy Poland, which responded by refusing, in the first paragraph of the ultimatum delivered three days later, to establish such a commission. At the same time Lithuanian diplomats approached foreign powers in a bid for international support.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 Polish {{ultimatum}} to Lithuania was {{an ultimatum}} delivered to Lithuania by Poland on March 17, 1938. The Lithuanian government had steadfastly refused {{to have any}} diplomatic relations with Poland after 1920, protesting the annexation of the Vilnius Region by Poland. As pre-World War II tensions in Europe intensified, Poland perceived the need to secure its northern borders. Five days earlier, Poland, feeling supported by international recognition of the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, decided to deliver an ultimatum to Lithuania. The ultimatum demanded that the Lithuanian government unconditionally agree to establish diplomatic relations with Warsaw within 48 hours, and that the terms be finalized before March 31. The establishment of diplomatic relations would mean a de facto <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> Lithuanian claims to the region containing its historic capital, Vilnius (known in Polish as Wilno).|$|E

5|$|In The Tempest, Shakespeare {{presents}} {{two powerful}} sorcerers, Prospero and Sycorax, who have both controlled the island. Initially {{it appears that}} the two characters are a contrasting pair: the benevolent Prospero and the rapacious Sycorax. However, upon closer analysis, {{the differences between the two}} characters disappear and the similarities grow. For example, Prospero, like Sycorax, coerces Ariel into doing his bidding, using the sprite to regain his inheritance as a Duke, and tortures Caliban with magic the way Sycorax tortured Ariel. Also, both Prospero and Sycorax were exiled from their respective homelands and both have children, which was possibly the reason why they were both spared being executed. The fine line between Sycorax's black magic and Prospero's white blurs even further during his <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> magic in Act V, a speech which has strong parallels to one given by the dark witch Medea in the Metamorphoses. In comparing himself to Medea, Prospero is implicitly comparing himself to Sycorax. Emphasizing the relationship between Prospero and Sycorax demonstrates the ambiguity of Prospero's supposedly benevolent character.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the {{north-western}} regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that {{were known as}} the mahajanapadas. The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling {{the life of the}} Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.|$|E
5|$|Kruger's second volksraad sat for {{the first}} time in 1891. Any {{resolution}} it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' residency on the condition they were naturalised as burghers—a process requiring the <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> any foreign allegiance. The residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old. During the close-run campaign for the 1893 election, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice John Gilbert Kotzé as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotzé. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893.|$|E
