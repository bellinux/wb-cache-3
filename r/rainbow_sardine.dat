2500|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} activity {{of the people of}} the island. Fishing is done both off shore in the sea and during the monsoon season in the lagoon and reef area. Trawl nets and pole line are used for oceanic tuna fishing. Wooden boats are used for local fishing in the lagoon. Fish species reported include carangids, cephalopods, perches, <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine,</b> rays, sail fishes, sharks, skipjack tuna, and tuna.|$|E
50|$|The slender <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> is {{primarily}} differentiated from the <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine,</b> because the slender rainbow sardines {{do not have}} tiny radiating striae on the posterior part of their scales. There is some indication that the slender <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> may {{tend to have more}} vertebra than the <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine.</b>|$|E

50|$|Dussumieria is {{the genus}} of <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardines,</b> a group within the round herring family Dussumieriidae.|$|R
40|$|Sardines are {{normally}} caught by gill nets and seine nets. Apart from these, several indigenous types of gears {{have been developed}} by fishermen to suit local conditions, which, though primitive and crude in appearance, are efficient in their own ways. 'Achil', a type of hand line, is one such gear developed and used to capture the lesser <b>sardines</b> and the <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardines</b> along the south-west coast of India between Varkkala and Cape Comori...|$|R
40|$|Clupeoid fishes, chiefly {{represented}} by the sardines Sardinella spp.), the whitebaits Anchoviella spp.), the anchovies (Thrissocles spp.) and the <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardines</b> Dussumieria spp.), form an important fishery at Lawson's Bay, Waltair and the catch statistics {{for a period of}} seven years (1950 - 56) show that on an average about 393 tons of these fishes are landed annually constituting about 37 - 5 per cent, of the total catch. The sardines rank first in importance and form on an average about 22 per cent, of the total catch...|$|R
50|$|The slender <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> swims {{in schools}} and while pelagic it is {{generally}} found near shores. It feeds on zooplankton, mainly crustacean and smaller fish. The slender <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> spawns mainly in spring. Its eggs, and when they hatch the larvae, drift passively until they metamorphose into free-swimming fish.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{restricted}} to the tropical and subtropical portions of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, the slender <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> is found off shores from Taiwan and the Philippines, to northern Australia, to east Africa, Madagascar and into the Red Sea. The slender <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> {{found its way into}} the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. It is now found in the eastern Mediterranean off the shores from Turkey to Egypt. It has been reported as far east in the Pacific as the Solomon Islands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> (Dussumieria acuta), {{also known}} as Common sprat, Dwarf round herring, Rainbow herring, and Sharpnosed sprat , is a bony fish {{important}} to aquaculture and commercial fisheries.|$|E
40|$|The {{systematics}} of the <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardines</b> of the Genus Dussumieria Valenciennes {{has been}} studied in detail. The existence of two species namely Dussumieria acuta Valenciennes and D. hasseltiiJlleeker in Indian waters has been re-established as against the view of Whitehead (1963) who synonymised these two species to one namely D. acuta Val. In this study specimens collected from east and west coasts of India were analysed morphometrically and meristically and the characters compared statistically. Clear differences {{in many of the}} characters, sufficient enough to substantiate the existence of two different species, were noticed. The two species are redescribed and photographs presented in the text...|$|R
5000|$|Like other {{sardines}} {{the slender}} <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> is caught {{both as a}} bait fish and for human consumption. Frequently fishermen catch them in shore with a purse seine (an encircling net) and then release them in deeper water where they attract larger fish.|$|E
5000|$|Until the 1980s in {{the eastern}} Mediterranean slender rainbow {{sardines}} were frequently confused with the <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> (Dussumieria acuta). Wangratana (1980) demonstrated the differences between Dussumieria acuta and Dussumieria elopsoides, while Whitehead (1985) and Randall (1996) showed that Dussumieria elopsoides does occur in the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|The slender <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> (Dussumieria elopsoides) is a small, subtropical, {{salt water}} fish of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea which was first {{described}} by Bleeker in 1849. Dussumieria hasselti and Dussumieria productissima are synonyms for this same fish. It is a round herring {{of the family}} Clupeidae.|$|E
50|$|Marine and estuarine species, the <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> can {{be found}} in Indo-Pacific regions such as the Persian Gulf (and perhaps south to Somalia), Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia to Indonesia (Kalimantan) and the Philippines. The species now also occurs in the Mediterranean, having invaded as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal.|$|E
5000|$|Shape: The slender <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> has an {{elongated}} body, with round belly and a pointed nose. The single dorsal (back) fin is slightly behind midpoint. The tail fin is heavily forked. The scales are very delicate and are easily detached. Like other sardines {{it has no}} lateral line, and no scales on the head.|$|E
50|$|The {{color of}} the <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> is {{iridescent}} blue with a shiny gold or brass line below, which quickly fades after death; the hind margin of the tail is broadly dark. The fish has a w-shaped pelvic scute; an isthmus tapering evenly forward; and more anal fin rays. There are 14 to 18 anal soft rays. The maximum length recorded is 20 cm.|$|E

Fish species reported include carangids, cephalopods, perches, <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine,</b> rays, sail fishes, sharks, skipjack tuna, and tuna. Agriculture is practised, with about 5% of the land area brought under cultivation. Coconut plantations are common along with associated coir twinning. Crops grown include red grass, groundnut, maize, sweet potato, grains, cereals, millets, papaya, and banana.|$|E

Enquiries with the purseseiner which brought the porposies, revealed that they were caught from a depth of 15 m along with the catch of sardine, mackerel and <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine.</b> The mesh size of the purseseine was 18 mm...|$|E
40|$|The clupeoids, which {{constitute}} about a {{third of}} the marine fish caught in India, are chiefly represented in Indian waters by the sardines (Sardinella), anchovies (Thrissocles), whitebait (Anchoviella), <b>rainbow</b> <b>sardine</b> (DU 8 sumieria),-white sardine (Kowala),etc. Of these, the sardines, represented by nine species, constitute an important fishery along the West and South East Coasts of India. A few species like S. longiceps, S. fimbriata, S. gibbosa and S. albella occur in large shoals...|$|E
