Metals processed at the mill included copper, gold, silver, and lead, all of which were received from another mill near Eureka, Utah. The metal content of ore was increased through the process to make transportation less expensive. The reducing process used was an acid-brine chloridizing and leaching process which became outdated, leading to the abandonment of the site in 1925. At the mill's highest productivity it processed 200 tons of ore yearly from the Tintic Mining District.|$|E

40|$|On May 4, 1995 {{the author}} visited a steel plate and coil, cold {{reduction}} facility at Steel Warehouse Inc. located in South Bend, Indiana about 150 miles from Argonne. Some very interesting facts were learned about cold reduction of {{hot rolled steel}} during this visit. The company selected is only a cold <b>reduction</b> <b>mill</b> and buys steel {{from a number of}} steel producers. The author spent a total of about three hours with these people, and this included a tour of their pickling line, the small cold <b>reduction</b> <b>mill</b> which at present is limited to 15. 5 in width maximum, and their large cold <b>reduction</b> <b>mill</b> which produces sheet and coil up to 72 in. wide. Some of the things that were learned, that {{will have an impact on}} the production of the Atlas steel plates are given here. (1) Hot rolled coils have some inherent, interesting, characteristics that must be taken into consideration when being cold reduced. (2) The monitoring of the coil thickness is only done along the center line of the coil, this has a serious impact on QC of plates cut from this coil for a number of reasons. (3) Hot rolled coils of steel in this particular instance may come from a number of different sources. This could cause problems if magnetic permeability is a serious issue.

40|$|When using continuous-cast billet in pipe rolling, it is {{expedient}} to {{roll the}} billet prior to broaching, so as to improve the structure and properties of the steel. To that end, a three-high screw-rolling mill for billet reduction has been installed at the TPA- 80 pipe-rolling unit at OAO Sinarskii Trubnyi Zavod. Introduction of the new process was associated with increase in the rejection rate on account of indentations in the pipe. These indentations {{may be attributed to}} the depression formed {{at the rear of the}} billet in reduction and the subsequent formation of metallic semicircles on broaching; the semicircles break away and enter the deformation zone. The sources of the indentations on the rolled pipe are investigated. The broaching of the billet on a screw rolling mill is mathematically simulated. Recommendations are made with a view to reducing the surface defects on pipe produced by the TPA- 80 unit with a <b>reduction</b> <b>mill.</b> Â© 2013 Allerton Press, Inc...|$|E

On the one hand,it ensures {{the function of the}} force of the bending roll not cancel out mutually,and enhances the controlled effect of the force of the bending roll in the strip,on the other hand, there will not be new extra and partial shape wave under the complex effect of the force of the bending roll. Meanwhile there will not be the problem that the force of the bending roll in some parts get too high even overall loading while the other parts get get too low in the setting procedure. While improving the lifespan of the fluid cylinder, the adjusting rest of the force of the bending roll get increased. While the related technology has been adopted by field engineering, we have achieved excellent result, and there is the value for more expanding...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this project}} focused on the {{conversion}} of bituminous coal to liquid hydrocarbons. The major steps in this process include mechanical pretreatment, chemical pretreatment, and finally solubilization and conversion of coal to liquid hydrocarbons. Two different types of mechanical pretreatment were considered for the process: hammer mill grinding and jet mill grinding. After research and experimentation, {{it was decided to}} use jet mill grinding, which allows for coal to be ground down to particle sizes of 5 {mu}m or less. A Fluid Energy Model 0101 JET-O-MIZER- 630 size <b>reduction</b> <b>mill</b> was purchased for this purpose. This machine was completed and final testing was performed on the machine at the Fluid Energy facilities in Telford, PA. The test results from the machine show that it can indeed perform to the required specifications and is able to grind coal down to a mean particle size that is ideal for experimentation. Solubilization and conversion experiments were performed on various pretreated coal samples using 3 different approaches: (1) enzymatic - using extracellular Laccase and Manganese Peroxidase (MnP), (2) chemical - using Ammonium Tartrate and Manganese Peroxidase, and (3) enzymatic - using the live organisms Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Spectral analysis was used to determine how effective each of these methods were in decomposing bituminous coal. After analysis of the results and other considerations, such as cost and environmental impacts, it was determined that the enzymatic approaches, as opposed to the chemical approaches using chelators, were more effective in decomposing coal. The results from the laccase/MnP experiments and Phanerochaete chrysosporium experiments are presented and compared in this final report. Spectra from both enzymatic methods show absorption peaks in the 240 nm to 300 nm region. These peaks correspond to aromatic intermediates formed when breaking down the coal structure. The peaks then decrease in absorbance over time, corresponding to the consumption of aromatic intermediates as they undergo ring cleavage. The results show that this process happens within 1 hour when using extracellular enzymes, but takes several days when using live organisms. In addition, live organisms require specific culture conditions, control of contaminants and fungicides in order to effectively produce extracellular enzymes that degrade coal. Therefore, when comparing the two enzymatic methods, results show that the process of using extracellular lignin degrading enzymes, such as laccase and manganese peroxidase, appears to be a more efficient method of decomposing bituminous coal...|$|E
