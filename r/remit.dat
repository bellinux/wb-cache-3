40|$|Social science discourses on {{migration}} and development emphasize migrants' altruism or self-interest as {{the determinants of}} their <b>remitting</b> practices, which is countered by alternative explanations focusing on social culture and structure. Due to the dichotomy of structure/agency, the current approaches offer unsatisfactory explanations of migrants' <b>remitting</b> practices. This dissertation aims to proposes a corrective by developing an alternative model of understanding the determinants of migrants' <b>remitting</b> practices. It synthesizes three strands of social science literature and derive the conception of <b>remitting</b> as a collective social act. From a realist approach following Durkheim, it begins at the empirical manifestations of migrants' <b>remitting</b> practices, but looks at deeper levels of social reality (the actual and the real) in identifying the determinants. It focuses on the internal social relations between the individuals involved in the acts in question {{as well as the}} external relations between the individuals and their social world to recognize the determinants of acts. Thus, it adopts a mixed-methods approach involving ethnographic fieldworks supplemented by small-scale survey with convenient samples. Following the theoretical case selection strategy of global ethnography, it investigates <b>remitting</b> practices among Bangladeshi migrants in Tokyo and Los Angeles. Holding the origin of the migrants constant allows for isolating the role of their different destinations in determining their <b>remitting</b> practices. This dissertation recognizes social norms in origin culture, advances in family life-cycle, legal status and social incorporation and/or marginalization in the destination as the determinants of migrants' <b>remitting</b> practices. While confirming the centrality of migrant family in <b>remitting</b> practices in the NELM perspective, it goes beyond by including how internal family relations and external social relations collectively determine migrants' <b>remitting.</b> It advances our knowledge of migrants' <b>remitting</b> by incorporating both migrants' agency and social structures embedding <b>remitting</b> practices. Besides generating satisfactory explanations of migrants' <b>remitting,</b> this study demonstrates how to combine agency and structure in migration studies in particular and sociology in general. It also offers valuable insights for development policy-making utilizing migrants' remittances in their origin communities. It concludes with a call for extending the scope of the study by extensive and systematic use of quantitative data on the general patterns of <b>remitting</b> and to include familiar destination countries of temporary migration in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Remittances "the money {{immigrants}} send {{to family}} members in their country of origin" are now centre stage in development and immigrant research. Yet, {{in spite of this}} interest, research on the characteristics of remittance senders in Canada remains quite limited, {{in large part because of}} the absence of household survey data. More broadly, studies of remittance senders in Canada and elsewhere often focus on immigrants from only one or two source countries and, consequently, do not provide a broad cross-national perspective on the issue. This study addresses these gaps by using the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada to document the incidence of <b>remitting</b> and the amounts <b>remitted</b> by immigrants from a wide range of countries. Using a common set of concepts and methods, we find that the incidence of <b>remitting</b> by the 2000 to 2001 landing cohort ranges from less than 10 % to 60 % across immigrants from different countries, while the average annual amounts <b>remitted</b> range from about $ 500 to almost $ 3, 000. Turning to the factors associated with <b>remitting,</b> the financial and family characteristics are consistently significant among immigrants from all world regions. In contrast, other factors, such as gender and education, are associated with <b>remitting</b> among immigrants from some regions but not from others.
