He was the first head of Solidarity for LGBT Huamn Rights of Korea (http://www.lgbtpride.or.kr/) from 1998 to 2002. From 2004 to 2005, he was imprisoned for his conscientious objection to the military service of the <b>Rep.</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> which classifies homosexuality {{as a type of}} mental disorder and criminalizes consented homosexual intercourse by Article 92 of Military Criminal Act.

Then in 2009 finally he established the Center for Military Human Rights Korea(CMHRK, www.mhrk.org); he is a current representative. CMHRK focuses on counseling victims of human rights infringement cases within the military including sexual violence, bullying and beating.

It is {{developed}} by the Korea Aerospace research Institute (KARI) for {{the government of the}} Republic of Korea, and Thales Alenia Space is the industry prime contractor of this development. The function of the KASS is to decompose all possible range error sources and to distribute corrections and/or alerts to its users by means of geostationary satellites. The KASS Processing Station (KPS) is the component of KASS in charge of computing the orbit, clock and ionosphere correction and alert information (below ‘Navigation Overlay Frame’, NOF) using data from a set of reference stations. The KPS is composed of two independent elements: the Processing Set (PS) and the Check Set (CS). The first element is responsible of computing the complete navigation context for the GNSS constellation (orbits and clock) and the ionosphere model, then to prepare and send the NOF to be broadcast to the users. The second element acts as a super user by applying the NOF to the GPS messages checking that this is consistent with an independent set of measurement to control and insure the integrity. The KPS-PS component {{plays a key role in}} the KASS performance achievement where the APV- 1 service level is required. To feed the KPS, the KASS has specific KASS Reference Station (KRS) located on the <b>Rep.</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> land masses. Compared to other SBAS, this leads to a very concentrated station network. This particularity makes a specific algorithm adaptation of the KPS-PS necessary, as compared to the EGNOS solution, to provide the desired APV- 1 performance. These adaptations regard both orbit determination and all the more ionosphere corrections due to the very low number of Ionosphere Grid Points (IPG) that need be modeled and monitored. To cope with these KASS specificities, Thales Alenia Space has designed, developed and qualified a new complete real time navigation algorithm chain that provides MOPS-compliant NOF messages. The ionosphere model is different from the EGNOS one that favors a local analysis counter to a global approach as the TRIN model [2] used in EGNOS. This new algorithm chain provides the specified APV- 1 performance, particularly in the case of strong ionosphere activity, with a very good level of integrity margin. This paper presents the overall KASS system architecture as well as the results obtained using this new algorithm chain under different ionosphere contexts. The APV- 1 service availability level is presented and the maximum of safety index on each monitored IGP and satellite is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Articulo de publicación ISIMammographic density (MD) is a {{quantitative}} trait, measurable in all women, and {{is among the}} strongest markers of breast cancer risk. The population-based epidemiology of MD has revealed genetic, lifestyle and societal/environmental determinants, but studies have largely been conducted in women with similar westernized lifestyles living in countries with high breast cancer incidence rates. To benefit from the heterogeneity in risk factors and their combinations worldwide, we created an International Consortium on Mammographic Density (ICMD) to pool individual-level epidemiological and MD data from general population studies worldwide. ICMD aims to characterize determinants of MD more precisely, and to evaluate whether they are consistent across populations worldwide. We included 11755 women, from 27 studies in 22 countries, on whom individual-level risk factor data were pooled and original mammographic images were re-read for ICMD to obtain standardized comparable MD data. In the present article, we present (i) the rationale for this consortium; (ii) characteristics of the studies and women included; and (iii) study methodology to obtain comparable MD data from original re-read films. We also highlight the risk factor heterogeneity captured by such an effort and, thus, the unique insight the pooled study promises to offer through wider exposure ranges, different confounding structures and enhanced power for sub-group analyses.

40|$|In SOFC stacks the {{electrical}} {{contact between the}} ceramic cathode layer and the metallic interconnector (IC) has to be adjusted carefully to minimize the contact resistance and slow down degradation mechanisms. In JÜLICH, ICs made of Crofer 22 APU or Crofer 22 H are coated with a MnCo 1. 9 Fe 0. 1 O 2 spinel (MCF) applied by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS), which prevents the diffusion of volatile Cr species from the steel into the cell. Materials for the cathode contact layer have to be sufficiently good electronic conductors, stable in oxidizing atmosphere, chemically stable and compatible with the adjacent layers, and show a thermal expansion behavior similar to MCF and the cathode material, i. e. La 0. 58 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -x (LSCF). Perovskites of La and Co, doped with Fe, Mn, or Cu on the B-site have been applied by wet powder spraying (WPS) onto the pre-coated IC. These compounds offer a good electrical conductivity and an appropriate thermal expansion but, depending on the composition, they may form several phases instead of a stable single phase. [1] Alternatively, LSCF {{can also be used}} for cathode contacting and first tests show promising results with better stack performances than the previously mentioned compounds. Although the thermal expansion coefficient of LSCF is quite large compared to those of MCF and the IC material, the ability for thermal cycles is given. Furthermore, no problems arising from chemical reactions or interdiffusion are expected when the contact layer is made of the same material as the cathode. As an alternative to WPS, the contact layer is screen printed onto the cell. At present, the full cathode is being covered although the contact layer is required only between the IC ribs and the cell. Applying the contact layer as stripes could reduce the amount of material needed {{and at the same time}} improve the gas supply from the interconnect channels to the active sites for reduction in the cathode since the gas transport may be the performance limiting factor at the cathode side. [2]A different possibility for contacting the cathode is to use metal foam sheets that are very easy to handle. Two metal foams (CoNi and CuMn, provided by Alantum, <b>Rep.</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea)</b> have been examined regarding their electrical and mechanical properties at high temperatures to evaluate the suitability for SOFC stacks.
