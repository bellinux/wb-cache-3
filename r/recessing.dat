25|$|Related to the router is a smaller, lighter version {{designed}} specifically for trimming laminates. It {{can be used for}} smaller general routing work. For example, with an appropriate jig it can be used for <b>recessing</b> door hinges and <b>recessing</b> lock faceplates.

25|$|The initial design set the {{supporting}} columns {{back from the}} façade but expressed them externally by <b>recessing</b> some of the storeys. This created horizontal bands on the façade that were aligned with the terracotta ornament on the Albert Hall. The Planning Authority had asked for the entrance the new building to face the Albert Hall to reduce traffic problems on Kensington Gore and this suited Cadbury-Brown as it meant that the College could appropriate this space as an entrance courtyard.|$|E
25|$|On {{entering}} this small and unassuming building, the unexpected {{glory of the}} interior for the visitor is the scissor-truss roof, which {{after more than a}} century retains rare stencil paintings by Powell Bros of Leeds on the chancel beams. Beneath the paint on the plastered north and south walls of the nave are hidden stencil paintings and possibly spirit frescoes by the same artists, revealed in a pre–1914 photograph in the church archives. Although this building is too simple to permit a gallery of columns and bays, Barber has still managed to include a few small columns by <b>recessing</b> the three-light nave windows into the wall, and fitting a single slender supporting column into each recess.|$|E
500|$|Nordby {{said most}} of the {{attention}} was devoted to Jennifer's face and that [...] "very quickly in combination" [...] with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and <b>recessing</b> her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the closure of the LVR the bay {{platform}} on the north side at the western end of the station was no longer needed and the track was removed. The bay on the south side remained in use into the 1970s for <b>recessing</b> local trains to Bedwyn until a [...] "down" [...] express had passed. The south bay was later removed when the station was resignalled and the track layout altered to allow down expresses to serve the north side platform. Both west end bays are now car parks. The sole east end bay {{on the north side of}} the line is maintained for use for eastbound passenger services starting at Newbury.

50|$|After <b>recessing</b> the court, the Judge {{announces that}} Reverend Brown {{will hold a}} prayer meeting later that night. Drummond says that such {{announcements}} from the bench are prejudicial, but the Judge says the court has recessed.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is designed {{in a dramatic}} ziggurat style, <b>recessing</b> the top from the street. The building consists of two stepped wings, set {{at right angles to}} each other, with corner flats featuring bay window balconies.|$|E
50|$|Ross House {{also shows}} early design {{responses}} {{to the need for}} fire prevention in multi-storey buildings, such as the sprinkler system and fireproof doors. The <b>recessing</b> of the oriel windows was a fire-prevention measure adopted from England.|$|E
50|$|The {{windows on}} all facades are {{similarly}} shaped and decorated. Small brick corbels between the window openings suggest brick piers with denticulated capitals, and the <b>recessing</b> and arching {{of the windows}} combines with this to suggest an arcade.|$|E
50|$|This {{is located}} between Ipswich and East Suffolk Junction {{on the east}} side of the line. The yard is still active (as of 2013) with Freightliner (container) trains <b>recessing</b> or running round before running to/from the docks at Felixstowe.|$|E
50|$|Due to the <b>recessing</b> of {{the active}} site inside the enzyme, the substrate, once bound, is almost {{completely}} sequestered from solvent. The surface exposure of the substrate to solvent when bound is 0.5% the surface exposure of the substrate in the free state.|$|E
50|$|The {{custom of}} <b>recessing</b> {{them in the}} {{thickness}} of the wall began {{about the end of the}} 12th century; some early examples consist only of stone benches, and there is one instance of a single seat or arm-chair in stone at Lenham in Kent.|$|E

Classes are 8:20 to 17:10 Monday to Friday, 8:20 to 11:30 Saturday (odd-weekly). Weekday mandatory self-study is 18:00-21:00 following the 17:10-18:00 dinner break.|$|E
50|$|The Standing Liberty {{quarter was}} minted from 1916 to 1930. In 1917, the obverse was altered to cover Liberty's exposed breast. The {{arrangement}} of {{stars on the}} reverse was also changed. In 1925, the design was modified again, this time <b>recessing</b> the date {{in order to increase}} resistance from wear.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1995, {{founding}} member Mark Olson abruptly left The Jayhawks, {{in order to}} spend more time with wife Victoria Williams. [...] With Gary Louris assuming principal singing and songwriting responsibilities, the band released three further albums—Sound of Lies in 1997, Smile in 1999, and Rainy Day Music in 2003—before <b>recessing</b> indefinitely.|$|E

50|$|Frenching is {{the act of}} <b>recessing</b> or {{moulding}} a headlight, taillight, antenna {{or number}} plate into a car body to give a smoother look to the vehicle. The name originates from the end result looking like a French cuff of a shirt sleeve, which has a ridge at the end. Also known as tunnelling, {{it is a common}} modification used on leadsleds and customs since the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|The two-story Quattrocento cloister {{remained}} unchanged {{by the addition}} of the library. Because of this, certain features of Michelangelo’s plan, such as length and width, were already determined. Therefore, new walls were built on pre-existing walls and cloisters. Because the walls were built on pre-existing walls, <b>recessing</b> the columns into the walls was a structural necessity. This led to a unique style and pattern that Michelangelo took advantage of.|$|E
50|$|The {{articulation}} of the brickwork and set out of openings reflects classical proportions of columns, spandrels, balustrades and entablatures. The facades are stepped, both horizontally in the projecting and <b>recessing</b> of facade bays, as well as vertically in the parapet. The brickwork is laid in a version of Flemish bond, with two stretchers and one header alternating in each course. Darker bricks emphasise string courses, opening lintels and sills, and the parapet capping.|$|E
50|$|This is done {{by cutting}} an area of sheet metal {{the shape of a}} number plate (for example), {{fabricating}} a box and welding it deeper into the body. The same principle is used in <b>recessing</b> car radio antennas, only that a hole must be drilled {{into the bottom of the}} tubing to let water drain out, reducing the risk of corrosion. This modification is still used on minitrucks, leadsleds and customized cars to this day.|$|E

50|$|Distribution boards may be surface-mounted or flush. The former {{arrangement}} provides easier alteration or {{addition to}} wiring {{at a later}} date, but the latter arrangement might be neater, particularly for a residential application. The other problem with <b>recessing</b> a distribution board into a wall {{is that if the}} wall is solid, a lot of brick or block might need to be removed—generally for this reason, recessed boards would only be installed on new-build projects when the required space can be built into the wall.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920, the {{building}} was constructed by Henry Kahl and Walsh-Kahl Construction for $1.5 million. [...] It is composed of steel frame construction with stone and decorative terra cotta facing materials. The building's sense of height is highlighted by <b>recessing</b> the spandrel panels between the floors and behind the vertical piers. [...] It is considered an [...] "exceptional example {{of the influence of}} the Chicago School on commercial architecture." [...] Historically, {{the building}} has contained 184 office suites, several retail shops, a restaurant and the Capital Theater.|$|E
50|$|Romans, {{being the}} successors of the Greeks, enjoyed {{an even greater}} boom to their economy. Granted {{a lot of their}} success was due to their unbeatable {{production}} of iron as well as the development of trade routes i.e. Pax Romana. They ruled with a mixture of kingship, aristocracy and democracy. Despite their accomplishments from the reformed political structure, the need to invest in the military to keep their growing competition at bay, by producing less and less valuable coins, ultimately led to their collapse, <b>recessing</b> back to the country side and barter system.|$|E
50|$|Technological {{change was}} fast paced {{in the years}} {{following}} the introduction of the Standard Class. The transition to fibreglass construction made the existing rules increasingly awkward. The stronger composite structures allowed higher wing loadings, and competitors resorted to fixed ballast to exploit this competitive advantage, which of course increased landing speeds and the risk of damage when alighting in unprepared fields. The fixed undercarriages caused a major fraction of the drag of sleek fibreglass airframes. Designers reacted by <b>recessing</b> the wheels into the fuselage, which further increased the risk of ground-related damage. Manufacturers took to arguing that the single cheapest way to increase performance was to retract the wheel.|$|E

50|$|On {{the south}} facade, {{the only other}} {{original}} one remaining exposed, the fenestration retains {{many of the same}} treatments, but with deeper <b>recessing.</b> A secondary entrance near the east corner has two paneled wooden doors with a crosetted upper light and blind transom. To its west, two barred windows open into the basement as the driveway rises toward the former loading dock {{at the end of the}} block. The water table continues, supported by brackets at the base of the two largest first-story windows, set with narrow four-light casement in the same surrounds as their counterparts on the east. A single narrow casement window is to the west, followed by a dropped single-pane transomed casement window.|$|E
50|$|Since 1970, when Congress has {{recessed}} {{before a}} lame duck session, {{the beginning of the}} recess has most often occurred in early to mid-October. The latest that Congress has ever continued to meet before <b>recessing</b> for an election was in 2000 (106th Congress), when the Senate left on November 2 and the House on November 3. Prior to 1970, by contrast, each of the four election recesses preceding {{a lame duck}} session began in September or August. The earliest start of an election recess was August 7, 1948 (80th Congress). In this case, Congress had recessed its regular session on June 20, scheduling itself to reconvene on December 31, but President Truman had called Congress back into extraordinary session on July 26.|$|E
