Five stream <b>reach</b> pairs, each consisting of an undisturbed <b>reach</b> and a similar <b>reach</b> flowing through {{an area where the}} riparian zone had been logged, along with six additional undisturbed <b>reaches</b> were studied. The riparian stand, large woody debris, stream channel morphology and the benthic macroinvertebrate community were measured at each <b>reach.</b> Large woody debris volume ranged from 91. 1 to 284. 0 m³/ha and was greater in the logged <b>reaches</b> than undisturbed <b>reaches.</b> Stream channel morphology, as indicated by the pool-riffle ratio, in the logged <b>reaches</b> was not significantly different than undisturbed <b>reaches</b> and percent pool area was less than 30 percent in all <b>reaches.</b> Macroinvertebrate density ranged from 146. 6 to 963. 2 individuals/sample and was greater in the logged <b>reach</b> of each stream pair.

40|$|This thesis investigates how adults, infants, and {{children}} use visual information to control <b>reaching</b> movements. To do this, the kinematics of a <b>reaching</b> movement were recorded using a 6 camera motion tracking system. Adult <b>reaching</b> movements were investigated {{in three different}} experiments. The first experiment looked at the effect of visual information about the <b>reach</b> space and the target on <b>reaching</b> movements. Adult <b>reaches</b> are significantly affected by removal of visual information about the <b>reach</b> space and the target, e. g. peak speed decreases as distance information is occluded. Adult <b>reaching</b> movements are also affected by {{the length of the}} delay between viewing an object and then <b>reaching</b> for it in complete darkness. Experiment 2 reveals that there is a linear increase in movement duration, decrease in peak speed, and increase in maximum grip aperture with increasing temporal delay. This is due to the decay of dorsal visual information. Experiment 3 found that a cautious <b>reaching</b> movement can be defined as a <b>reach</b> where duration increases, average speed decreases, and peak timing is proportionally earlier in the <b>reach.</b> The three developmental experiments investigated the changes in <b>reaching</b> in infancy, in typically developing 5 -year-old children, and in children with Williams syndrome (WS). Between 9 and 16 months of age, infants develop better coordination of <b>reaching</b> movements. Improved dark <b>reaching</b> behaviour in 16 -month-olds may be associated with more mature processing in the dorsal visual stream. <b>Reaching</b> movements in 5 -year-old children are straighter and faster than infant <b>reaches</b> but behaviour is not yet stereotyped like adults. WS children generate <b>reaches</b> that are slower and incorporate more movement units than 5 -year-old children, and WS behaviour may reflect poor processing of dorsal visual information rather than poor control of arm movement.
