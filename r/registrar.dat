5|$|By September 3, 2009, {{attorneys}} representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, {{had requested}} that the domain <b>registrar</b> of Eiland-Hall's website delete the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that the domain <b>registrar</b> revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection service for the website, and turn over contact information for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. The <b>registrar,</b> NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain <b>registrar,</b> repeating their requests and noting that they had read the website's contents and were therefore aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by the <b>registrar.</b>|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} <b>Registrar</b> had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the <b>Registrar</b> had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the <b>Registrar</b> had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the <b>Registrar</b> by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the <b>Registrar</b> had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for the <b>Registrar</b> to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E
5|$|Their {{second letter}} to NameCheap {{observed}} that the site was still operational on September 4, 2009, {{in spite of their}} prior requests on behalf of Beck. The domain <b>registrar</b> changed the name server of the website without telling Eiland-Hall; after contacting the <b>registrar,</b> he was permitted to return to his original name server. In an interview with Gawker on September 9, 2009, Eiland-Hall remarked that Beck's attorneys contacted the <b>registrar</b> of the domain, his hosting provider, as well as the company which housed the servers for his website. He noted that the hosting provider informed him they would not cooperate with the requests from Beck's lawyers unless they received a court order.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is concern}} about the {{educational}} impact and possible stress on <b>registrars</b> of new out-of-hours co-operatives. AIM: To compare the confidence in managing out-of-hours problems of <b>registrars</b> in traditional on-call rotas and co-operatives with that of their trainers. To determine how frequently <b>registrars</b> discussed problems out-of-hours with their trainers, and to compare the referral pattern of <b>registrars</b> with their trainers out-of-hours. METHOD: Analysis of log diaries of out-of-hours experiences kept by <b>registrars</b> and trainers over two, two-month periods in winter and summer. RESULTS: Thirty <b>registrars</b> (out of a possible 51) and 34 (out of a possible 52) trainers {{took part in the}} winter, and 18 <b>registrars</b> and 29 trainers in the summer. <b>Registrars</b> were confident in their management, and their confidence increased over the year (59 % versus 72 % difference = 12 %, 95 % CI = 6 % to 20 % for very confident). <b>Registrars</b> varied in their discussion of problems with trainers. When 'a little worried' they discussed their management 30 out of 53 times (57 %); if 'very confident', 36 out of 576 times (6 %). <b>Registrars</b> during the summer segment of the study referred more frequently to hospital than trainers (20 % versus 10 % difference = 10 %, 95 % CI = 3 % to 17 %. <b>Registrars</b> in traditional rotas recorded a slightly higher but statistically insignificant level of confidence in their management of problems than those <b>registrars</b> in cooperatives. CONCLUSIONS: While many <b>registrars</b> are confident in their work and are using their trainer for information appropriately, some are not. <b>Registrars</b> may be referring to hospital at a much higher rate than their trainers. More research is required to confirm and further explore these findings...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVEAppendicectomy is a {{very common}} {{surgical}} procedure performed by <b>registrars.</b> It is mainly carried out by surgical <b>registrars</b> as an open procedure in many government hospitals. We aimed to evaluate laparoscopic appendicectomy as a laparoscopic training skill in a clinical setting for our <b>registrars.</b> METHODSA retrospective analysis of all attempted laparoscopic appendicectomies over 12 months by experienced surgeons and <b>registrars</b> was done. Factors evaluated were operating time, conversion rate, postoperative hospital stay, morbidity and mortality. RESULTSThere was {{no statistically significant difference}} in operating time for surgeons and <b>registrars</b> (mean, 53 minutes vs. 60 minutes), conversion rate (10 % vs. 11 %). Mean hospital stay for patients operated on by surgeons was 3. 1 days and 3. 2 days for <b>registrars.</b> Morbidity was equal with both surgeons and <b>registrars.</b> CONCLUSIONWe conclude that laparoscopic appendicectomy is a safe laparoscopic training tool for <b>registrars</b> with basic laparoscopic knowledge who have had a proper apprenticeship, and can be done in a clinical setting...|$|R

5|$|Registration {{takes place}} through a third party, a domain name <b>registrar.</b> The {{relationship}} between Norid, the <b>registrar</b> and the holder is regulated through civil legal agreements. The <b>registrar</b> registers the domain {{on behalf of}} the holder, and the holder then holds the right to the domain name until it is terminated, unless a dispute resolution dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per registration and change of holder, as well as NOK60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK5,000 and a deposit of minimum NOK10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND. <b>Registrars</b> play a {{vital role}} in {{teaching}} undergraduate (UG) medical students. Previous studies indicate that <b>registrars</b> contribute as much as 30 % of medical students’ knowledge and that up to 20 % of a <b>registrar’s</b> time is spent on teaching UG medical students. The Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) Guide No. 20 defines 12 roles of a teacher, including an on-the-job role-model. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the perception and attitudes of <b>registrars</b> with regard to their role as teachers of UG medical students. METHODS. A questionnaire-based study with qualitative and quantitative aspects was conducted at the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, South Africa. RESULTS. Despite numerous attempts, the response rate to the study was very poor, with only 25 <b>registrars</b> participating. This pilot study indicated that <b>registrars</b> were mostly involved with on-the-job training, followed by ward rounds and practical sessions. The attitudes towards teaching included that <b>registrars</b> deemed teaching as beneficial, with only three indicating that it should not be done by <b>registrars.</b> Advantages of teaching included own learning opportunities and gaining confidence in teaching. Registrars’ own workload and lack of time hampered teaching. The majority of <b>registrars</b> indicated that receiving training with regard to teaching would be useful. CONCLUSION. Our pilot study concurs with international studies, indicating that the benefits of teaching medical students include knowledge acquired by <b>registrars.</b> Studies showed that the knowledge obtained in this manner outweighed that obtained by self-study/attendance of lectures. The on-the-job role-model as part of teaching is applicable to <b>registrars.</b> The international literature indicates that until recently <b>registrars</b> were not offered a formal teaching programme. Our study echoed this, with only one student indicating that it is not necessary, as <b>registrars</b> should not be expected to teach. [URL] InnovationForensic Medicin...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} hours worked by general {{surgical}} <b>registrars</b> in Europe and the USA has been reduced so as to reduce fatigue {{and the possibility of}} errors. The impact of these restrictions on surgical training remains unresolved. To date there are no officially reported data on the {{number of hours}} worked by <b>registrars</b> in South Africa. The aim {{of this study was to}} document the hours worked by <b>registrars</b> in general surgery in Cape Town. Thirty-three general surgical <b>registrars</b> at the University of Cape Town were asked to complete a time sheet over a 2 -week period, indicating hours spent in hospital as part of a normal working day, hours spent in hospital outside of a normal day, hours at home on ‘cold call’ and hours off duty. Of the 33 <b>registrars,</b> 25 completed the time sheet. <b>Registrars</b> at Groote Schuur Hospital worked an average of 105 hours per week (68 hours in hospital and 37 hours on call at home). <b>Registrars</b> at New Somerset Hospital worked 79 hours per week (70 hours on site), while <b>registrars</b> at Red Cross Children’s Hospital, G. F. Jooste Hospital and the Trauma Unit worked 60 - 69 hours per week. In the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) <b>registrars</b> worked 75 hours per week. In conclusion, general surgical <b>registrars</b> at the University of Cape Town work hours in excess of European and American work-hour restrictions...|$|R

5|$|<b>Registrar</b> Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam) shirks his {{responsibilities}} by excessively delegating to Oliver; to his dismay, Connie appoints him as Oliver's mentor. Oliver pushes himself {{too far in}} an attempt to impress Greg, which earns the senior doctor a reprimand for leaving him unsupervised. Oliver tries to earn back Greg's respect, but panics while attempting to insert a chest drain, and has to be rescued by ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). He invites her for a drink as thanks, but when Penny discovers that Frieda has romantic feelings for him, Oliver cancels as he does not reciprocate them. Oliver's confidence is further damaged when he mishandles a case, which results in a mother leaving her son to die alone. He moves back to the AAU, where he is shaken by an encounter with the boy's mother, which causes him to panic and embarrass himself in theatre. Penny's career begins to improve, and Oliver resents her when she is given <b>registrar</b> duties for a shift. Having realised that he is close to failing his F2 year, Oliver implicates Penny in a serious surgical error of his own doing, but is caught by <b>registrar</b> Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola).|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} and explore behavioural characteristics of <b>registrars</b> that interns find helpful in their working relationships and workplace learning. Design, setting and participants: Semistructured interviews with 18 interns at Nepean Hospital, Penrith, NSW, {{at the end}} of their first working year as doctors. The survey was conducted between December 2003 and February 2004. Main outcome measure: Desirable and undesirable behavioural characteristics in <b>registrars,</b> as reported by interns. Results: Overall, interns' opinions of <b>registrars</b> were positive. Desirable characteristics in <b>registrars</b> included approachability, availability, good communication skills, and a willingness to teach. Undesirable characteristics included an unwillingness to listen, unreasonably high expectations, a condescending attitude, apathy and rudeness. Conclusion: The behavioural characteristics of <b>registrars</b> that interns find helpful are identifiable, and there is significant room for improvement in the quality of clinical mentoring by <b>registrars.</b> The next step is to facilitate regular feedback from interns on registrars' performance, and to develop ways to encourage desirable behaviours in <b>registrars</b> while actively discouraging undesirable behaviours. 3 page(s...|$|R

5|$|The list {{of former}} Registrars {{published}} by the university in the 19th century begins with John London, who died in 1508. Records show {{that there were people}} before London carrying out similar tasks in the 15th century, and the university regards the role as having a 550-year history. There is a record of a resolution by the university, of uncertain date in the 15th century, that a <b>registrar</b> or scribe should be appointed to draft letters, record the university's public acts, copy its documents, and record the names of graduates. The position carried an annual salary of four marks (£2 13 shillings and 4 pence); fees had to be paid to the <b>Registrar</b> by individuals obtaining their degrees or recording other permissions granted by the university. In 1448, a John Manyngham signed a letter for the university, and was permitted in 1451 to have a scholar make transcripts in the university's library; one historian of the university says that Manyngham may have been Oxford's first <b>Registrar.</b> John Farley, who signed his name in Greek letters as a sign of his erudition, carried out the duties from 1458 to 1464.|$|E
