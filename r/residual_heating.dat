The atoms are confined in a quadrupole magnetic trap and are dressed by a linearly polarized rf field.

The final temperature results from a competition between <b>residual</b> <b>heating</b> and evaporation efficiency, which is controlled via the height of the holes with respect {{to the bottom of the}} trap. The experimental data are modeled by a Monte-Carlo simulation predicting a small increase in phase space density limited by the heating rate.

40|$|Purpose of this {{experiment}} was {{to select the}} best material {{for the construction of}} thermal links aiming at cooling down sensitive masses of the order of 100 - 1000 kg for the detection of rare decays and gravitational waves. We report on the technique used to measure the thermal conductivity at very low temperatures (down to 30 mK) of three different types of copper, before and after a thermal treatment of the samples. The most conductive copper was used for the thermal link of the CUORICINO experiment, where a mass of about 60 kg needs to be cooled down to a few mK. The cool down time was reduced by at least one order of magnitude with respect to previous similar experiments. An important contribution to this successful result came also from an improved procedure for controlling the <b>residual</b> <b>heating</b> provided by the conversion from ortho- to para-hydrogen in copper.

Three-interknited natural circulation loops are adopted by this PRHRS to remove the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> of the reactor core after a reactor trip. Based on the one-dimensional model and a simulation code (SCPRHRS), the transient behaviors of the PRHRS as well as the effects of the height difference between the steam generator and the heat exchanger and the heat transfer area of the heat exchanger are studied in detail. Through the calculation analysis, it is found that the calculated parameter variation trends are reasonable. The higher height difference between the steam generator and the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger and the larger heat transfer area of the <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger are favorable to the passive <b>residual</b> <b>heat</b> removal system.

40|$|International audienceIn the nightside subauroral region, heat {{transfer}} from the ring current causes {{a significant increase}} in the electron temperature of the upper ionosphere. Using DE- 2 satellite data, we investigate the properties of this remarkable feature. We find that the location of the temperature enhancement is primarily dependent on the level of geomagnetic activity. For geomagnetically quiet conditions () the temperature peak is located slightly poleward of 60 ° invariant latitude. For each decrease in the Dst index by 10 nT, it moves equatorward by about one degree. To a lesser degree, the location of the heating effect also depends on magnetic local time, with a significant positional asymmetry about midnight. The magnitude of the temperature enhancement varies with altitude. Within the height range 280 to 940 km, the peak temperature increases by 73 %, on average. Thereby a conspicuous increase in the temperature gradient is observed above about 700 km altitude. The magnitude of the heating effect also depends on the level of geomagnetic activity. For a decrease in the Dst index by 100 nT, the peak temperature increases by 46 %, on average. This rate of increase, however, depends on season and is significantly smaller during winter conditions. A superposed epoch type of averaging procedure is used to obtain mean latitudinal profiles of the temperature enhancement. For an altitude of 500 km, the following mean properties are derived: amplitude K; width at half this peak value deg; distance between equatorward boundary and maximum deg. On average, a decrease in the electron density is observed at the location of the temperature enhancement, at least at 500 km altitude. At the same time, a moderate increase in the zonal ion drift speed is recorded at this location. During larger geomagnetic storms, the latitudinal profile of the temperature enhancement assumes a more step-function-like shape, with a broad increase in electron temperature poleward from the equatorial edge of the electron temperature enhancement. Also the heating effects may extend to very low latitudes (less than 35 ° invariant latitude). And <b>residual</b> <b>heating</b> effects are observed long after the storm-substorm activity has ceased. The results obtained in this study should prove useful for both empirical and theoretical modeling of the nightside subauroral ionosphere...|$|E

The gas gap width between the thimble and the bayonet has a large effect on the heat transfer rate.
