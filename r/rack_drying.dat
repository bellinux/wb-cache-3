40|$|Raisin {{production}} and export {{is an important}} business in Turkey. In this research V. vinifera L. cv. “Sultanina” was dried in polythene tunnel type rack systems solar drier and in direct sunlight (traditional drying method). The inside temperature of the tunnel has been increased by adding solar panels to the drying tunnel. The cluster of grapes was dipped in four different alkali solution (dipping solution); such as 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, and 5 % of sodium hydroxide + 1 % olive oil. Each application was two replicates and at each repetition to be 2  kg/m 2 grapes. After dipping grapes {{were placed on the}} <b>rack.</b> <b>Drying</b> process were continued until 14 % humidity. In the study drying period of the grapes, drying ratio, % moisture, % total soluble solids content, 100 berry weight, berry surface color (CIE, L, a, b), alcohol-soluble color values were measured. Drying period of grapes in the solar drying tunnel is faster than direct sunlight. Solar tunnel drying was found to be satisfactory and competitive to traditional drying method. The color of grapes dried in the sun drying tunnel not seen a negative change. Provision of solar dryers in drying, air distribution and heat conservation is to make a positive impact on the drying process and capacity. The most important advantage of the dried product in the tunnel type solar drier is protected raisins from external environment. The main factor in the drying process is to obtain minimum energy consumption of the product with the desired quality and reach a maximum speed of drying. The results obtained from this research are used in practice compliance...|$|E

5000|$|Stainless steel {{laboratory}} <b>drying</b> <b>rack,</b> {{which is}} also known as a 'Mod-Rack' pegboard, is the <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> made of stainless steel that uses to drain laboratory accessories. The examples of stainless steel laboratory <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> are flask holders, soap dispensers, paper towel dispensers, glove box holders, drain shelves. [...] Stainless steel pegboard installation is very easy and quick to set up with basic hand equipment's, and it does not damage the wall as mounting brackets and hardware are being used.|$|R
50|$|Epoxy {{laboratory}} <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> are {{the most}} common type of <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> that are used among university labs and science classrooms in many high schools. Epoxy <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> are mounted directly to a wall or other solid structures which can be set up with basic hand tools and power tools. They are easily installed by using wall anchors and other strong fasteners due to their small weight. Typical installation is to drill holes, one at each corner, and to use the mounting points in order to fix it to the wall.|$|R

40|$|Monitoring {{continued}} on weight changes in marble and limestone briquettes {{exposed to the}} outdoor environment at sites in the eastern US. This report presents data for the exposure period 1988 - 1992 and summarizes results for the entire period from 1984. Since 1989, only three exposure sites have remained active, but briquettes from pre-exposed material were added at those sites. A linear relationship was found between cumulative gravimetric losses and exposure period. These losses resulted in an average recession rate of 11 to 21 micrometers/yr for marble and 21 to 45 micrometers/yr for limestone. The recession rates are site-dependent and can be described with respect to rain depth and other atmospheric conditions, {{as evidenced by the}} very low rates at the Ohio site on the movable <b>rack,</b> <b>dry</b> regime. Weight monitoring is continuing in a planned 10 -year program...|$|R
