40|$|Abstract [...] Waste {{concrete}} aggregate (WCA) refers to aggregates {{that have been}} used previously in cement concrete structures. After many research it had been concluded that WCA can be used in <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete.</b> In <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> mix, there is a wide scope for varying the gradation of aggregate to obtain a good mix without affecting the durability of pavement. <b>Bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> mixes with WCA in accordance with different gradations were studied. Behavior of <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> mixes with WCA is also investigated with two different compactive energy, one for medium traffic and another for heavy traffic. The research program concentrated on the Marshall design criteria for bituminous mixes. A dense grading with 25 mm maximum size is found to give the most satisfactory result from the stand point of stability, stiffness, deformation and voids characteristics. Test results reveal that the <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> with WCA can give satisfactory results when they are constructed using dense gradation and medium compaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{rates of}} energy that moving {{vehicles}} dissipate to road surfaces as well as noise emissions and their propensities for pitting (and hence their repair costs per year) all depend upon the structural properties of these surfaces. Thus, to increase the strength of <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> (i. e. a typical flexible road-surface) {{has been one of}} the major recent aims in highway engineering. The present study explored techniques that will increase these strength properties by modifying the material, using rubber latex, through rubberization and hence, improve the strength of the flexible trafficked surface when in contact with vehicles. At the optimal design asphalt (i. e. bitumen) content of 4. 68 %, the successive addition of various percentages of the rubber latex produced a design value of 1. 65 % rubber content, which increased the stability of the roadway from 1595 to 2639 Â N (i. e. an 65. 5 % increase) and the density from 2447 to 2520. 8 Â kg/m 3 (i. e. a 3. 02 % increase). This shows that the addition of rubber latex to <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> (a flexible road-surface) increased sustainability and the strength (in terms of stability and density).

40|$|Approximately 400 {{kilometres}} of Dutch sea dikes {{are protected}} by <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> revetments to prevent damage from erosion and repeated wave attacks during storms. The numerical analysis of sea dikes subjected to cyclic wave loading needs to consider the behaviour of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> revetment, and the behaviour of the subsoil including the generation and dissipation of the excess pore pressures, {{as well as the}} interaction between the revetment and subsoil. This thesis develops and evaluates numerical methods for investigating this problem, using the dynamic Finite Element Method with the coupling of plate and volume elements. In dynamic finite element analysis, the arbitrary selected boundary generates wave reflections which normally causes oscillation problems. Absorbing boundary conditions are therefore adopted to minimise the wave reflection at the artificial boundaries. The effects of the absorbing boundary conditions are investigated in detail for both solid and water phases, and appropriate sets of parameters are recommended. In order to model the <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> revetment, which is a thin layer of material with a high stiffness, a very fine mesh is often needed in order to obtain accurate results. However, an explicit time integration algorithm is normally needed for dynamic analysis, which reduces the critical time step size required for numerical stability if the same element type is used for both the revetment and the soil, severely affecting simulation performance. In order to avoid this problem, in this thesis a structural plate element is developed based on the classical Kirchhoff thin plate bending theory for modelling thin layer materials instead of the volume element. For consideration of both stretching and bending problems, the Kirchhoff thin plate bending theory has been extended. Specifically, a more conventional 3 -noded triangular plate element, with 1 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom per node, has been extended to include 2 extra translational degrees of freedom per node, i. e. giving a total of 3 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom per node. Moreover, an enhanced lumped mass matrix for the plate element has been constructed by considering both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Numerical validations indicate that the use of plate elements for simulating the thin layer material provides a great improvement on the accuracy of the results, as well as a significant decrease in the computational cost. For the limit state design of some engineering problems, non-linear material models provide more accurate results than elastic material models. Here an elastic viscoplastic model is investigated and implemented for the new plate element, using the Drucker-Prager yield condition and a non-associated flow rule. Typical creep behaviour of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> is presented and a parametric study of the viscoplastic model has been carried out for modelling the behaviour of Delft <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete.</b> It is concluded that the viscosity value for a particular material changes from different conditions, that it depends not only on the material model and stress level, but also on the temperature. The developed numerical methods have been used to investigate the behaviour of sea dikes subjected to wave attacks. The results of the bending moments and stresses in the <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete,</b> as well as the excess pore pressures and displacements in the soil, are presented. The tendency of a so-called "shake down" behaviour is observed after 10 cycles of wave attack during a severe storm, indicating that the displacement of the dike converges asymptotically to a particular final deformation.

The changes in portland cement <b>concrete</b> and <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete</b> under lower volumes of traffic were about 5 skid numbers. The lowest skid numbers (SN's) occurred in early to mid-August for portland cement concrete and sand-asphalt pavements and in late August to early September for <b>bituminous</b> <b>concrete.</b> Correlations between changes in SN and temperature were best for ambient air temperature averaged over 4 - and 8 -week periods prior to date of test.
