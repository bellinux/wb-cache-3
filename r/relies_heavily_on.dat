5|$|Manitoba's economy <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture {{is vital}} and is found {{mostly in the}} {{southern}} half of the province, although grain farming occurs {{as far north as}} The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The most common type of farm found in rural areas is cattle farming (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).|$|E

5|$|Cameroon is {{a member}} of both the Commonwealth of Nations and La Francophonie. Its foreign policy closely follows that of its main ally, France (one of its former colonial rulers). Cameroon <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> France for its defence, {{although}} military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government. Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich Bakassi peninsula (however, this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement) and with Gabon's president, El Hadj Omar Bongo, over personal rivalries.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the area since around 1350 AD. Prior to European settlement, the region was sparsely {{inhabited}} by nomadic groups of Māori, most of whom lived close to river mouths. In the early days of European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers, and saw milling became a major local industry from the mid-19th century until the 1930s. Ecotourism has become of growing importance in the Catlins economy, which otherwise <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> dairy farming and fishing.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc, Cleveland has erupted at least 22times in the last 230years. A VEI 3 {{eruption}} in 1944 produced the arc's only known volcanic fatality. Most recently Mount Cleveland has erupted three times in 2009, twice in 2010, once in 2011 and in 2016 and 2017. The volcano's remoteness limits opportunities for its study, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> satellites for monitoring. The volcano is primarily hazardous to aircraft; many of the flights over the north Pacific approach the vicinity of the volcano, and volcanic ash released from eruptions can damage sensitive electronic equipment and sensors.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E

A long-term development plan was proposed in 2011 by the Government of Gujarat, with investment of ₹830 million to refurbish the city of Dwarka and build a bridge connecting the city with Okha and Bet Dwarka. Janmashtami is the main festival that is celebrated during August and September. Sharda Peeth Vidya Sabha is an educational society sponsored by the Sharda Peeth, Dwarka which runs an arts college in Dwarka. Dwarka was selected as a heritage city by the Indian government's Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) initiative.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Fragments of Him {{is based}} on {{the life and death of}} Will, a man who dies early in the game. The player controls four characters throughout the game; Will, his ex-girlfriend, his boyfriend at the time when he died, and his grandmother. As the game progresses, it becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also on those of the other characters, and how they cope with his death. The game <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> its narrative which, although the player controls the game in the first-person, is described by the developer as being viewed in a second-person perspective, i.e. where the player is not directly controlling a character but instead indicates what the characters should interact with next.|$|E
5|$|The {{generalized}} Euclidean algorithm {{requires a}} Euclidean function, i.e., a mapping f from R into {{the set of}} nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements a and b in R, there exist q and r in R such that a = qb + r and f(r) < f(b). An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above. The function f can be {{the magnitude of the}} number, or the degree of a polynomial. The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably; hence, if f can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> the natural well-ordering of the non-negative integers; roughly speaking, this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{was founded}} in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became {{involved}} in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand forest <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the {{woody plants}} have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, {{which included the}} huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} feeds on a {{diverse range of}} {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates, though plant matter does constitute {{a major part of}} its diet. It is known to eat beetles, including weevils, rove beetles, and click beetles from the genus Psephus, butterflies, ants from the genera Dorylus and Pachycondyla, grasshoppers, cockroaches from the family Blattidae, earwigs, caterpillars, ant-lions, silverfish, and earthworms. Small lizards, frogs, snails, and slugs are also eaten, as are crabs from the genus Potamon, fruits, flower buds, mosses, and leaves. Fish have also been identified as a prey item in Nigeria. At at least one nesting site, it <b>relies</b> <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> the arthropods feeding on the bat guano near the cave for sustenance, while this behaviour has been reported to a lesser extent at other sites. It is known to regurgitate what it has eaten in pellet form. Overall, between 52 and 60 percent of the bird's diet is believed to be composed of animals. Rove beetle larvae and ants were the most frequently eaten prey in a study in Nigeria.|$|E
