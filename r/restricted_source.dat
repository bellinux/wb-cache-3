It has been recognised that such restriction {{may affect the}} study validity. Objectives To assess the bias that may arise when analyses involve data from cohorts based on <b>restricted</b> <b>source</b> populations, an area little studied in quantitative terms. Methods Monte Carlo simulations were used, based on a setting where the exposure and one risk factor for the outcome, which are not associated in the general population, influence selection into the cohort. All the parameters involved in the simulations (ie, prevalence and effects of exposure and risk factor on both the selection and outcome process, selection prevalence, baseline outcome incidence rate, and sample size) were allowed to vary to reflect real life settings. Results The simulations show that when the exposure and risk factor are strongly associated with selection (ORs of 4 or 0. 25) and the unmeasured risk factor {{is associated with a}} disease HR of 4, the bias in the estimated log HR for the exposureedisease association is 60. 15. When these associations decrease to values more commonly seen in epidemiological studies (eg, ORs and HRs of 2 or 0. 5), the bias in the log HR drops to just 60. 02. Conclusions Using a <b>restricted</b> <b>source</b> population for a cohort study will, under a range of sensible scenarios, produce only relatively weak bias in estimates of the exposureedisease associations...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} query execution when there is limited access to the relations, i. e. when binding patterns require values to be specified {{in order to get}} data from the relation. This problem is common in virtual data integration systems where there are heterogeneous <b>sources</b> with various <b>restricted</b> access patterns and query capabilities. Another problem is the lack of the statistical information about the sources and occurrence of unpredictable events. We introduce two mobile join operators, MDJoin and SMDJoin which are designed for <b>restricted</b> <b>sources</b> and implemented using 'mobile agents' in order to benefit from their autonomous and reactive characteristics. Mobile operators of <b>restricted</b> <b>sources</b> are capable to deal with <b>restricted</b> <b>sources</b> and react to the variations between the compile-time estimations and run-time computations of data during query execution. The difference between the two new query operators lies in their level of adaptation ability to the execution environment.

S. and Rest-of-the-World starchy foods (unmilled wheat and flour, rice, corn and fresh potatoes) using the <b>Restricted</b> <b>Source</b> Differentiated Almost Ideal Demand System (RSDAIDS) model. Caribbean per capita import demand curves for U. S. and Rest-of-the-World (ROW) are own-price unitary elastic for U. S. wheat, and own-price inelastic for U. S. rice and ROW wheat and rice. The implication is that reductions by any means in U. S. or ROW export prices of wheat and rice will increase U. S. or ROW exported quantities in the Caribbean, {{while at the same}} time securing food security through import quantity in the Caribbean. Wheat is not produced in the Caribbean. U. S. wheat price policy oriented toward a reduction in the export price of wheat to the Caribbean may increase the U. S. wheat market share in the Caribbean. For wheat and rice, no competition across source exists. Instead, there exists a complementarity relationship across source for each of the two products. In other words, the Caribbean distinguishes between the wheat or rice coming from the U. S. and the wheat or rice coming from the Rest-of-the-World.

40|$|While genetic {{diversity}} is hypothesized {{to be an}} important factor explaining invasion success, there is no consensus yet on how variation in source populations or demographic processes affects invasiveness. We used mitochondrial DNA haplotypic and microsatellite genotypic data to investigate levels of genetic variation and reconstruct the history of replicate invasions on three continents in a globally invasive bird, the monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus). We evaluated whether {{genetic diversity}} at invasive sites could be explained by (i) the native source populations from which they were derived and (ii) demographic bottlenecks during introduction. Genetic data indicated a localized source area for most sampled invasive populations, with limited evidence for admixing of native source populations. This pattern largely coincides with historical data on pet trade exports. However, the invasive populations are genetically more similar than predicted from the export data alone. The extent of bottleneck effects varied among invasive populations. The observed low genetic diversity, evidence of demographic contraction and <b>restricted</b> <b>source</b> area do not support the hypothesis that invasion is favoured by the mixing and recombining of genetic variation from multiple source populations. Instead, they suggest that reduced genetic variation through random processes may not inhibit successful establishment and invasion in this species. However, convergent selection across invasive sites could also explain the observed patterns of reduction and similarity in genetic variation and/or the <b>restricted</b> <b>source</b> area. In general, the alternative explanation of intraspecific variation in invasive potential among genotypes or geographic areas is neglected, but warrants more attention as it could inform comparative studies and management of biological invaders.

Satellites are increasingly used to obtain information on properties of aerosol particles with a diameter larger than about 100 nm. However, new aerosol particles formed by nucleation are initially much smaller and grow into the optically active size range on time scales of many hours. In this paper we derive proxies, based on process understanding and ground-based observations, to determine the concentrations of these new particles and their spatial distribution using satellite data. The results are applied to provide seasonal variation of nucleation mode concentration. The proxies describe the concentration of nucleation mode particles over continents.

One primary goal of the WSF policy is to increase the equity with which resources are distributed to schools. With respect to equity, the findings suggest that for particular schooling levels per-pupil spending became more responsive to student poverty and that the increase in responsiveness appears to have coincided with implementation of the WSF in the two districts. Moreover, each district relies on a different mechanism for driving resources to the schools: San Francisco relying to a greater degree on the unrestricted funds, while Oakland relies more heavily on <b>restricted</b> <b>sources</b> which, as directed by law, drive dollars to special need populations. Interestingly, neither district exhibited any significant change in the distribution of teacher experience after implementation of their SBF models; schools serving the highest proportion of students from low-income families continued to employ teachers with the least experience after implementation of the SBF models.
