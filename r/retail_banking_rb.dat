40|$|Our study {{reviews the}} process towards {{creating}} a single European <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> market. The EU has aimed at integrating the traditionally heterogeneous banking market in Europe {{by means of}} harmonizing legislation. While the wholesale banking market integration {{is considered to be}} more advanced, <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> integration is still in its infancy. Cross- border lending, cross-border mergers, and the promises of new technologies have not yet delivered the creation of a single <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> market. In this paper we provide new evidence on this issue. In particular, we find that there are some tendencies for a more integrated corporate lending market, while consumer lending markets are still remaining more fragmented. We identify three reasons for a lack of integration: A lack of international arbitrage, a limited pass-through of interest rate changes onto lending rates, and a limited national and international competitive <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> environment. The results also suggest that the introduction of the single currency may have already made a positive impact on <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> market integration. ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to improve the}} current {{understanding}} of the ways banking service providers can create value to customers through digital services. In particular, the study explores the ways a retail baking service provider could adopt digital services to enhance its service offering for improved customer experience. This thesis consists of a review of the previous research on the emerging trends in <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> to identify factors that affect the adoption of digitally enhanced services in the banking industry. In addition, the study builds on the research of the service-dominant (S-D) logic perspective to establish a framework to analyze digitalization in the <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> environment. The empirical research is based on qualitative research methodology to validate earlier findings and to collect more in-depth insights of the phenomenon. The study adds to the current understanding of the changes in <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> customer behaviors and customer expectations concerning the digitally enhanced service experience. The present thesis suggests that in order to increase customer-perceived value in <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> through adopting digital services, the <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> service providers need to integrate resources inside the service ecosystem with a customer-oriented mindset. Such a resource integration approach enables the production of unique value proposition, and allows the service providers to co-create value with their customers. In addition, it allows the service providers to differentiate themselves in the marketplace. The work contributes {{to the understanding of the}} S-D logic in the <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> business by examining the applicability of the S-D logic in the empirical case. The results also include a great amount of valuable and practical suggestions for <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> service providers to consider when they seek for ways to renew their service logic to be able to succeed in digital transformation. Also, a number of external and internal challenges in the adoption of digital services in <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> were identified and discussed...|$|R
