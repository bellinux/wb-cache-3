5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
25|$|The second batch, {{numbered}} 146 to 155, {{had similar}} bodies {{built by the}} Brush Electrical Engineering Company Limited of Loughborough, mounted on Brush-built P.22 trucks and with identical equipment to the U.E.C. cars, except for 146, which had a B.T.H electromagnetic brake instead of the air slipper type. All these cars were delivered with <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> indicators, and gradually, but with no small objection from the travelling public, this type of indicator was fitted to practically all the remaining cars.|$|E
25|$|The {{first car}} to be {{fitted with a}} new U.E.C. lower saloon was no. 16 and this {{appeared}} in service during the summer, the remaining rebuilt cars appearing shortly afterward. The fitting of top covers to these earlier cars had caused the original lower saloon frames to bow owing to the extra weight. These new saloons had normal staircases, while the existing equipment {{was replaced by the}} new Dick, Kerr 40 h.p. motors and D.B.I. controllers. The position of the track wheel was altered, and <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> indicators were fitted.|$|E
50|$|A few {{had their}} <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> {{replaced}} with dot matrix equipment in 2005/06, before all were fitted with LED equipment in 2007. All were fitted with cab air-conditioning in 2007.|$|R

50|$|The 9030 series sets {{differ from}} the earlier 8-car sets in having UV-cutting glass for the wide windows, {{eliminating}} the need for <b>roller</b> <b>blinds,</b> and having full-colour LED destination indicator panels.|$|R
25|$|This {{sub-series}} {{represented a}} stop-gap for use from 1998 on the Chūō-Sōbu Line until the full-production E231 series trains were delivered. The 17 ten-car sets differ noticeably {{from the other}} 209 series variants in having 2,966mm wide cars (compared to 2,870mm for earlier flat-sided stock), as well as LED destination indicators, replacing the earlier <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> type. While externally similar in appearance to the later E231 series sets, the 209-500 series are distinguishable by their white cab fronts and lack of six-door cars. Five sets were transferred to the Keihin-Tōhoku Line, and, from October 2008, these were modified (with ATS-P/SN instead of ATC), repainted, and transferred to the Keiyō Line following {{the introduction of new}} E233 series trains. From September 2010, three former Keiyō Line sets were reduced to eight cars and reliveried for use on the Musashino Line, entering service from 4 December 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The {{outline design}} of the F24 camera {{was carried out by}} the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, and it was {{introduced}} in 1925. Detailed design, and most production, was by Williamson Manufacturing Company Ltd of Willesden Green, London NW.10. The F24 was designed to be lighter and smaller than the F8 camera of 1919, but the F8 continued to be used in less demanding installations. The main component units of the F24 are a body with <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> focal plane shutter, gearbox, film magazine, and lens cone. Image film format is 5"×5", on 5" [...] wide roll film, with magazine capacity up to 250 exposures (the F8 offered images up to 8"×7.5" [...] on 9" [...] wide film). Shutter speed is preset between 1/100s and 1/1000s.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Hillarys {{celebrated its}} 40th anniversary.The full product range now {{includes}} vertical <b>blinds,</b> venetian <b>blinds,</b> <b>roller</b> <b>blinds,</b> pleated blinds, roman blinds, wooden blinds, skylight blinds and Perfect Fit blinds. There {{are more than}} 850 blind fabric choices. Window shutters, awnings and curtains are available nationwide. Carpets are also available across most of Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|These blinds can be {{classified}} broadly into six different categories: <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> (which do not have slats but consist of {{a single piece of}} material), Roman blinds, pleated blinds, Venetian blinds, Shoji Japanese blinds and vertical blinds.|$|R
50|$|Custom Made <b>Roller</b> <b>Blinds</b> come in blockout, {{translucent}} and sunscreen options, {{they are}} {{mounted on a}} metal headrail and operated with a side chain or spring mechanism. Lower cost and ready made blinds often come with a PVC pole instead of a metal headrail.|$|R

6000|$|... "I've {{just thought}} of that," [...] said Cavor. [...] "That's what I meant when I said {{the thing is}} finished. The inner glass sphere can be air-tight, and, except for the manhole, continuous, and the steel sphere {{can be made in}} sections, each section capable of rolling up after the fashion of a <b>roller</b> <b>blind.</b> These can easily be worked by springs, and {{released}} and checked by electricity conveyed by platinum wires fused through the glass. All that is merely a question of detail. So you see, that except for the thickness of the blind rollers, the Cavorite exterior of the sphere will consist of windows or blinds, whichever you like to call them. Well, when all these windows or blinds are shut, no light, no heat, no gravitation, no radiant energy of any sort will get at the inside of the sphere, it will fly on through space in a straight line, as you say. But open a window, imagine one of the windows open. Then at once any heavy body that chances to be in that direction will attract us--" ...|$|E
60|$|And it grew--the sphere. December passed, January--I spent a {{day with}} a broom {{sweeping}} {{a path through the}} snow from bungalow to laboratory--February, March. By the end of March the completion was in sight. In January had come a team of horses, a huge packing-case; we had our thick glass sphere now ready, and in position under the crane we had rigged to sling it into the steel shell. All the bars and blinds of the steel shell--it was not really a spherical shell, but polyhedral, with a <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> to each facet--had arrived by February, and the lower half was bolted together. The Cavorite was half made by March, the metallic paste had gone through two of the stages in its manufacture, and we had plastered quite half of it on to the steel bars and blinds. It was astonishing how closely we kept to the lines of Cavor's first inspiration in working out the scheme. When the bolting together of the sphere was finished, he proposed to remove the rough roof of the temporary laboratory in which the work was done, and build a furnace about it. So the last stage of Cavorite making, in which the paste is heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium, would be accomplished when it was already on the sphere.|$|E
50|$|Other {{existing}} {{vehicles in the}} Medway fleet were modernised to bring them into line with the new vehicles.

50|$|The {{locomotive}} had a round-topped firebox. The cylinders were inclined {{and arranged}} outside the engine frame, while the slide valves were actuated by Stephenson Link motion. The cab {{sides of the}} early locomotives were not enclosed, but were equipped with canvas <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> to offer the crew some protection against the elements.|$|R
50|$|External {{parabolic}} collectors require proper heat insulation, {{double-glazed windows}} over the zenithal opening and <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> to reduce excessive lighting, glare and heat on sunny days. Integrated anidolic systems reduce external protrusion {{and attempt to}} visually blend into traditional facades, however, like all anidolic systems, they are susceptible to glare and offer no protection from overheating on sunny days.|$|R
50|$|At {{the height}} of the Cold War in the mid 1960s, the agency was merged into the BND, the {{successor}} of the Gehlen Org. It was located in Karlsruhe and the Zimmerle & Co. which served as the front, ostensibly specializing in <b>roller</b> <b>blinds.</b> Aside from Soviet counter-intelligence activities, the agency also began monitoring domestic leftists and pacifists.|$|R

50|$|The term window blinds {{can also}} be used to {{describe}} window coverings generically—in this context window blinds include almost every type of window covering, i.e. shutters, <b>roller</b> <b>blinds,</b> cellular shades (also called honeycomb shades), wood blinds, roman blinds and of course, standard vertical and horizontal blinds. In the United Kingdom, awnings are sometimes called blinds or shades.|$|R
50|$|The term window blinds is also {{sometimes}} used, somewhat inaccurately, to describe window coverings generically—in this context window blinds include almost {{every type of}} window covering, including both curtains and blinds for homes and commercial premises, such as bars/pubs, offices, and shops, e.g., Plantation Shutters/Jigsaw Shutters, Roman <b>blinds,</b> <b>roller</b> <b>blinds,</b> and of course, vertical and horizontal blinds.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1971 by Tony Hillary. He originally made blinds in a converted garage {{at his home in}} Nottingham. As well as selling and fitting the blinds, Tony Hillary looked after advertising and manufacturing. Initially only two products Venetian blinds and vertical blinds were available. In 1974, <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> were introduced to the range.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, when {{a number}} of buses change hands, or {{operator}} requirements change, a bus builder {{may be required to}} refit them into the new owners preferred configuration.
