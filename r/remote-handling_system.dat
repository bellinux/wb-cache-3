40|$|The {{power output}} of fusion {{experiments}} and fusion reactor-like devices {{is measured in}} terms of the neutron yields which relate directly to the fusion yield. In this paper we describe the devices and methods used to make the new in-situ calibration of JET in April 2013 and its early results. The target accuracy of this calibration was 10 %, just as in the earlier JET calibration and as required for ITER, where a precise neutron yield measurement is important, e. g. for tritium accountancy. We discuss the constraints and early decisions which defined the main calibration approach, e. g. the choice of source type and the deployment method. We describe the physics, source issues, safety and engineering aspects required to calibrate directly the Fission Chambers and the Activation System which carry the JET neutron calibration. In particular a direct calibration of the Activation system was planned {{for the first time in}} JET. We used the existing JET <b>remote-handling</b> <b>system</b> to deploy the 252 Cf source and developed the compatible tooling and systems necessary to ensure safe and efficient deployment in these cases. The scientific programme has sought to better understand the limitations of the calibration, to optimize the measurements and other provisions, to provide corrections for perturbing factors (e. g. presence of the remote-handling boom and other non-standard torus conditions) and to ensure personnel safety and safe working conditions. Much of this work has been based on an extensive programme of Monte-Carlo calculations which e. g. revealed a potential contribution to the neutron yield via a direct line of sight through the ports which presents individually depending on the details of the port geometry...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThere is an {{increasing}} interest in developing cameras for surveillance systems to monitor nuclear facilities or nuclear waste storages [1]. Particularly, for today’s and {{the next generation of}} nuclear facilities increasing safety requirements consecutive to Fukushima Daiichi’s disaster have to be considered. For some applications, radiation tolerance needs to overcome doses in the MGy(SiO 2) range whereas the most tolerant commercial or prototypes products based on solid state image sensors withstand doses up to few kGy [2]. The objective of this work is to present the radiation hardening strategy developed by our research groups to enhance the tolerance to ionizing radiations of the various subparts of these imaging systems by working simultaneously at the component and system design levels. Developing radiation-hardened camera implies to combine several radiation-hardening strategies. In our case, we decided not to use the simplest one, the shielding approach. This approach is efficient but limits the camera miniaturization and is not compatible with its future integration in <b>remote-handling</b> or obotic <b>systems.</b> Then, the hardening-by-component strategy appears mandatory to avoid the failure of one of the camera subparts at doses lower than the MGy. Concerning the image sensor itself, the used technology is a CMOS Image Sensor (CIS) designed by ISAE team with custom pixel designs used to mitigate the total ionizing dose (TID) effects that occur well below the MGy range in classical image sensors (e. g. Charge Coupled Devices (CCD), Charge Injection Devices (CID) and classical Active Pixel Sensors (APS)), such as the complete loss of functionality, the dark current increase and the gain drop. We’ll present at the conference a comparative study between these radiation-hardened pixel radiation responses with respect to conventional ones, demonstrating the efficiency of the choices made. The targeted strategy to develop the complete radiation hard camera electronics will be exposed. Another important element of the camera is the optical system that transports the image from the scene to the image sensor. This arrangement of glass based lenses is affected by radiations through two mechanisms: the radiation induced absorption andthe radiation induced refractive index changes. The first one will limit the signal to noise ratio of the image whereas the second one will directly affect the resolution of the camera. We’ll present at the conference a coupled simulation/experiment study of these effects for various commercial glasses and present vulnerability study of typical optical systems to radiations at MGy doses. The last very important part of the camera is the illumination system that can be based on various technologies of emitting devices like LED, SLED or lasers. The most promising solutions for high radiation doses will be presented at the conference. In addition to this hardening-by-component approach, the global radiation tolerance of the camera can be drastically improve by working at the system level, combining innovative approaches eg. for the optical and illumination systems. We’ll present at the conference the developed approach allowing to extend the camera lifetime up to the MGy dose range.
