40|$|Abstract. Diffusion MRI is a noninvasive imaging {{modality}} {{that allows for}} the estimation and visualization of white matter connectivity patterns in the human brain. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nature of diffusion data, deriving useful statistics from the data is adversely affected by different sources of measurement noise. This is aggravated {{by the fact that}} the sampling distribution of the statistic of interest is often complex and unknown. In situations as such, the bootstrap, due to its distribution-independent nature, is an appealing tool for the estimation of the variability of almost any statistic, without relying on complicated theoretical calculations, but purely on computer simulation. In this work, we present new bootstrap strategies for variability estimation of diffusion statistics in association with noise. In contrast to the residual bootstrap, which relies on a predetermined data model, or the repetition bootstrap, which requires <b>repeated</b> <b>signal</b> measurements, our approach, called the non-local bootstrap (NLB), is non-parametric and obviates the need for time-consuming multiple acquisitions. The key assumption of NLB is that local image structures recur in the image. We exploit this self-similarity via a multivariate non-parametric kernel regression framework for bootstrap estimation of uncertainty. Evaluation of NLB using a set of high-resolution diffusion-weighted images, with lower than usual SNR due to the small voxel size, indicates that NLB is markedly more robust to noise and results in more accurate inferences. ...|$|E

How-ever, it should be emphasized that receptors per se have no intrinsic function; i. e., as with facts, they cannot speak for themselves. To be functional, receptors must be incorporated into systems that process or transduce the incoming signals. On the other hand, to the extent that their removal results in loss of information processing, receptors are the key to the phenomenon known as habituation or desensitization, i. e., the wan-ing of information processing observed on <b>repeated</b> <b>signal</b> input. Two general types of information-processing systems are commonly observed. One is short term in that signal processing is rapid in both onset and offset. The other is long term and expresses memory of the input system long after the initial signal has been withdrawn.

40|$|Our work in {{the last}} two years was mainly {{concerned}} with the detection of structured audio components within source signals. In this, an important type of structure are repetitions such as repeating bird calls or percussive elements in music. A few months ago, we have proposed a novel technique for detecting multiply (i. e., more than once) <b>repeated</b> <b>signal</b> components within a target signal. For such cases, we were able to improve classical autocorrelation techniques. In our experiments, we up to now have successfully considered applications in bioacoustics and in speech processing.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{reproducibility}} {{of time and}} frequency domain variables derived from the signal averaged P wave. DESIGN: Longitudinal within patient study. SETTING: Regional cardiothoracic centre. PATIENTS: 20 patients (10 with documented paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and 10 normal controls) were studied on three occasions to assess the reproducibility of <b>repeated</b> <b>signal</b> averaged P wave recordings. Digital P wave recordings were made on a further 10 patients on a single occasion and the recordings signal averaged twice {{in order to assess}} the reproducibility of the averaging system itself in the absence of biological variation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: P wave duration, spatial velocity, and energies contained in frequency bands from 20, 30, and 60 - 150 Hz of the P wave spectrum were measured after P wave specific signal averaging. Coefficients of reproducibility were calculated for paired signal averaged P waves derived by signal averaging the same digital recordings on two separate occasions, for recordings performed in the same patients immediately after each other ("back to back") and those performed one week apart. RESULTS: System reproducibility when the same digital P wave recordings were signal averaged on two separate occasions was high (< 11 % for all variables). For P wave duration the coefficient of reproducibility was 11. 4 % for back to back recordings and 13. 1 % for those one week apart. The reproducibility of spatial velocity and P wave energy was low. Variation in P wave morphology was noted when successive P waves from the same subject were examined. If recordings with the same P wave morphology were analysed the reproducibility of spatial velocity and P wave energy improved but remained significantly poorer than that for P wave duration. CONCLUSIONS: P wave duration is reproducible within subjects in the short and medium term. Frequency domain and spatial velocity analysis are poorly reproducible, due more to spontaneous variation in P wave morphology than to instability of the signal averaging process. This may limit the utility of signal averaged P wave variables other than duration for the prediction of atrial arrhythmia...|$|E

40|$|The Auditory Startle Reflex (ASR) is a {{transient}} motor response {{mediated by the}} brainstem to an unexpected, intense acoustic stimulus. It represents a sensitive, non-invasive measurement of central nervous system activity and {{can be applied to}} assess auditory function and cerebral gating ability. During ASR measurement, the latency, intensity and duration of the reaction to a sudden short acoustic signal is quantified, the habituation to a <b>repeated</b> <b>signal</b> is assessed and the pre-pulse inhibition (the reduced startle reflex after a "warning" signal) can be measured. Increases in the response to acoustic stimuli and a shorter latency are described in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and fragile X-syndrome while a decrease or lack in habituation can be seen in post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia. In order to track the development of reflex response in juvenile rats, litters of juvenile Wistar WU were exposed to a pre-defined program of acoustic stimuli at 10, 15, 20, 40 and 60 days post partum (pp) and the intensity and duration of the response to acoustic stimuli as well as the progress in pre-pulse inhibition and habituation were measured. Our results demonstrate the practicability of ASR measurements as early as day 10 pp with a coordinated animal response showing a significant pre-pulse inhibition around day 15 pp, in coincidence with ear and eye opening. During the juvenile period of hyperactivity and -reactivity (around day 15 - 20 pp) the juvenile rats show high intensity reactions with a long duration. The development of a gender-specific response starts around day 40 pp in coincidence with sexual maturation, with females demonstrating a higher degree of habituation and pre-pulse inhibition. Adult-like patterns of habituation can be assessed by day 60 pp. In contrast to general experimental habit (assessing ASR at weaning and day 60 pp), our data demonstrate the practicability of ASR measurement at day 15 pp with comparable results, enabling an earlier assessment of cerebral function...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} indoor {{positioning}} {{based on a}} technique combining the characteristics of two systems: pseudolites and repeaters. This solution tries to combine the best of each method: for pseudolites, the {{ability to cope with}} carrier phase measurements to improve the accuracy and reduce the effect of multipath, and for repeater the simplicity of the infrastructure and the automatic synchronisation with the satellite constellation. A pseudolite is a long established and relatively well-known concept: it consists of ground based stations broadcasting GNSS-like signals. A receiver based on the ground can process this signal exactly {{as if it was a}} satellite signal and use it as satellite data in the computation of a navigation solution. Thus it is possible to deploy a ground based constellation of pseudo-satellites in order to compute a position inside buildings or any places where GNSS signals are too weak to be processed by classical or highly sensitive GNSS receivers. Since the signal has the same structure as the outdoor signal, precise measurements can be carried out like carrier phase measurements allowing the multipath error to be mitigated. However, there are limitations to this method. First is the synchronisation of the ground based constellation. As in any GNSS system, synchronisation is vital and it can be very expensive to have a stable clock on each pseudolite. Second is the potentiality of high interference between the pseudolites. As the distances of propagation are relatively small and the indoor environment has a propensity to raise obstacles in the signal trajectory, the difference of power between two signals can be high enough to lead to the disruption of the weakest by the strongest. (There is also potential interference with the GNSS signals but it does not concern the present discussion.) This phenomenon is called the Near-far problem. Thus, pseudolites are interesting but limited by the synchronisation and the Near-far problem. The repeater based technique has several declinations as shown in the section II. B of the paper, but the main principle remains. It consists of collecting GPS signals from an outdoor antenna and then forwarding them indoors in a sequential switching mode without any further treatment other than amplification. Each repeater, which consists of an antenna and a cable linked to the sequential switcher, transmits signals over a specific period while the others are switched off. Signal switching induces an offset of phase on the signal received by an indoor receiver. This offset corresponds to the difference of time of arrival between two successive repeaters. Four such Time of Difference Of Arrival measurements are then necessary to compute a position. With such a method, there is no interference between repeaters, thus no longer a Near-far problem. In addition, there is no need for expensive synchronisation of the constellation, but the switching induces signal discontinuities that limit the possibility of carrier phase measurements. Consequently, it increases the influence of multipaths on the computed solution. The proposed method, called the Repealite method, consists of transmitting a <b>repeated</b> <b>signal</b> as for the repeaters. But, instead of switching, the transmission on each antenna is delayed in such a way that the codes (Which are the same, though delayed, for all satellite signals received.) transmitted on each repealite do not interfere once they arrive at the receiver antenna. The principles of this method were presented in [1] and [2]. It is clear that the continuity of the signal allows carrier phase measurements and it is also clear that no synchronisation is required. However, the Near-far problem remains and can even be worse than in the case of pseudolites. The point we want to focus on this paper is the high level of interference than can occur because of simultaneous broadcasting of different satellite signals. This can induce severe interference that can disrupt the signal. This paper mainly focuses on methods developed in order to improve correlation mitigating the effect of the interference between repealites, interference that we call systemic interference. After the state of art of the GNSS based indoor positioning techniques in section II, the principles of the Repealite method are presented in section III which ends with a theoretical description of the received signal. Section IV provides simulations from a typical indoor positioning situation in standard conditions in order to illustrate the interference influences and to study solutions that could be carried out to mitigate them. Section V summarises the paper and describes future works...|$|E
