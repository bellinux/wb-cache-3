We simulated future landscapes resulting from the annual interplay of loss and conservation of forest types.

We hypothesized that amyloid-β PET imaging by 18 F-florbetapir, a radiotracer that detects fibrillar amyloid-β plaque deposits, would identify subjects with global cognitive impairment or poor performance in individual cognitive domains in non-demented Parkinson disease patients. We assessed 61 non-demented Parkinson disease patients with detailed cognitive assessments and 18 F-florbetapir PET brain imaging. Scans were interpreted qualitatively (positive or negative) by two independent nuclear medicine physicians blinded to clinical data, and quantitatively by a novel volume-weighted method. The presence of mild cognitive impairment was determined through an expert consensus process using Level 1 criteria from the Movement Disorder Society. Nineteen participants (31. 2 %) were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and the remainder had normal cognition. Qualitative 18 F-florbetapir PET imaging was positive in 15 participants (24. 6 %). Increasing age and presence of an APOE ε 4 allele were associated with higher composite 18 F-florbetapir binding.

40|$|PURPOSE To {{investigate}} the retention loads of differently fabricated secondary telescopic polyetheretherketone (PEEK) crowns on cobalt-chromium primary crowns with different tapers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cobalt-chromium primary crowns with 0 °, 1 °, and 2 ° tapers were constructed, milled, and sintered. Corresponding secondary crowns were fabricated by milling, pressing from pellets, and pressing from granules. For these nine test groups, the pull-off tests of each crown combination were performed 20 times, and the retention loads were measured (Zwick 1445, 50 mm/min). Data {{were analyzed using}} linear regression, covariance analysis, mixed models, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U-test, together with the Benferroni-Holm correction. RESULTS The mixed models covariance analysis reinforced stable <b>retention</b> load <b>values</b> (p = 0. 162) for each single test sequence. There was no interaction between the groups and the separation cycles (p = 0. 179). Milled secondary crowns with 0 ° showed the lowest mean <b>retention</b> load <b>values</b> compared to all tested groups (p = 0. 003) followed by those pressed form pellets with 1 °. Regarding the different tapers, no effect of manufacturing method on the results was observed within 1 ° and 2 ° groups (p = 0. 540; p = 0. 052); however, among the 0 ° groups, the milled ones showed significantly the lowest <b>retention</b> load <b>values</b> (p = 0. 002). Among the manufacturing methods, both pressed groups showed no impact of taper on the <b>retention</b> load <b>values</b> (p > 0. 324 and p > 0. 123, respectively), whereas among the milled secondary crowns, the 0 ° taper showed significantly lower <b>retention</b> load <b>values</b> than the 1 ° and 2 ° taper (p < 0. 002).

Sandblasting was not as effective as application of an alloy primer (P = 0. 05). ConclusionSandblasting is an effective method to increase the bond strength. Sandblasting plus alloy primer application is a very effective method of increasing the bond strength, and these groups significantly differed from each other...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for peak recognition of 136 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) at different temperature programs. Their retention behaviours are predicted {{on the basis of}} an identification database of <b>retention</b> <b>values</b> (A, B) of gas chromatography. By the retention times of C- 13 labelled 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD/F internal standards, the retentions of all PCDDs and PCDFs can be calculated. After comparison with the retentions of practical environmental samples, the predicted values have been proved to be very accurate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
