40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fast method to accurately predict the aperture efficiency and sidelobe levels of shaped dual reflector systems {{over a wide}} region of the shaping parameter space. Only a few full evaluations of the system, {{at different points in}} the shaping parameter space, are needed to construct the model used for the predictions. The output space mapping technique is used to correct the responses obtained from a simple geometric optics model of the system for any desired point in the shaping parameter space by using the expected aperture edge taper information available from the shaping mapping and the feed pattern. The method is evaluated for a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds,</b> frequencies, and parameter spaces and shown to provide significantly improved results over the geometric optics predictions, while being orders of magnitude faster than full wave or asymptotic method...|$|E

The models {{are derived from}} first principles by considering a simple three-pool scheme and permit the extent of ruminal degradation to be calculated, {{as described in the}} companion paper. The models evaluated were the generalized Mitscherlich, simple Mitscherlich, generalized Michaelis–Menten, simple Michaelis–Menten, Gompertz, and logistic. Five sets of gas production data consisting of 216 curves, obtained using a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> (including straw, hay, silage, grain and various byproducts), were analysed to study the performance of these gas production models. Application of the non-sigmoidal models (simple Mitscherlich and Michaelis–Menten) to the data resulted in convergence problems and these models were found to be inadequate in many cases. Based on results of a pairwise comparison between models (variance ratio test), ranking of residual mean squares, lack-of-fit test, and of analyses of residuals, the generalized Mitscherlich and the generalized Michaelis–Menten models seemed particularly suited because of their flexibility to encompass sigmoidal and non-sigmoidal shapes of gas production profiles, whether symmetrical or not...|$|E

40|$|Good {{nutrition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental requirements for all animals and has been identified by Australian livestock farmers as the biggest contributor to animal welfare on farms. Ruminant livestock utilize their extensive fermentation capacity in their forestomach to digest coarse roughages that could not provide adequate nutrients for the welfare of monogastric animals. They are therefore most often kept on rangelands, with a diverse <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> of low quality and characterized by a large seasonal variability in growth and quality. However, the variation in feed quality and quantity can be partly buffered by the ability of domesticated ruminant livestock to store food energy as fat tissue, for example in the hump of Bos indicus cattle and fat tail of sheep, to be utilised when feed availability is low. It is important to determine when ruminant livestock are malnourished so that corrective action can be taken. We propose that this occurs when normal functioning of the animal, including behaviour, physiology and reproduction, is adversely affected by an inadequate supply of nutrients. The sensation of hunger is central to the concept that an animal suffers during malnutrition but is also adaptive to motivate the animal to locate the necessary nutrients. It is concluded that a better understanding of malnutrition in ruminant livestock is essential to maintain high welfare standards...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates, for {{the first}} time (to our knowledge) for any animal group, the {{evolution}} of phylogenetic differences in fibre digestibility across a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> that differ in potential fibre digestibility (fibre to lignin ratio) in ruminants. Data, collated from the literature, were analysed using a linear mixed model that allows for different sources of random variability, covariates and fixed effects, as well as controlling for phylogenetic relatedness. This approach overcomes the problem of defining boundaries to separate different ruminant feeding styles (browsers, mixed feeders and grazers) by using two covariates that describe the browser-grazer continuum (proportion of grass and proportion of browse in the natural diet of a species). The results indicate that closely related species {{are more likely to have}} similar values of fibre digestibility than species that are more distant in the phylogenetic tree. Body mass did not have any significant effect on fibre digestibility. Fibre digestibility is estimated to increase with the proportion of grass and to decrease with the proportion of browse in the natural diet that characterizes the species. We applied an evolutionary model to infer rates of evolution and ancestral states of fibre digestibility; the model indicates that the rate of evolution of fibre digestibility accelerated across time. We suggest that this could be caused by a combination of increasing competition among ruminant species and adaptation to diets rich in fibre, both related to climatically driven environmental changes in the past few million years...|$|E
40|$|The mineralization/immobilization of {{nitrogen}} when organic sources {{are added to}} soil is represented in many simulation models as the outcome of decomposition of the added material and synthesis of soil organic matter. These models are able to capture the pattern of N release that is attributable to the N concentration of plant materials, or more generally the C:N ratio of the organic input. However, the models are unable to simulate the more complex pattern of N release that has been observed for some animal manures, notably materials that exhibit initial immobilization of N even when the C:N of the material suggests it should mineralize N. The APSIM SoilN module was modified so that the three pools that constitute added organic matter could be specified {{in terms of both}} the fraction of carbon in each pool and also their C:N ratios (previously it has been assumed that all pools have the same C:N ratio). It is shown that the revised model is better able to simulate the general patterns on N mineralized that has been reported for various organic sources.

The major application of titanium {{has been in the}} aerospace industry. However, the focus shift of market trends from military to commercial and aerospace to industry also been reported. On the other hand, titanium and its alloys are notorious for their poor thermal properties and are classified as difficult-to-machine materials. These properties limit the use of these materials especially in the markets where cost is much more of a factor than in aerospace. Machining is an important manufacturing process because it is almost always involved if precision is required and is the most effective process for small volume production. Due to the low machinability of the alloys under study, selecting the machining conditions and parameters is crucial. The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> and cutting speeds, which provide a satisfactory tool life, is very limited.

40|$|Pig meat {{production}} in New Zealand {{has traditionally been}} associated with the dairy industry, relying upon dairy by-products (principally skim-milk and whey) as major sources of protein and energy for pig feed. However, export market prospects for milk protein led to the diversification of dairy factory products, such as the ultra-filtration of whey protein and lactose extraction of whey. The prevailing economic climate also encouraged dairy farmers to change to whole milk,anker collection and large numbers of the supplementary pig enterprises were closed down. Despite fluctuations, market prices generally showed an increase and many farmers began investigating alternative food supplies in order to take advantage of these higher prices. Garbage and other edible waste provided only limited scope for expansion, and the main alternative appeared to be the use of cereal grains. The New Zealand pig industry, in the last 5 - 10 years, has therefore begun to move towards a specialised form of production based upon the use of diets containing a predominance of cereals, similar to what has prevailed in many overseas countries for a longer period. The local report of Kingma and Ryan (1971) illustrates the need for efficiency in the high cost system of production based upon meal feeding. Where skimmilk is the principal ingredient in the ration, the supply of dietary protein is generally adequate due to the high nutritive value of the protein in this feedstuff. However, when the major source of nutrients comes from cereal grains, although these provide a concentrated source of energy, the poor balance of amino acids becomes limiting to the utilization of such rations. In New Zealand there is a restricted <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> high in protein and suitable for incorporation into pig rations.

40|$|Dairy cows {{possess a}} unique {{digestive}} system to digest fibre-rich diets. Ingested feed is retained and degraded in the rumen by the enteric microbial population and is {{passed from the}} rumen to the following segments of the digestive tract. Passage of feed determines energy and protein supply to the animal and is a key parameter in several feed evaluation models for ruminants. Yet, quantitative data on passage of feed and particularly of single feed components are limited. Common techniques used to determine fractional passage rates of feed typically include indigestible markers that {{are not able to}} describe passage of distinct feed components. This thesis describes the use of stable isotope labelled feed components as a novel marker to determine feed type and feed component specific fractional passage rates. In a series of in vivoexperiments, fractional passage rates of a typical dairy ration, including grass silage, maize silage and concentrates, were determined. The use of carbon (13 C) and nitrogen (15 N) stable isotopes as an internal marker inherent to the diet allowed to specifically determine fractional passage rates of plant cell walls such as structural fibre, fibre-bound nitrogen, n-alkanes, and intracellular components such as starch and total nitrogen. For grass silage and maize silage, stable isotopes gave slower fractional rumen passage rates compared to the commonly used external marker chromium mordanted fibre; for concentrates, stable isotopes gave faster rates than the external marker. Among isotopic labelled fractions, 13 C-labelled fibre and 15 N-labelled fibre-bound nitrogen gave the slowest rates. The isotopic signature of single feed components and further application of stable isotopes on a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> and feed components offers scope for the future for a more detailed insight into nutrient-specific passage kinetics. This will ultimately allow to quantify nutrient supply in response to changes in diet composition and quality, and model animal response in relation to optimal animal performance, environmental and animal-health issues...|$|E

Forages have been proved to be a substantial source of nutrients for pigs, however, the bulk of the existing work has focused on sows and grower-finisher pigs above 50 kg. This study was conducted during May-June 2009 at the Agricultural Research Council (Irene, Pretoria) to determine the voluntary forage intake and nutrient digestibility in growing pigs fed a mixed diet (concentrate + Kikuyu grass). Twenty five 8 weeks old Large White x Landrace crossbred pigs (27 ± 3. 8 kg) were blocked by weight into 5 groups of 5 pigs each. One of 5 treatments (A, B, C, D and E), corresponding to 100, 90, 80, 70 and 80 % of a basal concentrate ration, respectively, was randomly assigned to a pig within each block. Indoor treatments were either fed the concentrate only (A) or also received freshly cut Kikuyu grass (Pennissetum clandestinum) ad libitum (B, C and D). Only treatment E animals were housed outdoors in Kikuyu grass paddocks while all other treatments were housed indoors. Forage intake was recorded daily and also estimated using a pair of n-alkanes as markers. Nutrient and diet digestibility were calculated using acid-insoluble ash (AIA) and dotriacontane (C 32) as markers. The results showed that the concentrate intake (CI) in treatments A, B and C was significantly different from treatments C and E (P 0. 05). The estimated (EKI) and recorded (RKI) Kikuyu grass intakes were not influenced by CI or the level of concentrate allowance (CL) and RKI was higher (P < 0. 05) than EKI. Digestibility estimates with AIA were higher than C 32 Keywords: Dotriacontane; Kikuyu; growth performance; forage; monogastrics estimates (P < 0. 05). It was concluded that Kikuyu grass intake was not affected by the reduction of the concentrate level allowance. It was proposed that forage intake in a mixed diet (forage + concentrate) was more dependant on its own characteristics than the concentrate’s nutritional value.

40|$|Currently, rapid {{methods are}} needed for feed analysis. This study {{examined}} the potential of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to predict the nutritional value of a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> for ruminants, {{as an alternative to}} the in situ technique. Moreover, we investigated whether universal equations could be developed that would allow the low-cost determination of crude protein (CP) concentrations and their kinetics of degradation into the rumen. Protein nutritional values of 663 samples comprising 80 different feed types were determined in terms of concentrations of CP, water-soluble CP (CPWS), total-tract mobile bag CP digestibility (CPTTD), and in situ CP degradability, including the rumen soluble fraction (CPA), the degradable but not soluble fraction (CPB), rate of CPB degradation (CPC), effective degradability (CPED), and potential degradability (CPPD). Infrared spectra of dry samples were collected by attenuated total reflectance from 4000 to 600 cm? 1. Models were developed by partial least squares (PLS) regression in a randomly selected subset of samples, and the precision of the equations was confirmed by using an external validation set. Analysis by FTIR spectroscopy was sufficiently sensitive to allow the accurate prediction of sample CP concentration (R 2 = 0. 92) and to classify feeds according to their CPWS concentrations using universal models (R 2 = 0. 78) that included all sample types. Moreover, substantial improvements in predictions were observed when samples were subdivided in groups. Models for forages led to accurate predictions of CPWS and fractions CPA and CPB (R 2 > 0. 83), whereas models for CPTTD and CPED could be used for screening purposes (R 2 > 0. 67). This study showed that models for protein-rich concentrates alone could also be used for screening according to the feed concentrations of CPWS, CPTTD, CPED, CPA, and CPB, but models for energy-rich concentrates gave relatively poor predictions. The general difficulty observed in predicting CPC is because of a low correlation between FTIR spectra and the kinetics of CP degradation, which may be the result of large variation in the reference method (i. e., in situ degradation studies) and perhaps also because of the presence of compounds that can modify the CP degradation pattern in the rumen. In conclusion, FTIR spectroscopy should be considered as a low-cost alternative in the feed evaluation industry. Peer reviewe...|$|E

In total, 663 samples comprising 80 different feed types were analyzed. In situ DM and NDF degradabilities were determined as follows: effective degradability (ED), rumen soluble fraction (A), degradable but not soluble fraction (B), rate of degradation of the B fraction (C), and indigestible NDF (iNDF). Infrared spectra of dry samples were collected by attenuated total reflectance from 600 to 4000 cm+. Feeds were randomly classified into 2 subsets of samples with representation of all feed types; one subset was used to develop regression models using partial least squares, and the second subset was used to conduct an external validation of the models. This study indicated that universal models containing all feed types and specific models containing concentrate feeds could provide only a relatively poor estimation of in situ DM degradation parameters because of compositional heterogeneity. More research, such as a particle size distribution analysis, is required to determine whether this lack of accuracy was due to limitations of the FTIR approach, or simply due to methodological error associated with the in situ method. This latter hypothesis may explain the low accuracy observed in the prediction of degradation rates if there was physical leakage of fine particles from the mesh bags used during in situ studies. In contrast, much better predictions were obtained when models were developed for forage feeds alone. Models for forages led to accurate predictions of DMA, DMB, NDFED, and NDF concentration (R 2 = 0. 91, 0. 89, 0. 85, and 0. 79, standard error = 4. 34, 5. 97, 4. 59, and 4. 41 % of DM, respectively), and could be used for screening of DMED, NDFC, and iNDF. These models relied on certain regions of the FTIR spectrum (900 ? 1150 and 1500 ? 1700 cm? 1), which are mainly compatible with absorption of plant cell wall components, such as cellulose, pectin, lignin, cutin, and suberin, but also with nonstructural carbohydrates and certain active compounds.

From these experiments it was concluded that : * The digestibility values of concentrate ingredients derived in maintenance-fed sheep are applicable to maintenance-fed cattle. * Feed is not utilised as efficiently when the level of feeding is increased from maintenance to 2 x maintenance. * The improved feed conversion efficiency in steers offered a restricted allowance of concentrates cannot be attributed to a difference in digestibility but can be attributed in part to a lower rate of fat deposition compared to steers offered ad libitum concentrates. * The residue after oil extraction from Camelina sativa could replace some imported protein-rich feedstuffs in ruminant rations but to fully achieve this potential, the residual oil content must be decreased. * For measurement of ruminal degradability of concentrate ingredients a wide range of forage to concentrate ratios and feeding levels can be used. * It is important to consider the actual outflow rate of nutrients from the rumen when measuring the feed value of individual concentrate ingredients as this can {{have an impact on the}} effective degradability and the relative nutritive values assigned to such ingredients. * Large variations in ruminal degradation occur within and among feeds. The ruminal degradability of different samples of any one feed should be measured to determine their true nutritive value for feeding ruminants. * Within most concentrate ingredients examined, the variation in small intestinal digestibility (SID) due to source indicates a range in the quantity of amino acids supplied to the animal for productive purposes. The more rapid and cost effective in vitro technique can be used to screen the SID of concentrate ingredients. * Target volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations and proportions may be produced by varying the proportions of the individual ingredients in a concentrate ration. * An in vitro procedure allowed VFA production to be measured across a large <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> under standardised conditions. * On average, 75 % of gas produced during ruminal fermentation consists of carbon dioxide. The variation in methane production among individual concentrate ingredients provides an opportunity to formulate rations to minimize environmental pollution with methane.

40|$|Organic plant raising {{has been}} {{investigated}} under two previous government funded projects (OF 0109 & OF 0144) (1, 2) and it was shown in this research that organic ‘transplants’ could be produced {{for a range of}} crop species (3, 4, 6, 7). However, some species were easier to produce than others and one of the limiting factors was the availability of suitable nutrient sources, especially for supplementary feeding. The use of animal based nutrient sources in organic plant raising has always been considered far from ideal and there are now moves within the EU to ban all animal bi-products in organic plant raising. This work aimed to identify suitable non-animal based nutrient sources to be used as base nutrients for growing media and as supplementary feeds. The objectives of the project are; 1. 	To identify suitable alternative, non-animal based nutrient sources for organic plant raising. 2. 	To assess these non-animal based nutrient sources under UK organic plant raising conditions. To identify suitable alternative, non-animal based nutrient sources for organic plant raising. A UK, European and international search (literature, web, phone/personal contacts) was undertaken in early 2002 to establish what suitable, non-animal based, nutrient sources were available. Information on the products was sourced from the producer, supplier or manufacture and collated. Products that were obviously not suitable for organic production were excluded. This search identified a wide range of different types of non-animal based nutrient sources. A range of these products were used in the assessments in objective 2. To assess these non-animal based nutrient sources under UK organic plant raising conditions. Media trials Three commercially available growing media which utilise a non-animal based nutrient source were identified; Sinclair, Vapogro and Melcourt and a fourth was made for the purposes of these trials in consultation with the manufacturer; Vapogro with double the added base nutrients. Two species with contrasting requirements (leek and cabbage) were used to assess the efficacy of these media. Cabbage •	The Sinclair, Vapogro and Melcourt media all produced cabbage transplants considered to be of an acceptable quality, when supplied with supplementary feed. •	The Vapogro media with double the normal strength of base feed was able to produce cabbage transplants of acceptable quality without the need for supplementary nutrients. •	The Vapogro media with double the normal strength of base feed was able to produce cabbage transplants that were as large as those produced in the Sinclair and Melcourt growing media with supplementary feed. Though they were at an earlier growth stage. •	When supplied with supplementary feed, the Vapogro medium with double the normal strength of base feed produced significantly larger cabbage transplants than the other three media, though they were not more advanced in terms of growth stage. •	The Sinclair, Vapogro and Melcourt media, when supplied with supplementary feed, produced cabbage transplants that were not significantly different from one another in most respects. •	Adding supplementary feed to all the media resulted in more severe aphid infestation. Leek •	All of the growing media used were only able to produce leek transplants of acceptable quality when supplementary nutrients were added. •	The largest most vigorous leek transplants were produced in the Melcourt media, this is particularly significant as this is a peat free medium. •	The Vapogro media with double the added base nutrients was able to produce acceptable leek transplants, but they were severely attacked by sciarid fly, which caused large numbers to die. Supplementary feed trials Four commercially available non-animal derived, organic supplementary feeds were identified (AmegA BIOFEED 5. 0 - 0 - 2. 5; Westland Organic Tomato and Vegetable liquid feed (WTV); Bioplasma NATURAL GROW and Gem Fruit ‘n’ Veg Fertilizer). These were tested against a standard animal derived organic feed and conventional mineral fertiliser feed. Two species with contrasting requirements (leek and cabbage) were used to assess the efficacy of these feeds in a single growing media (Vapogro). •	Two of the feeds, WTV and AmegaA (with added phosphorus) produced cabbage and leek transplants of acceptable quality, broadly equivalent to those fed Nu-Gro, the standard organic supplementary feed. •	AmegaA without added phosphorus produced lower quality transplants. •	Bioplasma NATURAL GROW and Gem Fruit ‘n’ Veg Fertilizer produced poor quality transplants, not significantly different from zero feed in most respects. •	The exception to this was the degree of rooting, which was lower in the feeds with largest shoots, AmegaA with added phosphorus, and WTV and highest with the Bioplasma NATURAL GROW feed. •	Leeks grown with AmegaA with added phosphorus suffered severe sciarid fly attack •	The use of AmegaA and WTV merit further investigation, particularly regards their field performance. Conclusion. This study has shown that there area range of non-animal based organic base and supplementary feeds available to the UK organic plant raiser. Although only a limited <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeds</b> were trialled on a limited number of species (cabbage and leeks) {{it is likely that the}} products available will produce suitable quality organic transplants. ...|$|E

Numerical results were obtained for a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> parameter, pressure ratio, groove length and orifice recess volume for compressibility numbers from 0 to 50.

Results showed that the addition of herringbone grooving to an externally pressurized bearing increases stability, but reduces load capacity at low compressibility numbers. A fully-grooved bearing is more stable than a partially-grooved bearing. Orifice recesses reduce stability, especially at high compressibility numbers...|$|R
