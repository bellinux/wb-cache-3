50|$|A reliable, but {{somewhat}} more complicated procedure for addressing software issues {{is known as}} a restore (also referred to as imaging, and/or reimaging), in which the computer's original installation image (including operating system and original applications) is reapplied to a formatted hard drive. Anything unique, such as settings, or personal files will be destroyed if not backed up on external media, as this reverts everything back to its original unused state. The computer technician can only <b>reimage</b> if there is an image of the hard drive for that computer either in a separate partition or stored elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|The {{beauty of}} {{technology}} brokering is not inventing totally new products, {{it is the}} ability to <b>reimage</b> or recreate a product while using an old idea/product. For example, the Craving Aid Patch was a product originally designed for smokers and in many cases seen as a medical procedure. Nonetheless, exactly the same idea has now been used to create a totally different product using the same technology. Similar to the Craving Aid Patch, which is just an old idea reinvented into a new product, the Verizon Hub, perhaps the most modern residential phone, is based on the very same idea as when it was first invented, in the years of Alexander Graham Bell.|$|E

5000|$|Later {{readers of}} Jin have {{advanced}} two main theories for his divergent positions of admiring the bandits and yet denouncing {{them as a}} group. Hu Shi argues that China during Jin's life was being torn apart by two bands of outlaws, so Jin {{did not believe that}} banditry should be glorified in fiction. This agrees well with Jin's philosophy. His Buddhist and Taoist beliefs advocated natural development for every individual in society, while the Confucian part of him respected the emperor and the state as the ultimate authority. The other possibility is that Jin's attempt to <b>reimage</b> the novel into a condemnation of the bandits was to save the novel after it had been banned by the Chongzhen Emperor. This second theory is far-fetched, as the emperor's decree banning the novel was not promulgated until a year after the completion of Jin's commentary. Jin's views on the characters aside, he has unconditional praise for the novel as a work of art. He praises the vivid and lively characters of the novel, saying, [...] "Shui-hu tells a story of 108 men: yet each has his own nature, his own temperament, his own outward appearance, and his own voice". He also praises the work's vivid description of events, frequently remarking that the prose is [...] "like a picture". Finally, Jin appreciates the technical virtuosity of the author, and names 15 separate techniques used by Shi Naian.|$|E

The refocused format received mixed positive and negative feedback from listeners. The station was completely <b>reimaged</b> on air again in December 2010 by Rich Van Slyke. In February 2011, Joel Salkowitz became involved with programming on The Vibe, and slightly refocused the format to sound more like Pulse 87, and even <b>reimaged</b> The Vibe in April 2011 with Alison Priestley, the voice of Pulse 87.|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} is experimental: {{we attempt to}} read data {{with the work of}} Karen Barad and in doing so ‘see’ teacher-student writing conferences (a common pedagogy of US elementary school writing) as intra-activity. Data were gathered during teacher-student writing conferences in a grade five US classroom over a six week period. One conference between a researcher and a male Latino student, a Student of Labels, is diffracted. Reading and writing and thinking with Barad disrupts our habitual ways of privileging language as representational. Rather, we consider the material-discursive practices of schooling that produce what comes to matter, leading us to <b>reimage</b> the teacher-student writing conference as entangled becoming-writingconferencing, speaking to the multiplicity of participants, merging of bodies, continual movement, open-ended possibilities, and anticipated transformation of intra-action...|$|E

40|$|Women in Irish fiction {{have been}} largely the {{creation}} of male writers, and the embodiment of religious virtues such as purity and passivity, conventionally regarded as “feminine. ” Not only the Roman Catholic Church but also the State progressively contributed to the social construct of Irish womanhood as inferior and, above all, domestic. From the 1960 s onwards many women writers have tried relentlessly to <b>reimage</b> women in their fiction. Feminist activist Maeve Kelly is an outstanding example of such writers whose work remains virtually unexplored. Very often Kelly’s protagonists are women in their conventional roles as wives and mothers who struggle for happiness and independence.

More common is an arrangement where the sky is imaged onto an intermediate focal plane containing an opaque spot; this focal plane is <b>reimaged</b> onto a detector. Another arrangement is to image the sky onto a mirror with a small hole: the desired light is reflected and eventually <b>reimaged,</b> but the unwanted light from the star goes through the hole and does not reach the detector.
