25|$|To {{complete}} an aerial refueling, the tanker and <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> rendezvous, flying in formation. The receiver {{moves to a}} position behind the tanker, within safe limits of travel for the boom, aided by director lights or directions radioed by the boom operator. Once in position, the operator extends the boom {{to make contact with}} the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Once in contact, fuel is pumped through the boom into the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern {{specialized}} {{tanker aircraft}} have equipment specially {{designed for the}} task of offloading fuel to the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft,</b> based on drogue and probe, even at the higher speeds modern jet aircraft typically need to remain airborne.|$|E
25|$|When {{the desired}} amount of fuel has been transferred, the two {{aircraft}} disconnect and the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> departs the formation. When not in use, the boom is stored {{flush with the}} bottom of the tanker's fuselage to minimize drag.|$|E

2500|$|This led to {{the concept}} of Differential GPS, which used {{separate}} radio systems to broadcast the correction signal to <b>receivers.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> could then install a receiver which would be plugged into the GPS unit, the signal being broadcast on a variety of frequencies for different users (FM radio for cars, longwave for ships, etc.). [...] Broadcasters of the required power generally cluster around larger cities, making such DGPS systems less useful for wide-area navigation. Additionally, most radio signals are either line-of-sight, or can be distorted by the ground, which made DGPS difficult to use as a precision approach system or when flying low for other reasons.|$|R

25|$|In June 1943, {{in-flight}} refueling {{trials were}} conducted at Eglin with a Consolidated B-24D Liberator modified as a tanker and a Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress as a <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> by Pennsylvania Central Airlines {{with the assistance}} of Flight Refuelling Limited engineers from the United Kingdom. The B-17 received the fuel through a grapple system mounted in the tail gunners position.|$|E
25|$|Some {{historic}} systems {{used for}} pioneering aerial refueling used the grappling method, where the tanker aircraft unreeled the fuel hose and the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> would grapple the hose midair, reel {{it in and}} connect it so that fuel can be transferred either {{with the assistance of}} pumps or simply by gravity feed. This was the method used on the Question Mark endurance flight in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the KC-10 {{had participated}} in other smaller conflicts. In March1999, NATO {{launched}} Operation Allied Force against the government of Yugoslavia. The mobility portion of the operation began in February and was heavily dependent on tankers. By early May1999, some 150 KC-10s and KC-135s deployed to Europe where they refueled bombers, fighters and support aircraft engaged in the conflict. The KC-10 flew 409 missions throughout the entire Allied Force campaign and continued support operations in Kosovo. Since 11September2001, KC-10s had also flown more than 350 missions guarding U.S. skies {{as a part of}} Operation Noble Eagle. During Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, KC-10s have flown more than 1,390 missions delivering critical air refueling support to numerous joint and Coalition <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft.</b> KC-10s are expected to serve until 2043.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of machine}} vision {{to track the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft’s</b> {{receptacle}} {{is one of the}} key steps in automated aerial refueling. Traditional Meanshift tracking algorithm’s kernel bandwidth is fixed, when the target size changes, it will produce with the bias even with the loss of the situation. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a kernel bandwidth adaptive algorithm based on corner matching. First, use backward tracking method to amend the core window center. Then according to the Harris algorithm to detect the corner, use small-scale approach for the two points between frames to match and regression analysis, namely determine the update parameters of nuclear window width. Experiments show that the algorithm can track the target accurately when the size of tracking target change, and the kernel window width can be better suited to the target size...|$|R
2500|$|The flying boom is {{attached}} {{to the rear of the}} tanker aircraft. [...] The attachment is gimballed, allowing the boom to move with the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The boom contains a rigid pipe to transfer fuel. The fuel pipe ends in a nozzle with a flexible ball joint. [...] The nozzle mates to the [...] "receptacle" [...] in the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> during fuel transfer. [...] A poppet valve in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver's refueling receptacle. [...] Once properly mated, toggles in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Alan Cobham's Grappled-line looped-hose air-to-air {{refueling}} system {{borrowed from}} techniques patented by David Nicolson and John Lord, and was publicly demonstrated {{for the first}} time in 1935. In the system the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft,</b> at one time an Airspeed Courier, trailed a steel cable which was then grappled by a line shot from the tanker, a Handley Page Type W10. The line was then drawn back into the tanker where the receiver's cable was connected to the refueling hose. The receiver could then haul back in its cable bringing the hose to it. Once the hose was connected, the tanker climbed sufficiently above the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> to allow the fuel to flow under gravity. (see reference #11 Gas Station in the Sky for detailed drawing of this type of operation.) ...|$|E
2500|$|VMGR-152 {{is capable}} of {{refueling}} helicopters, tilt-rotor and fixed-wing aircraft in support of tactical missions, training operations, or ferry flights. [...] This is accomplished {{through the use of}} the two refueling pods mounted under the wings of its KC-130J aircraft, outboard of the engines. [...] These pods trail a 93-foot hose attached to a stabilized paradrogue into which <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> plug.|$|E
50|$|Since 1 February 2009, only 406 MHz beacons are {{detected}} {{by the international}} Cospas-Sarsat SAR satellite system. This affects all maritime beacons (EPIRBs), all aviation beacons (ELTs) and all personal beacons (PLBs). In other words, Cospas-Sarsat has ceased satellite detection and processing of 121.5/243 MHz beacons. These older beacons are now only detectable by ground-based <b>receivers</b> and <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, {{moving the}} <b>receiver</b> {{component}} between <b>aircraft</b> and surface vehicles is illegal {{in most countries}} as radio frequency laws allocate separate bands for air and surface models. This is done for safety reasons.|$|R

This paper presents the four most suitable methods, two of which have been developed by the author. These methods are shown with a common symbology, and their strengths, weaknesses, analysis and operational use are compared...|$|R
2500|$|On 23 January 2007, the KC-767 {{flight test}} {{aircraft}} set a program milestone by making its first hookup with a <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft,</b> a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The [...] "dry contact" [...] transferred no fuel, but {{was intended to}} test the tanker's fifth-generation fly-by-wire telescoping boom. Unlike the KC-135 boom operator, who is prone, the KC-767 operator uses a remote station with a video display. The testing was being done at Edwards Air Force Base, and the test aircraft was destined for Italy once testing was complete.|$|E
2500|$|The probe-and-drogue {{refueling}} method {{employs a}} flexible hose that trails from the tanker aircraft. [...] The drogue (or para-drogue), sometimes called a basket, is a fitting resembling a shuttlecock, attached at its narrow end (like the [...] "cork" [...] nose of a shuttlecock) with a valve to a flexible hose. [...] The drogue stabilizes the hose in flight {{and provides a}} funnel to aid insertion of the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> probe into the hose. [...] The hose connects to a Hose Drum Unit (HDU). [...] When not in use, the hose/drogue is reeled completely into the HDU. The receiver has a probe, which is a rigid, protruding or pivoted retractable arm placed on the aircraft's nose or fuselage to make the connection. [...] Most modern versions of the probe are usually designed to be retractable, and are retracted when not in use, particularly on high speed aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{procedure}} {{allows the}} receiving aircraft to remain airborne longer, extending its range or loiter time on station. [...] A series of air refuelings can give range {{limited only by}} crew fatigue and engineering factors such as engine oil consumption. [...] Because the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> can be topped up with extra fuel in the air, air refueling can allow a takeoff with a greater payload which could be weapons, cargo, or personnel: the maximum takeoff weight is maintained by carrying less fuel and topping up once airborne. [...] Alternatively, a shorter take-off roll can be achieved because take-off can be at a lighter weight before refueling once airborne. Aerial refueling has also been considered {{as a means to}} reduce fuel consumption on long-distance flights greater than [...] Potential fuel savings in the range of 35-40% have been estimated for long haul flights (including the fuel used during the tanker missions).|$|E
50|$|The Vulcan {{was over}} its normal maximum {{take-off}} weight—each carried, {{as well as}} extra equipment like the DASH 10 and a chemical toilet, a highly experienced Air to Air Refuelling Instructor (AARI) from the Victor tanker force who would fly the Vulcan during refuelling—and fuel usage, was higher than expected. As {{a result of the}} fuel demand and problems in flight with refuelling, two of the Victors had to fly further south than planned, eating into their own reserves. At the Victor's final refuelling bracket, the sortie flew into a violent thunderstorm, during which the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft's</b> refuelling probe failed, forcing the provider aircraft to swap places and take back the fuel. XL189 the last Victor to refuel the Vulcan was past the last refuelling bracket before turning home. Tankers had to be sent south to refuel these Victors so they could reach Ascension. A total of 11 Victors were used to support Black Buck One: XH669, XH672, XL162, XL163, XL188, XL189, XL192, XL232, XL511, XL512 and XM717.|$|R
5000|$|Franklin Manufacturing and Franklin Automobile {{were both}} {{declared}} bankrupt April 3, 1934, after reporting $2,088,000 in bank loans long overdue. For three years, Franklin [...] "doggedly" [...] fought off failure. He had [...] "cajoled" [...] his bankers into renewing bank loans equal {{three times the}} company's current assets. Despite all hopes, reorganization plans fell through and the company passed into bankruptcy and {{the hands of a}} <b>receiver.</b> The <b>aircraft</b> engine subsidiary survived and was purchased by employees.|$|R
5000|$|The usual {{reason for}} [...] "transmitting blind" [...] {{would be that}} the captain of an {{aircraft}} knows or suspects that the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>receiver</b> has failed. The captain would still proceed according to the flight plan, and under obligation to let other people know of his whereabouts and decisions.|$|R
2500|$|USAF KC-135 and French Air Force KC-135FR refueling-boom {{equipped}} tankers can be field {{converted to}} a probe-and-drogue system using a special adapter unit. [...] In this configuration, the tanker retains its articulated boom, but has a hose/drogue {{at the end of}} it instead of the usual nozzle. [...] The tanker boom operator holds the boom in a static position, while the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> then flies the probe into the basket. [...] Unlike the soft canvas basket used in most drogue systems, the adapter units use a steel basket, grimly known as the “iron maiden” by naval aviators because of its unforgiving nature. [...] Soft drogues can be contacted slightly off center, wherein the probe is guided into the hose receptacle by the canvas drogue. [...] The metal drogue, when contacted even slightly off center, will pivot out of place, potentially “slapping” the aircraft’s fuselage and causing damage.|$|E
2500|$|The tanker {{aircraft}} flies straight and level and extends the hose/drogue which {{is allowed to}} trail out behind and below the tanker under normal aerodynamic forces. The pilot of the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> extends his probe (if required) and uses normal flight controls to [...] "fly" [...] the refueling probe directly into the basket. [...] This requires a closure rate of approximately two knots (walking speed) {{in order to establish}} solid probe/drogue coupling and push the hose several feet into the HDU. [...] Too little closure will cause an incomplete connection and no fuel flow (or occasionally leaking fuel). Too much closure is dangerous because it can trigger a strong transverse oscillation in the hose, severing the probe tip. Another significant danger is that the drogue may hit the recipient aircraft and damage it—instances have occurred in which the drogue has shattered the canopy of a fighter aircraft, causing great danger to its pilot.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the closing}} months of World War II, {{it had been}} {{intended}} that Tiger Force's Lancaster and Lincoln bombers would be in-flight refueled by converted Halifax tanker aircraft, fitted with the FRL's looped-hose units, in operations against the Japanese homelands, but the war ended before the aircraft could be deployed. After the war ended, the USAF bought {{a small number of}} FRL looped-hose units and fitted a number of B-29s as tankers to refuel specially equipped B-29s and later B-50s. The USAF made only one major change between the system used by the RAF. The USAF version had auto-coupling of the refueling nozzle, where the leader line with the refueling hose is pulled to the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> and a refueling receptacle on the belly of the aircraft, allowing high-altitude air-to-air refueling and doing away with the aircraft having to fly to a lower altitude to be depressurized so a crew member could manually do the coupling. [...] This was the air-to-air refueling system that the Lucky Lady II used to make its famous first non-stop [...] around-the-world flight in 1949.|$|E
40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation provides {{flight test}} {{results of the}} automatic in-flight refueling of an Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using an automated hose-and-drogue refueling method.

50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{approaching a}} runway {{is guided by}} the ILS <b>receivers</b> in the <b>aircraft</b> by performing modulation depth comparisons. Many aircraft can route signals into the autopilot to fly the approach automatically. An ILS consists of two independent sub-systems. The localizer provides lateral guidance; the glide slope provides vertical guidance.|$|R
50|$|The MCL {{was based}} on the {{bistatic}} radar principle, using separated transmitters and <b>receivers.</b> An <b>aircraft</b> flying anywhere between the stations would reflect some of the transmitted signal towards the receiver, where it would mix with the signal travelling directly from the transmitter. The resulting change in signal is very easy to detect using simple electronics, and the transmitter is not pulsed so it does not require high voltages and is very simple as well. This leads to a very low-cost system that can cover huge areas, at the cost of providing no information about the precise location of the target.|$|R
2500|$|Usually, the {{aircraft}} providing the fuel is specially {{designed for the}} task, although refueling pods can be fitted to existing aircraft designs if the [...] "probe-and-drogue" [...] system is to be used. [...] The cost of the refueling equipment on both tanker and <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> and the specialized aircraft handling of {{the aircraft}} to be refueled (very close [...] "line astern" [...] formation flying) {{has resulted in the}} activity only being used in military operations. [...] There is no known regular civilian in-flight refueling activity. [...] Originally employed shortly before World War II on a very limited scale to extend the range of British civilian transatlantic flying boats, and then after World War II on a large scale to extend the range of strategic bombers, aerial refueling since the Vietnam War has been extensively used in large-scale military operations for many different military aircraft operations. [...] For instance, in the Gulf War and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the Iraq War, all coalition air sorties were air-refueled except for a few short-range ground attack sorties in the Kuwait area.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the probe}} is a valve that is closed until it mates with the drogue's forward {{internal}} receptacle, after which it opens and allows fuel to pass from tanker to receiver. [...] The valves in the probe and drogue that are most commonly used are to a NATO standard and were originally developed by the company Flight Refuelling Limited in the UK and deployed in the late 1940s and 1950s. [...] This standardization allows drogue-equipped tanker aircraft from many nations the ability to refuel probe-equipped aircraft from other nations. [...] The NATO standard probe system incorporates shear rivets that attach the refueling valve to {{the end of the}} probe. [...] This is so that if a large side or vertical load develops while in contact with the drogue, the rivets shear and the fuel valve breaks off, rather than the probe or <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> suffering structural damage. [...] A so-called [...] "broken probe" [...] (actually a broken fuel valve, as described above) may happen if poor flying technique is used by the receiver pilot, or in turbulence. [...] Sometimes the valve is retained in the tanker drogue and prevents further refueling from that drogue until removed during ground maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|The optimal {{approach}} is {{from behind and}} below (not level with) the drogue. [...] Because the drogue is relatively light (typically soft canvas webbing) and subject to aerodynamic forces, it can be pushed around by the bow wave of approaching aircraft, exacerbating engagement even in smooth air. [...] After initial contact, the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver a certain distance (typically, a few feet), and the hose is reeled slowly back onto its drum in the HDU. [...] This opens the tanker's main refueling valve allowing fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure (assuming the tanker crew has energized the pump). [...] Tension on the hose is aerodynamically 'balanced' by a motor in the HDU so that as the <b>receiver</b> <b>aircraft</b> moves fore and aft, the hose retracts and extends, thus preventing bends in the hose that would cause undue side loads on the probe. [...] Fuel flow is typically indicated by illumination of a green light near the HDU. [...] If the hose is pushed in too far or not far enough, a cutoff switch will inhibit fuel flow, which is typically accompanied by an amber light. [...] Disengagement is commanded by the tanker pilot with a red light.|$|E
50|$|The code is {{received}} by any <b>aircraft</b> <b>receiver</b> monitoring the radio frequency {{on which the}} SELCAL code is broadcast. A SELCAL decoder is connected to each <b>aircraft's</b> radio <b>receiver.</b> When a SELCAL decoder on an aircraft receives a signal containing its own assigned SELCAL code, it alerts the aircraft's crew by sounding a chime, activating a light, or both.|$|R
5000|$|Eight KC-135R {{aircraft}} are receiver-capable tankers, {{commonly referred to}} as KC-135R(RT). All eight aircraft were with the 22d Air Refueling Wing at McConnell AFB, Kansas, in 1994. [...] They are primarily used for force extension and Special Operations missions, and are crewed by highly qualified receiver capable crews. If not used for the <b>receiver</b> mission, these <b>aircraft</b> can be flown just like any other KC-135R.|$|R
5000|$|VOR/DME {{refers to}} {{combined}} radio navigation station for aircraft, {{which consists of}} two radio beacons, placed together, a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME). VOR produces an angle between the station and the <b>receiver</b> in the <b>aircraft,</b> while DME does the same for range. Together, they provide the two measurements needed to produce a navigational [...] "fix" [...] using a chart.|$|R
