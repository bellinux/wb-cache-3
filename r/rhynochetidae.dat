5000|$|Eurypygiformes is {{an order}} {{formed by the}} kagus, {{comprising}} two species in the family <b>Rhynochetidae</b> endemic to New Caledonia, and the sunbittern (Eurypyga helias) from the tropical regions of the Americas. [...] Its closest relatives {{appear to be the}} tropicbirds of the tropical Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans.|$|E
50|$|The {{generic name}} Rhynochetos, and the clade name <b>Rhynochetidae,</b> {{are derived from}} the Greek rhis meaning nose and chetos meaning corn, {{referring}} to the corn-shaped flaps over the nostrils. The specific name jubatus {{is derived from the}} Latin iabatus meaning crested. The name kagu is derived from the Melanesian names for the species. The species is variously known as the kavu or kagou in the Kanak languages, and as the cagou in French (also used as an alternative spelling in English).|$|E
50|$|New Caledonia's animal land {{diversity}} {{was similar}} to that of some oceanic islands, particularly New Zealand and as in these islands, the biodiversity was greater before being inhabited by humans. The island has no native mammals except for bats and no native amphibians. The vertebrates are dominated by reptiles and birds. Today the island has 21 endemic species of birds, including one endemic family, the <b>Rhynochetidae,</b> represented by one living species, the kagu. The island is also home to the unusual tool-using New Caledonian crow. The separation of the Gondwana islands before the mammalian expansion that allowed the radiation of flightless birds (moa, kiwi, sylviornis, cagous) and Mesozoic reptilian forms such as the tuatara of New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|While the kagu is {{the only}} living species in the family <b>Rhynochetidae,</b> a larger species, the lowland kagu (Rhynochetos orarius), has been {{described}} from Holocene subfossil remains. The measurements of this species were 15% bigger than Rhynochetos jubatus, with no overlap in measurements except those of the forelimbs. Given that the sites where R. orarius were all lowland sites, and that no fossils of R. jubatus were found in these sites, the scientists that described the fossils suggested they represented highland and lowland species respectively. R. orarius {{is one of many}} species to have become extinct in New Caledonia after the arrival of humans. The validity of the species has been questioned by some authors, but accepted by others.|$|E
50|$|The kagu or cagou (Rhynochetos jubatus) is a crested, long-legged, and bluish-grey bird {{endemic to}} the dense {{mountain}} forests of New Caledonia. It {{is the only}} surviving member of the genus Rhynochetos and the family <b>Rhynochetidae,</b> although a second species has been described from the fossil record. Measuring 55 cm in length, it has pale grey plumage and bright red legs. Its 'nasal corns' are a unique feature not shared with any other bird. Almost flightless, it spends its time {{on or near the}} ground, where it hunts its invertebrate prey, and builds a nest of sticks on the forest floor. Both parents share incubation of a single egg, as well as rearing the chick. It has proven vulnerable to introduced predators, and is threatened with extinction.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are only}} two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds {{traditionally}} classified as Gruiformes. Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and sungrebe (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and cranes (Gruidae) compose the suborder Grues and are termed [...] "core-Gruiformes" [...] (Fain et al. 2007). These are the only true Gruiformes. The suborder Eurypygae includes the kagu (<b>Rhynochetidae)</b> and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), button-quails (Turnicidae), Australian plains-wanderer (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and bustards (Otididae) each represent distinct and unrelated lineages. Many families known only from fossils have been assigned to the Gruiformes, e.g., Ergilornithidae, Phorusrhacidae, Messelornithidae, Eogruidae, Idiornithidae, Bathornithidae, {{to name just a}} few (see below). Though some of these are superficially 'crane-like' and the possibility that some may even be related to extant families traditionally included in the Gruiformes, there are no completely extinct families that can be confidently assigned to core-Gruiformes.|$|E

However, it is shown that the original description of these birds contains several misinterpretations and that the presumed synapomorphies of the taxon (Messelornithidae + Eurypygidae) are not present in Messel rails. Moreover, it is generally assumed that the closest extant relative of sunbitterns i the New Caledonian kagu (<b>Rhynochetidae),</b> and Messel rails lack significant derived characters supporting monophyly of the taxon (<b>Rhynochetidae</b> + Eurypygidae).

40|$|With {{recently}} derived algorithms, it {{is possible}} to calculate the relative phylogenetic distinctiveness of taxa with respect to patterns of phylogenetic branching. We extended this approach by exploring the relative extent to which taxa represent phenotypic biodiversity. We devised a method, based on the use of independent contrasts, that measures the amount of phenotypic change that occurs when lineages diverge. We use this method to quantify {{the extent to which a}} taxon represents the phenotypic diversification that has occurred in the past. We applied our method to an analysis of variation in clutch size across 133 avian families. All families did not contribute equally to representing clutch size diversification. The top 10 avian families in terms of representing clutch size diversification were the mesites (Mesitornithidae), cranes (Gruidae), bustards (Otidae), new world quail (Odontophoridae), seriemas (Cariamidae), finfoots (Heliornithidae), swallows (Hirundinidae), megapodes (Megapodiae), and guans (Cracidae). The 217 species in these 10 families (2. 3 % of all bird species, 7. 5 % of families) represented 19. 3 % of diversification in clutch size. Seventeen percent of overall clutch size diversification was represented by taxa threatened with extinction. The 10 families that represent the greatest proportion of overall clutch size diversification threatened by extinction were the mesites (Mesitornithidae), kagu (<b>Rhynochetidae),</b> cranes (Gruidae), kiwis (Apterygidae), new world quail (Odontophoridae), megapodes (Megapodiae), cassowaries (Casuariidae), finfoots (Heliornithidae), guans (Cracidae), and logrunners (Orthonychidae). The 42 threatened species (0. 5 % of all bird species, 3. 8 % of all threatened bird species) in these 10 families encompassed 53 % of the clutch size diversification whose representation was threatened with extinction. Our results suggest that this type of analysis could potentially help prioritize species-based conservation efforts by identifying those taxa that contribute most toward representing the evolutionary processes that lead to current phenotypic biodiversity...|$|E
