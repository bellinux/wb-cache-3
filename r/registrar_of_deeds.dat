40|$|A {{survey on}} land {{ownership}} in the Great Plains was conducted by the Farm Economics Research Division, Agricultural Research Services, U. S. Department of Agriculture in 1958. This study was specifically designed {{to make use of}} data obtained in this 1958 survey concerning land tenure, farm finance and land market problems of the Great Plains Region. Seventeen counties distributed geographically in the various economic areas of Nebraska were randomly selected for this study. A random sample of approximately 375 owners was drawn in each of the counties. Names and addresses of rural land owners were obtained from district or county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation offices or from records of county clerks, assessors, or <b>registrars</b> <b>of</b> <b>deeds.</b> Steps in compiling the list included: Compiling a list of names of all rural land owners with tracts of 2. 5 acres or more. Checking to eliminate duplications and to insure that it included all individuals, estates, and partnerships. Partnerships, estates and corporations were treated as single owners. Objectives of the survey were to ascertain the types of persons owning Nebraska farm land according to occupation, farming experience, age, sex and residence of landlord in relation to location of farms, and the tenure arrangement with the operator of the land. The survey also attempted to determine the reasons that different people had for owning land {{and the extent to which}} ownership of land was retained by people who were farmers in the past but are no longer farming. Analysis of change in land ownership patterns between 1946 and 1958 was made possible by comparing results of the study conducted in 1958 to results of a similar study conducted in 1946. Although the questions on the two survey differed, many of the basic characteristics of land ownership patterns in 1958 and 1945 could be compared. Advisor: Loyd K. Fische...|$|R
