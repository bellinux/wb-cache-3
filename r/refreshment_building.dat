50|$|The Old Hill {{ground with}} its grassy tree lined slopes set next to Haden Hill Park is rated {{to be one}} of the prettiest in the country. On joining the league in 1920 the ground was basin shaped with a {{pronounced}} slope. Measures were taken in 1923 to level off the playing area and a scoreboard and press box were erected. The ground was originally held on a lease but in 1934 the club raised £3,000 in ten weeks to buy the ground and a tablet was unveiled in 1938 in the pavilion recording the names of donors and a celebration in 1935 of the Silver Jubilee of King George V and Queen Mary. The ground was levelled off and enlarged to its present state in 1947 and a <b>refreshment</b> <b>building</b> was erected in 1950. This building was further extended in 1977 and in the late 1990s a successful application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts enabled a grant to be obtained which extended the present Clubhouse.|$|E

500|$|In 1912 WSPU members adopted arson {{as another}} tactic {{to win the}} vote. After Prime Minister Asquith had visited the Theatre Royal in Dublin, suffragette activists Gladys Evans, Mary Leigh, Lizzie Baker and Mabel Capper of Oxford Street, Manchester {{attempted}} to cause an explosion using gunpowder and benzine, which resulted in minimal damage. During the same evening Mary Leigh threw an axe at the carriage containing John Redmond, the Lord Mayor, and Prime Minister Asquith. Over {{the next two years}} women set fire to a <b>refreshments</b> <b>building</b> in Regent's Park, an orchid house at Kew Gardens, pillar boxes, and a railway carriage. Although Pankhurst confirmed that these women had not been commanded by her or Christabel, they both assured the public that they supported the arsonist suffragettes. There were similar incidents around the country. One WSPU member, for example, put a small hatchet into the Prime Minister's carriage inscribed with the words: [...] "Votes for Women," [...] and other suffragettes used acid to burn the same slogan into golf courses used by MPs. In 1914 Mary Richardson slashed the Velasquez painting Rokeby Venus to protest against Pankhurst's imprisonment.|$|R

40|$|We give an {{overview}} of how data visualization and data analysis are used within the Florida Panthers organization and around the National Hockey League {{in a variety of}} different contexts. We discuss how analytics can be used to assist an NHL team’s front office, coaching staff, and scouting department. We also discuss the kinds of data we encounter on the business side of the organization in departments like sales and marketing. One example that we will discuss at length is a data-driven approach to predicting the popularity of a game, using only information that is known before tickets go on sale, when we have no sales data for individual games. Join us for a reception to welcome Dr. MacDonald at 6 : 00 PM outside of Knight Auditorium in the DeSantis <b>Building.</b> <b>Refreshments</b> will be served...|$|R

5000|$|The {{library is}} housed in the former Rondebosch Town Hall. The main library is {{situated}} in the hall itself, which is no longer used for public meetings, {{as well as on}} the stage and in two side rooms, while the children's section is housed upstairs and on the balcony. The building was designed by George Murray Alexander and completed in 1899. In addition to a large public hall with a roof over 10m high, a stage and balcony, the building was designed to hold municipal offices, a public library and <b>refreshment</b> rooms. The <b>building</b> is made of rough stone, which has been painted a dull beige, and has high teak doorways and a teak staircase.

40|$|Godspell: A Community Celebration {{is a free}} musical {{that was}} held in the {{sanctuary}} of Union Chapel Ministries March 30 and April 1 at 7 : 00 pm. This musical was initiated and directed by Ball State University senior Brittany Lee for her Honors College Creative Honors Thesis. Godspell: A Community Celebration is a musical that strives for theatrical excellence through providing the community of Muncie and Union Chapel Ministries a free theatrical experience that is culturally relevant, thought provoking and entertaining. These things will be accomplished through modernizing the language, music, and jokes in Godspell, striving for performance excellence in dance, acting, and music, creating an audience centered show, creating an theatrical setting and environment which is applicable to the specific community of Muncie, IN and Union Chapel Ministries, and through involving as many members of that community as possible. Beyond the theatrical experience, Godspell: A Community Celebration will provide opportunities for community and church members to serve in a variety of facets. This project will use the talents of everyone willing to serve. Specifically, Godspell: A Community Celebration will require the talents and time of over fifty people performing, videotaping, serving and greeting, providing childcare, donating, making, and serving <b>refreshments,</b> designing and <b>building</b> set and props, buying and sewing costumes, creating and teaching choreography and music and service in many other facets.
