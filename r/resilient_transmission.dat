40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a packet-loss {{resilient}} system for the transmission of progressively compressed three-dimensional (3 -D) models. It {{is based on a}} joint source and channel coding approach that trades off geometry precision for increased error resiliency to optimize the decoded model quality on the client side. We derive a theoretical framework for the overall system by which the channel packet loss behavior and the channel bandwidth can be directly related to the decoded model quality at the receiver. First, the 3 -D model is progressively compressed into a base mesh and a number of refinement layers. Then, we assign optimal forward error correction code rates to protect these layers according to their importance to the decoded model quality. Experimental results show that with the proposed unequal error protection approach, the decoded model quality degrades more gracefully (compared to either no error protection or equal error protection methods) as the packet-loss rate increases.

40|$|Abstract — Frames and oversampled filter {{banks have}} been {{extensively}} studied {{over the past}} few years due to their increased design freedom and improved error resilience. In frame expan-sions, the least square signal reconstruction operator is called the dual frame, which can be obtained by choosing the synthesis filter bank as the para-pseudo inverse of the analysis bank. In this paper, we study the computation of the dual frame by exploiting the Greville formula, which was originally derived in 1960 to compute the pseudo inverse of a matrix when a new row is appended. Here, we first develop the backward Greville formula to handle the case of row deletion. Based on the forward Greville formula, we then study the computation of para-pseudo inverse for extended filter banks and Laplacian pyramids. Through the backward Greville formula, we investigate the frame-based error <b>resilient</b> <b>transmission</b> over erasure channels. The necessary and sufficient condition for an oversampled filter bank to be robust to one erasure channel is derived. A post-filtering structure is also presented to implement the para-pseudo inverse when the transform coefficients in one subband are completely lost...|$|E

The H. 264 compressed video is convolutionally encoded and transmitted over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Two iterative joint source-channel decoding schemes are proposed, in which slice candidates that failed semantic verification are exploited. The first proposed scheme uses soft values of bits {{produced by a}} soft-input soft-output channel decoder to generate a list of slice candidates for each slice in the compressed video sequence. These slice candidates are semantically verified to choose the best one. A new semantic checking method is proposed, which uses information from slice candidates that failed semantic verification to virtually check the current slice candidate. The second proposed scheme is built on the first one. This scheme also uses slice candidates that failed semantic verification but it uses them to modify soft values of bits at the source decoder before they are fed back into the channel decoder for the next iteration. Simulation results show that both schemes offer improvements in terms of subjective quality {{and in terms of}} objective quality using PSNR and BER as measures.

40|$|The {{generation}} of electricity from fossil fuels is {{a major contributor to}} climate change and cannot be sustained indefinitely. Renewables can provide electricity in a more sustainable manner, however supplies from sources such as wind and solar can be variable and unpredictable. Hydropower and tidal energy offer more predictable generation capacity, making them appealing for a <b>resilient</b> <b>transmission</b> system. This is particularly true in the context of decentralised power grids, which harness smaller amounts of energy {{from a wide range of}} sources to improve transmission efficiency and reliability. Yet for tidal power in particular, little work has been done thus far on developing small scale technology capable of working efficiently in low flow speed (< 2 m/s) conditions. This research was conducted to identify, design and develop a device capable of generating pico scale power (< 1 kW) in shallow water, low input tidal and river conditions. The result is the Water Hammer Energy System (WHES), a novel design that makes use of water hammer pressure surges to generate vertical oscillations from a horizontal flow of water. The hydrodynamics of the system are investigated through a combination of experimental and theoretical work, with studies conducted into the e↵ect of input head, flow rate, and device size on performance. A 16 mm diameter experimental device was found to provide a piston with a mean power of 8 mW. Data from this study was used to validate a mathematical model, which predicted a maximum hydrodynamic efficiency of 23. 1 % for a 1 m 2 device operating at a 0. 50 Hz valve closure frequency in 0. 4 m/s flow. Assuming a 30 % generator efficiency, such a device operating in the mouth of Poole Harbour (where the peak flow speeds reach 1. 69 m/s) could supply an average of 1. 14 kW of power. Over the course of a year, this would provide enough electrical energy to supply 2 typical UK houses and o↵set 5. 55 tonnes of CO 2. 5. 85 kW would be generated in a constant flow of 1. 69 m/s, sufficient to supply the annual electricity requirements of 11 typical UK households and o↵set nearly 30 tonnes of CO 2. With further development, the system may therefore be a viable method of generating pico scale hydropower from shallow water, low input sites...|$|E
40|$|The {{first two}} parts of the thesis address the issues related to 3 D video {{transmission}} over wireless networks and proposes cross-layer design techniques to optimise the information exchange between dif- ferent Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers or system blocks. In particular, the first section of this thesis exploits the flexibility of adjusting the checksum coverage length of the transport layer pro- tocol, UDP-lite as opposed to its counterpart UDP. The study pro- poses an optimum checksum coverage length to protect only impor- tant header information of an H. 264 encoded video transmission over wireless links, together with robust header compression (RoHC) and Automatic Retransmission Request (ARQ). The second part of the thesis investigates a content and Channel aware Medium Access Con- trol (MAC) layer scheduling algorithm by considering the layer prior- ities of an H. 264 Scalable Video Coding (SVC) encoded 3 D video transmission over an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Ac- cess (OFDMA) based wireless link with a prioritised queuing tech- nique to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end users. A considerable amount of research time was devoted to investigat- ing accurate, consistent and real-time quality evaluation techniques for 3 D image/ video as cross-layer design techniques mostly rely on the quality feedbacks from end users to optimise system parameters. The first quality metric proposed is a stereoscopic image quality met- ric using the disparity histogram of the left and right views. A 3 D stereoscopic video quality evaluation technique is proposed, based on the predominant energy distribution of gradients using 3 D structural tensors in the next section. Finally, a near no reference quality metric is proposed for colour plus depth 3 D video compression and transmis- sion, using the extracted edge information of colour images and depth maps. The research investigates a number of error <b>resilient</b> <b>transmission</b> methods to combat artifacts in 3 D video delivery over wireless chan- nels. A Region-of-Interest (ROI) based transmission method for stereo- scopic videos has been proposed to mark the important areas of the video and provide Unequal Error Protection (UEP) during transmis- sion. Next, we investigate the effects of compression and packet loss on the rendered video quality and propose a model to quantify ren- dering and concealment errors at the sender-side and then use the information generated through the model to effectively deliver 3 D.

In this image coder, the dual-sliding wavelet transform (DSWT) is first applied to image data to generate wavelet coefficients in fixed-size blocks. Here, a block consists of wavelet coefficients only from a single subband. Then, the resulting coefficient blocks are directly coded with the Low-Complexity Binary Description (LCBiD) coefficient coding algorithm. No parent-child relationship is exploited in the coding process. There is no intermediate buffering needed between DSWT and LCBiD. The compressed bit stream generated by the proposed coder is both SNR and resolution scalable, as well as highly <b>resilient</b> to <b>transmission</b> errors.
