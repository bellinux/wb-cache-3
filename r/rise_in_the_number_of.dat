5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees {{to care for the}} remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America.

5|$|While {{extensive}} {{technical studies}} and the raising of finance for the project were in progress, the city expanded significantly resulting in a twofold rise in population and a fivefold <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> vehicles between 1981 and 1998. Consequently, traffic congestion and pollution soared, as {{an increasing number of}} commuters took to private vehicles with the existing bus system unable to bear the load. An attempt at privatising the bus transport system in 1992 merely compounded the problem, with inexperienced operators plying poorly maintained, noisy and polluting buses on lengthy routes, resulting in long waiting times, unreliable service, extreme overcrowding, unqualified drivers, speeding and reckless driving. To rectify the situation, the Government of India and the Government of Delhi jointly set up a company called the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on 3 May 1995, with E.
