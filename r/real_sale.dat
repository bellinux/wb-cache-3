Suppose that A sells £100 worth of goods to B at six months’ credit, and takes a bill at six months for it; and that B, within a month after, sells the same goods, at a like credit, to C, taking a like bill; and again, that C, after another month, sells them to D, taking a like bill, and so on. There may then, at the end of six months, be six bills of £100 each existing at the same time, and every one of these may possibly have been discounted. Of all these bills, then, only one represents any actual property.|$|E

The sale value accounting has various advantages. It can adapt to economic environment by evaluating assets on the sale value. It has logically consistency of valuation and additivity by measuring all assets, liabilities and capital on the same attribute that is cash equivalents. The sale value accounting can meet the important accounting criteria which are empirical testability and relevance by measuring empirical phenomena and relating decision making models. The <b>real</b> <b>sale</b> value accounting has an uniform measurement system and it can compare between companies and between periods in the real meaning by revising all accounting figures on a general price index.

40|$|Abstract: The {{substitution}} between {{products is}} a common phenomenon in supply chain management when customers find their favorite product unavailable. Product substitution can improve the availability of different products and thus improve the customer service level, especially when the high-end product substitutes for the low-end product. In this paper, we construct profit model of downward substitution strategy and apply the optimal theory to compute the optimal order quantity and the maximal profit under this strategy in the first place, and then some relationships between product wholesale price, sale price, net salvage value and optimal order quantity are investigated. By analyzing {{the relationship between these}} different factors, we can obtain the compact of substitution strategy on product sale, which can provide management insight to <b>real</b> <b>sale</b> activity...|$|E
40|$|Privatization is the {{transferring}} {{of ownership}} {{from state to}} private ownership expecting that the lackluster and unsatisfactory performance of state-owned enterprises can be improved. This study was focuses on the evaluation of operating and financial performances of the privatized firms which issued shares in capital market. The research {{was carried out by}} investigating the performance of the firms after privatization, and evaluating the performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the short-run and the long-run. The performance were studied through statistical analysis of the dependency of several independent variables namely performance proxies i. e. soft budget constraint, fraction of share sold, share allocated to employee and top management team change on dependent variables i. e. return on sales (ROS), return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), <b>real</b> <b>sale</b> and net income. Several factors associated with the variation in initial returns such as percentage of share sold, uncertainty about the future firm value, market index fluctuation prior to the issue, size of firm and the value of issue {{on the first day of}} trading were analyzed statistically to evaluate the short-run and the long-run performances. The results showed that the performance proxies ROS, ROA and ROE deteriorated and real sales and net profit of the firms improved upon privatization. The factors that are responsible to the performance changes differ depending on the performance proxies. The factors responsible for ROS are the short-term debt to total asset and the share allocated to employee, the fraction of share sold and the share allocated to employee are responsible for ROA, while the ROE is affected by the top management team change only. The <b>real</b> <b>sale</b> is influenced by the fraction of share sold and the share allocated to employee, while net profit is not affected by any factor considered in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of emotional labor on instances of burnout by specifically focusing on <b>real</b> estate <b>sales</b> professionals. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (2008) cites the purchase or sale of a home as one of the most substantial and complicated financial events most people ever experience, thereby magnifying the challenges of work and communication in the <b>real</b> estate <b>sales</b> profession and providing a rich framework for understanding the concepts of emotional labor and burnout. A three part questionnaire focused on emotional labor and burnout was distributed to 450 <b>real</b> estate <b>sales</b> professionals in early March, 2008. Linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the predictive values of emotional labor components with burnout components. Findings in this study indicated that <b>real</b> estate <b>sales</b> professionals may rarely be required to display feelings in prescribed ways due to the autonomous nature of <b>real</b> estate <b>sales</b> work. Various implications and suggestions related to identification and empathy surfaced in the discussion chapter as components of emotional labor and burnout were considered in the context of the <b>real</b> estate <b>sales</b> profession...|$|R

40|$|Five {{hypotheses}} were put forth {{to explain the}} dominance of farm-expansion buyers in the farmland market. Those {{hypotheses were}}: economies of size, excess machinery, wealth, excess labor and quality of management. It was hypothesized that among farmland buyers, farm-expansion buyers {{are most likely to}} consider such factors in their bid price for land;Those five hypotheses have been suggested in the literature, but not all of them have been theoretically evaluated or empirically tested. Those hypotheses that have been tested, were tested by models using aggregate land value data, whereas a micro-land-price-data set of Iowa farmland sales was used in this study. From this data set, 128 observations were selected from the years 1975 to 1979 and were grouped by the six Iowa price-reporting districts;A linear regression model was constructed and estimated by using ordinary least squares to explain the variation in <b>real</b> <b>sale</b> price. Independent variables used to test the hypotheses were the inverse of total acres farmed, a dummy variable indicating excess machinery, acres owned times the real-average-county land value, a dummy variable indicating excess labor and the number of years of education and farm experience. Other independent variables were included to capture the effect of expected returns, location, land contracts, size of purchase and building value. The intercept was allowed to shift by year and price-reporting district. A second model replaced the inverse of total acres farmed, the economies of size variable, with horsepower per acre. A number of the variables had missing observations, which were replaced by the sample mean;The results indicate that approximately 54 percent of the variation in <b>real</b> <b>sale</b> price was explained by the two different versions of the model. All of the estimates had the hypothesized sign with the exception of years of experience. Of the variables used to capture the effect of the farm-expansion hypotheses, only the estimate for the horsepower per acre specification of the economies of size hypothesis was significant at the 5 percent level. Estimates for other variables that were significant were expected returns, size of purchase and distance to marketing center...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} public schools is often cited as an {{important}} attribute which distinguishes a community. Indeed, a recent public opinion poll conducted by the California Public Education Partnership indicates that residents rank improvements in public education higher than such high profile issues as environmental quality and crime reduction. In order to explore the role of educational quality in determining residential property values, a hedonic housing price model is used on a large sample of homes which sold within Fresno County in California over the period 1990 - 1994. After controlling {{for a wide range}} of housing characteristics and neighborhood features, the findings indicate that the school district does significantly influence the <b>real</b> <b>sale</b> price. Then the relative importance of inputs into the production of educational services is investigated as compared to output measures of productivity. These findings suggest that both input and output measures are important. However, elasticity estimates of input measures tend to be higher than those of output measures, with the average class size by far the strongest influence. There is some evidence to suggest that the benefits of additional teachers likely outweigh the costs. Finally, the findings suggest that attributes of schools are more highly valued by local residents than either crime or environmental quality measures within the community.

Though long associated with Color Field painting, Christensen 2 ̆ 7 s relentless experimentation with style and technique places him among this country 2 ̆ 7 s most ambitious abstract and gestural painters. Christensen was born in Lexington, Nebraska and grew up outside of Cozad. As a teenager Christensen listened to music on radio stations from Shreveport and Little Rock and grew fond of soul, blues, and pop music. His early aspirations to reach beyond his Midwest roots and experience a larger world, coupled with a youthful sense of independence and self-reliance, contributed to his eventual move to New York City. In 1964 {{he graduated from the}} Kansas City Art Institute and after one year of graduate school moved to the East Coast where he spent the rest of his life. Although he was painting the figure when he arrived in New York, he soon made an abrupt break from this style. Artists in Christensen 2 ̆ 7 s circle met and shared ideas at Max 2 ̆ 7 s Kansas City, a bar on Park Avenue South in New York City. There, Christensen met Minimalist artists Carl Andre and Brice Marden, whom he considered important early influences.
