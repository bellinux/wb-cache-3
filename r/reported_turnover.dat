Participants, 204 Registered Nurses currently employed by a hospital, were asked to report on a negative work event. Only satisfaction with the organization's response to the event affected justice perceptions regarding the shock event. Events perceived as unjust or unfair were negatively related to perceived compatibility with the organization, which in turn predicted turnover intention. Job embeddedness also influenced perceived compatibility and intent to leave the organization. Characteristics of the shock events and suggestions to organizations to prevent avoidable, voluntary turnover are also presented...|$|E

40|$|Tax {{agencies}} {{spend a lot}} {{of resources}} in overseeing tax evasion, without truly knowing what the effect on compliance is. The research area concerning the effects of audits is understudied, however more knowledge exists concerning the impact on individuals rather than on the impact on firms. The objective of this thesis is to examine the plausible behavioural changes among Swedish firms due to audits. The thesis is based on firms’ own reported VAT returns; it is their own behavioural change that is estimated, and not an involuntary change due to enforced payments or fines. The visible effects are solely due to the firm’s awareness of the supervision of the Swedish Tax Agency. The results, from a fixed effects regression, indicate that the audit do affect the firms’ level of compliance. The probability of an increased <b>reported</b> <b>turnover</b> is significant both at the extensive margin but also at other intervals. For the input VAT effects can be observed at several intervals, however not at the extensive margin...|$|E

40|$|We present {{observations}} {{obtained with}} the Advanced Camera for Surveys {{on board the}} Hubble Space Telescope of the "fossil" starburst region B in the nearby starburst galaxy M 82. By comparing UBVI photometry with models, we derive ages and extinctions for 35 U-band selected star clusters. We find that the peak epoch of cluster formation occurred ~ 150 Myr ago, in contrast to earlier work that found a peak formation age of 1. 1 Gyr. The difference is most likely due to our inclusion of U-band data, which are essential for accurate age determinations of young cluster populations. We further show that the previously <b>reported</b> <b>turnover</b> in the cluster luminosity function is {{probably due to the}} neglect of the effect of extended sources on the detection limit. The much younger cluster ages we derive clarifies the evolution of the M 82 starburst. The M 82 -B age distribution now overlaps with the ages of: the nuclear starburst; clusters formed {{on the opposite side of}} the disk; and the last encounter with M 81, some 220 Myr ago.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} H and K_s-band {{images of}} the Arches cluster obtained using the NIRC 2 instrument on Keck with the laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) system. With {{the help of the}} LGS AO system, we were able to obtain the deepest ever photometry for this cluster and its neighborhood, and derive the background-subtracted present-day mass function (PDMF) down to 1. 3 Msun for the 5 arcsec- 9 arcsec annulus of the cluster. We find that the previously <b>reported</b> <b>turnover</b> at 6 Msun is simply due to a local bump in the mass function (MF), and that the MF continues to increase down to our 50 % completeness limit (1. 3 Msun) with a power-law exponent of Gamma = - 0. 91 for the mass range of 1. 3 < M/Msun < 50. Our numerical calculations for the evolution of the Arches cluster show that the Gamma values for our annulus increase by 0. 1 - 0. 2 during the lifetime of the cluster, and thus suggest that the Arches cluster initially had Gamma of - 1. 0 ~ - 1. 1, which is only slightly shallower than the Salpeter value.

40|$|One of {{the effects}} of a {{corporate}} layoff is the interruption of communication networks for employees who remain in the workplace. Since information that passes along these informal networks is part of the lifeblood of any workplace, remaining employees struggle to reestablish network connections after a layoff is completed. Access to information and their status as a central point in a network are key elements in workers 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction with their work situation, and as such have a strong influence on turnover intentions. This study measured pre- and post-downsizing information flow and post-downsizing turnover intentions of downsizing survivors in the corporate office of an international hotel company. Using a combination of network analysis and path analysis, the study examined the relationship between changes in downsizing survivors 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 betweenness 2 ̆ 2 centrality (that is, the extent to which information transmits through them) and perceptions of information adequacy relative to <b>reported</b> <b>turnover</b> intentions at two months after the layoffs and at four months.
