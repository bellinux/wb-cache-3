25|$|ESCs {{provide all}} of the {{features}} and functions expected of a typical splice closure in an enclosure that prevents the intrusion of liquid and vapor into the closure interior. This is accomplished {{through the use of}} an environmental sealing system such as <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> or hot-melt adhesives. Some ESCs use pressurized air to help keep moisture out of the closure.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel {{can be used}} in pure form (B100) or may be {{blended with}} {{petroleum}} diesel at any concentration in most injection pump diesel engines. New extreme high-pressure (29,000 psi) common rail engines have strict factory limits of B5 or B20, depending on manufacturer. Biodiesel has different solvent properties than petrodiesel, and will degrade natural <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> and hoses in vehicles (mostly vehicles manufactured before 1992), although these tend to wear out naturally and most likely will have already been replaced with FKM, which is nonreactive to biodiesel. Biodiesel has been known to break down deposits of residue in the fuel lines where petrodiesel has been used. As a result, fuel filters may become clogged with particulates if a quick transition to pure biodiesel is made. Therefore, it is recommended to change the fuel filters on engines and heaters shortly after first switching to a biodiesel blend.|$|E
500|$|Members of the United States {{armed forces}} are exposed to CS during initial {{training}}, and during training refresher courses or equipment maintenance exercises, using CS tablets that are melted on a hotplate. This is to demonstrate the importance of properly wearing a gas or protective mask, as the agent's presence quickly reveals an improper fit or seal of the mask's <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> against the face. Following exposure while wearing a mask, recruits are ordered to remove the masks and endure exposure in the room. These exercises also encourage confidence {{in the ability of}} the equipment to protect the wearer from such chemical attacks. Such an event is a requirement for graduation from United States Army Basic Training, Air Force Basic Military Training, Navy Basic Training, and Marine Corps recruit training. CS gas in the form of grenades is also used extensively in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in some service schools. CS gas is used during the final field exercise of the Scout Sniper Basic Course to simulate being compromised. In addition, it is used during the [...] escape-and-evasion exercise ("Trail of Tears"), the last event before graduation from the course. It is also used during several events in the Marine Corps Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) including some rucksack runs and escape-and-evasion exercises. While students going through the course are given the opportunity to bring and wear a gas mask for the event, usually none are worn because once donned, gas masks could not be removed {{until the end of the}} exercise. This could last anywhere from 3–12 hours and would make running 25km while wearing [...] of gear virtually impossible.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, {{things go}} badly due to Jaime's and Sheilla's {{different}} leadership styles: while Jaime {{tries to be}} an inspirational leader, Sheilla {{is more of a}} demanding workhorse, trying to get Michelle to help out on the roof. When Michelle refuses, Sheilla does not take it well at all. Terry and Fred, on Candace's roof, would make the mistake of not shingling around the <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> (in fact, the <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> was stapled down to the sheeting with no tar paper underneath). Meanwhile, Angie and Sheilla would begin to work on Terry's roof, while Jaime tackles Ruth's shed with Michelle, leaving Ruth to do nothing. In the end, with only 15 minutes to go in the challenge, and two sheds (Terry's and Candace's) fully done, Jaime and Sheilla decide to abort and cleanup.|$|R
50|$|An {{ammunition}} box or cartridge box is a container designed for safe {{transport and storage}} of ammunition.

50|$|Redline - Reference kits {{available}} in either solid black or solid white with matching lugs and hoops. True to its name, the <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> on the lugs and bass drum claws were dyed red. The kits came in different size shellpacks in rock-styled configurations. The Redline series were {{released in the}} US in 2008 and in Europe (as a Masters Premium kit) at the Musikmesse later that year.|$|E
50|$|Seals in {{high-pressure}} {{vessels are}} also susceptible to explosive decompression; the O-rings or <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> used to seal pressurised pipelines {{tend to become}} saturated with high-pressure gases. If the pressure inside the vessel is suddenly released, then the gases within the rubber gasket may expand violently, causing blistering or explosion of the material. For this reason, {{it is common for}} military and industrial equipment to be subjected to an explosive decompression test before it is certified as safe for use.|$|E
50|$|The {{printing}} {{depends on}} the smooth flow of ink, which can be hindered if the ink begins to dry at the print head, as can happen when an ink level becomes low. Dried ink can be cleaned from a cartridge print head using isopropyl alcohol or water. Isopropyl alcohol will damage the printing head, melting the plastic at the connections and <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Tap water contains contaminants that may clog the print head, so distilled water and a lint-free cloth is recommended.|$|E

50|$|The EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens {{is often}} {{compared}} to the other L series zoom of comparable range, the 24-70mm f/2.8L USM, losing one full stop but gaining image stabilization (IS) in return, stabilizing camera shake up to three stops. It also has <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> for moisture and dust protection, although weather sealing is only effective if the photographer uses a weather-resistant camera body. Some early production models of the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens had a flare problem (reportedly the first 10,000 batch) and Canon offered to repair them for free.|$|E
5000|$|Zond 6 used a {{relatively}} uncommon technique called [...] "skip reentry" [...] to shed velocity upon returning to Earth. A {{few hours before}} reentry, on 17 November 1968, a faulty O-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> caused the cabin to depressurise, killing all the animal test subjects aboard.

5000|$|... 2500 3rd Generation Dodge trucks use a 10.5 AAM {{in all the}} V8 {{equipped}} trucks. Some early model Diesel and V10 trucks {{also used}} this axle. Like the 11.5, this axle also uses a re-usable <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> and looks similar to the 11.5 axle. The Ram Power Wagon also uses this axle with a locking differential. 2013 was the last model year that RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks were equipped with this axle.|$|R
50|$|Momsen {{began to}} look for ways to rescue submariners. He {{conceived}} a diving bell, which could be lowered to a submarine in distress, mated to an escape hatch, and opened to allow trapped submariners to climb in. A watertight seal to the submarine could be achieved by placing a <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> around the diving bell's bottom and reducing the air pressure once the bell was over the escape hatch. Then, the hatch could be opened, and the trapped submariners could climb aboard.|$|R
50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, connector insert and body. A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, Washington Gas Light {{experienced}} a 16-fold increase in gas leaks on residential service connections in Prince George's County, Maryland, which is served directly by pipeline from the plant. These leaks come from mechanical couplings which contain <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Washington Gas Light claims {{that because the}} Cove Point gas has less hexane and other heavy hydrocarbons than does domestic natural gas, the Cove Point gas causes the gaskets to dry out and leak. Cove Point disputes these claims and argues that Washington Gas's arguments are flawed and the expansion will not cause additional leaks in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia suburbs as the area served by unblended LNG increases.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{just prior}} to their buyout by Seagate, Conner Peripherals started using a {{cost-saving}} measure on its low-end drives. Instead of bolted-down, cast aluminum lids with <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets,</b> Conner Peripherals {{came up with a}} design that used a thinner stamped aluminum lid, and a thick adhesive tape seal along the perimeter of the lid, where the lip of the lid meets the base casting. This design used no screws to hold on the lid [...] - [...] just cutting the tape could permanently damage the drive by making the lid come off. This design was kept well after the Seagate buyout, and was discontinued in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Cell casting is {{a method}} used for {{creating}} poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sheets. Liquid monomer is poured between two flat sheets of toughened glass sealed with a <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> and heated for polymerization. Because the glass sheets may contain surface scratches or sag during the process, this traditional method has some disadvantages: among other problems, the PMMA sheets may contain variations in thickness and surface defects. It has since {{been replaced by the}} more modern method for making PMMA, extrusion, which gives uniform quality.|$|R
25|$|The iron lung, {{also known}} as the Drinker and Shaw tank, was {{developed}} in 1929 {{and was one of the}} first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated tank, which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed with a <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.|$|R
50|$|On January 5, 1875, Charles de Quillfeldt of New York City {{invented a}} wire-bail closure {{known as the}} Lightning closure. Within a short time he sold the patent rights to several individuals, {{including}} Henry Putnam and Karl Hutter. The stopper or lid was typically made from metal, porcelain, or ceramic, while a <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> was used to seal the container. Putnam modified de Quillfeldt's design so that the lid was secured by centering the wire bail between two raised dots or in a groove along the lid's center. Putnam's closure was patented 1882 (U.S. Patent #256,857).|$|R
