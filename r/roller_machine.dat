Differential Flatness is utilized to create reference trajectories that are tracked with a high convergence rate. Flatness also allows for nominal input torque generation without integration. Constraints on the inputs are satisfied through the motion planning phase. A partial state feedback linearization is performed and an exponential tracking dynamic feedback controller is defined. An exponential Kalman-related tension observer is also defined with semi-optimal gain formulation. The observer takes advantage of the bilinearity of the dynamics up to additive output nonlinearity. The closed-loop system is simulated in MatLab with comparisons to reference trajectories previously employed in literature. The importance of proper motion planning is demonstrated by producing excellent performance compared with existing tracking and tension observing methods...|$|E

For this aim, roller-shaped specimens were machined from extruded bars {{of these materials}} and subjected to rolling contact tests at different contact pressure levels {{by means of a}} four <b>roller</b> <b>machine.</b> Contact pressure-life diagrams and wear rates were so obtained and compared, highlighting a relationship with monotonic and hardness materials properties. Microscopic observations of contact surfaces and transversal section of the specimens also allowed observing the damage mechanisms occurred in the materials tested and the effects of the filler. In particular way, deep radial cracks appeared on unfilled PEEK, while spalling and delamination phenomena where found on composites. Diffuse microcracks were found at the filler-matrix interface of the composites specimens, confirming that the fatigue life of these materials is essentially determined by the crack propagation phase, also under rolling contact loading...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{vibration}} {{signals of}} the running machine contain non-stationary components. Usually, these non-stationary components contain abundant information on machine faults. In this paper, the Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) method for the machine fault diagnosis is proposed. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and Hilbert transform are key parts of the Hilbert–Huang transform method. The EMD will generate a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). By applying EMD method and Hilbert transform to the vibration signal, {{we can get the}} Hilbert spectrum from which the faults in a running machine can be diagnosed and fault patterns can be identified. The practical vibration signals measured from <b>roller</b> <b>machine</b> with eccentric and friction faults are analysed by the Hilbert–Huang transform and Fourier transform in this paper. Finally, HHT’s performance in rolling machine fault detection is compared with that of the Fourier transform. The comparison results have shown that the HHT is superior than the Fourier transform in machine fault diagnostics. The different failure characteristic frequencies can be distinguished in the component of different orders of IMF, and the time and frequency of failure characteristic frequency appearance can be clearly reflected in the Hilbert spectrum...|$|E

The effect of different parameters, ultrasound intensity, number of cycles, type of blade, gears speed on the nanofiller dispersion were analyzed. The inclusion of the nanofiller in the resin causes a drastic increase in the viscosity, preventing the homogenization of the resin and a drastic increase in temperature in the zones closest to the ultrasound probe. To overcome these challenges, the application of high speed agitation simultaneously with the application of ultrasonic radiation was used. This allows on the one hand a homogeneous dispersion, on the other hand an improvement of the dissipation of heat generated by ultrasonic radiation. A comprehensive study with parameters like viscosity and temperature was performed. It is necessary a balance between viscosity and temperature. Viscosity must be low enough to facilitate the dispersion and homogenization of the nanofillers, whereas the temperature cannot be too high because of re-agglomeration...|$|E

In-service testing for “road-friendliness would advantage the transport industry and road asset owners. The former because worn dampers could be replaced before vehicle and payload damage occurs; high-mileage but still serviceable shock absorbers {{need not be}} replaced (saving labour and equipment costs). The latter through reductions in road and bridge asset rehabilitation costs through less wear-and tear from HVs with out-of-specification or deficient shock absorbers. HV tyre wear is used widely as an indicator that suspension dampers are worn. Blanksby et al., (2006) showed {{that this is not}} a good determinant of damper wear. Under the joint QUT/MR project Heavy vehicle suspensions – testing and analysis it is proposed to develop a low-cost shaker bed made from a modified roller-brake tester to impart a known vibration to the axle. Accordingly, a heavy vehicle brake-test <b>roller</b> <b>machine</b> will be instrumented and modified. It will be used to provide a sinusoidal loading into a HV suspension using eccentricity of the roller/s. This will be attempted for wheel loads varying from tare to full load and for shock absorber conditions from fully-functional to inoperative. Resonant peak force magnitudes should be able to be analysed for axle-hop and body-bounce. The results from this test programme will: •	be used to determine the threshold beyond which HV suspensions cause tyre wear and road damage compared with when they are new; •	augment the already-underway Main Roads programme being conduced to determine differences due to the "Haire suspension system" (Davis, 2006, 2007; Davis & Kel, 2007; Davis & Queensland Department of Main Roads, 2006 a, 2006 b) under the test conditions; and •	yield a "proof-of-concept" of moderate-cost testing machine to perform low-cost HV suspension testing...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Theoretical and {{experimental}} researches of extraction processes from plant origin raw materials: barley, acorns and chicory with liquid carbon dioxide, {{as well as}} lupin with cheese whey were carried out. Quality indicators of extracts and secondary raw materials are defined. It is established that they are perspective raw sources for the enriched and functional products as they contain amino acids, vitamins and microelements. The dairy-vegetative lupine extract, for example, contains 17 amino acids, including the essential as well as vitamins and minerals. The studies of secondary raw materials, barley, acorns, chicory and lupine quality showed the expediency of their use for foods enrichment. Quality indicators of secondary raw materials are presented in the tables form in the given work. It {{formed the basis for}} the development of hardware-technological schemes of obtaining СО 2 -extracts and their use. The hardware-technological scheme of obtaining СО 2 -extracts from barley, acorns and chicory includes a number of equipment units: motor transport for raw materials delivery to the enterprise, the scraper hydroconveyor, the jet washer, a photoseparator for of poor-quality raw materials and impurities removal, a blowing machine for removing surface moisture from the raw materials, a jet washer for peeling, a cutter, drying and frying device, a crusher, a <b>roller</b> <b>machine</b> tool and an extracting unit. Hardware providing for yoghurt technology enriched with amino acids, microelements and vitamins which are present in a dairy-plant extract differs from the mentioned above one in the following. The extract used is a cheese whey, and the extraction of a target component is carried out in a vibrating extractor. The hardwaretechnological scheme is made according to Russian technology of yoghurt and furnished with the equipment for dairy-vegetative extract feeding into a product. It includes the following: a vibrating extractor (not shown in fig. 2), the extract collector, the cover and tube heat exchanger and the refrigerator. Prerequisites reconditions are stated at a heat exchanger choice. The offered scheme can be used in the manufacture of other fermented milk products. Thus, the hardware-technological schemes developed by the authors contribute to the complex processing of secondary raw materials of plant origin which is economically and ecologically expedient...|$|E

40|$|Treading barley (“Mugifumi” in Japanese) is a barley culturing {{process that}} is unique and {{indispensable}} in Japan. Generally, <b>roller</b> <b>machines</b> or human feet are used to tread young barley several times (Figure 1). As a model examination, a stainless steel instrument was used for treading barley in this study (Figure 2 (a)). Treading damages plants and decreases growth, such as the height and weight of aerial parts, which then recover gradually. In our study, the total amino acid contents increased with the treading stress. The treading stress induced a 1. 7 -fold increase in aspartic acid contents and an approximately 1. 6 - fold increase in glutamic acid, proline, cystine, and methionine contents. Isolation and purification suggested that {{the main components of}} the methanol-eluted fraction from the young green barley were six known phenolic compounds. Saponarin and lutonarin were the main components. The saponarin content was about 160 mg/g (methanol-soluble fraction) at 10 days after germination. We found that the higher antioxidant activity was due to the increased lutonarin/saponarin ratio from 10 % to 24 %. Therefore, our results suggest that treading stress is useful for young green barley. </span...|$|R
