50|$|From 1886 to 1905, Heinrich Witzenmann {{continued}} to develop numerous noteworthy profiles for hose production {{which are still}} of technical significance today. In 1894, he registered a patent for the double metal hose consisting of two coaxial metal hoses twisted in opposite directions. Further modifications of the original form focused {{on the use of}} different hose materials and different substances for the <b>thread</b> seal, including <b>rubber,</b> textile <b>threads,</b> asbestos and wire.|$|R
50|$|The first {{metal hose}} was {{technically}} a stripwound hose. It {{was invented in}} 1885 by the jewellery manufacturer Heinrich Witzenmann (1829-1906) of Pforzheim, Germany, together with the French engineer Eugène Levavassèur. The hose was modelled after the goose throat necklace, a piece of jewellery that consisted of interlacing metal strips. The original design of the hose {{was based on a}} helically coiled metal strip with an S-shaped profile. The profile interlocked along the windings of the helical coil. Due to a cavity between the interlocking profiles, this did not create a tight fit. The cavity was sealed by means of a <b>rubber</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The next {{breakthrough}} in golf ball development came in 1898. Coburn Haskell of Cleveland, Ohio had driven to nearby Akron, Ohio for a golf date with Bertram Work, {{the superintendent of}} the B.F. Goodrich Company. While he waited in the plant for Work, Haskell picked up some <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> and wound it into a ball. When he bounced the ball, it flew almost to the ceiling. Work suggested Haskell put a cover on the creation, {{and that was the}} birth of the 20th century wound golf ball that would soon replace the guttie bramble ball. The new design became known as the rubber Haskell golf ball. For decades, the wound rubber ball consisted of a liquid-filled or solid round core that was wound with a layer of <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> into a larger round inner core and then covered with a thin outer shell made of balata sap. The balata is a tree native to Central and South America and the Caribbean. The tree is tapped and the soft, viscous fluid released is a rubber-like material similar to gutta-percha, which was found to make an ideal cover for a golf ball. Balata, however, is relatively soft. If the leading edge of a highly lofted short iron contacts a balata-covered ball in a location other than the bottom of the ball a cut or [...] "smile" [...] will often be the result, rendering the ball unfit for play in most instances.|$|E
50|$|The town grew {{primarily}} {{around the}} Manhan River, both through its phase as a strictly agricultural community and later, through the Industrial Revolution, when mills and factories were first built in Easthampton, mainly {{in connection with}} textile manufacturing and its offshoots. The first of these, the Williston-Knight Button Company, was established in 1847 by Samuel Williston, son of the town's first minister, a Congregationalist named Payson Williston. The company specialized in cloth-covered buttons - a coveted item at the time - and to facilitate {{the operation of the}} machinery, a local brook was dammed, creating Nashawannuck Pond. Other mills soon opened nearby, a number of them specializing in elastic and <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cotton fiber {{is a type}} {{of natural}} fibers. Using natural fibers to {{fabricate}} textile can not only decrease the consumption of synthetic fibers, but also reduce the environmental pollution. This study aims to fabricate elastic knitted fabrics and evaluate their properties. Polyester (PET) filaments and <b>rubber</b> <b>threads</b> serve as the warp while cotton yarn serves as the weft for warp knitting. A crochet machine makes the warp and weft into warp knits with desirable stretchability, during which the amount (single/double) and the ply number (1 -, 2 -, and 3 -ply) of the weft are further varied. The resulting warp knits are evaluated for water absorption, air permeability, and mechanical properties. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the warp knits with single 1 -ply weft (S 1) yield an optimal air permeability of 224. 6 cm 3 /cm 2 /s and stiffness along the warp direction of 4. 74 cm. The warp knits with single 2 -ply weft (S 2) display an optimal tearing strength of 86 N while the warp knits with double 3 -ply weft (D 3 / 3) has an optimal tensile strength of 708 N...|$|R

50|$|Indonesian rubber {{industry}} take its root in colonial Dutch East Indies; {{in the early}} 20th century the rubber plantation in the colony was booming, largely owed to the advent of natural rubber tire industry to supply the growing automotive industry in the United States and Europe. Currently, Indonesia's rubber production is the world's second-largest after Thailand. Natural rubber is an important export commodity that earn foreign exchange, with increasing production trend. In fact, ASEAN nations are among the largest natural rubber producers; the combined rubber yield of three ASEAN members — Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia — accounts for nearly 66 percent of global total rubber production. However, compared to neighbouring countries, Indonesia's productivity level is lower (1,080 kg/ha), compared to Thailand (1,800 kg/ha), Vietnam (1,720 kg/ha) and Malaysia (1,510 kg/ha). Smallholder farmers in Indonesia retain for about 85 percent of total rubber estates, which suggests the minor role of government and large private estates in Indonesian {{rubber industry}}. Another problem {{is the lack of}} rubber processing facilities and manufacturing industry. In Indonesia, about half of the natural rubber that is absorbed internally goes to the tire manufacturing industry, followed by rubber gloves, <b>rubber</b> <b>thread,</b> footwear, retread tires, medical gloves, rubber carpets and various rubber tools.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} ratio of different rubber threads on the elastic, tensile, air permeability, andfar-infrared emissivity properties ofelastic warp-knitted fabric. Polyester filaments and rubber threads were applied as warp yarns while bamboo charcoal(BC) /Nylon(NY) filament was used as weft yarn to fabricate elastic knitted fabric (EKF) by using Velcro Crochet Machine. The four different ratios of rubber threads in warp direction were 0 %, 25 %, 50 % and 100 %. The result revealed that with the increase in weight ratio of the <b>rubber</b> <b>thread,</b> the air permeability decreased while the tensile elongation tended to increase in both warp and weft directions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} a reality in almost all {{surgical}} centers. Although with initial greater technical difficulty for surgeons, the rapid return to activities, less postoperative pain and higher quality aesthetic stimulates surgeons to evolve technically in this area. However, unlike open surgery where learning opportunities are more accessible, the laparoscopic training represents a challenge in surgeon formation. Aim:To present a low cost model for laparoscopic training box. Methods: This model is based in easily accessible materials; the equipment can be easily found based on chrome mini jet and passes <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> and a webcam attached to an aluminum handle. Results: It can be finalized in two days costing R$ 280, 00 (US$ 90).

40|$|Wastewater {{from the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> {{manufacturing}} industry is acidic in nature with PH {{in the range}} of 3. 8 to 4. 4 and containing high concentrations of COD, BOD, Total-N and zinc. The high BOD and COD ratio of the wastewater (0. 78 to 0. 90) indicates that the rubber wastewater is biodegradable and can be treated effectively by an anaerobic digestion process commonly employed in this industry. However, because the wastewater contained high concentrations of zinc, 250 to 310 mg/L, which could inhibit the digestion process, it was pretreated by chemical precipitation/flocculation. A treatment process using a combination of sodium sulfide and polyelectrolyte LT 27 at concentrations of 800 and 5 mg/L, respectively, is the most cost-effective system for zinc removal from the wastewater Zinc removal by sodium sulfide is not affected by pH. The optimum settling time was 60 min, whereas the optimum flocculation time was 20 min, and a speed of 20 rpm in a 110 mm diameter reactor gave the best res The estimated cost of zinc removal using this method was RM 1. 04 /m(3) (US $ 0. 26 /m(3)) of wastewater discharged...|$|E
