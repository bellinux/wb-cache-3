40|$|This article {{examines}} the critical response to the poetry of G. J. (Han) Resink (1911 - 1997), a Dutch-language poet and scholar who adopted the Indonesian nationality in 1950. In the past, commentators have very much focused on what they perceive to be 'eastern' elements in Resink's oeuvre. I maintain that this {{has resulted in a}} one-sided interpretation, neglecting the underlying western, and in particular Dutch, tradition in many <b>of</b> <b>Resink's</b> poems. This article demonstrates the different ways in which Resink drew on the principles and literary output of the Eighties Movement, and how his formal experiments gain in significance when set against the work of poets like Perk, Kloos, and Dèr Mouw. The general view on Resink's later work as being inferior to his earlier poetry is shown {{to be the result of}} unwarranted preconceptions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

30|$|Figure  5 {{shows that}} as the number <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> increases, the {{production}} first increases and then decreases. When the number <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> is the same, the initial production increases rapidly, and after reaching the peak value, the production is slowly reduced. This makes the cumulative production increase in the early stage. When the number <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> exceeds the number <b>of</b> reasonable production <b>wells,</b> the cumulative output gradually becomes flat. Therefore, there is a reasonable well pattern density (reasonable number <b>of</b> <b>wells)</b> {{in the development of}} the gas reservoir.

30|$|The depth domain {{thickness}} map {{of member}} Es 2 {{can be obtained}} through time-depth conversion (Fig.  12 a). By multiplying the plan-view distribution map of the compaction correction parameters by the thickness map in the depth domain, a plan-view map of the compaction recovered thickness of the Es 2 member can eventually be calculated (Fig.  12 c). Before applying the compaction correction, the area <b>of</b> <b>well</b> Binsh 1 exhibited flat topography, similar to the topographic features <b>of</b> <b>well</b> Binsh 18 (Fig.  12 a). After compaction recovery (Fig.  12 c), the area <b>of</b> <b>well</b> Binsh 1 was used for a different topographic assessment which obviously was lower than the area <b>of</b> <b>well</b> Binsh 18. It can be interpreted that the present strata thicknesses in the area <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> Binsh 1 and Wellbinsh 18 area are nearly the same, whereas well Binsh 1 contains {{a greater proportion of}} shale layers than well Binsh 18. After the application of the compaction correction, the corrected thickness <b>of</b> <b>well</b> Binsh 1 was greater than that <b>of</b> <b>well</b> Binsh 18; i.e., the “topography inverse” phenomenon occurs. The location <b>of</b> <b>well</b> Binsh 1 can be interpreted as the center of the lake basin, which matches well with regional sedimentary features (Fig.  12 d). Also, the paleo-geomorphology corresponds to depositional distribution characteristics. With the aid of the 3 -D interpolated compaction correction method that is based on the parameters of the compaction correction, the precision of the compaction correction also has been improved.|$|R
