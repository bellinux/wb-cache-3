40|$|Apparatus {{has been}} {{developed}} for the irradiation of V 79 - 379 A Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells with 3. 6 MeV protons from the Van de Graaff accelerator at the National Accelerator Centre in Faure. The original intention of this work was to investigate and measure a possible dose rate effect on the survival of V 79 cells, in the dose range from zero to 25 Gy, at dose <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 3 Gy/s and 300 Gy/s. The survival curves initially obtained were anomalous in that they showed abnormally high levels of survival and a tendency to remain at a constant survival level for doses above 10 Gy. Systematic attempts to correct this observed anomaly, involved the following; apparatus improvements were made, a means of measuring the beam profile was devised, the current measuring device and the dosimetry were improved and a possible dose rate effect on intracellular oxygen was investigated. After these improvements, the anomalous effect was much reduced, but not entirely eliminated. The final results showed {{no significant difference between}} the survival of cells irradiated at dose <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 3 Gy/s and 300 Gy/s; qualitative differences were however noticeable. After correction for the effect of a non-uniform beam profile, the survival curves were significantly different to published work.
