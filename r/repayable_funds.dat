40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{financial}} resources of municipal authorities with the intention on so called repayable financial resources. Repayable financial resources represent significant component for financing short-term and long-term projects of municipal authorities and serve as an important financial instrument {{for the development of}} municipal territory. The aim of the thesis is to evaluate forms and potentials of using repayabe financial resources by municipal authorities and also to consider the restriction to use repayable financial resources reflecting the state efforts to regulate the indebtedness of municipal authoritis. The evaluation of repayable financial resources is based on a questionnaire inquiries which was realized within municipal authorities of the Czech Republic. The questionnaire answers the questions of using <b>repayable</b> <b>funds,</b> their most frequent forms, and risk aversion of the municipal authorities...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} limits on contractual freedom in corporate bonds issues pursuant to the recent corporate law reform. First part of the paper studies the procedure of corporate bonds issuing provided the traditional Italian double limit regarding companies allowed to the issuance and the measure of it. The legal choice to maintain a cap to the issuing of bonds is critically reviewed, {{especially with regard to}} the case whether this maximum amount may be exceeded thanks to selected institutional investors (under control of the authorities in charge), who undertake the issue and guarantee the punctual and due final cash settlement towards those retail investors who are not sophisticated. This peculiar obligation of institutional investors is compared as well with a similar rule provided for small corporations (i. e. s. r. l., art. 2473, civil code), in order to demonstrate that it is a specific kind of accountability for someone else debt, different from a liability for violation of intermediary duties but even different both from the warranty for debtor’s solvency guaranteed to the transferee by the transferor of a credit (art. 1265, civil code) and from the liability of the transferor of a negotiable bill by endorsement. Institutional investors liability pursuant to art. 2412, 2 par., civil code is due to their choice to give up a restrictive selling policy in favour of a retail offer: this determines who, to whom and to what extent institutional investors may be liable. The paper also points out in what way this case is diverse from the selling restrictions the issuer or the lead manager endow for the offer of bonds. Second part of the essay is involved in the various kind of corporate bonds, even with some comparison with French, German, UK and US law. The aim is to clarify how many different negotiable instruments similar to the bonds may be ruled pursuant to the new art. 2411 civil code and not pursuant to the new rules provided for so called “strumenti finanziari partecipativi” by art. 2346, 2351 civil code. The standard used is the one of “repayable funds under the legal and contractual conditions applicable” used to describe the business of taking <b>repayable</b> <b>funds</b> exceptionally allowed to persons different from credit institutions. This means {{a different point of view}} of the usual coincidence between bonds and sum to be repaid as provide for mortgage. Securities similar to bonds and ruled as bonds are identified trough the examination of those kinds expressly described by the law, with special regard to those whose final cash settlement is influenced by corporate losses or profits. Moreover the paper examines the chance to deem as bonds some peculiar securities repayable with reference to an index, or only in a winding up of the company, or with commodities other than money. The category of debentures in this way set forth is finally reconsidered in the prospective of securities and markets regulations, where the aim of the law may differ from corporate law and so lead to rearrange this category...|$|E

25|$|Following another federal <b>repayable</b> <b>funding</b> {{commitment}} of one billion francs, {{each of the}} 26 long-haul aircraft (MD-11s and A330s) and 26 medium-haul aircraft (A321s, A320s and A319s) were able {{to be transferred to}} Crossair / Swiss {{at the end of the}} winter schedule of 2001/02. On Easter Monday, 1 April 2002, the last flight of Swissair, flight SR145 from São Paulo, landed in Zurich. A 71-year-long chapter of Swiss aviation history thus came to an end. Between 1931 and 2002, Swissair had transported more than 260 million passengers. The SwissairGroup (the name change from SAirGroup to SwissairGroup was announced in 2001 but never officially implemented) still existed as 'SAirGroup in Nachlassstundung' (German: Swissair in Administration) for several years until all assets were liquidated, including a large auction where many of the remaining Swissair assets, such as historic items, were auctioned. Today, Gategourmet continues as a subsidiary under the parent firm Gate Group.|$|R

The programme makers received £215,000 in <b>repayable</b> business <b>funding</b> from the Welsh Government and the first series was mainly filmed in Aberystwyth and the surrounding Ceredigion region on the west coast of Wales, over a 124‑day period in 2013. The show was filmed in both Welsh and English, with the location-based production offices contained within the former Ceredigion Council offices Swyddfa'r Sir, which also acts as the external scene of the show's police station.|$|R
50|$|Abortion funds rarely provide {{grants for}} the entire procedure. Instead, clients are interviewed {{individually}} and expected to raise {{as much as possible}} out-of-pocket, with the remainder provided by the fund in some combination of grant and/or <b>repayable</b> loan. Some <b>funds</b> will combine resources with other funds to increase the grant or loan total. This greatly increases the number of procedures that abortion funds can finance. However, since clients typically have poor credit, loans are given at modest interest rates, and funds do not employ aggressive collection tactics against their debtors, the abortion funds are still heavily dependent on donations and outside grants for their functioning. Most abortion funds are entirely staffed by volunteers, although a few of the larger funds have some paid administrative staff.|$|R
