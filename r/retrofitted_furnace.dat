40|$|In {{the fall}} of 1980, the Reed Rock Bit Company (Houston, Texas) placed a Hague International high {{temperature}} energy conservation system on a rotary hearth furnace used to heat steel billets for forging. The energy conservation system includes a heavy duty high temperature ceramic tube recuperator and five high temperature recirculating burners. The energy conservation system was retrofitted onto a rotary hearth furnace with an inside diameter of 11 ' 5 '' (3. 5 m) and an available hearth area of approximately 75 square feet (7 m 2). The system has an installed burner capacity of 3 MMBtu/hr (2, 345 kW). Before retrofitting, furnace thermodynamic performance data were collected. The amount of energy used to bring a mass unit of steel to forging temperature during typical heating cycles was 3, 921 Btu/lb (9. 12 x 106 J/kg). After in installation of the heat recovery system, the thermo dynamic performance of the improved furnace was calculated. The amount of energy used to bring a mass unit of steel to forging temperature during typical heating cycles in the <b>retrofitted</b> <b>furnace</b> was 1, 798 Btu/lb (4. 18 x 106 J/kg), demonstrating a fuel reduction of 54. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe current heat {{treatment}} processes {{make use of}} electricity or fuel for generating heat. Solar energy is available in abundance in the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat in India. Annual global solar radiation of about â‰¥ 2400 kWh/m 2 is received in these regions. Use of the abundant solar thermal energy in {{heat treatment}} of metals would saveenergy and fuels. In view of this a concept of solar convective furnace system is described in this paper. As a starting point, heat treatment of aluminium is considered. For this system, requirements of industrial furnace are taken as basis. A scale-down <b>retrofitted</b> <b>furnace</b> is designed and analysed. The importance of different process stages like, solar thermal energy absorption, storage and utilization in design of such a system is presented. A thermodynamic analysis is performed to derive requirements for the achievement of a uniform heating at a pre-determined rate. Control strategy {{to meet the requirements}} is worked out. Air flow profile in the furnace is analyzed using CFD as a tool. Laser Doppler Velocimetery technique is used for measurement of velocity in a Plexiglas model of the scale-down furnace. Flow analysis using theadopted CFD tool shows non uniformities in air flow profile. To counter this, further modifications and improvements in the furnace structure are suggested. Evaluation of Open Volumetric Air Receiver (OVAR) using installed solar air tower simulation facility is also presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOxyfuel {{combustion}} {{is one of}} {{the promising}} technologies to enable CCS for new and existing coal-fired power plants. For retrofit applications, oxyfuel is an attractive option because it does not have major impact on the boiler-turbine steam cycle. This paper presents a case study for retrofitting oxyfuel combustion technology in large state-of-the-art power plants that are originally commissioned and operated in air-fired mode. The overall process design for the modified power plant is outlined; necessary modifications of relevant components are explained. The paper also discusses results of experiments and numerical calculations on combustion behavior in the <b>furnace.</b> <b>Retrofit</b> measures ensure that the power stations still can run under both air-fired and oxyfuel-fired conditions if required by regulations/market conditions. This provides additional operational and commercial benefits for the operator of the plant and reduces the technical risk of implementing new components and processes not yet proven in the power sector...|$|R
40|$|GTE Products Corporation has {{developed}} a high temperature compact cross-flow ceramic recuperator {{that is capable of}} recovering energy from relatively clean furnace exhaust gases at temperatures up to 2500 F by preheating the combustion air to the burners. In a recently completed cooperative agreement between the U. S. Department of Energy and GTE (Contract No. DE-FCOI- 80 CS 40330) entitled Technology Acceleration Program for High Temperature Recuperators, GTE was to test, install and collect baseline and operating data for 175 industrial applications of the ceramic recuperator. GTE selected 38 plant sites (primarily from the metals processing industries) for the program. The selected furnaces operated at temperatures from 1600 F to 2500 F and the resulting preheated au temperatures ranged from 700 F to 1300 F. The fuel savings ranged from 12 % to 61 % {{and the vast majority of}} installations recorded payback periods of less than 2. 5 years. This paper presents the results of this project and briefly describes the selection of the industrial host sites, the <b>furnace</b> <b>retrofit</b> system designs, the resulting fuel savings and productivity improvements, the payback and areas of concern in high temperature waste heat recovery. Also included is a recuperator technology update...|$|R
