40|$|IRMM {{is one of}} the {{reference}} materials producers, which certify <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> for the indirect verification of Charpy pendulum impact machines. The certification approach taken at IRMM consists of two main steps. In a first step, a Master Batch of <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> is certified for each of a number of chosen nominal energy levels (currently 30 J, 60 J, 80 J, 120 J and 160 J). the certided absorbed energy value of these Master Batches is determined in an international round-robin. In the second step of the certification process, the Master Batch tst pieces are used to determine the certified valye of Secondary Batches of <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> of the same nominal energy. This is achieved by testing samples of Master and Secondary Batch under repeatability conditions. In this paper, this Master Batch - Secondary Batch approach is critically assessed in terms of traceability and uncertainty of the certified absorbed energy. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} tensile strength, hardness, density and wear resistance of the permanent mold cast iron. To carry out this experiment, suitable casting conditions, with which grey iron should be taken in the as-cast condition, were picked out, and the <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> JIS 8 C type tensile strength <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> were casted using two kinds of cast iron mold which has respectively mold ratio 6. 5 and 9. 0. The mold were coated with two layers of coating material, diatomaceous earth and soot. Irons, about 3 kg, were melted in a high frequency induction furnace at about 1450 ℃ with alumina crucible and were poured into the mold at 1300 ℃, after　being　inoculated　at　 1450 ℃ with 0. 3 % Ca-Si. Chemical composition of irons was adjusted to have required the degree of eutectic saturatio (Sc), 0. 85 to 1. 05, by the addition of low carbon steel to the base iron containing 3. 79 %C, 2. 20 %Si, 0. 44 %Mn, 0. 12 %P, 0. 05 %S. For purpose of <b>reference,</b> <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with same type were casted into green sand mold. The results obtained are as follows: (1) The microstructure of the permanent mold cast iron with a grey fracture in the as-cast condition is composed of ferritic and pearlitic matrix containing eutectic and fine flaky graphite, and higher Sc is, more the ferrite among the matrix becomes. (2) Strength of the permanent mold cast iron is better than that of the sand mold casting with same Sc:the tensile strength and the hardness of the permanent mold cast iron is respectively 24 to 32 kg/mm＾ 2) and 220 to 260 Hv(20). Density of the permanent mold cast iron is higher than that of green sand mold cast iron. (3) In case of grey iron permanent molding,it is necessary to select the chemical composition and the cooling conditions to keep away from tending to be white or mottled cast iron, and hence it tends to have similar structure and mechanical properties. Therefore,it will be recommended,in case of permanent mold casting,to controll strictly the casting conditions using the iron with higher Sc which has less chilling tendency. (4) Owing to the ferritic structure included in the matrix,wear resistance of the permanent mold cast iron is inferior to that of green sand mold cast iron, and higher Sc is, lower the wear resistance becomes...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of sintered {{woven wire mesh}} is one of classical porous medium. The porosity {{is one of the}} major parameters for the porous media. This paper presents the experimental results of the effect of porosity on internal flow behavior and heat transfer characteristics of sintered metal wire mesh structures. All the three <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> made of stainless steel wires with the same wire diameter (d = 0. 14 mm) were sintered after woven. One of them was sintered using two sintered metal wire mesh structures with different porosities (55 % and 26 %) so that the porosity changed along the flow direction. The porosities of the other two <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> are 55 % and 26 %, respectively. The experiments were completed with the Reynolds number in the range of 10 to 42. The permeability and inertia coefficient of each <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> were obtained as well as the friction factor. Infrared camera was used to measure the wall temperature of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> to get the Nusselt numbers. The results show that for all <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> permeability increases as porosity increases, while inertia coefficient shows the opposite trend. Pressure drop of all pieces increases with respect to the mass flow rate. Friction factor decreases as the Reynolds number increases. The curves for <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> # 3 fall between those for <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> # 1 and # 2 and are more close to that for test # 2.

In the experiment the uniformed type and size of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> to be broken at the effective range could not be found， however the result of the tests indicated the possible width in the effective range of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> if the depth is known. 2. Normally there is not much defference in the strength of tensile if the width of effective range is enlarged except in some unusual occations. 3. It seems to be better to decide an appropriate width of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> which will be easily broken in the effective range, considering the small width described in the report, rather than merely enlarging the width of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> in the effective range. 4. There seems to no difference between the breaking and the spot failure in the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> will not cause the break， but the split direction to width will...|$|R
40|$|Background: Studies {{investigating}} the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are typically performed using the clinical diagnosis or amyloid-β {{positron emission tomography}} as the <b>reference</b> <b>test.</b> However, neither {{can be considered a}} gold standard or a perfect <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> for AD. Not accounting for errors in the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> is known to cause bias in the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers. Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of AD biomarkers while taking the imperfectness of the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> into account. Methods: To determine the diagnostic accuracy ofADbiomarkers and taking the imperfectness of the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> into account, we have developed a Bayesian method. This method establishes the biomarkers' true value in predicting the AD-pathology status by combining the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> and the biomarker data with available information on the reliability of the <b>reference</b> <b>test.</b> The new methodology was applied to two clinical datasets to establish the joint accuracy of three cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (amyloid-...|$|R
