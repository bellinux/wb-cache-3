40|$|The final {{cessation}} {{of the legal}} effects of administrative acts {{can be achieved by}} annulment and revocation. Both are legal operations that lead to the termination of legal effects of administrative acts. A controversial issue is the one regarding the authorities that may exercise the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> and annulment of an administrative act. As concerns normative administrative acts, the specific manner of termination of enforcement of such acts is to repeal them. On the relationship between repeal {{on the one hand and}} cancellation and revocation on the other hand, various contradictory opinions were voiced in the legal doctrine. An aspect with important implications in the administrative practice is the one concerning the possibility of invalidating a normative administrative act before its entering into force. Finally, the article deals with the notion of non-existent administrative acts, which has become a constitutional institution as concerns administrative normative acts...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem that}} we address in this paper stems from the trend to {{delegation}} in the water management field. The {{problem that we}} address refers to the municipality's negotiating disadvantage {{in the face of}} some cartelized water management. We discuss the specific characteristics of the delegation auction that render it useless as a tool for collective welfare maximisation. We show that the remaining tool for achieving collective welfare maximisation, i. e. the municipality's right to revoke delegation and return to direct management, is also ineffective {{due to a lack of}} credibility that is essentially financial in nature. Thus, if the credibility of revocation could be restored, the municipality's bargaining power could also be restored. Using standard methods of stochastic calculus, we model the municipality's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> as a call option held by the municipality. We show that the value of this option depends to a large extent on the exercise price, which is partly determined by objective economic criteria and partly by legal and institutional conventions. Based on this we suggest that credibility could be restored by the constitution of a fund at least as large as the effective exercise price...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem that}} we address in this paper stems from the trend to {{delegation}} in the water management field. It refers to the municipality’s negotiating disadvantage {{in the face of}} cartelized water management firms that makes delegation, once undertaken, virtually irreversible. We show why the characteristics of the delegation auction render is useless as a tool for collective welfare maximization. We also show that the remaining tool for achieving collective welfare maximization, i. e. the municipality’s right to revoke delegation and return to direct management, is also ineffective {{due to a lack of}} credibility that is essentially financial in nature. Thus, if the credibility of revocation could be restored, the municipality’s bargaining power could also be restored. Using standard methods of stochastic calculus, we model the municipality’s <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> as a call option held by the municipality. We show that the key variable for the value of this option, and thus for the municipality’s position, is the exercise price, which is partly determined by objective economic criteria and partly by legal and institutional conventions. We show that community welfare maximisation occurs at the point where the exercise price is determined exclusively by objective economic criteria. Since the delegated firm as a simple agent has the right to abrogate the contract if delegation becomes unprofitable, we then model this right as a put option held by the firm. Its value also depends to a large extent on the exercise price, which is partly determined by objective economic criteria and partly by legal and institutional conventions. Combining the exercise points of the two options enables us to determine th...|$|E

40|$|The flow of {{personal}} data throughout {{the public and}} private sectors is central to the functioning of a modern society. The processing of these data is, however, increasingly being viewed as a major concern, particularly in light of many recent high profile data losses. It is generally assumed that individuals have a right to withdraw, or revoke, their consent to the processing of their personal data by others; however this may not be straightforward in practice, or addressed adequately by the law. Examination of the creation of data protection legislation in Europe and the UK, and its relationship with human rights law, suggests that such a general right to withdraw consent was assumed to be inbuilt, despite the lack of express provisions in both the European Data Protection Directive and UK Data Protection Act. In this article we highlight potential shortcomings in the provisions that most closely relate to this right in the UK Act. These raise questions as to the extent <b>of</b> meaningful <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>revocation,</b> and thus <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> informational privacy, afforded to individuals in a democratic society.

40|$|By {{order of}} 29 November 1999 the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) {{referred}} to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC two questions regarding {{the interpretation of the}} "doorstep-selling directive", and the "consumer credit directive", which arose in the course of proceedings involving Mr and Mrs Heininger, who took out from the Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG bank a loan to purchase a flat, secured by a charge on the property (Grundschuld). Five years later they sought to cancel the credit agreement, maintaining that an estate agent had called uninvited at their home and induced them to purchase the flat in question and - at the same time acting on a self-employed basis as agent for the bank - to enter into the loan agreement, without informing them of their right of cancellation. Article 1 para. 1 of the doorstep-selling directive provides that it applies to contracts under which a trader supplies goods or services to a consumer and which are concluded during a visit by a trader to the consumer's home where the visit does not take place at the express request of the consumer'. Article 3 para. 2 a) of that directive provides that the directive shall not apply to contracts for the construction, sale and rental of immovable property or contracts concerning other rights relating to immovable property. Article 4 of the directive provides that traders shall be required to give consumers written notice of their right of cancellation. Article 5 provides that the consumer shall have the right to cancel the contract within seven days from receipt by the consumer of the notice. Article 2 of the consumer credit directive provides that it shall not apply to credit agreements intended primarily for the purpose of acquiring or retaining property rights in land or in an existing or projected building, and that Article 1 a) and Articles 4 to 12 of the directive shall not apply to credit agreements, secured by mortgage on immovable property. The German legislation transposing the doorstep-selling directive (the "HWiG") provides for a right of cancellation by the consumer within a period of one week, if a transaction is entered into away from the trader's business premises. The cooling-off period does not start to run until the customer receives a notice in writing containing information on this right and if that notice is not given, the right of cancellation will not lapse until one month after both parties have performed their obligations under the agreement in full. Section 5 para. 2 of the HwiG provides that where the transaction also falls within the scope of the legislation transposing the consumer credit directive (the "VerbrKrG"), only the provisions of the latter are to apply. Section 3 para. 2 of the VerbrKrG, in setting out the exceptions to the scope of that law, provides that inter alia Section 7 (right of cancellation) shall not apply to credit agreements in which credit is subject to the giving of security by way of a charge on immovable property, and is granted on usual terms for credits secured by a charge on immovable property and the intermediate financing of the same. Given this legal framework {{it is obvious that the}} Heiningers could not cancel the credit agreement according to the VerbrKrG. Although the agreement constitutes a consumer credit under section 1 VerbrKrG, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> is excluded by section 3 para. 2 VerbrKrG, the exclusion of which is backed by the consumer credit directive. Although the credit agreement was entered into away from the banks business premises, they as well could not cancel it under the HWiG since this law is not applicable to consumer credit agreements. Thus, the claim of the Heiningers was denied by German courts until the Federal Court of Justice raised the question, if the subsidiarity clause in section 5 para. 2 of the HWiG constitutes a contradiction to the provisions of the door step selling directive...|$|E

40|$|Credential-based {{authorization}} offers interesting {{advantages for}} ubiquitous scenarios involving limited {{devices such as}} sensors and personal mobile equipment: the verification can be done locally; it offers a more reduced computational cost than its  competitors for issuing, storing, and verification; and it naturally supports rights delegation. The main drawback is the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> <b>Revocation</b> requires handling potentially large revocation lists, or using protocols to check the revocation status, bringing extra communication costs not acceptable for sensors and other limited devices. Moreover, the effective revocation consent—considered as a privacy rule in sensitive scenarios—has not been fully addressed. This paper proposes an event-based mechanism empowering a new concept, the sleepyhead credentials, which allows to substitute time constraints and explicit revocation by activating and deactivating authorization rights according to events. Our approach is to integrate this concept in IdM systems in a hybrid model supporting delegation, which can be an interesting alternative for scenarios where <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> consent and user privacy are critical. The delegation includes a SAML compliant protocol, which we have validated through a proof-of-concept implementation. This article also explains the mathematical model describing the event-based model and offers estimations of the overhead introduced by the system.

There are different ways to treat these delegation chains when revoking rights, which give rise to different revocation schemes. Hagström et al. [8] proposed a framework for classifying revocation schemes, in which the different revocation schemes are defined graph-theoretically; they motivate the revocation schemes in this framework by presenting various scenarios in which the agents have different reasons for revocating. This paper is based on the observation that there are some problems with Hagström et al.
