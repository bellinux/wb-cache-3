The vanadium has seen a steady rise in demand from the steel construction industry as building regulations increasingly call for improved strength and lighter construction materials. More recently the development of large-scale vanadium-redox flow batteries (VRFBs) for use in energy grid storage applications has opened up a new demand stream for vanadium (Gan and Dong 2010; Lazenby 2012).|$|R

After HCI attack at 80 ~ (1 M), the number of acid sites measured bythe Hammett indicator method is~ 0. 50 /nm 2, and the specific surfaces are 245 m 2 /g after calcination at 550 ~ (4 h), and 55 m 2 /g after steaming at 750 ~ (4 h). The performance of leached (1 M HCI) vermiculite has been compared with another hydrocarbon cracking catalyst-y-AI 203. The leached vermiculite produces a definite higher conversion and higher C 3, C 4 and gasoline yields, but much lower coke production. By electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and thermal analysis, {{it has been shown}} that the leached vermiculite samples are composed ofmore or less attacked layers retaining their original platy morphology, and non-crystalline hydrated silica. Chemical nalyses indicate that octahedral cations are dissolved first. Since the 1973 <b>petroleum</b> crisis, <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of heavy oil fractions has become financially important. As zeolites have been used to crack the small molecules (< 8 /k), scientific research is striving to obtain a suitable catalyst o pre-crack the heavier fractions (i. e. larger molecules).

40|$|Fluid <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracking</b> (FCC) {{technology}} {{is the most important}} process used by the refinery industry to convert crude oil to valuable lighter products such as gasoline. Process development is generally very time consuming especially when a small pilot unit is being scaled-up to a large commercial unit {{because of the lack of}} information to aide in the design of scaled-up units. Such information can now be obtained by analysis based on the pilot scale measurements and computer simulation that includes controlling physics of the FCC system. A Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code, ICRKFLO, has been developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and has been successfully applied to the simulation of <b>catalytic</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>cracking</b> risers. It employs hybrid hydrodynamic-chemical kinetic coupling techniques, enabling the analysis of an FCC unit with complex chemical reaction sets containing tens or hundreds of subspecies. The code has been continuously validated based on pilot-scale experimental data. It is now being used to investigate the effects of scaled-up FCC units. Among FCC operating conditions, the feed injection conditions are found to have a strong impact on the product yields of scaled-up FCC units. The feed injection conditions appear to affect flow and heat transfer patterns and the interaction of hydrodynamics and cracking kinetics causes the product yields to change accordingly...|$|R

A series of aluminum borate supports with various aluminum borate (A/B) weight ratios were prepared by precipitation method. NiMo/AB catalysts were prepared by impregnation of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O) and ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH 4) 6 M 07 O 24. 4 H 2 O) solution.

40|$|Cotton gin trash (CGT) was pyrolyzed at {{different}} temperatures and reaction {{times in a}} programmable temperature-controlled furnace. The total amount of output products (solid, liquid condensate, and non-condensable gases) from the pyrolysis of cotton gin trash was determined. The CGT was air-dried to reduce the moisture content to approximately 20 weight percent (wt. %); the CGT was then milled, sieved and weighed (100 g per sample) prior to pyrolysis. The heating value of the raw CGT {{was determined to be}} 7146 Btu lb- 1. Air was evacuated in the pyrolysis reactor before the start of each run. The CGT was pyrolyzed at the temperatures of 600, 700, and 800 °C. The maximum char yield of 38. 34 wt. % was determined at the temperature of 700 °C and pyrolysis period of 30 min, and it was based on the highest char heating value of 9460 Btu lb- 1. The highest gaseous product yield was 44. 20 wt. % at 800 °C and 60 min combination. The liquid condensates reached as high as 36. 33 wt. % but it was also noted that a major portion (ca. 90 wt. %) of the liquid is composed of water and the remaining portion is composed of different oils, alcohols and other volatile liquids. The amount of solid produced generally decreased as the pyrolysis time and temperature increased. Moreover, the amount of gas yield increased as the pyrolysis time and temperature increased, while the amount of liquid yield increased in parallel with temperature but not with pyrolysis time. By elucidating on the solid, liquid and gaseous products of CGT pyrolysis, the conversion process could be modeled for the optimal production of either char for the production of activated carbon or syngas for the production of synthetic <b>petroleum</b> via <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> and reforming processes...|$|R

Compared with the thermal <b>cracking</b> process, the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of this microalga displayed higher selectivity for and greater yield of these olefins. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of extracted lipids and the corresponding residues of the microalga was also examined, and the results showed that the lipids could be efficiently converted to light olefins. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of lipids extracted by different solvents demonstrated that neutral lipids gave the highest yield of light olefins at 36. 7 %. The yields of light olefins obtained from <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of the extraction residues were much lower than the yields obtained from lipids, and thus the lipids, especially the neutral lipids, are the primary contributors to the generation of light olefins.
