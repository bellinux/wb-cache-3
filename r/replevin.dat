5|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the financial Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians in debt and unable to meet their financial obligations. A debt relief movement began in the state, and pro-relief candidates won majorities in the General Assembly in 1820. The Assembly passed a law of <b>replevin</b> that was extremely favorable to debtors. Disgruntled creditors challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} law, appealing their case to the Court of Appeals. The court opined in favor of the creditors. Attempts to remove the anti-relief justices failed. The pro-relief legislature passed a measure abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court, to which pro-relief governor Joseph Desha appointed pro-relief justices who upheld the <b>replevin</b> law.|$|E
5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky <b>Replevin</b> Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|Forced {{to choose}} between {{accepting}} depreciated money in payment for outstanding debts or waiting long times to collect debts, creditors turned to the courts for relief. In 1822, Bourbon County circuit court judge James Clark ruled {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair that the <b>replevin</b> law violated the state and federal constitutions. This ruling was so unpopular with the Relief Party that they attempted to remove him from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the <b>replevin</b> law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow {{for one of the most}} common court actions, <b>replevin,</b> to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the <b>replevin</b> law to state that creditors who would accept payment in notes from the Bank of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes from the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept notes from either.|$|E
5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing a law of <b>replevin</b> which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court â€“ New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a <b>replevin</b> law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E
25|$|In colonial America, <b>replevin</b> {{was used}} {{more often than}} detinue. In England the scope of <b>replevin</b> was usually limited to action in {{distress}} (where a chattel had been taken by a person who intended to hold it as a bargaining chip to force some action by the true owner).|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{judicial}} bonds include appeal bonds, supersedeas bonds, attachment bonds, <b>replevin</b> bonds, injunction bonds, Mechanic's lien bonds, and bail bonds. Examples of fiduciary bonds include administrator, guardian, and trustee bonds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Mitchell v. Georgia & A. R. Co. {{it was noted that}} where action in trover is allowed by statute, and defined by such, it {{necessarily}} includes all three actions of trover, detinue and <b>replevin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1712 Berkeley Codd, Esq. of Sussex County, Delaware disputed some of {{the rights}} of Penn's grant from the Duke of York. Some of William Penn's agents hired lawyer Andrew Hamilton to {{represent}} the Penn family in this <b>replevin</b> case. Hamilton's success led to an established relationship of good will between the Penn family and Andrew Hamilton. Penn had grown weary of the politicking back in Pennsylvania and the restlessness with his governance, but Logan implored him not to forsake his colony, for fear that Pennsylvania might {{fall into the hands of}} an opportunist who would undo all the good that had been accomplished. During his second attempt to sell Pennsylvania back to the Crown in 1712, Penn suffered a stroke. A second stroke several months later left him unable to speak or take care of himself. He slowly lost his memory.|$|E
500|$|In 1820, the Debt Relief Party gained {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly. On February 11, 1820, the Assembly passed a law of <b>replevin,</b> or [...] "stay law," [...] that prevented creditors from seeking court order for payment of a debt for a period of one year. They hoped that this would provide time for an economic recovery which would allow debtors to save their investments. If the creditor would not accept bank notes issued by the Bank of Kentucky, he was forced to wait an additional year to collect the debt.|$|E
500|$|Kentucky {{historian}} Lowell H. Harrison {{opined that}} the most important measure implemented during Adair's administration was the creation of the Bank of the Commonwealth in 1820. [...] The bank made generous loans and liberally issued paper money. [...] Although bank notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth quickly fell well below par, creditors who refused to accept these devalued notes had to wait two years before seeking <b>replevin.</b> [...] To inspire confidence in the devalued notes, Adair mandated that all officers of the state receive their salaries in notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth.|$|E
500|$|The Kentucky Court of Appeals, {{then the}} state's court of last resort, {{struck down the}} law {{ordering}} a two-year stay of <b>replevin</b> because it impaired the obligation of contracts. [...] At about the same time, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision {{in the case of}} Green v. Biddle, holding that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky before Kentucky became a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict. [...] Adair denounced this decision in an 1823 message to the legislature, warning against federal and judicial interference in the will of the people, expressed through the legislature. [...] Emboldened by Adair's message, Relief partisans sought to remove the three justices of the state Court of Appeals, as well as James Clark, a lower court judge who had issued a similar ruling, from the bench. [...] The judges were spared when their opponents failed to obtain the two-thirds majority required for removal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ruling and}} opinion of Lord Mansfield became {{permanent}} law with this case. [...] Action in trover {{could be an}} alternative to <b>replevin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Mansfield also {{explained}} that [...] "If any evidence or confession has been extorted from her, {{it will be}} of no prejudice {{to her on the}} trial." [...] Additionally, a defendant could sue to suppress and regain possession of at least some types of illegally seized evidence, in a common law action for <b>replevin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Trover {{is a form}} of {{lawsuit in}} common-law {{countries}} for recovery of damages for wrongful taking of personal property. [...] Trover belongs to a series of remedies for such wrongful taking, its distinctive feature being recovery only for the value of whatever was taken, not for the recovery of the property itself (see <b>replevin).</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Tinker v Poole , Lord Mansfield {{overcame the}} {{technical}} objections (traditionally held) that a distress (holding of a chattel to induce an {{action from the}} owner) was not a disposition of goods, and that trover could be an alternative to <b>replevin.</b> [...] This was a controversial opinion at the time, and was not necessarily viewed as legitimate stare decisis.|$|E
2500|$|There are 114 {{counties}} and one independent city (City of St. Louis) in Missouri. Sheriffs in Missouri are elected to a four (4) year term. The sheriff and his deputies may conduct {{a variety of}} duties within their respective jurisdictions. Section 57.100 of the Missouri Revised Statutes states that [...] "Every sheriff shall quell and suppress assaults and batteries, riots, routs, affrays and insurrections; shall apprehend and commit to jail all felons and traitors, and execute all process directed to him by legal authority, including writs of <b>replevin,</b> attachments and final process issued by circuit and associate circuit judges." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some buildings, {{such as the}} Crenshaw House in far southeastern Illinois, {{are known}} sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the [...] "Reverse Underground Railroad". Under {{the terms of the}} Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, when {{suspected}} fugitives were seized and brought to a special magistrate known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a writ of <b>replevin</b> for the return of property.|$|E
2500|$|For centuries, {{through the}} 19th century, {{the common law}} {{recognized}} only specific forms of action, and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a writ) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, <b>Replevin,</b> Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment. To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific [...] "magic words" [...] encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a pro se ("for oneself," [...] without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting {{at the outset of}} a case over minor wording issues.|$|E
2500|$|In Sykes v Walls , a {{claim of}} {{wrongful}} detention by a bailee was upheld as a good claim {{on the ground that}} a refusal to deliver up constituted a [...] "misfeasance". [...] By this case, trover became virtually concurrent with detinue. [...] When a chattel had been found, and there was a subsequent refusal to deliver it to the owner, it was taken as evidence that a conversion had occurred. Trover was a wrong against the right of possession and not against the possession itself, because possession was prima facie in the wrong-doer. Even when trover was allowed to overlap trespass and <b>replevin,</b> which were concerned with possession, it remained necessary to define conversion, and this extension did not really affect the definition. Conversion became any act {{on the part of the}} defendant inconsistent with the plaintiff's right to possession. [...] This right had parts: [...] it had to be (1) absolute and (2) immediate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{enabling}} legislation {{passed by the}} legislature was carefully constructed to avoid clashes {{if at all possible}} and to create an aura of legality in the process. To avoid conflicts with Unionists, it allowed importers to pay the tariff if they so desired. Other merchants could pay the tariff by obtaining a paper tariff bond from the customs officer. They would then refuse to pay the bond when due, and if the customs official seized the goods, the merchant would file for a writ of <b>replevin</b> to recover the goods in state court. Customs officials who refused to return the goods (by placing them under the protection of federal troops) would be civilly liable for twice the value of the goods. To insure that state officials and judges supported the law, a [...] "test oath" [...] would be required for all new state officials, binding them to support the ordinance of nullification.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1887 case of Deaderick v. Oulds, the Supreme Court of [...] Tennessee {{ruled on}} a case of trover. [...] The defendant, Oulds, cut 800 walnut logs, branded them with the letter [...] "D", then {{proceeded}} to float them down a river {{with the intention of}} recovering them downstream. Sometime later, Oulds found an unmarked log among his other marked logs which had peculiar cracks at one end. He floated the unmarked log down the river, and it washed up on an island owned by the plaintiff, Deaderick, who then claimed the log as his in trover or <b>replevin.</b> [...] The Tennessee court quoted the English case of Bridges v. Hawkesworth where the plaintiff, being in the shop of the defendant, picked up a parcel containing bank notes. [...] The defendant, {{at the request of the}} finder, took charge of the notes, to hold for the owner. [...] After three years, no one had come forth to claim them. [...] The defendant shop owner refused to deliver them to the plaintiff. [...] The court held the defendant shop owner liable in trover for the notes.|$|E
2500|$|After the Norman Conquest, fines {{were paid}} only to courts or the king, and {{quickly became a}} revenue source. A wrong became known as a tort or trespass, and there arose a {{division}} between civil pleas and pleas of the crown. The petty assizes (i.e. of novel disseisin, of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein presentment) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The trespass action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. The plea arose in local courts for slander, breach of contract, or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts {{so that in the}} 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made de cursu (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace. It may have arisen either out of the [...] "appeal of felony", or assize of novel disseisin, or <b>replevin.</b> Later, after the Statute of Westminster 1285, in the 1360s, the [...] "trespass on the case" [...] action arose for when the defendant did not direct force. As its scope increased, it became simply [...] "action on the case". The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case.|$|E

I was asking him more {{concerning}} this bustle about the figures in wax-work of the Pope, and Devil, etc. He was not at leisure, or he would have seen them. I hear the owners are so impudent, that they design to <b>replevin</b> them by law. I am assured that {{the figure of the}} Devil is made as like Lord Treasurer as they could. Why, I dined with a friend in St. James's Street. Lord Treasurer, I am told, was abroad to-day; I will know to-morrow how he does after it.

60|$|This {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} of Bunyan's treatises, to edit which required the Bible at my right hand, and a law dictionary on my left. It was very frequently republished; but in an edition by John Marshall, 1725, it became most seriously mutilated, many passages were omitted, and numerous errors were made. In this state, it was copied into Mr. Whitefield's edition of his works, and it has been since republished with all those errors. It is now restored to its original state; and we hope that it will prove a most acceptable addition to our theological literature. Although Bunyan was shut up for more than twelve years a prisoner for the truth, and his time was so fully occupied in preaching, writing, and labouring to provide for the pressing wants of his family; still he managed to get acquainted, in a very remarkable manner, with all those law terms which are connected with the duties of a counsel, or advocate. He uses the words <b>replevin,</b> supersedeas, term, demur, nonsuit, reference, title, in forma pauperis, king's bench, common pleas, as properly and familiarly as if he had been brought up to the bar. How extraordinary must have been his mental powers, and how retentive his memory! I examined this work with apprehension, lest he had misapplied those hard words; but my surprise was great, to find that he had used every one of them with as much propriety as a Lord Chief-Justice could have done.|$|E

What's here now? yes, faith, I lamented my birthday(9) two days after, and that's all: and you rhyme, Madam Stella; were those verses made upon my birthday? faith, when I read them, I had them running in my head all the day, and said them over a {{thousand}} times; they drank your health in all their glasses, and wished, etc. I could not {{get them out of}} my head. What? no, I believe it was not; what do I say upon the eighth of December? Compare, and see whether I say so. I am glad of Mrs. Stoyte's recovery, heartily glad; your Dolly Manley's and Bishop of Cloyne's(10) child I have no concern about: I am sorry in a civil way, that's all. Yes, yes, Sir George St. George dead.(11)--Go, cry, Madam Dingley; I have written to the Dean. Raymond will be rich, for he has the building itch. I wish all he has got may put him out of debt. Poh, I have fires like lightning; they cost me twelvepence a week, beside small coal. I have got four new caps, madam, very fine and convenient, with striped cambric, instead of muslin; so Patrick need not mend them, but take the old ones. Stella snatched Dingley's word out of her pen; Presto a cold? Why, all the world here is dead with them: I never had anything like it in my life; 'tis not gone in five weeks. I hope Leigh is with you before this, and has brought your box. How do you like the ivory rasp? Stella is angry; but I'll have a finer thing for her. Is not the apron as good? I'm sure I shall never be paid it; so all's well again.--What? the quarrel with Sir John Walter?(12) Why, we had not one word of quarrel; only he railed at me when I was gone: and Lord Keeper and Treasurer teased me for a week. It was nuts to them; a serious thing with a vengeance.--The Whigs may sell their estates then, or hang themselves, as they are disposed; for a peace there will be. Lord Treasurer told me that Connolly(13) was going to Hanover. Your Provost(14) is a coxcomb. Stella is a good girl for not being angry when I tell her of spelling; I see none wrong in this.
