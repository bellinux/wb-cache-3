25|$|During the 1980s, audiences had an {{appetite}} for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars. Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He {{made a number of}} successful action films in the '80s, such as Commando (1985), <b>Raw</b> <b>Deal</b> (1986), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), and Red Heat (1988).|$|E
25|$|Florance played Mavis Lipton in Tim Burstall's thriller End Play (1976). This was {{followed}} by her first film role in writer-director Paul Cox's first full-length feature, Illuminations (1976). It was a relatively small role but it led to further collaborations. In the same year, Florance played Mrs Sullivan in the multi-award-winning Fred Schepisi film The Devil's Playground (1976). A small appearance in Australian western <b>Raw</b> <b>Deal</b> (1977) followed, and then the part of Mrs Gleeson in Ken Hannam's atmospheric mystery, Summerfield (1977).|$|E

Perle called the arms talks under negotiation in the late 1970s [...] "the <b>rawest</b> <b>deal</b> of the century".|$|R

Prompted by Asquith, Robertson submitted a memorandum on war aims (31 August). He wanted Germany preserved as a major power as a block to Russian influence, possibly gaining Austria to compensate for the loss of her colonies, Alsace-Lorraine and her North Sea and Baltic ports (including the Kiel Canal).|$|E
25|$|The Halifax Borough Committee and Watch Committee had {{complete}} {{control over the}} Force at this time. There {{was a great deal}} of discontent in the Halifax Force and Richardson thought his men were getting a <b>raw</b> <b>deal</b> from the Borough Watch Committee but got short shrift from them when he tried to improve their working life. Apparently he got very tenacious about their working hours and would not back down after repeated attempts to get them a better deal got dragged out over a period of time. In the end, however, he won the day. His men were very grateful for his efforts and a brass plaque was cast in 1910 and erected in the entrance hall of Harrison Road Police Station from 1910 until 1985. When the Station moved to a new location it was re-erected at the new station at Richmond Close, Halifax. Both Alfred Richardson and his brother Ernest Frank Richardson were involved in improving the indexing of police procedures on identifying past law-breakers by fingerprints and body measurements. Alfred Richardson tended to favour the Bertillon (1853–1914) method which involved several body measurements being recorded. His brother, Frank Richardson preferred indexing the records after photographing on-site fingerprints. (He had been working in conjunction with the Home Office, London, for many years on experimenting to find the best method.) Alfred Richardson gave lectures locally on the differences between the Bertillon method and photographic fingerprinting.|$|E
500|$|Like Big Red Rock, {{the vastness}} of rural and outback landscapes were {{reflected}} in the artwork and music of Beyond. According to a review by Forester in The Age, the band and album have [...] "titles to suggest space, time and distance" [...] and some tracks had an [...] "indigenous appeal". The lead track's title, [...] "Moondah", translates into English as [...] "beyond". In April 1976 Loughnan, who wrote the song, said in a TV Times interview: [...] "The aborigines have had a <b>raw</b> <b>deal</b> in the past. The song expresses {{the hope that they}} get better treatment in the future". [...] "Moondah (beyond)" [...] begins with clapsticks, log drum, imitation didgeridoo, and sounds evocative of indigenous singing.|$|E

It was nominated for best hiphop song for the 1997 TMF Awards, and it allowed E-Life to perform with LL Cool J, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Ice Cube, the Wu-Tang Clan, Public Enemy, Blackstreet and Run DMC.|$|R

500|$|Norman Wilner of MSN {{considered}} Licence to Kill {{the second}} worst Bond film, above only A View to a Kill, but defended Dalton, saying he [...] "got a <b>raw</b> <b>deal.</b> The actor {{who could have}} been the definitive 007... had the bad luck to inherit the role just as the series was at its weakest, struggling to cope with its general creative decline {{and the end of the}} Cold War". In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of Licence to Kill and also thought that Dalton was unfortunate, saying [...] "one has to feel for Dalton, who was never given a fair shake by either of the films in which he appeared". On a more positive note, Chuck O'Leary of Fantastica Daily remarked that it was a rare entry in the Bond series where the danger seems real.|$|E
500|$|Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh {{admitted}} that his government {{was responsible for}} failure in preventing the attacks by MNS on north Indian candidates at Railways examination centres and ordered a probe into the incident, which will also enquire into why the job advertisements where not given in Marathi newspapers. [...] "What has happened is not good. Such incidents take place because of loopholes in the law. One can't hold only the Home Ministry responsible for it, it is (entire) government's responsibility. Such incidents are affecting {{the image of the}} state and I have instructed the DGP to take stern action," [...] Deshmukh said. However, NCP leader Narayan Rane, wrote a piece in 23 October 2008, issue of 'Prahar', in a city newspaper he owns, pleading that Marathis should get their legitimate share in the central government sector. The Times of India noted, the essay indicates that Rane continues to have a soft spot for MNS chief Raj Thackeray– the two were close friends when Rane was in the Sena. Stating that the Marathis were getting a <b>raw</b> <b>deal</b> in central government jobs such as income tax and the railways, Rane said it was perplexing that of 54,000, only 54 Marathis were summoned for the railway recruitment exams. The railways must give Marathis their legitimate share in employment, Rane said.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Hollywood films {{considered}} to be classic noirs, fall {{into the category of}} the [...] "B movie". Some were Bs in the most precise sense, produced to run on the bottom of double bills by a low-budget unit of one of the major studios or by one of the smaller Poverty Row outfits, from the relatively well-off Monogram to shakier ventures such as Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC). Jacques Tourneur had made over thirty Hollywood Bs (a few now highly regarded, most forgotten) before directing the A-level Out of the Past, described by scholar Robert Ottoson as [...] "the ne plus ultra of forties film noir". Movies with budgets a step up the ladder, known as [...] "intermediates" [...] by the industry, might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances. Monogram created Allied Artists in the late 1940s to focus on this sort of production. Such films have long been colloquially known as B movies. Robert Wise (Born to Kill , The Set-Up [...] ) and Anthony Mann (T-Men [...] and <b>Raw</b> <b>Deal</b> [...] ) each made a series of impressive intermediates, many of them noirs, before graduating to steady work on big-budget productions. Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer John Alton, a specialist in what James Naremore called [...] "hypnotic moments of light-in-darkness". He Walked by Night (1948), shot by Alton and though credited solely to Alfred Werker, directed in large part by Mann, demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of [...] "police procedural" [...] crime dramas. It was released, like other Mann-Alton noirs, by the small Eagle-Lion company, it was the inspiration for the Dragnet series, which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951.|$|E
