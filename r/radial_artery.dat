5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation).

The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E

Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket.

25|$|Graft patency is {{dependent}} {{on a number of}} factors, including the type of graft used (internal thoracic artery, <b>radial</b> <b>artery,</b> or great saphenous vein), the size of the coronary artery that the graft is anastomosed with, and, of course, the skill of the surgeon(s) performing the procedure.

Intracoronary ultrasound (CVIS, 3. 5 Fr) was performed in 27 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Carotid arteries were imaged by B-mode ultrasound with semiautomatic edge detection and <b>radial</b> <b>arteries</b> by high resolution A-mode echotracking (NIUS 2). Quantitative measurements included coronary artery intima-media cross-sectional area (IM(CSA)) and cross-sectional narrowing (CSN), as well as intima-media thickness (IMT) and lumen radius (r) of the common carotid and the <b>radial</b> <b>arteries.</b> Intima-media thickness was increased in coronary, carotid, and <b>radial</b> <b>arteries.</b> Coronary arteries had an IM(CSA) of 7. 7 +/- 2. 5 mm(2) and a CSN of 24 % +/- 8 %. Despite this moderate plaque burden, lumen area was preserved (12. 3 +/- 4. 2 mm(2)) because of compensatory enlargement of coronary arteries. Right and left carotid and right <b>radial</b> <b>arteries</b> had an IMT of 575 +/- 78 microm, 570 +/- 129 microm, and 328 +/- 61 microm, respectively. There was no correlation between coronary IM(CSA) and carotid IMT (r = 0. 07) or radial IMT (r = 0. 02), and there was no correlation between coronary CSN and carotid IMT/r (r = 0. 12), or radial IMT/r (r = 0. 25). In conclusion, in these patients with symptomatic ischemic disease no relationship between IMT of the coronary arteries and IMT of carotid or <b>radial</b> <b>arteries</b> was found.

40|$|Introduction. Transient {{receptor}} potential vanilloid proteins (TRPV) {{represent a}} class of voltage-insensitive, non-selective cation channels with emerging roles in vascular biology. The hypothesis {{of this study was}} that changes in the expression of TRPV 3 contributed to pregnancy-induced functional changes in rat uterine <b>radial</b> <b>arteries.</b> Aims. This study investigated the expression and function of TRPV 3 in uterine <b>radial</b> <b>arteries</b> isolated from non-pregnant and twenty-day pregnant rats. Methods. TRPV 3 mRNA and protein expression was assayed through quantitative and analytical PCR, immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot analysis. Functional studies in isolated vessels were performed using pressure myography. Data were analysed utilizing GraphPad Prism 6. 0 (). Results. IF studies suggested TRPV 3 is primarily localized to the smooth muscle in uterine <b>radial</b> <b>arteries</b> from both pregnant and non-pregnant rats. Pregnancy increased TRPV 3 mRNA expression in the arteries but protein assays yielded conflicting results suggesting post-translational modification. The TRPV 3 activator carvacrol caused a concentration-dependent dilation of arteries which was not affected by pregnancy (pEC 50 Non-preg 4. 03 ± 0. 08, n = 11; Preg 4. 07 ± 0. 1, n = 10). Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) enhanced responses to carvacrol in arteries from nonpregnant rats only. In arteries from both non-pregnant and pregnant rats responses to carvacrol were prevented by TRAM- 34 (1 µM), a blocker of the K+ channel KCa 3. 1. Discussion. Smooth muscle TRPV 3 mediate dilation of rat uterine <b>radial</b> <b>arteries</b> through activation of KCa 3. 1, the intermediate-conductance Ca 2 +-sensitive K+ channel. Pregnancy increased expression of TRPV 3 in the arteries, but this did not alter responses to the activator, carvacrol.

Relaxation against 3 classic vasoconstrictors (potassium chloride, thromboxane A 2 mimetic U 46619, and α-adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine) and prophylactic effect on contraction against these vasoconstrictors were examined. The effect of the nicardipine and nitroglycerin cocktail on the endothelial function in internal thoracic and <b>radial</b> <b>arteries</b> was studied in response to acetylcholine.
