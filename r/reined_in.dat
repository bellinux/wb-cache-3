5|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{of state}} power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming, the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s. By the late Ming dynasty, there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys, a system which <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{government}} <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> inflation {{by making the}} peso equal in value to the U.S. dollar, and privatised numerous state-run companies, using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt. However, a sustained recession {{at the turn of}} the 21st century culminated in a default, and the government again devalued the peso. By 2005 the economy had recovered, but a judicial ruling originating from the previous crisis led to a new default in 2014.|$|E

5|$|In January 1992 Walsh {{was made}} chief {{executive}} of Pillsbury, {{in addition to his}} job as CFO of the Grand Met food division. He identified the various divisions of Pillsbury as poorly integrated and <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> their independence to make them more accountable to head office. He also invested heavily in research and development, technology, IT systems and marketing. A boosted marketing budget helped to grow Häagen-Dazs from a well known US brand to a product with global reach, {{and one of the best}} known names in luxury ice cream.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian {{architect}} during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, {{which would have been}} unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost <b>reined</b> <b>in.</b> Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.|$|E

25|$|The court <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> {{the wide}} {{scope of the}} defence power after the war, {{allowing}} for a transitional period. It struck down several key planks of the Chifley Labor government's reconstruction program, notably an attempt to nationalise the banks in the Bank Nationalisation case (1948), and an attempt to establish a comprehensive medical benefits scheme in the First Pharmaceutical Benefits case (1945). However the court also famously struck down Menzies Liberal government legislation banning the Communist Party of Australia in the Communist Party case (1951), Latham's last major case.|$|E
60|$|When, after a time, Bob {{attempted}} {{to ease down}} the mad pace, spurs and quirt went into him again with undiminished vim and put him to renewed effort. And when, at last, Daylight decided that the horse had had enough, he turned him around abruptly and put him into a gentle canter on the forward track.

6000|$|... "So I am in time! Oh! {{never more}} will I revile that horse," [...] she exclaimed, and sinking {{to her knees}} then and there she gasped out some prayer of thankfulness.

500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with Wizard magazine, Moore was also critical about {{his decision to}} cripple Barbara Gordon: [...] "I asked DC {{if they had any}} problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon - who was Batgirl at the time - and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project... said, 'Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'

25|$|To {{determine}} if criticism against the women was justified, Sir Alan appointed both as project managers for this task. Claire, who <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> her aggressive side in response, earned praise from her team and Nick, while Lucinda received surprisingly good feedback about her leadership, even impressing Margaret. Of the two, Sugar held reservation that Lucinda lacked force of character {{to put her}} foot down, after she backed down from a suggestion to have manufacturers on both of Alpha's sales teams, hoping they could convey enthusiasm, when she was met by silence from Jennifer, Lindi and Raef.|$|E
25|$|Despite the transcontinental {{success and}} {{millions}} in government subsidies, the Union Pacific faced bankruptcy {{less than three}} years after the Last Spike as details surfaced about overcharges that Crédit Mobilier had billed Union Pacific for the formal building of the railroad. The scandal hit epic proportions in the United States presidential election, 1872, which saw the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant and became the biggest scandal of the Gilded Age. It would not be resolved until the death of the congressman who was supposed to have <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> its excesses but instead wound up profiting from it.|$|E
25|$|His brigade command was the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. He {{served as}} the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Armored Division, in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

25|$|As Hungary's {{new prime}} minister, Imre Nagy {{slightly}} relaxed state {{control over the}} economy and the mass media and encouraged public discussion on political and economic reform. In order to improve general living standards, he increased the production and distribution of consumer goods and reduced the tax and quota burdens of the peasants. Nagy also closed forced-labor camps, released most of the political prisoners – the Communists were allowed back into party ranks – and <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> the secret police, whose hated head, Gábor Péter, was convicted and imprisoned in 1954. All these rather moderate reforms earned him widespread popularity in the country, especially among the peasantry and the left-wing intellectuals.|$|E
25|$|The Sikh Misls {{came into}} {{conflict}} with the Durranis, with Bhangi Misl eventually capturing Lahore. The Muslim lands and properties were confiscated by the Sikhs. After Zaman Shah invaded Punjab in 1799, the region was further destabilised, allowing Ranjit Singh to consolidate his position {{in the aftermath of}} the invasion. Singh entered into battle with Zaman, and was able to seize control of the region after a series of battles with the Bhangi Misl and their allies. After capturing the Lahore, the Sikh army immediately began plundering the Muslim areas of the city until their actions were <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> by Ranjit Singh. Thereafter, Lahore then served as the capital city of the Sikh Empire.|$|E
25|$|More importantly, the new dynasty {{proceeded}} {{to create a}} legal and political system whose basic features would continue under the Konbaung Dynasty well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. It also <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> the continuous growth of monastic wealth and autonomy, giving a greater tax base. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. Except for a few occasional rebellions and an external war—Burma defeated Siam's attempt to take Lan Na and Mottama in 1662–64—the kingdom was largely at peace {{for the rest of}} the 17th century.|$|E
60|$|The walnuts gave {{place to}} fig-trees, the figs {{in turn to}} vines, and still the {{straining}} gear held fast, and the bouncing vehicle hung together behind the lathered beasts.

6000|$|Geoffrey did not glance {{behind him}} until, when some {{distance}} from the ranch, he <b>reined</b> his horse <b>in,</b> and wiped his forehead. He had yielded at last to an uncontrollable impulse which was perhaps part of his inheritance from the old moss troopers, who had carried off their brides on the crupper. As he walked his horse, a muffled beat of hoofs came up the trail, and he fancied he heard a voice say: [...] "The twentieth--I'll be ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Vixen! Elspie {{had given}} her the name when in a facetious frame of mind, as being {{descriptive}} of the very opposite of her character, for she was gentle as a lamb, tender in the mouth, playful in her moods, and sensitive to a degree both in body and spirit. No curb was ever needed to restrain Vixen, nor spur to urge her on. A chirp sent an electric thrill through her handsome frame; a [...] "Quiet, Vic!" [...] sufficed to calm her to absolute docility. Any child could have <b>reined</b> her <b>in,</b> and she went with springy elasticity as though her limbs were made of vivified steel and indiarubber. But she was getting old, and somehow the wolves seemed {{to be aware of}} that melancholy fact. They would not have troubled her in the heyday of her youth! ...|$|R
500|$|Some {{went against}} the common view held in UMNO. Ismail Abdul Rahman told Parliament that [...] "...both the Alliance and the PAP {{subscribe}} {{to the concept of}} a Malaysian Malaysia," [...] but differed in their methods. Ismail characterised the PAP's approach as [...] "non-communalism straightaway," [...] while the Alliance required [...] "two steps. First, inter-racial harmony; second, and ultimate state of non-communalism." [...] Such statements were dismissed by Lee as [...] that could not be taken seriously unless the ultras were <b>reined</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} made of Stanford's music by writers from Shaw onwards {{is that his}} music lacks passion. Shaw praised [...] "Stanford the Celt" [...] and abominated [...] "Stanford the Professor", who <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> the emotions of the Celt. In Stanford's church music, the critic Nicholas Temperley finds [...] "a thoroughly satisfying artistic experience, but one that is perhaps lacking in deeply felt religious impulse." [...] In his operas and elsewhere, Grove, Parry and later commentators found music that ought to convey love and romance failing to do so. Like Parry, Stanford strove for seriousness, and his competitive streak led him to emulate Sullivan not in comic opera, for which Stanford had a real gift, but in oratorio in what Rodmell calls grand statements that [...] "only occasionally matched worthiness with power or profundity." ...|$|E
500|$|Move was Third Day's {{first record}} without guitarist Brad Avery, {{who left the}} band after the {{recording}} of their previous album (Revelation). After he left the group, the band felt they were at a musical crossroads; although they considered replacing Avery, they ultimately decided not to. After playing a few concerts without Avery, Third Day felt they needed to step it up musically. The band's induction into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame also served as inspiration for the record. Although the band {{felt that they had}} previously <b>reined</b> <b>in</b> sounds that were too southern rock in sound, they decided to show more of their southern roots in the record. Bassist Tai Anderson said that although Third Day felt Revelation was a [...] "career record" [...] for them, they felt they [...] "just couldn't just make 'Revelation Part II.' It needed to feel different". The band chose to record the album in their own studio, which they felt offered more creative freedom than their previous recording process in Los Angeles. The also opted to work with producer Paul Moak, whom the band ultimately developed a good chemistry with. All the songs on Move were either written or co-written by Mac Powell.|$|E
2500|$|Task Review: Alpha came up {{with the}} idea of a [...] "National Singles' Day" [...] to be held on 13 February, and {{produced}} a range of cards intended as an alternative to Valentine's Day cards for single people. While their first two pitches were relatively unsuccessful due to objections over the date, thus earning them low orders, their third earned them a considerable amount after Michael removed the date from it. Meanwhile, Renaissance went with an environmental card, suggested by Jenny and forced onto the team after she [...] refused to research any of the other ideas they made. However, the card's environmental theme was questioned by the retailers, with Kevin's aggressive pitching causing two of them to make no orders. While he <b>reined</b> this <b>in</b> and ensured they got orders from their third pitch, it could do nothing to prevent the team losing the task.|$|R
40|$|The {{author of}} this thesis {{undertakes}} to compare the role of silence in the Civil and Common law of contracts. This thesis demonstrates that these two legal systems, which had at first ignored silence, have <b>reined</b> it <b>in</b> to an increasingly greater degree by objectifying it. This paper's purpose is thus not only to comparatively assess the role of silence through the various phases of the contract, where this process of objectivization occurs, but also to examine the reasons behind this process. Lastly, it will examine the direction the process takes. The scope of silence being indefinite, it would be unreasonable to imagine its complete objectivization. Nevertheless, the parallel processes in both the Common and the Civil law will have to evolve further {{in order to allow}} silence to take on a greater role in Contracts. The succes of such an evolution, in either system, will no doubt result from a comparative approach of this phenomenon...|$|R
50|$|Stephen's career under John II is unknown, but {{he enjoyed}} the favour of John's {{youngest}} son and eventual successor, Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143-80) {{and is likely to}} have been among those who supported Manuel's accession over the rights of his elder brother Isaac Komnenos. Thus when Manuel I decided to depose the Patriarch of Constantinople Cosmas II Atticus due to the latter's sympathies with Isaac, Stephen was among the imperial relatives who participated in the synod that tried and deposed Cosmas in February 1147, with the pretext of his support for the Bogomil monk Nephon. When Cosmas, enraged at his dismissal, cursed the empress never to bear a male child, Stephen, a nervous and impetuous man, according to Niketas Choniates, tried to attack the patriarch, but at the last moment <b>reined</b> himself <b>in.</b> This made a bad impression among all the attendants, but Cosmas reportedly prophesied that he would soon receive his due blow as punishment.|$|R
