But the Assembly saw itself as playing an important role, particularly with greater <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> membership, experience and expertise in defence policy. Therefore, it renamed itself the [...] "Interim European Security and Defence Assembly" [...] and urged the European Convention to include it as a second chamber within the EU's institutional framework. Hence it argued it could effectively scrutinise the CSDP, help improve EU-NATO relations and be more suited, being composed of national parliamentarians, to the intergovernmental style of the CSDP.|$|E
40|$|Some 300 {{legislative}} acts are adopted every {{year by the}} European Parliament and the Council, or by the Council alone. Based on these acts, the European Commission adopts around 3, 000 implementing acts each year, after consulting one of the 250 so-called ‘Comitology committees’ made up of representatives of the Member States. Only about 0. 2 % of these delegated acts are referred back to the Council because of non-agreement between the Commission and the Committee. Since the entry into force of the second Comitology decision in 1999, Parliament also has a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny</b> over such acts, but it has used this right in order to question the Commission’s proposals in only three cases. This paper asks whether this <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny</b> is an appropriate way of controlling delegated rule-making. It starts with a short historical overview of Parliament’s role, before describing the current legal regulation of Parliament’s involvement in comitology procedures. It then looks in detail at the three cases in which Parliament has to date adopted a ‘Resolution’. Finally, a general assessment is made of parliamentarian control over implementing powers, {{with a view to}} contributing to the present discussion about an adequate system of delegated rule-making under the Constitutional Treaty...|$|E

Two Member States requested the performance of a 90 -day feeding study with the hybrid. Two Member States reiterated their opposition to cover "import and processing " under Regulation (EC) 1829 / 2003.

40|$|Defense date: 8 September 2009 Examining Board: Profs. Christian Joerges (Supervisor, former EUI and University of Bremen), Hans-W. Micklitz (EUI), John Paterson (External Co-Supervisor, University of Aberdeen), David M. Trubek (University of Wisconsin, Madison) This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{analysing}} the emerging relationship in the European Union between 'new governance' - epitomised {{by the development of}} the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) - and law. While some scholars have seen the project of new governance as a purely political or functional enterprise - a mechanism of 'soft law' - the thesis will argue against such a view through an empirical analysis of a particular OMC process - the OMC for social inclusion and social protection (the OMC SPSI). While on the one hand, the OMC SPSI has achieved considerable success in creating a new social policy vocabulary in Europe, the very description of the OMC as an instrument of 'soft law' has handed considerable power to frame key policy decisions to national and European executives, while depriving Parliaments and local authorities from their normal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> The OMC SPSI illustrates why - far from invoking a merely 'technical' or procedural set of questions - 'new governance' is deeply implicated in debates over the future of the European welfare state. The indicators and recommendations of the method are not seen by its participants as neutral descriptors, but rather invoke competing views of the very ends of social policy in Europe. The description of new governance as soft and heterarhical does not therefore dilute its key legitimacy challenges, but makes them ever more pressing. In response, the thesis will argue for a 'constitutionalisation' of new governance. This constitutionalisation, the thesis will argue, should not be aimed at a legal 'juridification' of OMC procedures, or at re-enforcing their participatory potential, but rather at creating opportunities for political contestation and scrutiny in procedures too long the preserve of a small and mutually re-enforcing circle of executive actors. A 'republican' constitutionalisation of the OMC - one able to politicise the norms and indicators through which national social policy is being evaluated - may allow 'new governance' a last opportunity to refute accusations of executive dominance and technocratic paternalism that threaten to undermine its 'procedural' potential...|$|R

40|$|The {{need to hold}} International Institutions (IIs) {{accountable}} is well documented. In {{response to}} such clamours, there has been effort to implement some level <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> institutional actions either through an internal process or through some form of external review. It is contended that efforts so far made are inadequate as; first, the present level <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny</b> is often focused on institutional forms and procedures with scant or no visible <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> the substantive actions of IIs. Secondly, even if substantive actions were to be scrutinised, many IIs (particularly international economic institutions) would escape <b>scrutiny</b> because <b>of</b> the somewhat blanket assumption that their acts are not authoritative. This paper seeks to establish the need to hold international institutions accountable for their substantive actions and in particular to broaden the scope <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny</b> to include seemingly innocuous “soft” measures through the adoption of “effect-perspective” in characterising an institution’s modus operandi...|$|R

40|$|Short {{of natural}} law or an unwritten constitution, I have heard no principled {{explanation}} to justify the full sweep of judicially-imposed limits on majoritarian legislation under the written Constitution.

While ambitious, this thesis may be sustained by examining specific 2 ̆ 2 windows 2 ̆ 2 of various open-ended provisions of the Constitution. I focus here on the fifth and fourteenth amendments, and more particularly on the due process and equal protection standards <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> legislation and the underlying principles for scrutinizing both national and state action.

40|$|The {{circuits}} {{are split}} {{as to what}} level <b>of</b> <b>scrutiny</b> should be applied to challenged regulations of professional speech.

40|$|In Footnote 4 of United States v.

In the landmark decision of McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment right {{to keep and bear arms}} for self-defense is a fundamental right that is fully incorporated and applicable to the States under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Prior to McDonald, the Supreme Court invalidated a law banning the possession of handguns in District of Columbia v. Heller.
