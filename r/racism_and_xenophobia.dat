UKIP has faced a critical reception from mainstream political parties, much of the media, and anti-fascist groups; its discourse on immigration and cultural identity generated accusations of <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>xenophobia,</b> both of which it denies.|$|E

This system of morals and ethics was unique at the time, as other video games allowed players to be lauded as [...] "heroes" [...] by the game worlds' denizens, no matter what the player's actions had been. In Ultima IV, on the other hand, players were forced to consider the moral consequences of their actions. According to Garriott, Ultima was now [...] "more than a mere fantasy escape. It provided a world with a framework of deeper meaning a level of detail diversity of interaction that is rarely attempted." [...] "I thought people might completely reject this game because some folks play just to kill, kill, kill. To succeed in this game, you had to radically change the way you'd ever played a game before." ...|$|E

2500|$|UKIP gained {{traction}} {{from the}} fact that post-2008, immigration had come to the forefront of many Britons' minds as a result of increased EU migration and its concomitant social changes. By the 2015 general election, the political scientists James Dennison and Matthew Goodwin argued, UKIP had secured [...] "ownership" [...] of the immigration issue among British voters, having secured it from the Conservatives. However, the party's campaign against immigration has been accused of using <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>xenophobia</b> to win votes. Political scientist David Art suggested that in its campaign to restrict immigration, UKIP had [...] "flirted with xenophobia", while Daniel T. Dye stated that part of the party's appeal was its [...] "sometimes-xenophobic populism", and the journalist Daniel Trilling stated that UKIP tapped into the [...] "anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim populism" [...] that was popular in the late 2000s. The political scientist Simon Usherwood stated that UKIP's hardening of immigration policy [...] "risked reinforcing the party's profile as a quasi-far right grouping", elsewhere stating that the party was only held together by its opposition to the EU and immigration, suggesting that it had [...] "no ideological coherence" [...] beyond that.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on <b>Racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>Xenophobia</b> (now Fundamental Rights Agency), then {{an agency}} of the European Union, {{developed}} a more detailed working definition, which states: [...] "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." [...] It also adds that [...] "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," [...] but that [...] "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." [...] It provides contemporary examples {{of ways in which}} antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; denying the Holocaust or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of dual loyalty or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism‚Äîas can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel. Late in 2013, the definition was removed from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency. A spokesperson said that it had never been regarded as official and that the agency did not intend to develop its own definition. However, despite its disappearance from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency, the definition has gained widespread international use. The definition has been adopted by the European Parliament Working Group on Antisemitism, in 2010 it was adopted by the United States Department of State, in 2014 it was adopted in the Operational Hate Crime Guidance of the UK College of Policing and was also adopted by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, and in 2016 it was adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, making it the most widely adopted definition of antisemitism around the world.|$|E

2500|$|Norman Finkelstein {{argues that}} {{organizations}} such as the Anti-Defamation League have brought forward charges of new antisemitism at various intervals since the 1970s, [...] "not to fight antisemitism but rather to exploit the historical suffering of Jews in order to immunize Israel against criticism". He writes that most evidence purporting to show a new antisemitism has been taken from organizations that are linked in some way to Israel, or that have [...] "a material stake in inflating the findings of anti-Semitism," [...] and that some antisemitic incidents reported in recent years either did not occur or were misidentified. As an example of the misuse of the term [...] "antisemitism," [...] he cites the European Monitoring Centre on <b>Racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>Xenophobia's</b> 2003 report, which included displays of the Palestinian flag, support for the PLO, and the comparisons between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa in its list of antisemitic activities and beliefs.|$|R
