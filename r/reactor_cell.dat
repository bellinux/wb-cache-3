50|$|Rotating Cell Biofilm Reactor (RCBR) is a {{new type}} of {{biological}} process based on biofilm active sludge used in wastewaters treatment. RCBR reactors represent an evolution of Rotating Biological Contactors plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the biological surface of Rotating Biological Contactors plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using - instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree - many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the <b>reactor</b> <b>cell</b> of a traditional rotating RBC plant.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} {{attachment to the}} Lambda 9 spectrometer for in situ reflectance measurements of catalysts at temperatures up to 623 K M. Thiede and J. Melsheimer Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faradayweg 4 - 6, 14195 Berlin, Germany Abstract The spectroscopic investigation of catalyst powders under reaction conditions is generally possible only in reflectance. Two problems occur: 1. Low signal level Normally the sample is positioned directly at the integrating sphere and all diffusely scattered light from the sample is reflected back into the integrating sphere. A hot <b>reactor</b> <b>cell</b> cannot be attached directly, it must be positioned {{as far as possible}} from the integrating sphere to avoid its heating. If the <b>reactor</b> <b>cell</b> is attached at some distance from the measurement window of the integrating sphere only a portion of the diffusely scattered light will be reflected back into the sphere. At a distance of 12 mm, for example, this will only be 20 %. In a first setup we bridged the distance with highly reflecting ceramics, to increase the part of light reflected into the sphere (Fig. 1). 2. Thermal radiation The thermal radiation of the hot <b>reactor</b> <b>cell</b> also enters the integrating sphere. At higher temperatures it is significantly stronger than the measurement light from the spectrometer itself. This leads to increased noise and saturation of the detector. In the {{newly developed}} setup we tried a. 	to make the distance between integrating sphere and <b>reactor</b> <b>cell</b> with oven as large as possible; b. 	to increase the signal level c. 	to decrease the surface which causes the thermal radiation, and d. 	to bring <b>reactor</b> <b>cell</b> and oven into a vertical position which facilitates the work with powder samples. These requirements could be fulfilled by the application of a specially formed light conductor made of quartz, in which the light is conducted to the sample and back into the integrating sphere by total reflectance. At the same time, the surface which causes the thermal radiation was reduced (Fig. 2). In this way, we succeeded in improving the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 4 - 5 compared with the first setup...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the present {{doctoral}} thesis is to study the synthesis and the decomposition of ammonia under atmospheric pressure. In fact it is a research {{in order to find}} more efficient, more economic and of course safer methods of ΝΗ 3 synthesis. The research focuses on the use of solid state proton conductors and ruthenium is studied as catalyst. In all the experiments carried out, the pressure in the reactor was equal to 1 bar. Concretely, the reactions of ΝΗ 3 synthesis and decomposition were studied. As far as the reaction of ΝΗ 3 synthesis concerned, both a solid state proton conductor in the perovskite form of SrCe 0. 95 Yb 0. 05 O 3 -α (SCY) and an oxygen conductor of Y 2 O 3 stabilized with 8 % Zr (YSZ) were used. On the contrary, in the case of ΝΗ 3 decomposition, only a proton conductor (SCY) was used. Both the above reactions were studied in a single and in a double chamber <b>reactor</b> <b>cell.</b> The reaction of ΝΗ 3 decomposition was studied electrocatalytically in a double chamber <b>reactor</b> <b>cell,</b> by using a non industrial Ru catalyst and by imposing positive and negative potentials. That means that {{from the surface of the}} catalyst (cathode) protons were pumped or supplied, respectively. The electrocatalytic experiments showed that only by removing protons from the catalytic surface, the catalytic rate was enhanced. Then, wave-form positive potentials were imposed with frequencies varying from 0. 05 to 1000 Hz. It was proved, that in most temperatures examined, at smaller frequencies and mainly at 2 Hz, the electrocatalytic rate was higher than that observed with constant current. Finally, the effect of constant and wave-form potential in the catalyst activity was examined. The conclusion was that the constant current decreased more the catalyst activity than the wave-form did. Then, the catalytic ΝΗ 3 decomposition was studied in a single chamber proton conducting cell at temperatures between 350 and 650 °C and in partial pressures of ΝΗ 3 equal to 0. 5, 1, 1. 25, 1. 5 and 2 kPa. The apparent activation energy and the apparent order of the reaction were calculated. Then, for partial pressure of ΝΗ 3 equal to 1 kPa, positive and negative potentials were imposed. It was observed that the imposition of both positive and negatives potentials led to an increase in the catalytic rate. For the single chamber <b>reactor</b> <b>cell,</b> the above corresponded to a removal of protons from the surface of Ru (working electrode) and to a removal of protons from the surface of Ag, respectively. The results showed that Ru is a better electrocatalyst, beyond catalyst, than Ag. The apparent activation energy decreased up to 70 % when imposing positive current, while the NEMCA effect was observed, with the faradaic efficiency Λ reaching the value 4. As far as the reaction of ΝΗ 3 synthesis concerned, both an industrial and a non industrial Ru catalyst were examined. Initially, the catalytic reaction was studied at various reacting mixtures and temperatures. Then, in a double chamber proton conducting cell, the electrocatalytic behavior of the electrode was observed, according to which, the necessary H 2 for the reaction was supplied electrochemically through the solid electrolyte. Also, the study took place in a double chamber <b>reactor</b> <b>cell</b> by using an Yttria-Stabilized-Zirconia (YSZ). In both cases the electrocatalytic rate was almost 50 % of the corresponding theoretic rate, that would have been obtained in a conventional catalytic reactor. Finally, the study of ΝΗ 3 synthesis took place in a single chamber proton conducting cell, where a weak NEMCA effect was observed. The above experiments were carried out again with a non-industrial Ru catalyst this time. At the experiments conducted in a double chamber <b>reactor</b> <b>cell,</b> electrocatalytic rate was not observed. At the experiments done in a single chamber <b>reactor</b> <b>cell,</b> an increase in the catalytic rate by imposing constant potential was observed, but it was considerably smaller than that observed when using the industrial Ru catalyst. This strengthens the conclusion that the non-industrial Ru catalyst is not a satisfying electrocatalyst for the reaction of ΝΗ 3 synthesis. Even smaller was the increase in catalytic rate at the imposition of wave-form potentials for frequencies 0. 05 and 2 Hz. Finally, the two catalysts of Ru, the industrial and the non-industrial one, were compared by using Scanning Electron Migrography. ...|$|E

Data presented include the study of changes in rat urinary metabolite profiles associated with xenobiotic toxin exposure analyzed by HPLC using water:acetonitrile binary gradient conditions and post-column flow splitting between EC-Array and MS detectors. Results show complementary quantitative and qualitative analysis and the ability to differentiate sample groups consistent with xenobiotic-induced histopathological changes. The potential applicability of this hyphenated technique for biomarker elucidation through measurement of redox active compounds that are commonly associated with disease pathology and xenobiotic toxicity is discussed. The use of EC <b>reactor</b> <b>cells</b> in series with MS is also presented as a means of producing likely metabolites to facilitate structural elucidation and confirmation...|$|R
40|$|Fuel <b>cell</b> <b>reactors</b> or electrolyzers {{based on}} {{alkaline}} anion-exchange membrane and proton exchange membrane (AAEM & PEM) are investigated for gas phase electrochemical conversion of humidified CO 2 under identical conditions, using conventional Pt/C, Pd/C and Cu/CNTs as cathodic catalysts. Humidified CO 2 {{can be converted}} to H 2 and CO via the AAEM based fuel <b>cell</b> <b>reactors</b> with an estimated onset potential of − 1. 0 V using Cu/CNT as cathodic catalyst, while PEM based fuel <b>cell</b> <b>reactors</b> can only produce H 2 under identical conditions. This {{can be attributed to the}} suppressed hydrogen evolution and enhanced CO 2 reduction in the case of AAEM based reactor. Remarkably, AAEM based reactor with Cu/CNT cathode catalysts shows a higher activity (8. 88 μmol h− 1 cm− 2) to convert CO 2 to CO than that of Pd/C (7. 59 μmol h− 1 cm− 2) and Pt/C (0. 75 μmol h− 1 cm− 2) at the same catalyst loading. This study indicates that AAEM based reactor is able to realize the gas phase electrochemical conversion of CO 2, providing a viable strategy for CO 2 utilization and conversion to useful fuels...|$|R
