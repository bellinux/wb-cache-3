40|$|Miljöbyggnad is a {{building}} certification system adapted to Swedish regulations and design practice with focus on energy, indoor environment and materials. The building is assessed according to certain indicators {{and the resulting}} grade {{is based on a}} fourpoint scale GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE and CLASSIFIED, where GOLD is the highest grade and CLASSIFIED means that some performance requirements are not fulfilled. Some of the indicators are defined on room level; solar heat load, thermal climate and daylight. They can be assessed through simplified or detailed methods, where the simplified methods are based on simple formulae including a few parameters. The intention is to encourage the use of detailed methods by criteria formulated so that higher grades are more easily reached. However, the detailed methods are generally more time consuming due to simulations. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} determine the conformity between the two methods for the <b>room</b> <b>indicators.</b> Additionally, key parameters are defined in order to pinpoint the most important input data regarding both methods. In order to evaluate the <b>room</b> <b>indicators</b> three building types with fictive representative room units are defined; a dwelling, an office and a hospital. For those, the <b>room</b> <b>indicators</b> are evaluated by simplified calculations and detailed simulations, the latter using IDA ICE and VELUX Daylight Visualizer. Then a parameter study of 17 parameters is performed. The results are divided into two parts; the results from the parameter analysis and the results regarding conformity between the two methods respectively. The study concludes that the two methods converge very well regarding the solar heat load. Concerning the thermal climate indicators, the detailed simulations are found to be less sensitive to varied parameters than the simplified due to the compensation of installed heating and cooling power as well as ventilation and airing. For the daylight indicator the detailed simulations are favourable...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the subjective effects of modal spacing and density. These are measures often used as indicators to define particular aspect ratios and source positions to avoid low frequency reproduction problems in <b>rooms.</b> These <b>indicators</b> imply a given modal spacing leading to a supposedly less problematic response for the listener. An investigation into this topic shows that subjects can identify an optimal spacing between two resonances associated with a reduction of the overall decay. Further work to define a subjective counterpart to the Schroeder Frequency has revealed that an increase in density may not always lead to an improvement, as interaction between mode-shapes results in serious degradation of the stimulus, which is detectable by listeners...|$|R
40|$|Navigating the {{environment}} requires {{the integration of}} distance, direction, and place information, which critically depends on hippocampal place and entorhinal grid cells. Studies in rodents have shown, however, that substantial changes in {{the environment}}’s surroundings can trigger {{a change in the}} set of active place cells, accompanied by a rotation of the grid cell firing pattern (Fyhn et al., 2007) - a phenomenon commonly referred to as global remapping. In the present study, we investigated whether human grid and place cells show a similar remapping behavior in response to environmental changes and whether different episodes in the same environment might cause remapping as well. In two experiments, participants underwent 3 T fMRI scanning while they navigated a virtual environment, comprising two different rooms in which objects were placed in random locations. Participants explored the first room and learned these object-location conjunctions (learning-phase), after which the objects disappeared and participants were asked to navigate repeatedly to the different object locations (test-phase). This procedure (i. e. a learning- and test-phase within a room) was repeated several times, separated by different events, such as leaving and re-entering the same room, or moving to the second, different <b>room.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of grid cell firing were derived from the BOLD activation while participants moved within the virtual environment, whereas indicators of place cell firing were derived from the activation patterns while participants were standing at particular object locations. We compared these indicators between the different rooms and events to investigate how these manipulations influence remapping. Overall, our findings demonstrate entorhinal grid cell and hippocampal place cell remapping in humans. Furthermore, our results suggest that beside environmental changes, also other events (e. g., re-entering the same environment) might evoke remapping. We conclude that, in humans, remapping is not only environment-based but also event-based and might serve as a neural mechanism to create distinct memory traces for episodic memory formation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain an {{effective}} speech communication in rooms it is advisable, besides reaching the full intelligibility of words, to minimize the effort paid by the listener in {{the recognition of the}} speech material. This twofold requirement is not easily described by the current <b>room</b> acoustic <b>indicators,</b> which are mainly concerned either with a subjective rating by means of word recognition scores or with using listeners’ impressions of reported listening difficulties. In this work, the problem is tackled by introducing the concept of “listening efficiency,” which is defined as a combination of the accuracy of intelligibility and of the effort spent on achieving this goal. This indicator is here developed, and an application of the former and of the “listening efficiency” is presented in the field of classroom acoustics. Listening tests with pupils and adults were performed and the subsequent statistical analyses indicated several interesting findings. In particular, listening efficiency is able to clearly discriminate between equal intelligibility scores obtained under different acoustical conditions, permitting room acoustics to be tailored for specific groups, such as children...|$|R
40|$|<b>Room</b> {{acoustic}} <b>indicators</b> of intelligibility {{have focused}} on the effects of temporal smearing of speech by reverberation and masking by diffuse ambient noise. In the presence of a discrete noise source, these indicators neglect the binaural listener's ability to separate target speech from noise. Lavandier and Culling [(2010). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 127, 387 – 399] proposed a model that incorporates this ability but neglects the temporal smearing of speech, so that predictions hold for near-field targets. An extended model based on useful-to-detrimental (U/D) ratios is presented here that accounts for temporal smearing, spatial unmasking, and binaural de-reverberation in reverberant environments. The influence of the model parameters was tested by comparing the model predictions with speech reception thresholds measured in three experiments from the literature. Accurate predictions were obtained by adjusting the parameters to each room. Room-independent parameters did not lead to similar performances, suggesting that a single U/D model cannot be generalized to any room. Despite this limitation, the model framework allows to propose a unified interpretation of spatial unmasking, temporal smearing, and binaural de-reverberation. I. INTROD...|$|R
40|$|When {{speech is}} in {{competition}} with interfering sources in <b>rooms,</b> monaural <b>indicators</b> of intelligibility fail {{to take account of}} the listener’s abilities to separate target speech from interfering sounds using the binaural system. In order to incorporate these segregation abilities and their susceptibility to reverberation, Lavandier and Culling [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 127, 387 – 399 (2010) ] proposed a model which combines effects of better-ear listening and binaural unmasking. A computationally efficient version of this model is evaluated here under more realistic conditions that include head shadow, multiple stationary noise sources, and real-room acoustics. Three experiments are presented in which speech reception thresholds were measured in the presence of one to three interferers using real-room listening over headphones, simulated by convolving anechoic stimuli with binaural room impulse-responses measured with dummy-head transducers in five rooms. Without fitting any parameter of the model, there was close correspondence between measured and predicted differences in threshold across all tested conditions. The model’s components of better-ear listening and binaural unmasking were validated both in isolation and in combination. The computational efficiency of this prediction method allows the generation of complex “intelligibility maps” from room designs. © 2012 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

M. tuberculosis can contaminate surfaces and is highly resistant to disinfection. We investigated whether hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) is effective for the deactivation of M. tuberculosis on experimentally contaminated surfaces in a biological safety cabinet (BSC) and a <b>room.</b> Biological <b>indicators</b> (BIs) consisting of an ∼ 3 -log 10 inoculum of M. tuberculosis on stainless steel discs and a 6 -log 10 inoculum of Geobacillus stearothermophilus were exposed to HPV in BSC time course experiments and at 10 locations during room experiments. In three separate BSC experiments, M. tuberculosis BIs were transferred to growth media at 15 -min intervals during a 180 -min HPV exposure period. No M. tuberculosis BIs grew following 30 min of HPV exposure. In three separate room experiments, M. tuberculosis and G. stearothermophilus BIs were exposed to HPV for 90, 120, and 150 min, respectively. BIs for both microorganisms were deactivated in all 10 locations following 90 min of HPV exposure.

The objectives of this project are: - To automatically turn on the lights when a person has entered the room and automatically turn off the lights when the room is empty. - To control the room’s brightness (control the intensity of brightness, window blind). - To count {{the number of people in}} the room. -To enable the system operates in certain modes. Lighting is essential in houses, offices and closed areas. Uncontrollable usage of lighting may end up with wastage of power and natural light. The system main ideas is to maximize the use of natural light available in a closed areas or room and reduce the consumption of energy by controlling the intensity of brightness. If both natural and artificial lighting are efficiently used during daylight time, energy consumption can be reduced. Conventional lighting system only used basic on and off switches. Thus, it does not utilize both sources of light. The Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) was used as light sensors that will transmit the values of the intensity of light to the microcontroller. By using a microcontroller, PWM signal was generated through C programming and fed to LEDs to control its brightness. The LDR will control the PWM duty cycle and vary the LEDs brightness. In addition, the system use door sensor to initiate the smart lighting system and to detect the number of occupant in the room. Moreover, the system has four modes can be selected by user. There are four push buttons, each one is pressed to select certain mode. This project can enhance our lighting systems by using it more efficiently and maximize the use of natural daylight...|$|R

MICTIVO aims to monitor the ICT-integration in the Flemish education system. ICT-integration in MICTIVO {{is a combination of}} ICT-infrastructure, ICT-policy and ICT-use at the micro-level, in which three actors are involved: headmasters, teachers and students with their characteristics, ICT-competences and perceptions towards ICT. MICTIVO is devised as a recurrent instrument with <b>room</b> for additional <b>indicators</b> to assess the latest trends (e. g. social media use). During the first edition (2007 - 2008), scales were validated and empirically tested, and the second edition (2012 - 2013) is a follow-up study. Design principles were ensuring comparability (over time, between actors, between indicators) and avoiding redundancy. To get a representative view on the Flemish education system, 20 % of the schools are selected through stratified random sampling. The selected schools are allocated to one of three sub studies. In the first, only headmasters are questioned (80 % of the sample), in the second also all the teachers per school (10 %) and in the third also several classes of students per school (10 %).

The fuel level instruments are calibrated for 1 cold conditions. 3. Suppression Pool Water Level (Wide Range) Suppression pool water level is a Category 1 variable provided to detect a breach in the reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB). This variable {{is also used to}} verify and provide long term surveillance of ECCS function. The wide range suppression pool water level measurement provides the operator with sufficient information to assess the status of both the RCPB and the water supply to the ECCS. The wide range water level instruments have a range of 1. 7 feet to 27. 5 feet. Two wide range suppression pool water level signals are transmitted from separate differential pressure transmitters and are continuously monitored by two level indicators and recorded on two recorders in the control <b>room.</b> These transmitters, <b>indicators</b> and recorders provide the primary indication used by the operator during an accident.

5000|$|If the {{temperature}} in the building is higher than {{the temperature}} outside, the heat leaks through the elements of construction. Windows are usually the most vulnerable elements of the building in terms of heat losses. The heat loss though window constructions is about 20-25% of total heat loss. Heat insulation of translucent constructions can be improved by increasing the number of glasses and chambers of multiple glass panes, but will result in increased construction cost and decreased optical transmission. The reasonable alternative is the usage of low-emissivity glass, which is practically the same as ordinary glass in terms of optical transmission, but it also reflects the heat radiation back into the <b>room.</b> The major <b>indicator</b> which characterizes the ability of glass to reflect heat radiation is its emissivity (E) or the [...] "emission factor". The emission factor of ordinary glass is 0.83; the factor for low-emissive glass can reach 0.03, so that more than 90% of accumulated heat will be reflected back into the room. The lower the emission factor is, the more effective is the material to reflect the heat, and the more heat it will accumulate. To compare, the emission factor of a multiple glass pane with two chambers, which is made of ordinary glass, {{is the same as the}} emission factor of a multiple glass pane with one chamber, which was produced with usage of low-emissive glass. Besides energy-efficient functions in cold seasons of the year, low-emissive glass possesses the ability to reflect the excess of outside heat energy in summer seasons; the optical transmission coefficient is affected insignificantly in this way. The additional factor of reduce of heat transfer of multiple glass panes is the usage of low thermal conductivity gases - Ar or Kr - to fill the chambers. In present-day multiple glass panes Ar is more often used, which helps to reduce heat losses by 10-20%, though the cost of multiple glass panes is insignificantly increased.|$|R
