Since Long (1975), the conventional wisdom has been that <b>ownership</b> <b>risk</b> induces a firm to overuse the stock of a resource. However, the empirical evidence is mixed. In particular, Bohn and Deacon (2000) finds that weak property rights have an ambiguous effect on present extraction. We provide a theoretical model supporting these mixed observations in a common-pool resource environment. We show that if <b>ownership</b> <b>risk</b> includes a risk of expropriation in which the identities of the excluded firms are unknown ex ante, then the present extraction of all firms may decrease along with a higher risk of expropriation.

Design/methodology/approach: The study focuses on international strategic R&D joint ventures of US firms. The sample {{is made up of}} 266 firms. Regression models are used in the testing of the hypotheses. Findings: The authors show a clear difference between the effects of performance versus relational <b>risks</b> on <b>ownership</b> decisions in international joint ventures (IJVs). In response to performance risk, firms are less likely to pursue a majority ownership, whereas with relational risk the effect is opposite. Originality/value: A key contribution of this paper is that it shows the effects of performance versus relational <b>risks</b> on <b>ownership</b> decisions in IJVs. Another contribution is the finding that IJV experience moderates the effects of relational risk factors on firms' ownership decisions in joint ventures. With greater joint venture experience, firms are more likely to take a non-dominant position in response to diverse partners as they develop routines and capabilities that allow them to better manage IJV partners and minimize the risk of partner opportunism without the need for majority ownership. 20 page(s...|$|R

Our empirical results suggest that, during 1994 - 1996, the largest shareholders engage in low risk-taking activities when they hold large cash flow rights and have low deviation of cash flow from control rights. However, the risk is higher when the largest family shareholder enters the board and when Chairman-CEO can manipulate loan loss provisions. After the financial crisis, earnings management through discretion on loan loss provisions reduces risk. Overall, this study suggests that the problems underlying the implicit guarantee scheme are different between banks and finance companies, and between types of governance structure.

40|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{developments in}} information technology and the growing economic significance of the emerging Eastern European, South American and Asian economies, international financial activity remains strongly concentrated in {{a relatively small number}} of international financial centres. That concentration of financial activity requires a critical mass of office occupation and creates demand for high specification, high cost space. The demand for that space is increasingly linked to the fortunes of global capital markets. That linkage has been emphasised by developments in real estate markets, notably the development of global real estate investment, innovation in property investment vehicles and the growth of debt securitisation. The resultant interlinking of occupier, asset, debt and development markets within and across global financial centres is a source of potential volatility and risk.

40|$|Bank managers, stockholders, and {{directors}} must work closely together in deciding what risks their bank will assume {{and how to}} control the bank's overall risk exposure. Each decision-maker will {{have to understand the}} risk preferences of others in order to make mutually acceptable decisions and develop policies that reflect all of their concerns. To the extent that weak risk control is tied to management and ownership structure, bank examiners must also understand the basic components of a sound management and ownership structure if the examiner is to suggest corrective steps for a problem institution.; This study looks at a sample of Tenth Federal Reserve District banks to investigate the relationship between bank <b>risk,</b> <b>ownership</b> of the bank by managers, {{and the degree to which}} managers and owners have their wealth concentrated in their bank stockholdings. Data for 270 randomly selected banks reveal that ownership and wealth diversification of bank owners and managers do influence bank risk. These effects extend not only to the overall risk of the bank, but are also reflected uniquely in asset quality measures, bank leverage, and other parts of a bank's risk exposure.; Major findings highlight connections between bank <b>risk,</b> <b>ownership</b> structure, and manager wealth. Banks are less risky when bank managers have a higher concentration of wealth in their bank and, thus, have more to lose from taking on additional risk. Possibly seeking to avoid large loan losses that could threaten their employment, hired managers typically operate their banks with lower credit risk than banks with owner managers. Using capital as a buffer against risk, owner-manager banks tend to have higher capitalization than banks with hired managers. Stock ownership by hired managers provides incentives to operate their bank more in line with the risk preferences of owners. Finally, a hired-manager bank will be less risky when a major owner monitoring the bank has much of his or her wealth concentrated in the bank's stock.; Thus, ownership structure and concentration of wealth in bank equity have a significant influence on bank risk. Understanding how risk preferences depend on ownership and wealth diversification can be valuable information to managers and owners as they grapple with the level and type of risk to take in their banks.

This dedication interacted with heightened risk consciousness to fuel a sense of undelimited responsibility. Parents tended not to place sectoral or temporal boundaries around their responsibility {{for the care of}} their child.

40|$|The {{paradigm}} shift to more distributed flood risk management (FRM) {{strategies in the}} UK involves devolved responsibilities to the local, {{and the need to}} enhance <b>risk</b> <b>ownership</b> by communities. This poses questions about how communities build resilience to future flood risk, and how agencies support these processes. This paper explores results from interdisciplinary research on “sustainable flood memory” (SFM) in context of effective FRM as a conceptual contribution to a global priority. The project aimed to increase understanding of how flood memories provide a platform for developing and sharing lay knowledges, creating social learning opportunities to increase communities’ adaptive capacities for resilience. The paper starts by conceptually framing resilience, community, lay knowledge, and flood memory. It then explores key themes drawn from semi-structured interviews with floodplain residents affected by the UK Summer 2007 floods in four different settings, which contrasted in terms of their flood histories, experiences and kinds of “communities”. SFM were found to be associated with relational ways of knowing, situated in emotions, changing materiality and community tensions. These all influenced active remembering and active forgetting. The paper reflects on varying integrations of memory, lay knowledges and resilience, and critically evaluates implications of the SFM concept for the strategy, process and practice of developing community flood resilience. Given the concept’s value and importance of “memory work”, the paper proposes a framework to translate the concept practically into community resilience initiatives, and to inform how risk and flood experiences are communicated within communities...|$|E

The OLS estimation results indicate that, at lower and higher ranges of Tobin’s Q, banks employ higher debt, and reduce their debt at intermediate range. This is due to the complex interaction of market conditions, agency costs, and bankruptcy costs.

Also, institutional investors may {{play an important role in}} Latin American corporate governance, particularly ADR holders and pension funds. The second volume of the special issue includes five case studies: business groups, property and control structures in Chile, Brazil, Mexico and East Asia. Also, the role of pension funds in Chilean corporate governance is analyzed. We conclude that significant control and ownership concentration exists in all of the cases studied, beyond the minimum needed for control; that the role of banks differs substantially in the different cases; and that group structures are diverse, being notably simpler in Chile.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is twofold. Firstly, it examines the relationship between the use of financial and non-financial performance measures in executives’ annual incentive systems and firm performance. Secondly, it looks at the extent to which this relationship is influenced by five different organisational contingencies (business <b>risk,</b> <b>ownership</b> structure, organisational culture, the quality of the performance measures used in executives’ annual incentives and the effectiveness of the executives’ reward system). Agency theory and contingency theory are used to develop the theoretical framework that underpins this study. The research design is based on survey and archival data from 132 private and publicly quoted organisations based in the UK. Data is studied using multivariate analysis, in particular, multiple regression analysis with main and interaction effects. Contrary to expectations, the study finds that the relationship between the use of financial and non-financial performance measures in executives’ annual incentives and economic firm performance (measured by return on assets and sales annual growth) is negative rather than positive. However, this relationship is not universalistic. Results suggest that when organisations operate in high or low business risk environments or when organisations have clan or adhocracy cultural values the use of multi-criteria performance measures in executives’ annual incentives is beneficial as it facilitates the achievement of business goals. Results also suggest that ownership structure, the quality of performance measures and the effectiveness of executives’ reward systems are organisational contingencies that do not influence the performance impact of using multi-criteria performance measures in executives’ annual incentive systems. This thesis contributes to the management literature; in particular, to the literature that looks at the use of non-financial performance measures in management control systems. It contributes to agency-based research by providing empirical evidence that refutes some of its premises regarding the use of multi-criteria performance measures in incentive systems. This thesis also contributes to contingency-based research as it supports the notion that there is no universally appropriate management control system –in this case, the executive incentive system– which applies equally to all organisations in all circumstances.

40|$|Efficient and {{comprehensive}} risk management is critical for successful delivery of engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) projects. Complexity of construction projects is on the rise, which makes it necessary to model uncertainties and to manage risk items related to this class of projects. For decades, researchers and construction practitioners worked together to introduce methods for risk identification and assessment. Considerably less effort was directed towards the development of methods for mitigation, monitoring, and control. The respective individual limitations of these methods prevent the development of comprehensive model which satisfies the needs of practitioners. In this research a {{comprehensive risk management}} model “CRMM” is developed to address the limitations of existing methods and {{to fill the gap}} between research and practice. The developed model implements a micro system approach to introduce a novel risk identification methodology that provides a systematic procedure to identify risk associated with construction projects. The identification procedure implements root cause analysis and brainstorming technique to identify risk items, consequences, and root causes. The developed CRMM also introduces new method for determination of <b>risk</b> <b>ownership</b> utilizing fuzzy set theory and “One Risk – One Owner” concept. The ownership determination method allocates risk to the owner with highest ability, effectiveness, and capacity to deal with that risk. It also introduces a new qualitative and quantitative evaluation process that utilizes fuzzy set theory and fuzzy probability theory, as well as a new risk mapping procedure which allows for the determination of risk level associated with any project component (e. g., category). The quantitative assessment methodology allows for the use of linguistic and numeric fuzzy evaluations. Fuzzy Linguistic-Numeric Conversion Scheme (FLNCS) is introduced to convert the linguistic evaluations into numeric. The quantitative assessment methodology also introduces the pre-mitigation contingency that represents the contingency fund required for a risk in case no mitigation strategy is implemented. In this respect a novel risk mitigation framework is developed to generate and evaluate possible mitigation strategies for each risk being considered. It also provides a selection procedure which allows users to select the most effective mitigation strategy; making use of fuzzy set theory. The mitigation methodology introduces the post-mitigation contingency that quantifies the contingency required for the selected mitigation strategy. Performance of selected mitigation strategy is monitored using a newly developed risk monitoring method that compares the actually depleted contingency to the post mitigation contingency. The developed monitoring method provides an early warning that alerts users of detected possible failure of selected mitigation strategy. It also determines the correct time for initiation of control process based on a set of qualitative factors. Once risk control process is initiated, the developed control method identifies, evaluates, and selects the most effective control action(s) to support the selected mitigation strategy. In cases where the selected control action fails, the developed control method notifies the user to revise the risk management plan. These notifications allows user to avoid potential failures of similar risk items which are expected to occur in the future. The developed CRMM was coded using VB. Net under Microsoft® windows and. NET framework environment to facilitate its application. A set of case studies are collected from literature and analysed to validate the developed methods within CRMM and to illustrate their essential features. Also, a numerical example elucidates the complete computational processes of the developed comprehensive model...|$|E
