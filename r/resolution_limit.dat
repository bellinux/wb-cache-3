The concept is illustrated by <b>resolution</b> <b>limited</b> filtering ECG gated B-scan echocardio-graphic images.

25|$|With {{the natural}} Poisson {{distribution}} {{due to the}} random arrival and absorption times of the photons, there is an expected natural dose (photon number) variation of at least several percent 3 sigma, making the exposure process susceptible to stochastic variations. The dose variation leads to {{a variation of the}} feature edge position, effectively becoming a blur component. Unlike the hard <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> imposed by diffraction, shot noise imposes a softer limit, with the main guideline being the ITRS line width roughness (LWR) spec of 8% (3s) of linewidth. Increasing the dose will reduce the shot noise, but this also requires higher source power.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{infrared}} microscopy {{refers to}} microscopy performed at infrared wavelengths. In the typical instrument configuration a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) {{is combined with}} an optical microscope and an infrared detector. [...] The infrared detector can be a single point detector, a linear array or a 2D focal plane array. [...] The FTIR provides the ability to perform chemical analysis via infrared spectroscopy and the microscope and point or array detector enable this chemical analysis to be spatially resolved, i.e. performed at {{different regions of the}} sample. As such, the technique is also called infrared microspectroscopy [...] (an alternative architecture involves the combination of a tuneable infrared light source and single point detector on a flying objective). This technique is frequently used for infrared chemical imaging, where the image contrast is determined by the response of individual sample regions to particular IR wavelengths selected by the user, usually specific IR absorption bands and associated molecular resonances [...] A key limitation of conventional infrared microspectroscopy is that the spatial resolution is diffraction-limited. [...] Specifically the spatial resolution is limited to a figure related to the wavelength of the light. [...] For practical IR microscopes, the spatial resolution is limited to 1-3X the wavelength, depending on the specific technique and instrument used. [...] For mid-IR wavelengths, this sets a practical spatial <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> of ~3-30 μm.|$|E

50|$|To the left, the pinhole is large, and {{geometric}} optics applies; the <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> is about 1.5 times the {{radius of the}} pinhole. (Spurious resolution is also seen in the geometric-optics limit.) To the right, the pinhole is small, and Fraunhofer diffraction applies; the <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> is given by the far-field diffraction formula shown in the graph and now increases as the pinhole is made smaller. In the region of near-field diffraction (or Fresnel diffraction), the pinhole focuses the light slightly, and the <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> is minimized when the focal length f (the distance between the pinhole and the film plane) is given by f = s2/λ. At this focal length, the pinhole focuses the light slightly, and the <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> is about 2/3 of the radius of the pinhole. The pinhole {{in this case is}} equivalent to a Fresnel zone plate with a single zone. The value s2/λ is in a sense the natural focal length of the pinhole.|$|E
5000|$|Rayleigh's <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> {{is reached}} {{when the two}} stars are {{separated}} by the theoretical radius of the first dark interval around the Airy disk, which {{is larger than the}} disk's apparent radius, so that a distinct dark gap appears between the two disks. Most astronomers say they can still distinguish the two stars when they are closer than Rayleigh's <b>resolution</b> <b>limit.</b> Sparrow's <b>Resolution</b> <b>Limit</b> is reached when the combined light from two overlapping and equally bright Airy disks is constant along a line between the central peak brightness of the two Airy disks. However, at the Sparrow <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> the two Airy disks will appear to be just touching at their edges, which according to Sparrow is due to a brightness contrast response of the eye. The same reasoning applies to the resolution of two wavelengths in a spectroscope, where lines of emission or absorption will have a diffraction induced width analogous to the diameter of an Airy disk.|$|E
