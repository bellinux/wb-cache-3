40|$|Pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} {{pemphigus}} vulgaris characterized by pustules and/or papillomatous vegetations, preferentially affecting intertriginous and periorificial areas. Exceptional manifestations may be misdiagnosed resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis is confirmed by immunofluorescence and detection of anti-desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and/or anti-Dsg 1 antibodies. We herein report an unusual manifestation of PVeg. At the time of first presentation, lesions were restricted to the <b>right</b> <b>ring</b> <b>finger’s</b> tip. Although mucous membranes were initially not affected, high levels of anti-Dsg 3 antibodies were detected while anti-Dsg 1 and anti-desmocollin (Dsc) 1, 2, and 3 antibodies were absent. To compare our immunological findings with previous reports, all accessible Anglophone literature published since December 1988 was evaluated. We identified 52 patients suffering from PVeg, 7 of these showed anti-Dsg 3 antibodies without any mucous membrane involvement. Notably, the detection of anti-Dsg 1 and anti-Dsg 3 antibodies does not necessarily correlate with the involvement of skin and/or mucous membranes. This {{might be due to}} more specific and complex antibody constellations in nonclassical or atypical pemphigus...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{patterns}} of fingerprints {{is important in}} anthropology and medical genetics, chiefly because of their diagnostic usefulness. In the present work, we studied the frequencies of various types of skin ridges of the first phalanx in patients with sever oligospermia or azospermia. In a double-blind case-control study, we determined the frequencies of fingerprints in 880 first phalanxes belonging to 48 men with sever oligospermia and 40 men with azospermia. We determined the types of fingerprints based on Galton classification. Also their FRC, TFRC and AFRC were calculated. Then the results were compared {{with each other and}} general population as control group. The most frequent type of fingerprint in both case groups was "Loop". Frequencies of different types among two groups of cases were statistically different (P< 0. 005). Also they were statistically different with general population (P< 0. 005). The largest mean of FRC in men with oligospermia was belonging to the left <b>ring</b> <b>fingers</b> (23. 1) and the second to the right thumbs (21. 91). The largest mean of FRC in men with azospermia was belonging to the right thumbs (23. 6) and the second to the <b>right</b> <b>ring</b> <b>fingers</b> (22. 6). The mean of TFRCs in men with oligosoermia and azospermia were 106. 8 and 114. 39, respectively, and the mean of AFRCs in those two groups were 14 and 11, respectively; their differences were not statistically significant. It can be concluded that qualitative feathers of the fingerprints of men with oligospermia and azospermia were different {{with each other and with}} general population. And quantitative feathers of the fingerprints in those two case groups were statistically different as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Kienböck's {{disease is}} a {{condition}} of osteonecrosis of the lunate bone in the hand, and most patients present with a painful and sometimes swollen wrist with a limited range of motion in the affected wrist. Vaughan-Jackson syndrome {{is characterized by the}} disruption of the digital extensor tendons, beginning on the ulnar side with the extensor digiti minimi and extensor digitorum communis tendon of the small finger. It is most commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. We describe a case of a patient with an unusual presentation of Kienböck's disease with symptoms similar to those of Vaughan-Jackson syndrome. Case presentation A 40 -year-old man of Indian ethnic origin with no known history of trauma presented to our clinic with a ten-day history of an inability to extend his <b>right</b> little and <b>ring</b> <b>fingers</b> with associated pain in his right wrist. He was being treated with long-term steroids but had no other significant medical history. His examination revealed an inability to extend the metacarpal and phalangeal joints of the <b>right</b> <b>ring</b> and little <b>fingers</b> with localized tenderness over the lunate bone. Spontaneous disruption of the extensor tendons was diagnosed clinically and, after radiological investigation, was confirmed to be secondary to dorsal extrusion of the fragmented lunate bone. The patient underwent surgical repair of the tendons and had a full recovery afterward. Conclusion Kienböck's disease, though rare, is an important cause of spontaneous extensor tendon rupture. The original description of Vaughan-Jackson syndrome was of rupture of the extensor tendons of the little and <b>ring</b> <b>fingers</b> caused by attrition at an arthritic inferior radioulnar joint. We describe a case of a patient with Kienböck's disease that first appeared to be a Vaughan-Jackson-like syndrome. </p...|$|R
40|$|A unusual {{example of}} Dupuytren's disease occured {{in a black}} patient with a strong diathesis. The disease {{affected}} the insertion of flexor carpi ulnaris at the wrist {{as well as the}} palm. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1996) 21 B: 3 : 367 - 368 Dupuytren's disease was originally described affecting the digits of the hand. The deformity results from contraction of fibrous bands associated withthe palmar fascia and other fibrous structures of the hand. We report a case of histologically confirmed Dupuytren's disease at the wrist. CASE REPORT A 63 -year-old black patient presented with a 25 -year history of progressive contraction of the left little and <b>right</b> <b>ring</b> <b>fingers.</b> He had sought reatment because of the development of painful plaques in both palms and over the ulnar border of his wrist, proximal to the flexor crease. He ~tso had mild Peyronie's disease, but no evidence of plantar fasciitis. He was a non-insulin dependent diabetic, on glibencla-mide. There was no history of epilepsy or alcoholism. On examination, there was a 90 ° contracture at the proximal interphalangeal joint of his left little finger, with no deformity at the metacarpophalangeal joint or at the wrist. There were painful nodules in the palm, and {{at the base of his}} hypothenar eminence (Fig 1). At operation a limited palmar fasciectomy was carried out, including an isolated band from the lumbrical muscle to the PIPJ level, allowing fldl passive extension of the little finger. The wrist was explored through a separate incision, and a nodule of fibrous tissue was found extending Fig 1 The patient's left hand showing Dupuytren's disease affecting the palm and little finger. There is also a nodule overlying the insertion of flexor carpi ulnaris. Fig 2 Intraoperative photograph showing fibrous nodule overlying the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris...|$|R

5000|$|The {{choice of}} finger is also less than settled until recent times; during the 17th century in England {{it was not}} unusual to wear the wedding ring on the thumb.

These fake nails are not worn/glued over the entire fingernail, rather, they are worn on {{approximately half of the}} front tip of the nail. Commonly, he uses a Dunlop thumbpick which he files down so that the tip of the pick is shorter and at a more comfortable angle for his playing style. As is commonly seen, Dufour has two <b>rings</b> on his <b>right</b> index and <b>ring</b> <b>finger.</b> These are his wedding and engagement rings.

40|$|Aim: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the significance of dermatoglyphics in predicting the development of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) among gutkha chewers. Objective: To evaluate the finger tip patterns in OSMF patients. Materials and Methods: The {{study was conducted}} on 75 subjects selected randomly from the OPD of Oral medicine and Radiology, out of which 25 subjects were gutkha chewers with OSMF, 25 were gutkha chewers without OSMF, and 25 were healthy subjects who were used as controls. The fingertip patterns were recorded using duplicating ink on A 3 size paper and analyzed for their configurations using a magnifying lens. Results: Statistical analysis showed significant increase in the percentage of loops among gutkha chewers with OSMF and controls, and significant increase in the whorl patterns among the control group. The distribution of finger tip patterns of all the digits showed statistically significant increase in whorl pattern in right index (RI) and <b>right</b> <b>ring</b> (RR) <b>finger.</b> Conclusion: The present study showed {{a significant increase in the}} loop pattern among gutkha chewers with OSMF in comparison to controls. Thus, it can be concluded that people with more number of loop patterns are more prone to develop OSMF as compared to those with other patterns. Hence, dermatoglyphics can be used in this modern era to forecast the future of gutkha chewers, without much intervention...|$|R
