5000|$|Gessmann {{developed}} and has taught humanistic psychodrama since 1979 {{as a new}} form of psychodrama. It became an integral part of humanistic psychology. [...] Gessmann moved the collective action and nature of the people {{at the center of the}} therapeutic ethic. [...] Faith, love, hope, and the idea of a human community are essential to meaningful humanistic psychodrama. Intuitive look for detecting the wholeness of a thing, the dialectical conception <b>of</b> polarities, the <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> absolute <b>authority,</b> take decisive influence on the image of man and his life. The goals and methods of classical psychodrama were necessarily re-evaluated and described. This led to a fundamental change in international psychodrama practice. Gessmann is a member of the American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama as well as the International Association of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama since 1977.|$|R

Upon the Pope's refusal he was taken prisoner, and on February 20 was escorted from the Vatican to Siena, and thence to the [...] near Florence. The French declaration of war against Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany led to Pius' removal, though by this time deathly ill, by way of Parma, Piacenza, Turin and Grenoble to the citadel of Valence, where he died six weeks later, on August 29, 1799. Napoleon was not directly involved. He was in the Near East, and did not return to France until November, 1799, where he conducted the coup-d'état of November 9 (18 Brumaire).|$|R

Aimlessness means <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> all aims. Helplessness means <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> all help. No master, no disciple, means <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> spirituality. And the New Life I have in mind eventually means absolute renunciation. Therefore, if any one asks you what this New Life is, say, 'Absolute and perfect renunciation.' If they ask, 'Renunciation of what?' say, 'Of everything - aims, hopes, help and life itself.'" ...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{contraception}} {{is a story}} told largely {{from the perspective of}} reproductive rights. This perspective, while compelling, limits the true scope of contraceptive history and fails to adequately explain {{some of the most important}} developments regarding politics, sexuality, and public mores. This is a case study of Connecticut from 1940 to 1965. Research demonstrates within the state and the United States this was an important period of transition in terms of political liberalism and sexual liberalism. Connecticut produced one of the most important legal precedents of the later twentieth century, Griswold v. Connecticut. The case articulated the legal right to privacy as it pertained to a married couple 2 ̆ 7 s use of contraception. In order to understand the historical context of this case, this thesis explores four elements of the contraceptive dynamic. The organized movement, the consumer market, religious authorities, and public policy each form the basis of a chapter. The study concludes only through the interplay of consumer demand, expert opinion, moral sanction by religious and authorities, and governmental unwillingness to enforce anti-contraceptive laws did access to and acceptance of contraception grow. Political and social liberalism shared common ground during this era by advocating for a citizen 2 ̆ 7 s personal freedom to make certain choices privately without government interference. Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s history reveals the social and cultural forces which shaped the definition of privacy from which a new legal articulation of privacy evolved in 1965. Unknown to those involved in the case, Griswold would become an important dividing point in American history concerning concepts on sexuality and citizenship. Yet, the acknowledgement of a right to privacy in contraception was not a complete <b>renunciation</b> <b>of</b> government <b>authority</b> to regulate sexuality or morality. Rather it was a redrawing of the boundaries of proper sexuality in an effort to maintain a certain amount of social control over sexual behavior and citizens 2 ̆ 7 actions. Articulating and redefining the right to privacy would become the mechanism through which society regulated sexuality, morality and social relations. ...|$|R
