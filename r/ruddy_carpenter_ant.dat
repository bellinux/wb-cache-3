40|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> in {{the genus}} Camponotus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are {{considered}} {{some of the}} most serious pests to wood structures worldwide. There are over 900 species of <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> in the world, 50 in the United States and Canada, and 12 in Utah.

50|$|Camponotus nearcticus, {{commonly}} named smaller <b>carpenter</b> <b>ant</b> is {{a relatively}} small <b>carpenter</b> <b>ant.</b> Its appearance is similar of that to Lasius niger, commonly named the black garden ant. The ant is a household pest.|$|R

50|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> {{and their}} larvae are eaten {{in various parts}} of the world. In Australia, the Honeypot ant (Camponotus inflatus) is {{regularly}} eaten raw by Indigenous Australians. It is a particular favourite source of sugar if Australian Aboriginals are living in arid regions, partially digging up their nests instead of digging them up entirely, in order to preserve this food source. In North America, lumbermen during the early years in Maine would eat <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> to prevent scurvy, and in John Muir's publication, First Summer in the Sierra, Muir notes that the Digger Indians of California ate the tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants.</b> In Africa, <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> are among the vast amount of species that are consumed by the San people.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> {{can damage}} wood {{used in the}} {{construction}} of buildings. They can leave behind a sawdust-like material called frass that provides clues to their nesting location. <b>Carpenter</b> <b>ant</b> galleries are smooth and very different from termite-damaged areas, which have mud packed into the hollowed-out areas. <b>Carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> can be identified by the general presence of one upward protruding node, looking like a spike, at the [...] "waist" [...] attachment between the thorax and abdomen (petiole). Control involves application of insecticides in various forms including dusts and liquids. The dusts are injected directly into galleries and voids where the <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> are living. The liquids are applied in areas where foraging ants are likely to pick the material up and spread the poison to the colony upon returning.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> are foragers that {{typically}} eat parts of other dead insects or substances derived from other insects.

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular methods for {{achieving}} control of the Red Imported Fire Ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, is through the use of broadcast baits. Several factors contribute to bait efficacy, one of which may be particle size. The goals of these laboratory studies were to determine particle size and bait preference using Advance Select Granular Ant Bait and Advance <b>Carpenter</b> <b>Ant</b> Scatter Bait, determine the effect of starvation on bait removal and recruitment to <b>Carpenter</b> <b>Ant</b> Scatter Bait, and determine if any correlation existed between head capsule width and particle size selected. Experimental colonies removed significantly more 1400 - 2000 ?m particles of Select Granular Ant Bait, while <b>ants</b> foraging on <b>Carpenter</b> <b>Ant</b> Scatter Bait preferred 1000 - 1400 ?m particles. Mean number of ants present at bait mirrored results from bait removal test. Ants displayed a preference for <b>Carpenter</b> <b>Ant</b> Scatter Bait based on mean number of ants present at bait for the 10 -d foraging period. For starvation assays, significant differences in bait removal and number of ants present occurred in the 0 -d group. Ants starved for 5 d removed significantly more bait of all particle sizes, and removed greater amounts of 1000 - 1400 ?m <b>Carpenter</b> <b>Ant</b> Scatter Bait than other sizes. Head width reliably predicted particle size selected, but the linear model explained very little of the observed variation for ants foraging on Select Granular Ant Bait (R 2 = 0. 043) or <b>Carpenter</b> <b>Ant</b> Scatter Bait (R 2 = 0. 047). This study supported the significant role of bait size and starvation period in S. invicta bait preference, and demonstrated how size preference may vary depending on bait type...|$|R
