5000|$|By December 1966, Brian had {{produced}} and completed {{most of the}} Smile backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from their tour of Britain, they were confused by the new music and the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. Would-be business partner David Anderle persuaded the group to file a lawsuit against Capitol for unpaid royalties. Within the suit, there was a <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> the band's contract, which would have allowed them to form their own independent record label, Brother Records. Throughout {{the first half of}} 1967, the album's release date was repeatedly postponed as Brian tinkered with the recordings, experimenting with different takes and mixes, unable or unwilling to supply a completed version of the album.

5000|$|On July 11, 2016, Bell Media {{applied to}} the CRTC for a <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> CKSL's {{broadcast}} license, citing severe deteriorating conditions at the transmitter site. A technical review was done {{at the location of}} CKSL's transmitter building and towers by Bell Media and its contractors, and they found that the AM array's broadcast towers posed a structural risk, as well as needing their aircraft warning lights to be repaired to bring it back up to proper building, safety and aircraft codes. The transmitter building was also found to have shifted off its foundation. The cost estimate to repair all these issues was in the $CAD 3 million range, and with CKSL's long-term ratings performance at dead last of the ten commercial radio stations serving the London area, and with little hope of that changing any time soon, coupled with the region's four per cent decline of advertising revenue in radio since 2013, the CRTC accepted Bell's request to shut down CKSL.
