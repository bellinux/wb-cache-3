50|$|On February 9, 2007, a {{preliminary}} settlement in a class-action lawsuit against TracFone {{was carried out}} by Jeanette Wagner, and approved in the Boone (County) Circuit Court in Kentucky. The complainants alleged that Tracfone misled consumers by charging a <b>roaming</b> <b>rate</b> in their home calling area (they were charged for 2 units per minute, not the usual 1 unit per minute), and that it refused to extend their prepaid service time during handset repairs. Tracfone gave each of their customers an extra 20 units of airtime.|$|E
5000|$|On February 3, 2012 all {{the monthly}} plans were again changed. The Canada-wide plans {{increased}} in price by $5. While they now feature the caller ID and voicemail calling features, per-second billing {{was replaced with}} per-minute billing. Also, the new $30/month plan has 100 minutes instead of 150 minutes. The cost of additional minutes has increased from 35¢/min to 45¢/min, {{and the cost of}} additional outgoing text messages is now 20¢/text. As well, the <b>roaming</b> <b>rate</b> while in the United States has increased from $1.35/min to $1.50/min. Customers who signed up on February 2, 2012 or earlier are grandfathered with their older plan, and are thus unaffected by these changes unless they switch to a newer plan. [...] These changes were met with criticism from both existing and potential customers, as Koodo's older plans offered a much better value for airtime. It should be noted that unlimited SMS and MMS are no longer included in the City Koodo plan, because it has been replaced by the new calling features. Only the first 50 messages are free of charge. One must either purchase the unlimited messaging add-on, or pay-per-use, to send additional messages.|$|E
50|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Swiss newspaper Tagesanzeiger, some consumers criticized Swisscom's international <b>roaming</b> <b>rates</b> and its subscription rates for mobile phones. The main concern of the consumers in the survey was that they found the rates to be too high.|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of plan, {{received}} {{text messages}} are free throughout the world. As of 2017, the three incumbent wireless providers in Canada continue to charge {{much more than}} Freedom for roaming in the United States.

40|$|KPMG {{was engaged}} to {{investigate}} international roaming charges, including the differences between prices paid by Australian consumers and consumers in other countries. This report finds that Australians roaming overseas pay more on average than consumers from countries in Asia and North American roaming in Australia; the reverse was true for Europe, although the <b>roaming</b> <b>rates</b> there are higher than elsewhere on average...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of my work}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of roaming price regulation on the market of mobile phone operators and determine, whether the only result of union price regulation of mobile operators is cheaper <b>roaming</b> <b>rate.</b> The roaming price regulation mainly resulted in the decrease {{in the cost of}} messages, calls (both incoming and outgoing) and data services when using the phone within the European Union. Roaming prices were previously very high. The roaming prices have dropped significantly since 2007, when the EU roaming legislative was introduced. I came to conclusion, according to established data, that mobile operators' roaming price regulation have affected also other spheres (mainly cost of messages sent to foreign phone numbers). Furthermore roaming price regulation have affected delay of domestic prices - cutting and developement of services...|$|E
40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of smartphones and tablets, mobile de-vices are soon becoming a preferred medium of Internet ac-cess in Wireless LANs (WLANs). Due to their smaller form factor, these truly mobile devices allow the users to access the wireless networks while undergoing different types of mo-bility, posing new challenges to wireless protocols. Current history-based protocols that maximize performance in static settings do not work well in mobile settings where wireless conditions change rapidly. Thus, today’s WLANs {{need to be able}} to determine the type of the client’s mobility and em-ploy appropriate strategies in order to sustain high perfor-mance. While previous work tried to detect mobility using hints from sensors available in today’s mobile devices, in this work, we demonstrate how different mobility modes can be distinguished by using physical layer information – Channel State Information (CSI) and Time-of-Flight (ToF) – available at commodity APs, with no modifications on the client side. In addition, we demonstrate how fine-grained mobility deter-mination can be exploited to improve performance of client <b>roaming,</b> <b>rate</b> control, frame aggregation, and MIMO beam-forming. Our testbed experiments show that our mobility classification algorithm achieves more than 92 % accuracy in a variety of scenarios, and the combined throughput gain of all four mobility-aware protocols over their mobility-oblivious counterparts can be more than 100 %...|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Tenzing merged its {{operations}} {{into a new}} company, OnAir, formed with SITA and Airbus. OnAir originally intended to introduce broadband and in-flight cell services in 2005, but further delays in Inmarsat's satellite launches and other factors have put inflight trials back until early 2008 and first announced launch customer on Kingfisher Airlines mid-2009. At that time it plans to offer an in-flight cell GSM phone service, at international <b>roaming</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
50|$|In April 2013, Cover-More {{launched}} a global SIM card which allowed Australian travelers {{to save money}} on call and data <b>rates</b> versus standard <b>roaming</b> <b>rates.</b> The SIM is prepaid, compatible with most mobile phones and tablets, and works in more than 100 countries. Later that year, Cover-More renewed its partnership with Munch Re, which handed all underwriting responsibilities to Munich Re’s company Great Lakes Australia. In November 2013, Cover-More partnered with Indian company TrawellTag.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 2006, Brightroam Inc {{began as}} a {{subsidiary}} of Roadpost inc, leveraging their 15 years of history in providing short term cellular and international roaming services. The goal of the company was to provide international roaming services to North Americans, both to undercut <b>roaming</b> <b>rates</b> for GSM subs and to provide services to CDMA subscribers. Brightroam based its business plan around key factors such as highly Web-enabled automated sales, provisioning and customer service platform to reduce costs and pricing.|$|R
50|$|Mobilicity's roaming {{partners}} are Rogers Wireless in Canada and T-Mobile USA or AT&T in the United States for 2G,3G and 4G service. For both countries, prices are the same, and roaming minutes bundles {{can be purchased}} at a reduced cost. Some monthly plans also include such roaming minutes. If these minutes run out, or if a customer does not have them in their plan, regular <b>roaming</b> <b>rates</b> apply. <b>Roaming</b> is also available internationally at higher rates than in Canada and the USA.|$|R
5000|$|The UMX Max Android {{smartphone}} and a 3G network {{were launched}} by Public Mobile on November 22, 2011. [...] The ZTE N762 was launched on December 5, 2011. In December 2011, retail presence for Public Mobile has been expanded to Walmart Canada and Zellers stores. Roaming in the United States on Sprint Nextel's network was also launched during that month. Rates for this service {{are the same}} as Canadian <b>roaming</b> <b>rates.</b> Public Mobile added 45 000 new subscriptions in Q4 2011, finishing the year with 199 000 active customers.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, when high <b>roaming</b> charge <b>rates</b> persisted the Commission {{proposed}} {{to intervene in}} the market by setting maximum rates at which mobile network operators could charge their subscribers. The proposed regulation was approved by the European Parliament and by the Council of Ministers, and came into law in June 2007. It required capping of retail and wholesale voice roaming charges from 30 August 2007, unless a special roaming tariff applied. The maximum prices was set to decrease further in 2008 and 2009. The regulation also required that customers traveling to another member state would receive a text message of the charges that apply for roaming services. Originally the capping measures were introduced on a temporary basis and were due to expire on 30 June 2010.|$|R
40|$|Third-generation (3 G) {{cellular}} {{systems will}} provide global coverage and nearly universal <b>roaming,</b> offering data <b>rates</b> up to 2 Mb/s. The down side {{is that the}} deployment and management cost of 3 G networks is high. On the other hand, wireless LAN (WLAN) systems are more suited for hotspot coverage and offer data rates that easily exceed 3 G data rates with low investment cost. Hence, integrating the two systems would allow operators {{to take advantage of}} their best features...|$|R
40|$|The third {{generation}} (3 G) proposal for cellular communications claims to provide global <b>roaming,</b> high transfer <b>rates</b> and advanced services such as: commerce, {{global positioning system}} and multimedia messaging services via audio and video. In the framework of these complex networks several important computational processes are performed; not only do these operations require high performance solutions, but they must be accomplished within strict constraints regarding power consumption, size and cost. This paper discusses two important processes occurring in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks, namely encryption and MPEG- 4 video encoding; and proposes a hardware solution, {{in the form of}} a configurable Very Large Instruction Word (VLIW) parallel processor, to improve the performance of those processes...|$|R
50|$|The last {{member state}} of EFTA, Switzerland, is not {{party to the}} EEA agreement, and is instead linked to the EU {{by a series of}} {{bilateral}} agreements. Despite close relations with the EU in several fields, the regulations do not apply to Switzerland, and charges are usually considerably higher for EEA residents roaming in Switzerland, and for Swiss residents in the EEA, especially on internet data. Switzerland will not be part of the 2017 free rate agreements. Rates vary, sometimes EU rate at €0.05 and sometimes up to €10/MB. Some companies do offer EU <b>rate</b> <b>roaming</b> to Switzerland as well. Monaco, Andorra and San Marino have cooperation with the EU, like usage of the euro, but not free roaming.|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} {{we discuss the}} {{recently}} described roaming mechanism for chemical reactions {{from the point of}} view of nonlinear dynamical systems in phase space. The recognition of the roaming phenomenon shows the need for further developments in our fundamental understanding of basic reaction dynamics, as is made clear by considering some questions that cut across most studies of roaming: Is the dynamics statistical? Can transition state theory be applied to estimate <b>roaming</b> reaction <b>rates?</b> What role do saddle points on the potential energy surface play in explaining the behavior of roaming trajectories? How do we construct a dividing surface that is appropriate for describing the transformation from reactants to products for roaming trajectories? How should we define the roaming region? We show that the phase space perspective on reaction dynamics provides the setting in which these questions can be properly framed and answered. We illustrate these ideas by considering photodissociation of formaldehyde. The phase-space formulation allows an unambiguous description of all possible reactive events, which also allows us to uncover the phase space mechanism that explains which trajectories roam, as opposed to evolving toward a different reactive event...|$|R
40|$|This {{report found}} {{international}} mobile roaming services (IMRS) prices to be unreasonably high, considering the underlying costs, and identified {{some of the}} causes for this price level. This report aims to examine and suggest possible solutions and policy options that may {{address the problem of}} high IMRS charges. It assesses their viability and possible side effects. Report Summary The first report on international mobile roaming services (“International Mobile Roaming Charging in the OECD Area”, DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009) 8 /FINAL 1), provided information on market development and pricing of International Mobile Roaming Services (IMRS) in the OECD area. It found prices to be unreasonably high, considering the underlying costs, and identified some of the causes for high roaming prices. High wholesale charges, the fact that consumers do not seem to take into account roaming services when choosing a bundled mobile offer, lack of contestability and low consumer awareness of roaming prices and of substitutes were found to be among the reasons for this price level. This report is a follow-up that proposes solutions to the described problems, and assesses their viability and possible side effects. The development of on-net offers by operators with large footprints is a desirable market-driven {{solution to the problem of}} high wholesale roaming charges. This response was referred to as “internalisation” in the first roaming report. Although trans-national footprints are needed in order to avoid wholesale charges, on-net offers based on the internalisation of wholesale costs and traffic steering to subsidiaries are a natural solution to launch reasonably priced and convenient retail roaming offers. However, the number of operators with large footprints remains low, and some on-net offers are likely to be focused on roaming in a particular region (e. g. Zain in East Africa). Due to competition dynamics at the retail level and the fact that roaming services are an element of the mobile services bundle, trans-national operators are likely to decide not to lower retail prices in order to retain high revenues from non priceelastic customers. In the event of a marketplace dominated by few operators with large footprints, smaller operators may be put aside, due to their inability to internalise wholesale roaming costs. Bigger players may impose high wholesale charges and make them unable to launch competitive retail roaming offers. The natural response for smaller operators is to form alliances in order to get substantial wholesale rate reductions. Although such alliances have existed for some time and did not prove to be very successful in bringing down overall wholesale costs, they may be again a valid response in a new scenario with increased operator consolidation and the presence of a higher number of on-net offers. As a last resort, regulatory intervention may be warranted to allow for improved market contestability. Another way forward to improve market contestability in roaming services was termed “localisation” in the first report. Global Mobile Virtual Network Operators (global MVNOs) are those operators that gain access to local airtime on local terms and conditions, thus avoiding wholesale <b>roaming</b> <b>rates.</b> Even though a number of global MVNOs have entered the market during the last few years, this option still remains not very widespread. It faces some important drawbacks, such as customers being reluctant to have two mobile service providers, lack of brand recognition, etc. They also face serious challenges to expand their customer base such as low bargaining power compared to “national” MVNOs, and relatively low volumes to justify investments. However, global MVNOs remain as an alternative to provide better market contestability and this report supports enhancing their visibility and consumer awareness. National regulatory frameworks as well should enable global MVNOs to develop by allowing access to airtime on local terms and conditions.  ...|$|R
