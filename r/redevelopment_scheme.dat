5|$|The {{government}} {{sought help}} from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and P. R. China for funding for several projects and military advice. The failure of several GDR-led projects including the New Zanzibar Project, a 1968 urban <b>redevelopment</b> <b>scheme</b> to provide new apartments for all Zanzibaris, led to Zanzibar focussing on Chinese aid. The post-revolution Zanzibar government was accused of draconian controls on personal freedoms and travel and exercised nepotism in appointments to political and industrial offices, the new Tanzanian government being powerless to intervene. Dissatisfaction with the government {{came to a head}} with the assassination of Karume on 7 April 1972, which was followed by weeks of fighting between pro and anti-government forces. A multi-party system was eventually established in 1992, but Zanzibar remains dogged by allegations of corruption and vote-rigging, though the 2010 general election was seen to be a considerable improvement.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster in 1899 was a pivotal {{point in the}} {{development}} of Mayfair, following which all <b>redevelopment</b> <b>schemes</b> not already in operation were cancelled. In the following years, Government budget proposals such as David Lloyd George's establishment of the welfare state in 1909, greatly reduced the power of the Lords.

25|$|By the 1950s, {{with its}} {{continuing}} growth, {{the town was}} becoming congested, and the Council decided on another major <b>redevelopment</b> <b>scheme.</b> The Croydon Corporation Act was passed in 1956. This, coupled with national government incentives for office relocation out of London, led to the building of new offices and accompanying road schemes through the late 1950s and 1960s, and the town boomed as a business centre in the 1960s, with many multi-storey office blocks, an underpass, a flyover and multi-storey car parks.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{countries}} such as the People's Republic of China that practice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures. Singapore practices eminent domain under the Land Acquisitions Act, which allows it {{to carry out its}} Selective En bloc <b>Redevelopment</b> <b>Scheme</b> for urban renewal. The Amendments to the Land Titles Act allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not. Thus, eminent domain often invokes concerns of majoritarianism.|$|E

25|$|Urban {{regeneration}} {{has been}} ongoing in Barrow since the 1990s. Portland Walk Shopping Centre opened in 1998 anchored by Debenhams {{as part of}} a major reconstruction of Barrow town centre. Around the same time the Hindpool Retail Parks and Dock Museum were constructed over various former industrial sites in Barrow, including the dry dock, the Barrow Jute Works and the Barrow Steel Works. Recent construction projects in the town also include the £43 million expansion of Furness College's Channelside campus, £22.5 million Furness Academy new build, £14.5 million central Barrow flood relief scheme, £8.5 million Barrow police station, £5 million town centre <b>redevelopment</b> <b>scheme,</b> £4 million Scottish Power Wind Farm operations centre as well as the North Central Renewal Area, shake up of the town's residential and retirement homes and a number of large-scale hotel schemes catering for the influx of contractors working for BAE Systems.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{redevelopment}} {{currently under}} consideration, but numerous proposals {{have been submitted}} {{over the past twenty}} years. When Thessaloniki became the European capital of culture during 1997, the city council put together an organizing committee for the redevelopment of the waterfront of the city, including the redevelopment of Aristotelous Square. Of the many designs that were presented to the committee, some of them were very radical and others less so. In almost all proposals, there were provisions for a marina or a similar extension of the square onto waterfront, as well as a wheel similar to the London Eye in London. Up to date, no official <b>redevelopment</b> <b>scheme</b> has been made official. The current mayor of Thessaloniki, Yannis Boutaris, mentioned in his electoral campaign that Thessaloniki would undergo a major redevelopment to bring it into the 21st century, but so far no designs or any new announcements have been made public.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{sightings}} of fish as far downstream as Manchester city centre {{were reported in}} local newspapers. In February 1981 the Manchester Evening News reported that [...] "ten jacksharps , about two inches long" [...] had been spotted by a site manager working on the Mark Addy public house, which was then being built on the disused New Bailey Landing Stage, below New Bailey Street, {{on the border of}} Manchester and Salford. [...] Plans for developing the river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that, over the May bank holiday, the first pleasure cruise on the river in the 20th century would leave from the Mark Addy as part of a three-day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success. [...] In 1983 over 100canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could [...] "transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester". By 1984 two local men felt the waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still [...] "a class 4 river– top of the pollution chart". [...] During 1985 the Croal–Irwell Valley local plan was launched, listing 187proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. [...] The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that £67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. [...] In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches {{on the side of the}} river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester's first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre [...] "mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford– the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing £500m of investment and 13,000newjobs over the next 10years". [...] The Manchester Ship Canal Company also announced a £70 million <b>redevelopment</b> <b>scheme</b> for Pomona Docks in Salford, to include a marina, homes, offices and other commercial developments.|$|E
50|$|Walnut Hall was {{the subject}} of a number of {{demolition}} proposals and <b>redevelopment</b> <b>schemes</b> from the 1970s onwards, ranging from a proposed parking lot to residential developments that would have incorporated the heritage building.

50|$|In the {{establishment}} of urban renewal programmes, some difficulties were experienced by the PAP government. The obstacles came from the resistance of {{people who used to}} live in the slums and squatters. It was reported by Singapore newspapers that those people were reluctant to be replaced. This became the major problems of 1960s <b>redevelopment</b> <b>schemes.</b> Affordable land value also became one of its reasons. Another problem was that the government had to purchase the private land owned by the middle and upper society to make the land vacant and be used for redevelopment.|$|R
50|$|Recent developments, such as inner-city <b>redevelopment</b> <b>schemes,</b> {{mean that}} new arrivals in cities no longer {{necessarily}} {{settle in the}} centre. In some developed regions, the reverse effect, originally called counter urbanization has occurred, with cities losing population to rural areas, and is particularly common for richer families. This has been possible because of improved communications, and has been caused by {{factors such as the}} fear of crime and poor urban environments. It has contributed to the phenomenon of shrinking cities experienced by some parts of the industrialized world.|$|R
