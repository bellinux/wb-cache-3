5|$|Friendship International Airport was {{constructed}} between 1947 and 1950 {{as the new}} primary airport for Baltimore. To directly connect the airport with Baltimore, an access road was planned to link the new BaltimoreWashington Expressway, later designated MD 295, with the airport terminal. The first portion of the Friendship International Airport Access Road was completed from a full Y interchange at the expressway to an interchange with MD 170 in October 1949 and designated MD 46. The access road was completed from MD 170 to the airport terminal in July 1951, {{about the same time}} the expressway was completed between MD 46 and downtown Baltimore. The remainder of what is now I-195 was planned as early as 1969, when the portion of Metropolitan Boulevard north of US 1 was placed under construction. The freeway opened from the US 1 ramps northwest through the I-95 interchange to an intersection with Sulphur Spring Road just south of the modern Selford <b>Road</b> <b>overpass</b> in August 1974. The freeway was extended to its present terminus at Rolling Road and the ramps to UMBC Boulevard were constructed in 1975. Metropolitan Boulevard south of the I-95 interchange was marked as a second segment of MD 46 from when it opened. North of I-95, the freeway was marked as a relocation of MD 166. That segment of MD 46 was renumbered as an extension of MD 166 by 1981.|$|E
25|$|Between 2007 and 2008, {{the section}} of I-55 between I-80 and Welco Corners, {{originally}} built as the redirected path of US66 in 1957, was rebuilt and widened to three lanes in each direction to accommodate modern traffic loads. However, between I-80 and Gardner, I-55 today remains mostly as it was as US66 in 1957. This heritage is evident, with fully mature trees in interchange medians, several 1957-era motels and gas stations still in operation, and several original bridges still in use, such as the Smith Bridge over the Des Plaines River and the nearby Blodgett <b>Road</b> <b>overpass.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2.4 mile (4km) section from Armstrong Mill Road to Interstate 75 {{would be}} one of the costliest {{segments}} of the highway to be constructed, as it would feature an interchange at the interstate that was projected to cost $8.2 million. The right-of-way purchase from Palumbo Drive to Interstate 75 began in August 1986; construction was completed two years later. The alignment chosen followed south of Todds Road east of Armstrong Mill Road, then cross to the north side of Bryant Road and interchange with Interstate 75 approximately 200 feet north of the Bryant <b>Road</b> <b>overpass.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Merritt Parkway {{was built}} {{directly}} through Trumbull {{in the late}} 1930s. Trumbull has the distinction of harboring the youngest original Parkway underpass (Frenchtown Road), built in 1942, and the oldest Parkway overpass (at White Plains Road), built in 1934. Constructed of reinforced concrete and encased steel-girder design {{at a cost of}} $47,532. It was financed by NRA grants and Connecticut Highway Department funds, the White Plains <b>Road</b> <b>Overpass</b> is not a typical Parkway structure. It was designed prior to the Parkway concept being adopted in 1934 and reflects the newer state highway bridges seen throughout Connecticut during the early 1930s.|$|E
25|$|The line to {{the north}} was opened in 1872, {{as part of the}} North East railway to Wodonga. A {{completely}} new station, with a single platform, was provided in 1878, {{on the site of the}} present island platform, with passenger subways and footbridges added in 1886, along with conversion of the island platform to the current layout. It was also at this time that a <b>road</b> <b>overpass</b> was provided at Mount Alexander Road, in what was one of the first grade separation projects to be carried out in the state. In 1909, the present buildings were provided, along with a centre track between platforms 1 and 2.|$|E
25|$|Davis' Toad Tunnel is a {{wildlife}} crossing that {{was constructed in}} 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on The Daily Show. Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped {{from one side of}} a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line <b>Road</b> <b>overpass</b> which crosses Interstate 80. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21inches (53cm) wide and 18inches (46cm) high.|$|E

50|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{often have}} a significantly smaller structure gauge, and therefore the rolling stock used has a smaller loading gauge in both height and width. Conversion to a wider track gauge will often require enlargement of the structure gauge on bridges, under <b>road</b> <b>overpasses</b> and in tunnels. Embankments and cuts could need widening as well.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, the {{original}} station was relocated {{and placed in}} a deep cutting, coinciding with the construction of <b>road</b> <b>overpasses</b> for South <b>Road</b> and the Nepean Highway. At that time, provision was made for a third platform on {{the eastern side of the}} cutting. The third platform opened on 28 June 1987, when a third line from Caulfield was opened.|$|R
25|$|The Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad was {{chartered}} in 1866, {{connecting the}} Harlem River {{in the south}} and Port Chester in the north. The railroad opened in 1873, with some portions passing through the current park. The route, a branch of the New Haven Line operated by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, contained six stations. One of these stations, called alternatively City Island or Bartow, in Pelham (now part of the park). In 1895, the railroad re-acquired some of the land from the park In 1906, ownership of the Shore <b>Road</b> <b>overpass</b> over the Harlem and Port Chester railroad line was transferred to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.|$|E
25|$|The {{section of}} freeway between CR 525 and Drift Road (Exit 41) in Watchung was {{completed}} in 1974. The section from Drift Road to Route 24 (Exit 48) in Springfield Township was delayed because of environmental impacts to the Watchung Reservation. In order to mitigate opposition to the original plan, that was shifted closer to {{the northern edge of}} the Reservation, which required extensive cuts into the Second Watchung Mountain. Extra land was added to the Nikesite <b>Road</b> <b>overpass</b> and a separate land bridge was built to allow for animal migration. The road was also designed to use a narrower right-of-way with no median strip and just a Jersey barrier dividing the highway, to minimize the amount rock to be removed. This stretch of I-78 opened in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} changes to MD 166 {{came in the}} early 1970s with the {{construction}} of I-95 and Metropolitan Boulevard, the latter of which went under construction in 1969. When I-95 was completed through Arbutus in 1971, South Rolling Road was split. Metropolitan Boulevard opened from the US 1 ramps northwest through the I-95 interchange to an intersection with Sulphur Spring Road just south of the modern Selford <b>Road</b> <b>overpass</b> in August 1974. South Rolling Road was truncated in St. Denis by the construction of the US 1 ramps. The freeway was extended to its present terminus at Rolling Road and the ramps to UMBC Boulevard were constructed in 1975. Metropolitan Boulevard south of the I-95 interchange was marked as a second segment of MD 46disjoint from the section between MD 295 and Baltimore/Washington International Airportfrom when it opened. North of I-95, the freeway was marked as a relocation of MD 166. MD 166 was extended to US 1 and replaced that segment of MD 46 by 1981. MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus when I-195 was completed in June 1990.|$|E

500|$|The Tompkins Hill <b>Road</b> <b>overpass</b> is {{situated}} {{just south of}} Fields Landing and {{was built in the}} late 1960s. It suffered slight damage during the 1975 earthquake and was due for a retrofit in 1981. The overpass was constructed with cement abutments on earthen ramps on either end and a series of concrete support columns in the middle. Eight [...] reinforced concrete spans accommodated northbound and southbound lanes of traffic, with no anchors connecting the spans with each other or to the abutments. At the time of the shock, two of the southbound spans came off their support (a [...] ledge) and six people were injured when a Volkswagen Beetle and a small pickup truck plummeted off the bridge.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, MDSHA {{completed}} the I-70 Corridor Planning Study, which examined the [...] segment of I-70 from the Mount Philip <b>Road</b> <b>overpass</b> between Braddock Mountain and Frederick to {{just east of}} MD144 at {{the western end of}} the project underway to relocate the Interstate through Bartonsville. [...] The study proposed a series of projects to upgrade I-70 through Frederick, much of which had been constructed as the Frederick Freeway in the late 1950s, to Interstate standards. [...] The four-lane freeway was plagued with closely spaced interchanges with substandard acceleration and deceleration lanes and curve radii. [...] Many of the interchanges were missing important movements between highways. [...] For instance, travellers aiming to move from southbound US15 to westbound I-70 needed to use US40 through Frederick's heavily commercialized Golden Mile to join I-70 at Exit 48.|$|E

[...] After passing under Charge Pond Road, Route 25 enters a densely populated region of Wareham with an alignment parallel to Route 28 (Cranberry Highway). Eastbound Route 25 has its first interchange with Maple Springs Road, a local road that connects to US 6 and Route 28 {{and is used}} to access Wareham and the village of Onset. Shortly after the interchange, numbered as Exit 2 (formerly Exit 1), Route 25 proceeds across Agawam Mill Pond via a short causeway. Exit 2 off Route 25 west is located {{to the east of}} Agawam Mill Pond and connects to US 6 and Route 28 via Glen Charlie Road, an unnumbered route that also serves the village of White Island Shores.|$|E
500|$|North of the {{interchange}} for M-153, (Ford Road), M-39 crosses into Detroit. From {{there the}} road continues through the densely populated areas [...] {{of the west}} side of the city. Next to the Chicago <b>Road</b> <b>overpass,</b> the freeway runs under a CSX Transportation rail line. The trunkline continues traveling to the north through a series of interchanges. The first is a partial interchange for Plymouth Road; northbound traffic exiting here is directed to use the service drive northbound to access Schoolcraft Road, and traffic can enter M-39 southbound. Next is the stack interchange with I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) with access to both the local and express lanes of that freeway. The last of the series is another partial interchange with Schoolcraft Road. As a counterpart to the Plymouth Road interchange, this one provides access from southbound M-39 to the cross street with a signed connection along the southbound service drive to Plymouth Road and an entry point for northbound traffic. Continuing north, M-39 comes to an interchange with M-5 (Grand River Avenue) which also connects to Fenkell Avenue, the 5Mile Road equivalent on Detroit's mile road system.|$|E
