40|$|Particle swarm {{optimization}} {{comes under}} {{lot of changes}} after James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart first proposes the idea in 1995. The changes has been done mainly on Inertia parameters in velocity updating equation so that the convergence rate will be higher. We are proposing a novel approach where particles movement will not be depend on its velocity rather it will be decided by constrained biased random walk of particles. In random walk every particles movement based on two significant parameters, one is random process like toss of a coin and other is how much displacement a particle should have. In our approach we exploit this idea by performing a biased <b>random</b> <b>operation</b> {{and based on the}} outcome of that <b>random</b> <b>operation,</b> PSO particles choose the direction of the path and move non-uniformly into the solution space. This constrained, non-uniform movement helps the random walking particle to converge quicker then classical PSO. In our constrained biased random walking approach, we no longer needed velocity term (Vi), rather we introduce a new parameter (K) which is a probabilistic function. No global best particle (PGbest), local best particle (PLbest), Constriction parameter (W) are required rather we use a new term called Ptarg which is loosely influenced by PGbest. We test our algorithm on five different benchmark functions, and also compare its performance with classical PSO and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). This new approach have been shown significantly better than basic PSO and sometime outperform QPSO in terms of convergence, search space, number of iterations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Rough sets {{theory is}} an {{effective}} mathematical tool dealing with vagueness and uncertainty. It has been applied {{in a variety of}} fields such as data mining, pattern recognition or process control. It is very important to compute the attribute reduction in real applications of rough set theory. To compute the optimal attribute reduction is NP-hard. Many heuristic attribute reduction algorithms with polynomial-time complexity have been proposed. However, most of them are incomplete for the definition of attribute reduction given by Z. Pawlak. and few of them are able to fully use the expert experience. In this paper, a complete attribute reduction algorithm based on the principle of discernibility matrix is given, which can make full use of the expert experience by defining a partial ordering relation on the set of condition attributes. The completeness of the algorithm is proved. The algorithm includes a <b>random</b> <b>operation</b> leading to different reductions may be obtained by repeating executing.

There exist contradicting conjectures on the topic, due to Chvatal - Sankoff in 1975 and Waterman in 1994. In the present article, we consider a special model of i. i. d. sequences made out of blocks. A block is a contiguous substring consisting only of one type of symbol. Our model allows only three possible block lengths, each been equiprobable picked up. In this context, we introduce a <b>random</b> <b>operation</b> (random modification) on the blocks of one of the sequences. In the present article, we develop the techniques to prove the following: if we suppose that the random modification increases the length of the LCS with high probability, then the order of the fluctuation of the LCS is as conjectured by Waterman. This result is a key technical part {{in the study of the}} size of the fluctuation of the LCS for sequences of i. i. d. blocks, developed by Matzinger and Torres. Comment: 18 page...|$|E

Among several {{countermeasures}} {{suggested for}} thwarting differential analysis are the <b>random</b> ordering of <b>operations,</b> insertion of <b>random</b> <b>operations,</b> and <b>random</b> insertion of <b>operations.</b> This paper presents a phase-substitution technique which {{in combination with}} subsequent time-domain differential analysis is shown {{to be able to}} thwart these three countermeasures in several experiments.

40|$|Manufacturing {{automotive}} powertrain components (engines and transmissions) is {{a complex}} task involving the integration of hundreds of components. Simulation is commonly applied {{in the design and}} implementation of such production systems. Examples of such systems are the crankshaft machining line, engine final assembly and transmission final assembly, to name a few. Invariably, different engine and transmission sub-assemblies are machined and assembled on separate systems. The completed sub-assemblies are then assembled to the engine or transmission main assembly. There are many areas within a powertrain assembly plant that show complicated behavior due to the varying nature of manufacturing processes. Not only the variation in process, but the schedules, availability of workers, and the performance of material handling equipment are only few of the factors contributing to the randomness in operation. Test areas where the final assembly is inspected for functionality present an example of such highly <b>random</b> <b>operation.</b> Simulation is a very useful tool for investigating the behavior of such complicated systems.

A prerequisite {{is that the}} facilities are operated in an appropriate manner and potentially induced non-gravitational effects, such as shearing forces, {{have to be taken}} into account. Dinoflagellates, here P. noctiluca, as fast and sensitive reporter system for shear stress and hydrodynamic gradients, were exposed on a clinostat (constant rotation around one axis, 60 rpm) or in a random positioning machine, that means rotating around two axes, whose velocity and direction were chosen at random. Deformation of the cell membrane of P. noctiluca due to shear stress results in a detectable bioluminescence emission. Our results show that the amount of mechanical stress is higher on an random positioning machine than during constant clinorotation, as revealed by the differences in photon counts. We conclude that one axis clinorotation induced negligible non-gravitational effects in the form of shear forces in contrast to <b>random</b> <b>operation</b> modes tested.

In quantum systems, <b>random</b> <b>operations</b> can be obtained via random circuits thanks to so-called q-designs, and {{play a central role}} in the fast scrambling conjecture for black holes. Here we consider a more physically motivated way of generating random evolutions by exploiting the many-body dynamics of a quantum system driven with stochastic external pulses. We combine techniques from quantum control, open quantum systems and exactly solvable models (via the Bethe-Ansatz) to generate Haar-uniform <b>random</b> <b>operations</b> in driven many-body systems. We show that any fully controllable system converges to a unitary q-design in the long-time limit. Moreover, we study the convergence time of a driven spin chain by mapping its random evolution into a semigroup with an integrable Liouvillean and finding its gap. Remarkably, we find via Bethe-Ansatz techniques that the gap is independent of q. We use mean-field techniques to argue that this property may be typical for other controllable systems, although we explicitly construct counter-examples via symmetry breaking arguments to show that this is not always the case. Our findings open up new physical methods to transform classical randomness into quantum randomness, via a combination of quantum many-body dynamics and random driving.
