50|$|A <b>reader</b> <b>printer</b> was {{developed}} in the mid 20th century. This <b>reader</b> <b>printer</b> allowed for the viewer to see the microfilm, but also print what was shown in the reader. The first of these devices was produced in World War II for use with V-Mail.|$|E
50|$|The library has a {{computer}} lab and homework center, a copy machine, a microfilm <b>reader</b> <b>printer</b> and a microfche <b>reader</b> <b>printer.</b> Prueter Library has books in Spanish for {{both children and}} adults. Because the library is {{in the home of}} the navy base, the library makes an effort to collect materials about Port Hueneme, the Seabees, and the U.S. Navy.|$|E
50|$|Previous {{systems were}} all real-mode systems with no {{hardware}} support for protection and separation {{of programs and}} the operating system. While there had been support for multiprogramming in previous systems, it was limited to running one user job concurrently with multiple supporting functions known to be well-behaved, such as the card <b>reader,</b> <b>printer,</b> and card punch spoolers.|$|E

50|$|A {{collection}} of real device Services, including cash dispensers and recyclers, card <b>readers,</b> cheque <b>readers,</b> <b>printers,</b> bar code <b>readers,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|HASP {{bypassed}} most {{operating system}} services with code specially tailored for efficiency. HASP operated {{as a single}} operating system task and used cooperative multitasking internally to run processors to perform tasks such as running card <b>readers,</b> <b>printers,</b> and punches, managing the spool files, communicating with the system operator, and driving multiple communication lines for remote job entry.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical systems {{including}} the card <b>reader,</b> <b>printer,</b> counters and storage units were all {{driven by a}} single motor, which also drove an oil pump and a generator that provided 46-volt power for the electrical logic. This included about 900 relays which were mounted on three swing-out gates. The control panel had a matrix of 43 by 52 holes, {{most of which were}} assigned.|$|E
5000|$|The 'most popular' ticket machine, Ticketer Large, is {{designed}} for busy urban routes. It is a fixed point solution, with an ITSO-compliant smart card <b>reader,</b> <b>printer</b> and an electronic point of sale machine. [...] This was the original Ticketer system; the other three machines, which differ only in their hardware, were developed by Corvia {{at the request of}} bus operators who had special requirements.|$|E
50|$|There was {{a devastating}} fire on January 15, 2015 which {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} building and damaged much of the historical artifacts inside. The historical and genealogical society have set up shop in the old dollar store in Marissa. As yet they don't have all salvaged items (books, files) back from Smoke Services, but all of the newspaper microfilm and a new <b>reader</b> <b>printer</b> on which to view it are at the new facility.|$|E
50|$|Semantically, CGOL is {{essentially}} just Common Lisp, with some additional <b>reader</b> and <b>printer</b> support.|$|R
5000|$|From fiction, to anime, mystery, history, {{and large}} print, IPL's shelves cover {{a wide range}} of subject matter and formats. Patrons can also find DVD's, video games, computers, eReaders, puzzles, {{microfilm}} <b>readers,</b> <b>printers,</b> scanners, and a nearly complete set of yearbooks from Independence High School dating back to 1911. [...] The library {{is also a member of}} SEKnFind, a 41-member consortium of Southeast Kansas Libraries, allowing for a robust inter-library loan program.|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} Krasker Film and Video services, current periodicals, microfilm and microfiche <b>readers</b> and <b>printers,</b> and a study area.|$|R
50|$|A {{microfilm}} printer contains a xerographic copying process, like a photocopier. The image to be printed is projected with synchronised movement {{on to the}} drum. These devices offer either small image preview for the operator or full size image preview, when it is called a <b>reader</b> <b>printer.</b> Microform printers can accept positive or negative films and positive or negative images on paper. New machines allow the user to scan a microform image and save it as a digital file: see the section below on digital conversion.|$|E
50|$|A {{new era of}} {{library service}} began with the move to the new building. A new {{bookmobile}} was purchased in 1978. A high-tech microfilm reader-printer {{was given to the}} library by the B'nai B'rith Lodge in 1970. Several neighborhood libraries were established under the Model Cities Program (no longer in existence). Art work was added to the circulating collection. The Israelite House of David research room was opened. The library offered rental of videodiscs, and later videotapes. A computer terminal with internet access was made available to the public in 1997. That same year, the Benton Harbor Lions Club Foundation paid for half of a new $14,000 microfilm <b>reader</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Standards {{which provide}} {{the means to}} {{automatically}} Capture data that is carried directly on physical objects, bridging the world of physical things {{and the world of}} electronic information. GS1 data capture standards include definitions of bar code and radio-frequency identification (RFID) data carriers which allow identifiers to be affixed directly to a physical object, and standards that specify consistent interfaces to <b>readers,</b> <b>printers,</b> and other hardware and software components that connect the data carriers to business applications.|$|R
50|$|Weller is {{the former}} Midwest Correspondent for Publishers Weekly magazine. He has written for The Paris Review, All things Considered, Slate Magazine, Huffington Post and the National Public Radio. Weller's short fiction has {{appeared}} in numerous books, literary journals and magazines, including the Chicago <b>Reader,</b> <b>Printers</b> Row Journal and Rosebud. His pop-cultural essays have appeared in Post Road, Annalemma, and F, among many other publications. Weller is currently the Associate Chair and {{an associate professor in}} the Department of Creative Writing at Columbia College, Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|OS/360 {{included}} spooling routines, called reader/interpreters {{and output}} writers. Each reader/interpreter was [...] "responsible for reading one input job stream" [...] - {{that is one}} input device. Likewise each output writer was responsible for controlling one printer or punch. Spooled data were stored in OS temporary datasets controlled by standard OS services. Each reader/interpreter or output writer was a separate operating system task in its own partition or region. [...] A system {{with a large number}} of <b>readers,</b> <b>printers,</b> and punches might have a large number of spooling tasks.|$|R

5000|$|Mill Hill School has an Elliott 803 with 8192 {{memory in}} the 1970s. It had five-track paper tape <b>reader</b> and <b>printer</b> {{but no other}} I/O devices. The school had Elliott 803 autocode and Algol compilers.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to treat the design and {{evaluation}} of resource allocation systems for a multi-programmed computer. Resources are divided into two groups: Shared resources (processors, channels, supervisor programs, some files, direct access devices, etc.) Non-shared resources (main storage, tape drives, card <b>readers,</b> <b>printers,</b> some files, etc.) The paper is divided into five sections. The first three of these deal with allocation of resources to users. The fourth section covers a method of optimization of the cost of allocation of some shared resources and some non-shared resources. The firth section covers methods of quantitative evaluation of the performance of the first three sections. Advisor: Lester Lipsk...|$|R
50|$|The PXA16x {{delivers}} strong {{performance at}} a mass market price point for cost sensitive consumer and embedded markets such as digital picture frames, E <b>Readers,</b> multifunction <b>printer</b> user interface (UI) displays, interactive VoIP phones, IP surveillance cameras, and home control gadgets.|$|R
2500|$|The other 9 {{units in}} ENIAC were the Initiating Unit (started {{and stopped the}} machine), the Cycling Unit (used for {{synchronizing}} the other units), the Master Programmer (controlled [...] "loop" [...] sequencing), the Reader (controlled an IBM punch-card <b>reader),</b> the <b>Printer</b> (controlled an IBM card punch), the Constant Transmitter and 3 function tables.|$|R
50|$|Because it is a {{structured}} language based on XML, POSXML is {{a language that}} is constantly evolving, new commands and instructions {{can be added to}} your library at any time. Initially, the language had only two dozen basic commands to create a functional application on a POS terminal, using few resources: only the basic display (LCD), keypad, magnetic card <b>reader</b> and <b>printer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Common Lisp {{uses the}} prefixes [...] and [...] Setting the {{variables}} *read-base* and *print-base* to 16 can {{also used to}} switch the <b>reader</b> and <b>printer</b> of a Common Lisp system to Hexadecimal number representation for reading and printing numbers. Thus Hexadecimal numbers can be represented without the #x or #16r prefix code, when the input or output base has been changed to 16.|$|R
50|$|The GEC 2050 was {{commonly}} {{used as a}} Remote Job Entry station, supporting a punched card <b>reader,</b> line <b>printer,</b> system console, and a data link to a remote mainframe computer system, and GEC Computers sold a complete RJE package including the system, peripherals, and RJE software. Another turnkey application was a ticketing system, whose customers included Arsenal Football Club. The system was also {{commonly used}} for road traffic control and industrial process automation.|$|R
50|$|His free-lance {{writings}} came to {{the attention}} of the Cape Argus as early as 1861, and he soon became a <b>printer's</b> <b>reader</b> for that paper's parent company, Saul Solomon & Co., from where he rapidly rose in position.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} on [...] to William and Louisa (née Howard). He was baptized in the Parish of St Jude, Peckham on [...] [...] His father was a <b>Printer's</b> <b>Reader.</b> Cullen was educated at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys.|$|R
50|$|Computers used {{teleprinters}} {{for input}} and output {{from the early days}} of computing. Punched card <b>readers</b> and fast <b>printers</b> replaced teleprinters for most purposes, but teleprinters continued to be used as interactive time-sharing terminals until video displays became widely available in the late 1970s.|$|R
500|$|Sherwood {{published}} {{the first part}} of The Fairchild Family in 1818 with the firm of John Hatchard in Piccadilly, thereby assuring it [...] "social distinction". Hatchard was associated with the Clapham Sect of evangelicals, which included Hannah More, and his customers were wealthy businessmen, gentry, and Members of Parliament. The book was popular, remaining in print until 1913. Urged by her <b>readers,</b> her <b>printer</b> and her own desire to capitalize on Part I's success, Sherwood published Parts II and III in 1842 and 1847, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Using the {{information}} in these XML client application files, Jargon Reader renders (draws) the graphical user interface and executes logic functions in response to user interface events such as selecting a button. Various peripherals such as barcode readers, mag-card readers, RFID <b>readers</b> and mobile <b>printers</b> are also supported.|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{hardware}} {{requirements of a}} CDC 6000 series computer system consists of the computer, including 32,768 words of central memory storage, any combination of disks, disk packs or drums to provide 24 million characters of mass storage, a punched card reader, punched card punch, printer with controllers, and two 7-track magnetic tape units. Larger systems {{can be obtained by}} including optional equipment such as: additional central memory, extended core storage (ECS), additional card <b>readers,</b> punches, <b>printers,</b> and tape units. Graphic plotters and microfilm recorders are also available.|$|R
25|$|UNIVAC, {{the first}} {{commercial}} computer manufacturer, produced a series of EXEC operating systems. Like all early main-frame systems, this batch-oriented system managed magnetic drums, disks, card <b>readers</b> and line <b>printers.</b> In the 1970s, UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic (RTB) system to support large-scale time sharing, also patterned after the Dartmouth BC system.|$|R
5000|$|Card data is {{transferred}} via radio waves {{to the central}} administration system through card read write reader devices, such as access control mullion readers, ticket readers, ATMs, USB connected desktop readers or all devices embedding a contactless <b>reader</b> technology like <b>printers,</b> Time & attendance terminals, parking, lifts, point of sales, car sharing ...|$|R
5000|$|Commonly used {{by small}} {{businesses}} {{as their primary}} data processing machines, the 1401 was also frequently used as an off-line peripheral controller for mainframe computers. In such installations, with an IBM 7090 for example, the mainframe computers used only magnetic tape for input-output. It was the 1401 that transferred input data from slow peripherals (such as the IBM 1402 Card Read-Punch) to tape, and transferred output data from tape to the card punch, the IBM 1403 Printer, or other peripherals. This allowed the mainframe's throughput to not be limited by {{the speed of a}} card <b>reader</b> or <b>printer.</b> (For more information, see Spooling.) ...|$|R
