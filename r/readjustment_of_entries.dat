The increase of SV occurring at work onset appears to compensate in HTRs for the sluggish <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> HR so that the rate <b>of</b> <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> Q is kept within normal limits. As a consequence, qm, t 1 / 2 q mon-, and t 1 / 2 VO 2 on- appear to be similar or only moderately delayed in HTRs compared with CTLs. It is concluded that in HTRs, because of constrained maximum HR, only work loads up to 60 % of the VO 2 max of CTLs may be attained; also, owing to the fast <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> Q, up to work loads of 75 to 100 W, the rest to work transition phase is not impaired...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{a typical}} {{localization}} technique, beacon nodes whose locations are known apriori, act as reference in estimating {{the location of}} user nodes. Placement of these beacons in the indoor environments has strong impact {{on the quality of}} the localization technique. When the operating environment is an indoor environment such as an office or building, the placement of beacons is very important due to the presence of obstructions which often result in nonuniform signal propagation error and self interference of beacon nodes. Besides, the structure of indoor environment keeps changing with time, affecting the beacon infrastructure. <b>Readjustment</b> <b>of</b> beacon nodes is time consuming and might interrupt the localization service. Hence, it is ideal to minimize the number <b>of</b> <b>readjustments</b> <b>of</b> the beacon nodes as far as possible. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm to minimize the number <b>of</b> the <b>readjustments</b> <b>of</b> beacon nodes and the interruption in localization service...|$|R

They {{felt that}} the tuning of these short stretches of free string can be achieved with greater accuracy than can be attained with a duplex bar. With the fixed points of a duplex bar, small variations in casting are liable to produce imperfections in the duplex string lengths. Furthermore, since variations in humidity can cause duplex scales to move in pitch more rapidly than the speaking scale, manual <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> the string tension on the non-speaking side of the bridge, and/or a <b>readjustment</b> <b>of</b> the duplex position to better accommodate humidity fluctuation, is feasible with individual aliquots.|$|R
