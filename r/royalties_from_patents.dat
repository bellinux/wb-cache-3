After 1938, it received funds from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. In addition, a foundation (Ahnenerbe-Stifterverband) was established, set up with funds from business leaders. One of the largest donations, approximately 50,000 Reichsmark, came from Deutsche Bank boardmember Emil Georg von Stauß associates, including BMW and Daimler-Benz. The foundation also received <b>royalties</b> <b>from</b> <b>patents</b> partially held by the SS (see below).

50|$|In 1804, Connecticut {{inventor}} Theodore Burr engineered {{his design}} for an arch truss bridge, also called a king-post arch design, and patented it in 1817. Shelburne Museum’s Covered Bridge {{is an example}} of Burr’s creative engineering. Because inventors receive <b>royalties</b> <b>from</b> bridge <b>patents</b> based on a bridge’s length, there was great incentive to devise ways of increasing a bridge’s possible span and the frequently used king-post design could only extend so far. Burr’s design, which bolted a single arched timber to the king-post braces, added such stability that not only did the king-post trusses become secondary supports but also the bridge’s possible reach greatly increased.|$|R

40|$|C. Y. F. Young receive <b>royalties</b> <b>from</b> these <b>patents.</b> T 3 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. In this study, we show the interactive effects of T 3 and androgens on the growth response and expression of the prostatespecific genes, PSA (prostate-specific antigen) and hK 2 (human glandular kallikrein), in the human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. T 3 alone showed pronounced growth enhancement in a dose-dependent fashion. However, in the presence of androgens, higher concentrations of T 3 were required to produce additional proliferative effects. T 3, androgens, or a combination of the two up-regulated PSA protein production in a dose-dependent fashion, but T 3 had little stimulatory effect on hK 2 protein expression, regardless of the presence or absence of androgens. Using gene transfer assays, T 3 alone showed no effect on transcriptiona...|$|R

Our model captures two types of incentives these firms are subject to: free-riding due to the public good nature of the standard and patent races in order to derive <b>royalties</b> <b>from</b> essential <b>patents.</b> As a consequence, R&D may be excessive or insufficient as compared to the collective optimum. Our goal is to test if consortia can address any type of inefficiency, by either reducing or increasing collective R&D investment. We address this question empirically on a large dataset of ICT standards, by assessing the effect of consortia on the number of standard-related patents filed by companies. After sorting standards entailing over or underinvestment, our results confirm that in the first case consortia have a chilling effect on patent filings, while it has an inflating effect in the second case...|$|R
50|$|LeRoy Sunderland Buffington (1847-1931) was an American {{architect}} from Minnesota {{who specialized}} in hotels, public and commercial buildings, churches, and residences. He was born September 22, 1847, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He studied architecture and engineering at the University of Cincinnati and graduated in 1869. He later moved to Saint Paul, becoming a partner of Abraham Radcliffe, and worked on the remodeling of the original Minnesota State Capitol. After the first Capitol burned down, Buffington designed a replacement which served as the State House until 1904. In 1881 {{he claimed to have}} thought up the idea of building skyscrapers by using load-bearing iron frames. He applied for a patent in November 1887 and received it in May 1888. Even though many subsequent builders used this method of construction, Buffington was mostly unsuccessful in collecting <b>royalties</b> <b>from</b> his <b>patent</b> (one exception was for the Rand Tower in Minneapolis). Buffington remained in private practice in Minneapolis until his death on February 15, 1931.|$|R

40|$|We seek {{to advance}} {{scholarship}} in patent strategy by presenting {{a set of}} organizing theoretical perspectives to guide future research. The domain of patent strategy primarily encompasses patenting, licensing, and enforcement decisions. Patent strategy also entails a set of nested choices, where future opportunities are only available by building prior positions, which thus {{become a source of}} dynamic capabilities. Three generic strategies are pursued by firms in the patent domain – using patents to strategically “isolate ” rent yielding organizational assets, maximizing <b>royalty</b> revenues <b>from</b> <b>patented</b> technologies, and defending against patents owned by others. In addition, patent strategy has an important organizational choice dimension, where the organizational modes used in the commercialization of complex multi-invention products have fundamental implications for the strategic use of patents by firms. I situate prior studies of patent use in the context of broad theoretical framework presented in this paper, and suggest avenues for further research into patent strategy...|$|R
5000|$|Spangler {{then gave}} {{one of his}} Electric Suction Sweepers to his cousin Susan Troxel Hoover (1846-1925), who used it at home.

William Henry [...] "Boss" [...] Hoover (August 18, 1849 - February 25, 1932) and son Herbert William Hoover Sr. (October 30, 1877 - September 16, 1954) were leather goods {{manufacturers}} in North Canton, Ohio, {{which at the time}} was called New Berlin.
