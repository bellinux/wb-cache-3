Due to simplicity in fabrication process, a step <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> is generally implemented in microchip to increase the concentration factor.

This paper reports a new fabrication technique to form a gradual <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> <b>in</b> polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microchannel for both anionic and cationic isotachophoresis (ITP).

The proposed resynthesis (a) is capable of substantial logic restructuring, (b) is customizable to solve a variety of optimization tasks, and (c) has reasonable runtime on industrial designs. The approach uses don’t cares computed for a window surrounding a node and can take into account external don’t cares (e. g. unreachable states). It uses a SAT solver and interpolation {{to find a new}} representation for a node. This representation can be in terms of inputs from other nodes in the window thus effecting Boolean re-substitution.
