5000|$|<b>Reintermediation</b> in Economics {{can also}} mean the {{reintroduction}} of intermediaries to business processes in an electronic firm. This {{means that a}} company involved in eCommerce will partner with intermediaries to perform functions such as supply-chain management, rather than operating in a direct-to-consumer model. [...] <b>Reintermediation</b> is largely {{a response to the}} development of disintermediation in eCommerce, because due to the amount of processes performed between manufacturing and direct selling to the consumer companies naturally seek to offset that responsibility, if it makes sense for the firm fiscally.|$|E

50|$|Disintermediation in Banking and Finance is most {{directly}} {{attributed to the}} massive movements of funds away from Bank investments in the 20th century, due to the Banking Act of 1933 and the Banking Act of 1935, which involved {{the formation of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Company. The FDIC is responsible for insuring deposits at banks, and it was created with the purpose of regaining general confidence in the Banking System amidst the great depression and the major banking crises that came with it. This type of depository insurance {{at the time of its}} creation (following the collapse of several major banks) is the kind of security that is sought after in an investment and in turn this insurance is one of the key factors in the <b>reintermediation</b> of savings into federally insured depositories. <b>Reintermediation</b> is mainly caused by the desire to insure savings into a secure account and in times of market fluctuation and interest rate volatility in the money market the funds will naturally flow back into savings deposits.|$|E
50|$|Re-intermediation {{in banking}} and finance {{can be defined}} as the {{movement}} of investment capital from non-bank investments, back into financial intermediaries. This is usually done in efforts to secure depository insurance on the capital, during times of high risk and volatility in market interest rates. Conceptually, <b>Reintermediation</b> {{can be thought of as}} an answer to disintermediation, which is the movement of investment funds away from financial intermediaries into other investments. Disintermediation occurs naturally, as competition from different financial firms can allow for higher investment yield, which causes funds to flow away from depository institutions.|$|E
50|$|Restructuring {{followed}} by disintermediation and <b>reintermediation</b> {{is one of}} the essential features of the transition from traditional to Internet marketing communications. Internet may make the traditional distributors or retailers leave out of the business simply because the Internet communication is less costly than them. JD.com significantly changed the distribution channels of personal computer selling in China by letting the consumers order different parts of the computers and then pact together online before 2009, leaving tens of thousands of retailers in that field out of their jobs. In 2015, JD.com accounted for 22.9% of the Chinese online shopping's market share. Again, according to Financial Times, with the shifting trend of using mobile phones for online purchase in China, the people using cellphones to log on to the Internet outnumbered those using PC, the next wave of restructuring faced by JD.com and its major competitors like Alibaba. In 2014, JD.com's orders deriving from mobile phones increased to 543%, compared with the last year's quarter of the same period. Haoyu Shen, {{the chief executive of the}} JD.com, ascribed this result to its own company's app rather than the co-operation with Tecent, the Chinese second largest online corporation, although it invested in JD.com on March 2014. We can see that as a company doing business of ecommerce, JD.com has been constantly facing challenges and opportunities of disintermediation and <b>reintermediation</b> with the rapid shifts of the technology development of the Internet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reintermediation</b> {{occurred}} due to {{many new}} {{problems associated with}} the e-commerce disintermediation concept, largely centered on the issues associated with the direct-to-consumers model. The high cost of shipping many small orders, massive customer service issues, and confronting the wrath of disintermediated retailers and supply channel partners all presented real obstacles. Huge resources are required to accommodate presales and postsales issues of individual consumers. Before disintermediation, supply chain middlemen acted as salespeople for the producers. Without them, the producer itself would have to handle procuring those customers. Selling online has its own associated costs: developing quality websites, maintaining product information, and marketing expenses all add up. Finally, limiting a product's availability to Internet channels forces the producer to compete {{with the rest of the}} Internet for customers' attention, a space that is becoming increasingly crowded.|$|E
40|$|D. Com. (Marketing Management) This study {{specifically}} {{relates to}} disintermediation and <b>reintermediation</b> {{in the retail}} travel industry in South Africa. Brick and mortar travel agencies in South Africa and across the world are losing customers due to {{the advent of the}} Internet. The Internet has modified the way traditional distribution channels are structured and how they operate. The distribution process involves a product or services evolution from raw materials to the sale of the final product. Intermediaries facilitate the flow in this process by adding value but also adding costs. Disintermediation refers to removing or bypassing intermediaries in the distribution process to create shorter supply chains. The core rationalisation for this process relates to costs of intermediaries versus the value that intermediaries provide. If travel agents are to remain relevant in the travel distribution industry, they need to add value to the travel distribution process again and thus the <b>reintermediation</b> of their business. <b>Reintermediation</b> can be defined as those previously disintermediated intermediaries who re-enter the distribution process by offering additional value to customers or suppliers. The primary objective of this study was thus to develop a model that assists dissintermediated travel agencies to retain customers via the process of <b>reintermediation.</b> A range of <b>reintermediation</b> strategies have been suggested for the travel agency industry such as targeting niche markets, the production of customised travel packages, the adoption of online strategies, the hiring of more professional and experienced staff and becoming more customer service orientated. Eight proposed <b>reintermediation</b> factors were highlighted and explained and evidence was provided to support their inclusion in the model. The research methodology employed a 16 step process which encompassed a qualitative and quantitative component. The qualitative phase of the research incorporated focus groups with travel agency owners and managers in the Eastern Cape. Four mini-focus groups were held with a total of 12 owners and managers in this area. The fundamental aim of the focus groups was of a confirmatory nature in that participants’ opinions were sought with regard to the composition of the proposed <b>reintermediation</b> model. The quantitative phase of the study incorporated an electronically administered survey with 200 travel agency owners and managers in SA, of which only 149 questionnaires were eligible for analysis. A questionnaire was developed for the survey using an array of existing scales that were modified to suit the purposes of this study. The questionnaire was designed in such a manner, that there were two columns for respondents to rate the statements which were centred in the questionnaire. The left column required respondents to indicate their current opinions with regards to the status of the current <b>reintermediation</b> factors within their businesses, while the right column asked respondents to rate the importance of the proposed <b>reintermediation</b> factors within their businesses. Essentially this resulted in the development of two models: Model 1 reflected the current opinions of travel agency owners and managers regarding <b>reintermediation</b> in their businesses, and Model 2 referred to the opinions of travel agency owners and managers in terms {{of the importance of the}} proposed factors in reintermediating their businesses and thus retaining customers. There are three commonly consistent <b>reintermediation</b> factors across Models 1 and 2; they are: differentiated product (leisure), high quality service and co-exist with technology. Thus, in terms of <b>reintermediation</b> factors these three can be considered to be the most important <b>reintermediation</b> factors for travel agents in South Africa. Model 1 contains five of the proposed <b>reintermediation</b> factors while Model 2 only contains four of the proposed <b>reintermediation</b> factors as presented in Figure 1. 2 in Chapter One. Thus Model 1 was considered the superior model of the two. In addition, Model 1 has better fit statistics than Model 2...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for understanding {{the circumstances under which}} technological innovations for electronic commerce change industry structures. Initially these changes are to the detriment of traditional product and service providers. However, these players can fight against technological disintermediation. We examine three different scenarios from a long run perspective. The first involves situations in which no traditional or non-technological intermediaries exist. In these settings, upstart electronic intermediaries can interject themselves through innovation. The second is where a single traditional intermediary already is present. The third is a variant on the second, and involves situations where multiple traditional intermediaries form the industry structure. The perspective we propose identifies a recurring pattern of intermediation (I), disintermediation (D) and <b>reintermediation</b> (R) — what we call the IDR cycle. It enables us to explain and predict instances of technological <b>reintermediation,</b> where a once-disintermediated player is able to effectively compete again...|$|E

40|$|Early {{researchers}} {{seemed to}} agree on the prediction that decreased transaction costs in electronic marketplaces would lead to the reduction, or even extinction, of traditional intermediaries from electronic value chains. Despite some validity in these claims, a careful examination of the way that electronic commerce restructures traditional market functions reveals three equally plausible scenarios for the future. Traditional intermediaries will either be driven out of the market (disintermediation) or be forced to differentiate and re-emerge in the electronic marketplace (<b>reintermediation),</b> while wholly new markets for intermediaries will also be created (cybermediation). In this paper, we use a model of market functioning to establish areas where each of these three scenarios are expected to dominate. 1.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{exploratory}} study undertaken {{to deal with}} the intricacy of consumer behaviour in a buying process for a complex high involvement service bundle spanning both offline and online channels.

This offers a challenge for communications management if organisations wish to add customer value by minimising their customer time and effort search costs. Prior online channel research has not acknowledged off-line information complementarity for complex high involvement search.

40|$|Advances in {{information}} and communications technologies (ICTs) have strategic implications {{for a wide}} range of industries. Tourism and hospitality have dramatically changed by the ICTs and the Internet and gradually emerge as the leading industry on online expenditure.

This paper explores the strategic implications of ICTs and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of Internet distribution for small and medium-sized hospitality enterprises (SMEs). Primary research in Athens hotels demonstrates the effects of the Internet and ICTs for secondary markets, where there is lower penetration and ICT adoption. Interviews and questionnaires identified a number of strategies in order to optimise distribution. The analysis illustrates the strategic role of ICTs and the Internet for hospitality organisations and Small and Medium-sized organisations in general.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the development}} of electronic commerce and lnternet technology has lead to various new opportunities to transform the nature of business-to-business networks, for instance through disintermediation, <b>reintermediation</b> and formation of virtual enterprises. However, discussions {{of the role of the}} Internet in such transformations in the electronic commerce literature have predominantly focused on the potential of the Internet to reduce transaction costs, particularly search costs. It is now recognised within the strategic management literature that factors other than transaction costs, largely ignored in electronic commerce literature, are important in shaping business-to-business networks. Therefore, this paper seeks to uncover new roles that the Internet can play in the strategic choices for organisations wishing to utilise electronic commerce and Internet technologies. It does this through detailed analysis of the strategic choices of an actual case company, one of which involves Internet-enabled distributed manufacturing, using three widely known theories of strategic choice: Transaction Cost Economics, the Resource-Based View, and Network Theory. Our analysis shows that in addition to its impact on transaction costs, the Internet can also impact on asset specificity of transactions, the imitability of resources, knowledge sharing in relationship management, and the scalability of business strategies. The contribution of this paper is to articulate several novel research propositions concerning the potential of the Internet in the transformation of business-to-business networks...|$|E
40|$|Early {{research}} in electronic markets {{seemed to suggest}} that E-Commerce transactions would result in decreased costs for buyers and sellers alike, and would therefore ultimately lead to the elimination of intermediaries from electronic value chains. However, a careful analysis of the structure and functions of electronic marketplaces reveals a different picture. Intermediaries provide many value-adding functions that cannot be easily substituted or `internalised' through direct supplier-buyer dealings, and hence mediating parties may {{continue to play a}} significant role in the E-Commerce world. In this paper we provide an analysis of the potential roles of intermediaries in electronic markets and we articulate a number of hypotheses for the future of intermediation in such markets. Three main scenarios are discussed: the disintermediation scenario where market dynamics will favour direct buyer-seller transactions, the <b>reintermediation</b> scenario where traditional intermediaries will be forced to differentiate themselves and reemerge in the electronic marketplace, and the cybermediation scenario where wholly new markets for intermediaries will be created. The analysis suggests that the likelihood of each scenario dominating a given market is primarily dependent on the exact functions that intermediaries play in each case. A detailed discussion of such functions is presented in the paper, together with an analysis of likely outcomes in the form of a contingency model for intermediation in electronic markets...|$|E

From April-May 2000, the author is undertaking a major study for the Commonwealth Government (DETYA) : a scoping study of e-commerce in the education and training sector (higher education, VET, schools) of Australia. This paper starts where the ANTA study (Mitchell 2000 a) and the DETYA study stop, by exploring the implications of e-business for online learning systems. E-business will eventually impact not only on the organisations providing online education but on their online learning systems. The paper is based also on research by the author for a Doctorate in Education within the Faculty of Education at Deakin University that commenced in 1997 and is continuing. The research for this paper involved a review of national and international developments in ebusiness, relating them to online learning systems. This paper traces the origins, definitions and drivers of both e-business and online learning systems in the 1990 s, showing how e-business principles and strategies in the future will have a beneficial impact on online learning systems, even if online learning systems eventually lose their identities as separate from the rest of the organisation. An e-business focus for online learning systems would start with an understanding of the customers 2 ̆ 7 needs; would find a customer-centric solution, not a technology-centric solution; would empower the customer; would provide sufficient and multiple types of support for the customer; would provide quality and skilled input; and would provide cost effective, reliable and accessible technology. This vision of an e-business approach to training varies greatly from the traditional business model for the delivery of training, particularly by VET Registered Training Organisations (RTOs). The traditional business model includes real estate prices dictating location of campuses; architecture dictating class sizes; industrial relations dictating the number and length of sessions and prescribing tight role descriptions; queues of students enrolling in February and July each year; and students seated in teacher-dominated classrooms. In contrast, an e-business basis for RTOs would involve the use of electronic communication to improve business performance, improve the use of existing resources, enhance existing services and increase market reach. An e-business model for RTOs would include the following features: the development of new relationships with customers, using electronic communication to strengthen the relationship; the pursuit of new student markets; and the development of new relationships and alliances between providers. In this new arena of potential and threat, of disintermediation and <b>reintermediation,</b> there will be new roles for new intermediaries; and there will emerge new ways of supporting teaching and learning. Progressive education and training organisations will realize the potential offered by e-business and enjoy the fruits of <b>reintermediation.</b> </div...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} at the impacts and {{implications}} of new technology for educational publishing {{in the context of}} major growth in e-Learning. Although it acknowledges the continuing influence of textbooks both on how emerging technologies will drive changes to courses and the pace at which courses evolve, the major focus is upon the impact of technological and organisational change upon the value chains for e-Learning and educational publishing. It reviews relevant developments in technology, e-Learning and educational publishing and the connections between them, using recent examples. Fundamental to the nexus between technology, e-Learning and publishing is the search for value and for new means of creating and leveraging value in a turbulent higher education marketplace. The subjective nature of value is recognised in the context of different stakeholders. The paper then links changing perceptions of value to a perceived shift within educational publishing, which entails moving from the more or less homogeneous delivery of packaged content towards the provision of truly customised learning services combining use of the latest technologies with access to high quality content. The kinds of value, old and new, provided by educational publishers are compared in a table. This shift in value is then explained in the context of value chains for e-Learning and for educational publishing. So far as educational publishing is concern there are signs of both disintermediation and <b>reintermediation</b> in the value chain. Amidst these changes, the position of educational publishing appears set to improve through its potential to provide a new range of integrated technology and content services...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I address two issues of general {{relevance}} to contemporary debates in economic geography: first, the organisational and spatial implications {{of new information}} technologies for the economic landscape; and, second, the enduring role of place to digital capitalism. Specifically, I examine the organisational evolution of multichannel retailing in Toronto from a geographical perspective. Bricks-and-mortar retailers are increasingly pursuing a multichannel strategy by operating an Internet-based web store alongside the existing network of physical retail outlets. I therefore evaluate the organisational implications of the adoption of business-to-consumer e-commerce (e-tailing) technology for six Canadian bricks-and-mortar retailers based in Toronto and assess how the associated changes in business structure have been inscribed upon the urban landscape. The argument is developed in three sections. First, I discuss how the formula for tlsb>competitive advantage in the new (r) etail markets of the developed world has shifted from a pure play to a multichannel organisational paradigm. Second, I provide a background {{to the development of}} Canadian e-commerce and an overview of the empirical methodologies employed during the research. Third, the focus of the paper moves 'behind the web store' to spatialise the physical places that constitute the fulfilment infrastructure of e-tailing as sequentially linked stages in Internet commodity chains. I evaluate the impact of the Internet commodity chain upon the geographical organisation of each retailer, and, in particular, consider whether the unique logistical requirements of e-tailing have stimulated spatial processes of disintermediation and <b>reintermediation.</b> It is argued that, when read through the lens of Toronto, e-tailing has incurred limited organisational disruption and is characterised by a distinctive geography of integration between online and offline retailing services within the urban space of the city. I conclude the paper by contextualising the findings within themes for conceptual debate in economic geography. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{classification}} of credit markets in transition economies. It describes {{a continuum of}} systems by identifying its polar cases: countries where the entire financial system still relies on outside money, mostly republics of the former Soviet Union; and those where a more decentralized intermediation system is developing (Central/Eastern Europe). We believe that different outcomes of financial reform depend on several factors, such as initial macroeconomic conditions and a differential ability of enterprises to restructure. However, we submit that the major element is the different degree of institutional development. Our thesis is that outside money continues to dominate in circumstances when decentralized enforcement of credit is unreliable. The inability to enforce credit conditions is a more basic challenge than the scarcity of ability to assess creditworthiness (although serious in itself). As a result, there is no <b>reintermediation</b> of private savings, and the central bank remains the lender of first resort. The resulting money creation potentially leads to hyperinflation and capital flight, which further compromise {{the development of a}} private intermediation circuit. Ultimately, firms are induced to capture the banking sector, and more generally to build lobbying power to attract refinancing credit. In the latter system, macroeconomic stabilization has largely succeed: enforcement of credit obligations is more effective, permitting more decentralized credit decisions. However, the burden of non-performing loans, worsened by high real interest rates caused by stabilization, produces moral hazard in lending decisions. Banks have a perverse incentive to direct funding towards their former debtors, financing less efficient projects. The result is further concentration of loan portfolios, an overall lower productivity of investment and a greater concentration of risk in the transition phase. Finally, we identify an intermediate stage of transition in which decentralized credit is still not fully reliable, as it may be extended collusively to uncreditworthy borrowers. As restructuring is costly for many enterprises, and impossible for value-subtractors, a tight outside money policy subtracts more liquidity than the corporate sector can generate by internal restructuring. Marginal enterprises may then resist restructuring by extending unenforceable trade credit, recognizing that other firms will do the same. As a result, trade credit is plentiful and rapidly turns into arrears, and the probability of a collective rescue increases with the prospect of an output collapse driven by illiquidity. A collective bailout then validate the enterprises' view of private credit as nonbinding, and refocuses the system around flows of refinancing credit...|$|E
40|$|European {{publishing}} {{companies are}} quickly digitizing their businesses to achieve cost savings, and increased market reach and penetration. IT is increasingly affecting {{the ways in}} which the whole value chain operates. Interaction and collaboration costs have been slashed. Physical assets are no longer the cornerstone of competitive success and value propositions. This situation became more critical mainly due to continuous increase in consumer expectations, longer demand chain, conventional mechanism for information flow resulting into poor information visibility, and use of traditional demand forecasting methods. All above issues increase marketing and distribution costs significantly resulting into under performance of firms in the hyper-competitive scenario. Electronic markets are still far from reaching a state of maturity resulting in a difficult task to safely predict the possible transformation in the distribution system structure in the IT environment. This research is an attempt to develop a strategic IT enabled demand chain management model for European publishing companies to enhance efficiency for longterm performance and gaining sustainable competitive advantage. Major results of the study are as follow: • Brand management is the most important function of marketing for the present followed by distribution channel management, advertising, sales promotion, logistics, sales administration and management, and demand forecasting and management. • Main objectives behind the growing importance of distribution are higher growth and long-term performance of business, greater market dominance and coverage, sustainable competitive advantage, cost containment, and partnering channel 7 relationships. It is because of the fact that product, price and promotion no more bring long-term competitive advantage. Distribution channel strategy is always a wellstructured system, meant for long-term and based on the philosophy of relationships, which is very difficult to copy by competitors. • Traditionally, advertising was used for brand building and management. But in the prevailing new emerging environment, emphasis is more on sales promotion and trade promotion instead of advertising. In other words, focus of promotion is more on point-of-sale brand building and management. • Information technology (IT) further complicates the whole gamut of distribution. It provides an additional channel of distribution as well as increases the magnitude of competition. It is also a new and powerful information medium for producers, wholesalers and retailers to conduct business among each other enhancing interactivity, productivity, transaction efficiency, and relationships facilitating firms in optimization of resources and containment of total cost. • Marketing intermediaries add two types of values namely, logistical and marketing values addition. Intermediaries closer to the firm add high logistical value and less marketing value. Whereas, intermediaries closer to consumers add high logistical as well as marketing values to prevent stock-out. • Multi-tier distribution system is prevailing in most of the industrial sectors barring publishing industry. In the new environment, there is every possibility of transformation in the distribution channel structure. These changes may be in the form of disintermediation and/or <b>reintermediation.</b> Disintermediation can be partial or complete (cybermediation). Whereas, <b>reintermediation</b> can be in the form of infomediary and intermediary empowerment. • European publishing firms do not prefer cybermediary for mass marketing. Some firms have Internet distribution system but only for niche markets like, institutional markets, highly premium products/brands. In the situation of partial disintermediation, most of the firms would like to prefer C&F agents in the case of publisihing companies. In no case, they have chosen retailers/dealers. The concept of infomediary is not prevailing in Europe at present but consumer respondents prefer to collect information from the Internet and then physically verify books at stores before 8 making purchase decisions. Hence, there is a bright future of infomediary in Europe. Most of the European publishing companies are in the process of integrating their demand chain members (C&F agents and stockiest) on the web for their empowerment. The overwhelming highlights of this system include containment of costs, working methodology, transparency and real-time availability of information regarding order-status, shipment schedules, replies of inquiries, credit status, stockstatus, etc. making them feel significant and committed to achieve predetermined objectives, team spirited, and excited about their work. • Partnering channel relationships is an important issue of demand chain management. It is essential to keep channel members happy, loyal and well motivated for higher growth and long-term performance of business. Furthermore, all publishing firms under study have integrating by negotiation strategy for resolution of channel conflicts. Altogether 21 factors have been identified for partnering relationships. These factors have been grouped in nine key relationship factors (KRF) on the basis of nature and characteristics. Accordingly, 5. 76 is the maximum value assigned to various aspects related to availability of products and minimum value 4. 36 given to zero-defect delivery. Out of nine factors, two factors (prompt information sharing about changes in product profile, sales policy and promotional schemes, and point-topoint information about order status, shipment/delivery schedule and tracking of movement of shipment) are having information components solely. Whereas, the efficiency of remaining seven factors can be significantly improved by the extensive use of information technology. These factors include quick responsiveness for regular availability of products as per normal and unforeseen requirements, no stock-out and fulfillment of delivery commitment, consistency in trade related service quality, prompt logistics system for recovery from defective delivery, reasonable return on investment and infrastructure, fixed and smaller replenishment cycle time, commitment for long-term association, and zero-defect delivery. IT enabled Demand Chain Management Business Model On the basis of above results, a new business model has been proposed for demand chain management taking into consideration existing issues and challenges in the new 9 environment. Value proposition of the model has been redefined in terms of “RESPECT” (Reasonable return, Efficiency, Speed, Economy of Scale, Collaboration, and Trust). For the fulfillment of above value proposition, the requirement of information will be comprehensive and its speedy flow across the demand chain, which also needs interface with firm’s ERP and SCM systems. Hence, proposed business model is an IT enabled demand chain management. The highlights of this model are hyper-responsive, partnering relationships, shared value and knowledge, and value-added service. This model also addresses the scope of disintermediation and <b>reintermediation,</b> prevention of unnecessary stockpiles across the demand chain, and cost reduction. The proposed IT enabled demand chain management solutions are based on certain underlying philosophical principles. It includes minimize the number of layers, adopt pull based push strategy, provide a common view of demand, have business intelligence for optimization, develop multiple supply network, continuous replenishment in small quantity, and information transparency and visibility across the demand chain. The proposed model is being validated for its feasibility, scope for use and successful implementation in the European publishing sector. On the basis of opinion of experts (top corporate executives heading distribution function), various strategic initiatives have been proposed for successful implementation of new demand chain management system. It includes collaborative planning and scheduling, training and education to demand chain members, demand chain partnering relationships, pro-active demand-driven breakthrough culture, vendor managed inventory system, and customer portfolio management. It is uniquely hyper-responsive linkage between major demand chain partners. To transcend this, however, it requires a broad understanding of marketing and distribution, sharing of information between parties and the development of personal rapport between mangers at a number of levels in all organizations of demand chain for real time quick response. Information technology can support internal operations and collaboration between demand chain members. By the use of high-speed data networks and databases, firms can share data with its business partners to better manage the whole value chain. That is why, the effective use of this technology is a key aspect of firm’s success. All information systems are composed of technology that performs three main functions namely, data capture and communication, data storage and retrieval, and data manipulation and reporting. Various IT enabled managerial processes have been proposed for the optimization of the value of the new model. It include order management, demand planning and forecasting system, inventory management system, transportation planning and scheduling system, leveraging relationship system, advance planning and scheduling system, ERP system, and SCM system. For the evaluation and control purposes, a performance scorecard has also been proposed addressing various strategic and functional aspects. Strategic factors include return on assets to firm, return to channel members, order/replenishment cycle time, demand forecast accuracy, profit margin, on-time shipment, inventory turns, cash conversion cycle, sales growth, and marketing and distribution costs. Functional factors deal with frequency of stock-out, defective delivery, real-time information sharing and quality of decision, transparency of system, shared value and customer loyalty, frequency of channel conflict, effectiveness of promotional policies, collaborative planning, scheduling and innovation, resource pooling and risk sharing, and customer support for excellence...|$|E
40|$|Tourism {{distribution}} {{has seen}} a shift from the traditional business-to-business (B 2 B) channels via intermediaries to direct business-to-consumer (B 2 C) distribution. Following {{the introduction of the}} World Wide Web in the 1990 s, the new technology brought transparency to the market by allowing access to information that was previously the sole domain of the intermediaries in the travel industry. This study aims to understand how the evolving nature of information and communication technology (ICT), both past and current, is underpinned by a process of integration and consolidation in the New Zealand outbound wholesale travel sector. This single case study focused its investigation on a key player in the New Zealand outbound wholesale travel sector, one which was the best representative of the evolving changes outlined above. This approach allowed an in-depth, intensive investigation of the process of both horizontal and vertical integration in the presence of ICT. The findings show that the establishment of strategic alliances was a protection tactic employed by businesses in the intermediary sector, when threatened by the possibility of disintermediation. The strength of the new, integrated organisation manifested in this study as increased leverage and buying power with suppliers, enhancing the role of the outbound travel wholesaler in their aggregation and provision of product to their affiliated retail network. This in turn leads to an interesting and challenging balance for the different stakeholders involved in the distribution process, with the travel wholesaler seemingly holding the power balance when product availability is limited. The findings also show that while the wholesale sector acknowledges changes in consumer buying behaviour expressed by a preference for online booking, they are constrained by the cost of ICT development. Having already invested heavily in software development, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the required level of system enhancement. In an attempt to gain more synergies with common ICT usage and development, further integration and consolidation within the sector is a likely outcome, given the history of such amalgamations outlined in this study. This research makes an important contribution to theory by confirming the concept of <b>reintermediation,</b> showing the strength and value of the intermediary sector in the travel distribution structure. By exploring how ICT can be exploited by stakeholders to gain or regain control of their distribution channel, it is the focus on unique product and proprietary content that provides practical managerial implications, with the suggestion of leveraging such content as a strategic solution for the outbound travel industry. When determining operational solutions for the wholesale sector, this study reflects the difficulty in maintaining the required level of system enhancement due to the investment required, without further collaboration within the sector itself...|$|E
40|$|The Internet {{has changed}} the {{traditional}} supply chain of the music industry. The shrinking of music into the Moving Picture Experts Group Audio layer 3 de-facto standard {{has resulted in the}} global sharing of digital music online. This type of sharing potentially causes the disintermediation of record companies and retailers from the traditional supply chain and allows artists and consumers to be directly connected through websites and peer-to-peer technology. As a result, stakeholders are currently uncertain of their role in the emerging music-on-demand model of purchase. This research project examines the relationship between digital music distribution services and its role in the destruction of the music industry. The aim of this research project is to assess the role of digital music distribution services in the downturn and restructuring of the music industry. Furthermore, research will explore the interplay between technical, social, legal and economic dimensions with the purpose of understanding how the traditional supply chain has changed. Due to the exploratory nature of this thesis, the multiple case study methodology will be employed, with case studies completed on MP 3. com, Napster and Kazaa. Multiple sources of evidence will be used to collect data for the multiple cases, including documentation review and interviews. Interviews will be used to gather the opinions of the various stakeholders of the music industry on the issues to be covered as part of this thesis. The results of the case studies demonstrated that the creation of digital music distribution services initially resulted in the disintermediation of record companies and retailers. The record companies reacted by trying to close and takeover each of the three online music sharing services. This proved unsuccessful, and initiated the product life cycle trend, where digital music distribution services are continually evolving to avoid the threat of legal action. Eventually the record companies and retailers have established themselves online, causing <b>reintermediation</b> through the introduction of a pay-per-download (PPD) and subscription payment system. Of the dimensions covered it was found that technology will always outpace law and thus impact on social behaviors and attitudes. The principal conclusion of this thesis is that digital music distribution services will not lead to the demise of the music industry as evidence from the three cases suggested that the online music industry is growing and that consumers have simply shifted their spending rather than stopped purchasing altogether. Furthermore, the three cases of MP 3. com, Napster and Kazaa reveal how technology can shape society and identity the underlying desire of the record companies to control the supply and demand of music by resisting change. Recommendations for future research include quantitative research into the success of online business models, the establishment of an integrated digital rights management system and an investigation of the possibility of technological advancements {{for the creation of a}} converged MP 3 device...|$|E
40|$|Submitted in {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirement}} of the Doctor of Business Administration. ""December 2014 "Includes bibliographical references. Chapter I. Introduction [...] Chapter II. Literature review [...] Chapter 3. Methodology [...] Chapter 4. Findings [...] Chapter 5. Discussion and conclusion [...] References. Tourism is a substantial industry that serves many people in many different industries. Bricks and Mortar (B&M) travel agencies are physically established traditional travel agencies providing travel services to customers from premises accessible to the public. B&M travel establishments occupied a prime position in the market before the 1980 s. Such B&M travel agencies are refered to as intermediaries. They were the standard access point for anyone intending to go on holiday or book a business trip. They were profitable, mostly working in isolation {{from each other and}} representing a limited number of airlines or hotels. Although there had been some introductions of technology in the travel industry as early as the 1950 s, {{it was not until the}} 1990 s when Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) entered the marketplace that changes in business practices began to have a noticeable impact. The introduction of the Internet brought about a change in the fortunes of B&M travel agents. While some customers found the access to extensive information via the Internet beneficial other customers were left bewildered and perplexed in the supply chain positioning of travel products. The direct competition from Internet booking services operated by third party intermediaries and major suppliers of services such as international hotel companies intensified and made changes in the traditional travel distribution supply chain and thus increased financial pressure on travel agencies. In Australia, this pressure has resulted in a reduction in the number of businesses in the travel agent sector (disintermediation) over the past decade by some 17 %. However, some B&M travel agents, although forced into disentermediation, were able to re-invent themselves and through <b>reintermediation</b> survive and prosper. This scenario raised the questions: What services and strategies do customers and B&M travel agents believe have helped B&M travel agents in Australia to compete with Internet Only travel agencies? How do customers and traditional B&M travel agencies envisage the future of B&M travel agencies in the context of the industry and which should they concentrate on in the future? Why do some customers prefer to use the services of B&M travel agencies?To address these questions, a research study was instigated to analyze and report on the status of the Australian B&M travel agencies now and in the future. The research study adopted a multi-method approach using extensive literature reviews, email questionnaires, and interviews with the principal stakeholders – owner/managers of the B&M travel agents and travellers. A theoretical framework for analyzing the findings from the studies was based on Porter five forces of competition. The findings from the study suggest that B&M travel agencies are fighting back by becoming part of big establish travel houses, introducing new packages, better customer centric relationships, adding more value-generating services and are building on their core competencies while also implementing ICT to not just survive but to grow. The interviews with travellers confirmed that there is a need for a balance between human interaction and internet, better CRM, and after sales support, etc., and also contradicted the findings of the B&M travel agents as younger generation has a perception that online tickets are cheaper, human interaction is not very important, etc., but assisted in identifying areas that the B&M travel agents had not recognized as vital for future growth that includes; robust web support with a recommender system, customer after travel feedback. From the responses to the questionnaires and in-depth interviews with the principal stakeholders a recipe for success was identified, which highlighted the strategies B&M travel agencies should adopt to succeed. Personal services that cannot be replicated by Internet-only travel agents were a vital factor in the success, as was the embracing of ICT and particularly the Internet. However, these factors had to be implemented in unison; the sum was greater than the individual parts. While the future looked promising due to re-intermediation, there was one area that could face significant change in the next decade. In terms of the clientele of B&M travel agents, it was the older generation who favored them. The older traveller was more likely to use B&M travel agents. The research found this was because they were less likely to be familiar with technology, exhibited higher levels of technophobia, and preferred to pay in person rather than online.
