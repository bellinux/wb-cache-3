40|$|Koristeći bogatu arhivsku građu matičnih knjiga grada Pule, autor je u ovome članku analizirao relativno malobrojne slučajeve koji se odnose na spominjanje pripadnika nekih posebnih skupina, poput Cigana, ali i pojedinaca s različitim tjelesnim i psihičkim nedostatcima, kao što su slijepe, kljaste, šepave, nijeme i mentalno zaostale osobe. Using the {{plentiful}} archival fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{civil and}} ecclesiastical <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Pula, {{in this article}} author analyses <b>recorded</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively not numerous groups of people, such as Gipsies, mentally retarded, blind, physically disabled and mute persons. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Pula Gipsies are mentioned under the term Cigalo, Cingano, Cingaro and Zingaro. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages one <b>of</b> them is mentioned two times at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baptisms Gipsies are mentioned 10 times: two times {{in the seventeenth century}} and eight times in the eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased they are mentioned 13 times: fi ve times in the seventeenth century and eight times in the eighteenth century. Mentally disabled persons are rarely recorded in the sources, too – only 11 times. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages they are not mentioned at all, but in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decea-sed <b>the</b> most <b>of</b> them are mentioned. Blind persons are mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased only two times (both in the eighteenth century), and in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is documented (in the nineteenth century). Similarly, in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is recorded. By the same token, only one physically disabled person is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased (in the mid eighteenth century), and only one limping person is mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation (in the nineteenth century). Likewise, one mentally retarded boy is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased in the mid eighteenth century. Mute persons are mentioned 4 times: once in <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century and three times in <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century. To sum all, Gipsies and variously disabled persons are recorded 36 times: 21 recordings in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased, 11 notes in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> baptisms, and two times in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation and in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages. Although these social groups represent a small percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permanent or temporary population of Pula, one can notice that their presence contributed to <b>the</b> social life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city...|$|R

5|$|A Passion for Churches is a 1974 BBC {{television}} documentary written and {{presented by the}} then Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman and produced and directed by Edward Mirzoeff.

5|$|A popular {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} origins of the lemuriform clade is that they evolved from European adapiforms known as adapids. In some adapids, the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit, and the American paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb. However, no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eocene, and the European adapid lower jaws from that time did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms.|$|E
