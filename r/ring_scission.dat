40|$|The {{hydroxyl}} radicals (HO center dot) {{are one of}} {{the most}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the oxidative damage of biological molecules, including carbohydrates. During the industrial processing of food, ROS can be formed. In order to identify the structural changes induced in starch by oxidation, amylose, amylopectin, and maltotriose, an oligosaccharide structurally related to these polysaccharides, were subjected to oxidation with HO center dot generated under Fenton reaction conditions (Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2). The oxidised polysaccharides were hydrolysed by alpha-amylase and the obtained oligosaccharides were fractionated by ligand-exchange/size-exclusion chromatography. Both acidic and neutral alpha-amylase resistant oligosaccharides were characterized by mass spectrometry. In oxidised neutral products, new keto, hydroxyl, and hydroperoxy moieties, and oxidative <b>ring</b> <b>scission</b> were observed at the reducing end of the oligosaccharides. The acid sugar residues occurred at the reducing end and included gluconic and glucuronic acid derivatives, and acids formed by oxidative <b>ring</b> <b>scission,</b> namely, arabinonic, erythronic, glyceric and glycolic acids.

Steroids vary by the functional groups attached to this four-ring core and by the oxidation state of the rings. Sterols are forms of steroids with a hydroxyl group at position three and a skeleton derived from cholestane.

40|$|Mechanochemically {{facilitated}} retro [2 + 2] cycloaddition of four-membered ketene dimer rings {{was investigated}} using density functional theory and ultrasound induced scission experiments. The results reveal that, {{in contrast to}} many other mechanochemical processes, the activation energy for mechanochemical ring-opening of cyclobutane- 1, 3 -diones increases {{in the presence of}} an external force. Thus, a strengthening of bonds in the four-membered ring is observed under the influence of an extensional force on cis-substituents. A force on trans-substituents weakens the bonds, but to a smaller extent than initially stronger bonds outside the <b>ring.</b> Mechanochemical <b>scission</b> experiments of ketene dimers incorporated in the main chain of a polymer using ultrasound confirmed that scission of the chains does not occur via retro [2 + 2] cycloaddition, but elsewhere in the chain...|$|R
30|$|Even though {{aromatic}} oxidation involving splitting of {{the ring}} C–C bonds represented a milestone in the heterogeneous catalyzed oxidation technology [12], {{the literature on the}} topic is somewhat limited. The literature on <b>ring</b> <b>scission</b> is mostly focused on the discussion of a few examples of industrially successful selective catalytic oxidations, e.g., the commercial production of phthalic anhydride from the vapor-phase oxidation of naphthalene. This type of chemistry is of particular interest for the present work, due to its potential application for the conversion of heavy aromatic materials. As a result, the oxidation of some key aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene will be discussed in the following sections. There are important differences in the way oxidation of these four compounds proceed.|$|E

We successfully developed a three-step, one-pot carboalumination-Claisen rearrangement-addition reaction, which provides complex allylic alcohols from simple starting materials. While attempting to extend this methodology to nitrogen-containing substrates, a tandem hydrozirconation-iminium ion addition reaction was developed that allows simple access to functionalized isoindolinones. An oxidative rearrangement of enol ethers to spiroketals was developed, contributing an unusual approach to these highly sought after functionalities. Finally, an approach to the complex natural product diazonamide A was investigated {{with the intention of}} applying the Chan rearrangement. Eventually, the complexities of total synthesis forbid the use of the Chan rearrangement, and an alternative pathway was developed that led to the application of a cascade acyl chloride-oxazoline <b>ring</b> <b>scission</b> to install critical components of diazonamide...|$|E

XPS studies on active layers blends of PCPDTBT and PCBM also show significant changes in the vertical composition during ageing, with increased enrichment of PCPDTBT observed at the top surface and that the use of a processing additive (ODT) has a negative impact on the morphological stability.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study, the {{photolysis}} of carbofuran has been undertaken under sunlight conditions {{and at the}} surface of model supports such as clay films and different soils collected from two different sites in Morocco (Tirs and Dahs). In all conditions, an efficient degradation occurred owing to direct light absorption and also to photoinduced processes involving either clays or natural organic matter moities. On kaolin films, the photodegradation kinetics appears to follow a first-order process that clearly depends on the film thickness. The diffusion of carbofuran from the lower part to the illuminated surface {{was found to be}} negligible when compared to the photolysis process within the range of 20 – 70 μm. Thus, the photolysis rate constant at the surface of the solid support, k 0, was evaluated to be 7. 0 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 min− 1. Under these experimental conditions, the quantum yield was found equal to 2. 1 [*]×[*] 10 - 4. On soil surfaces, the disappearance rate constant was mainly attributed to photoinduced processes arising from natural organic matter. From the analytical point of view, the products were formed through (1) hydroxylation on the aromatic <b>ring,</b> (2) homolytic <b>scission</b> of the carbamate C–O bond leading to radical species formation, and (3) photohydrolysis of the carbamate C–O bond...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of -(15) -l-arabinotriose (Ara(3)), an oligosaccharide structurally {{related to}} side chains of coffee arabinogalactans, was studied in reaction with hydroxyl radicals generated {{under conditions of}} Fenton reaction (Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2). The acidic and neutral oxidation products were separated by ligand exchange/size-exclusion chromatography, subsequently identified by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and structurally characterised by tandem MS (ESI-MS/MS). In acidic fraction were identified several oxidation products containing an acidic residue at the corresponding reducing end of Ara(3), namely arabinonic acid, and erythronic, glyceric and glycolic acids formed by oxidative scission of the furanose ring. In neutral fractions were identified derivatives containing keto, hydroxy and hydroperoxy moieties, as well as derivatives resulting from the <b>ring</b> <b>scission</b> at the reducing end of Ara(3). In both acidic and neutral fractions, beyond the trisaccharide derivatives, the corresponding di- and monosaccharide derivatives were identified indicating the occurrence of oxidative depolymerisation. The structural characterisation of these oxidation products by ESI-MS/MS allowed the differentiation of isobaric and isomeric species of acidic and neutral character. The species identified in this study may help in detection of roasting products associated with the free radical-mediated oxidation of coffee arabinogalactans.

40|$|Abstract: Studies on an {{unexpected}} reaction involving a reductive cleavage of the pyridazine moiety of a tricyclic heterocycle are described. Structure assignments for the products {{obtained from the}} reductive cleavage were made using physicochemical methods. The pro drug ’ (TCN-P, fi) of 6 -amino- 4 -N-methyl- 8 -(P-D-ribofuranosyl) -I, 3, 4, 5 &pentaaza-acenaphthylene 2 (TCN, b) is currently undergoing clinical trials {{under the auspices of}} the National Cancer Insritute. 3 It is generally thought that both TCN and TCN-P are acting as adenosine analogs 4 but the exact biochemical mechanism has not yet been elucidated. It has been reported that a ring scissinn of the RO 0 kd HO OH OH pyrrole ring of TCN occurs in vivo, and this prompted us to initiate a synthesis of the aza analog of TCN (5) with a nitrogen being substituted for carbon at the site of the in vivo <b>ring</b> <b>scission</b> in TCN (la).

40|$|A {{series of}} cyclic triphosphenium ions {{containing}} three adjacent phosphorus atoms linked by a hydrocarbon backbone has been synthesised. They vary in ring size (four- to seven- membered rings), substituents on the four-coordinate phosphorus atoms, and organic backbone, {{and have been}} characterised by (^ 31) P NMR spectroscopy. Variable temperature studies probing the mechanism of formation of cyclic triphosphenium ions from a reaction of PX(_ 3) with a diphosphane have shown a three-step mechanism: (i) the addition of PX(_ 3) to the diphosphane to form an acyclic intermediate, (ii) cyclisation to afford a heterocycle with a halogen still bonded to the central P atom, and (iii) removal of the halogen to afford the cyclic triphosphenium ion. The syntheses of P(_c) -alkyl and aryl derivatives of cyclic triphosphenium ions using two different methods are described. Direct ethylation of a cyclic triphosphenium ion using ethyl triflate is only possible when the substituents on the four-coordinate phosphorus atoms are small e. g. Et. Synthesis of Pc-alkyl and aryl derivatives with larger substituents on the four-coordinate P atoms, and/or Pc, have been achieved via reaction of a diphosphane with a dichlorophosphane {{in the presence of}} AICI(_ 3 _ or SnCI(_ 2). A series of tetraphosphonium ions containing four adjacent P atoms linked by an organic backbone has also been synthesised. These derivatives have been characterised using (^ 31) P NMR spectroscopy and where possible X-ray diffractions studies and elemental analyses. The P-P bonds in these derivatives are typical values for single bonds. The synthesis of Pt(II) complexes containing cyclic triphosphenium ions has been achieved to afford cis and/or trans isomers via reaction of a cyclic triphosphenium ion with trans-[Pt(PR(_ 3)) CI(µCl) ](_ 2). However, if the cyclic triphosphenium ion contains phenyl groups on both of the four-coordinate phosphorus atoms, <b>ring</b> <b>scission</b> followed by complexation of the diphosphane to Pt is observed. In the Pt(II) complexes containing cyclic triphosphenium ions, an unusually small 'J(_pt-p) value to the phosphenium central P (981 - 1267 Hz) suggests that the bond between the phosphenium central P atom and the Pt centre is long. Hydrolysis reactions of several Pt(II) complexes containing chlorophosphane ligands have been monitored by (^ 31) P NMR spectroscopy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Benzene, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical and {{a component of}} gasoline, is radiomimetic and exposure may lead progressively to aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, and multiple myeloma. Although benzene {{has been shown to}} cause many types of genetic damage, it has consistently been classified as a non-mutagen in the Ames test, possibly because of the inadequacy of the S 9 microsomal activation system. The metabolism of benzene is complex, yielding glucuronide and sulphate conjugates of phenol, quinol, and catechol, L-phenylmercapturic acid, and muconaldehyde and trans, trans-muconic acid by <b>ring</b> <b>scission.</b> Quinol is oxidised to p-benzoquinone, which binds to vital cellular components or undergoes redox cycling to generate oxygen radicals; muconaldehyde, like p-benzoquinone, is toxic through depletion of intracellular glutathione. Exposure to benzene may also induce the microsomal mixed function oxidase, cytochrome P 450 IIE 1, which is probably responsible for the oxygenation of benzene, but also has a propensity to generate oxygen radicals. The radiomimetic nature of benzene and its ability to induce different sites of neoplasia indicate that formation of oxygen radicals is a major cause of benzene toxicity, which involves multiple mechanisms including synergism between arylating and glutathione-depleting reactive metabolites and oxygen radicals. The occupational exposure limit in the United Kingdom (MEL) and the United States (PEL) was 10 ppm based on the association of benzene exposure with aplastic anaemia, but recently was lowered to 5 ppm and 1 ppm respectively, reflecting a concern for the risk of neoplasia. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has even more recently recommended that, as benzene is considered an A 1 carcinogen, the threshold limit value (TLV) should be decreased to 0. 1 ppm. Only one study in man, based on nine cases of benzene associated fatal neoplasia, has been considered suitable for risk assessment. Recent re-evaluation of these data indicated that past assessments may have overestimated the risk, and different authors have considered that lifetime exposure to benzene at 1 ppm would result in an excess of leukaemia deaths of 9. 5 to 1. 0 per 1000. Although in this study, deaths at low levels of benzene exposure were associated with multiple myeloma and a long latency period, instead of leukaemia, which might justify further lowering of the exposure limit, the risk assessment model {{has been found to be}} non-significant for response at low levels of exposure. The paucity of data for man, the complexity of the metabolic activation of benzene, the interactive and synergistic mechanisms of benzene toxicity and carcinogenicity, the different disease endpoints (aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, and multiple myeloma), and different individual susceptibilities, all indicate that in such a complex scenario, regulators should proceed with caution before making further changes to the exposure limit for this chemical...|$|E
