5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while <b>risperidone</b> and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. <b>Risperidone</b> has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications <b>risperidone</b> and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; <b>risperidone</b> can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of <b>risperidone,</b> which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including <b>risperidone</b> (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
25|$|Carbamazepine {{and other}} enzyme {{inducers}} may reduce plasma levels of <b>risperidone.</b> If {{a person is}} taking both carbamazepine and <b>risperidone,</b> the dose of <b>risperidone</b> will likely need to be increased. The new dose should not be {{more than twice the}} patient's original dose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Risperidone</b> was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993 for the treatment of schizophrenia. In 2003, the FDA approved <b>risperidone</b> for the short-term treatment of the mixed and manic states associated with bipolar disorder. In 2006, the FDA approved <b>risperidone</b> for the treatment of irritability in autistic children and adolescents. On August 22, 2007, <b>risperidone</b> {{was approved}} as the only drug agent available for treatment of schizophrenia in youths, ages 13–17; it was also approved that same day for treatment of bipolar disorder in youths and children, ages 10–17, joining lithium. The FDA's decision was based in part on a study of autistic people with severe and enduring problems of violent meltdowns, aggression, and self-injury; <b>risperidone</b> is not recommended for autistic people with mild aggression and explosive behavior without an enduring pattern.|$|E
25|$|While {{antipsychotic}} medications such as <b>risperidone</b> have {{a slight}} benefit in people with dementia, they {{have been linked to}} higher incidences of death and stroke. Because of this increased risk of death, treatment of dementia-related psychosis with <b>risperidone</b> is not FDA approved.|$|E
25|$|<b>Risperidone</b> is {{effective}} in treating the acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. A 2013 study compared 15 antipsychotic drugs in treating schizophrenia. <b>Risperidone</b> was ranked fourth, 11% more effective than paliperidone (5th), 20-23% more effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, and 36% less effective than clozapine (1st).|$|E
25|$|<b>Risperidone,</b> an anti-psychotic medication, {{can result}} in megacolon.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has focused}} on {{atypical}} antipsychotics, especially <b>risperidone,</b> which has the largest amount of evidence that consistently shows improvements in irritability, self-injury, aggression, and tantrums associated with ASD. <b>Risperidone</b> is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating symptomatic irritability in autistic children and adolescents. In short-term trials (up to six months) most adverse events were mild to moderate, with weight gain, drowsiness, and high blood sugar requiring monitoring; long term efficacy and safety have not been fully determined. It is unclear whether <b>risperidone</b> improves autism's core social and communication deficits. The FDA's decision was {{based in part on}} a study of autistic children with severe and enduring problems of tantrums, aggression, and self-injury; <b>risperidone</b> is not recommended for autistic children with mild aggression and explosive behavior without an enduring pattern.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>risperidone</b> and {{aripiprazole}} {{have received}} FDA labelling for autism.|$|E
25|$|Schizophrenia: {{antipsychotics}} such as haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine, <b>risperidone</b> and quetiapine.|$|E
25|$|CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as SSRI medications, may {{increase}} plasma levels of <b>risperidone.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Risperidone</b> has not {{demonstrated}} a benefit {{in the treatment}} of eating disorders or personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Risperidone</b> {{is mainly}} {{used for the}} {{treatment}} of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Risperidone</b> {{has shown}} promise in {{treating}} therapy resistant obsessive–compulsive disorder, when serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not sufficient.|$|E
25|$|<b>Risperidone</b> is {{available}} as a tablet, an oral solution, and an ampule, which is a depot injection.|$|E
25|$|An {{antipsychotic}} {{combined with}} an antidepressant, particularly atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole (Abilify), quetiapine (Seroquel), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and <b>risperidone</b> (Risperdal).|$|E
25|$|Alpha α1 {{adrenergic}} receptors: This action {{accounts for}} its orthostatic hypotensive effects {{and perhaps some}} of the sedating effects of <b>risperidone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since <b>risperidone</b> {{can cause}} hypotension, its use should be {{monitored}} closely {{when a patient}} is also taking anti-hypertensive medicines to avoid severe low blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|It was {{recently}} found that D-amino acid oxidase, the enzyme that catalyses {{the breakdown of}} D-amino acids (e.g. D-alanine and D-serine — the neurotransmitters) is inhibited by <b>risperidone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Older {{people with}} dementia-related {{psychosis}} {{are at a}} higher risk of death if they take <b>risperidone</b> compared to those who do not. Most deaths are related to heart problems or infections.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} of 9 published trials having minimum duration 6 months and median duration 52 weeks concluded that olanzapine, quetiapine, and <b>risperidone</b> had better effects on cognitive function than amisulpride and haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|In August 2012, Johnson & Johnson {{agreed to}} pay $181 million to 36 U.S. states in order to settle claims that it had {{promoted}} <b>risperidone</b> and paliperidone for off-label uses including for dementia, anger management, and anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Atypical {{antipsychotic}} {{drugs like}} clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, <b>risperidone</b> and asenapine are relatively potent antagonists of 5-HT2A as {{are some of}} the lower potency old generation/typical antipsychotics. Other antagonists are MDL-100,907 (prototype of another new series of 5-HT2A antagonists) and cyproheptadine.|$|E
25|$|Long-acting {{injectable}} {{formulations of}} antipsychotic drugs provide improved compliance with therapy and reduce relapse rates relative to oral formulations. The efficacy of <b>risperidone</b> long acting injection {{appears to be}} similar to that of long acting injectable forms of first generation antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|Janssen's {{patent on}} <b>risperidone</b> expired on December 29, 2003, opening {{the market for}} cheaper generic {{versions}} from other companies, and Janssen's exclusive marketing rights expired on June 29, 2004 (the result of a pediatric extension). It is available under many brand names worldwide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Risperidone,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Risperdal among others, is an {{antipsychotic}} medication. It is mainly {{used to treat}} schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability in people with autism. It is taken either by mouth or by injection into a muscle. The injectable version is long acting and lasts for about two weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{tranquilizer}} or antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a typical antipsychotic, {{was discovered in}} 1951 and introduced into clinical practice shortly thereafter. Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced agranulocytosis. Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia {{and the development of}} an adverse event monitoring system, clozapine re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are clozapine, <b>risperidone,</b> and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought-after for widespread use. During the 1990s, olanzapine, <b>risperidone,</b> and quetiapine were introduced, with ziprasidone and aripiprazole following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic paliperidone was approved by the FDA in late 2006.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be a dose-dependent risk for {{seizures}} with chlorpromazine treatment. Tardive dyskinesia and akathisia are less commonly seen with chlorpromazine than they are with high potency typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol or trifluoperazine, and some evidence suggests that, with conservative dosing, the incidence of such effects for chlorpromazine may be comparable to that of newer agents such as <b>risperidone</b> or olanzapine.|$|E
25|$|On 11 April 2012, Johnson & Johnson and its {{subsidiary}} Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. were fined $1.2 {{billion by}} Judge Timothy Davis Fox of the Sixth Division of the Sixth Judicial Circuit of the U.S. state of Arkansas. The jury found the companies had downplayed multiple {{risks associated with}} <b>risperidone</b> (Risperdal). The verdict was later reversed by the Arkansas State Supreme court.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{treatment}} of a manic episode of bipolar disorder involves the utilization of either a mood stabilizer (valproate, lithium, or carbamazepine) or an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, quetiapine, <b>risperidone,</b> or aripiprazole). Although hypomanic episodes may respond to a mood stabilizer alone, full-blown episodes are treated with an atypical antipsychotic (often {{in conjunction with a}} mood stabilizer, as these tend to produce the most rapid improvement).|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine is {{recommended}} by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence as a first line therapy {{for the treatment of}} acute mania in bipolar disorder. Other recommended first lines are haloperidol, quetiapine and <b>risperidone.</b> It {{is recommended}} in combination with fluoxetine as a first line therapy for acute bipolar depression; and as a second line treatment by itself for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, are {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} treatment of mania or acute psychosis-induced aggression. In this context, benzodiazepines are given either alone, or in combination with other first-line drugs such as lithium, haloperidol or <b>risperidone.</b> The effectiveness of taking benzodiazepines along with antipsychotic drugs is unknown, and {{more research is needed to}} determine if benzodiazepines are more effective than antipsychotic drugs when urgent sedation is required.|$|E
25|$|Citing an {{increased}} risk of stroke, in 2004 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) in the UK issued a warning that olanzapine and <b>risperidone,</b> both atypical antipsychotic medications, should not be given to elderly patients with dementia. In the U.S., olanzapine comes with a black box warning for increased risk of death in elderly patients. It is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis. However, a BBC investigation in June 2008 found that this advice was being widely ignored by British doctors.|$|E
