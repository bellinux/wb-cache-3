2500|$|The [...] "rod-actuated brake", {{or simply}} [...] "rod brake", (<b>roller</b> <b>lever</b> brake in Raleigh terminology) uses {{a series of}} rods and pivots, rather than Bowden cables, to {{transmit}} force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface, which faces the hub, of the wheel rim. They were often called [...] "stirrup brakes" [...] due to their shape. Rod brakes are used with a rim profile known as the Westwood rim, which has a slightly concave area on the braking surface and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads {{on opposite sides of}} the rim.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1934 and 1940 {{eight of}} the first fifteen locos had their Gresley gear removed and were {{converted}} to a [...] "double Walschaerts" [...] valve gear which utilized a double eccentric (return) crank and second link {{on the right side}} (similar to the gear Baldwin used on its 3-cylinder experimental compound 4-10-2 #60000), which operated the valve for the inside cylinder. Union Pacific referred to this system as the [...] "third link." [...] The 4-12-2's constructed from 1928 utilized roller bearings in the Gresley lever bearings, thus none of these engines were converted. The pre-1928 engines not converted received the <b>roller</b> bearing <b>levers</b> in 1940, and no further conversions were made.|$|R
50|$|Standardized limit {{switches}} are industrial control components manufactured {{with a variety}} of operator types, including <b>lever,</b> <b>roller</b> plunger, and whisker type. Limit switches may be directly mechanically operated by the motion of the operating lever. A reed switch may be used to indicate proximity of a magnet mounted on some moving part. Proximity switches operate by the disturbance of an electromagnetic field, by capacitance, or by sensing a magnetic field.|$|R
5000|$|The dolmens {{were built}} from glacial erratics, with the gaps filled with red sandstone. Presumably, {{standing}} stones were {{transported to the}} site using <b>rollers,</b> slides, <b>levers</b> and ropes, and {{the interior of the}} unfinished dolmens was filled with clay to form a ramp to enable the movement of the cover stones into their final position. After removing the clay from the interior, a barrow (tumulus) was then raised on top of the dolmen, which remained accessible through a passage made from smaller stones. In addition, single standing stones were sometimes placed around the dolmen, forming either a rectangular or trapezoidal shape (Hünenbett), or a stone circle (Bannkreis). Sometimes, large singular [...] "guardian stones" [...] (Wächterstein, Bautastein) were placed adjacent to these shapes. The interior of the dolmen was usually divided into small compartments by slabs of red sandstone, standing upright.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the first}} and most {{important}} preparation for that event the old fellow ordered from his Singapore agent a Steyn and Ebhart's [...] "upright grand." [...] I was then commanding a little steamer in the island trade, and it fell to my lot to take it out to him, so I know something of Freya's [...] "upright grand." [...] We landed the enormous packing-case with difficulty on a flat piece of rock amongst some bushes, nearly knocking the bottom out of one of my boats in the course of that nautical operation. Then, all my crew assisting, engineers and firemen included, by the exercise of much anxious ingenuity, and by means of <b>rollers,</b> <b>levers,</b> tackles, and inclined planes of soaped planks, toiling in the sun like ancient Egyptians at the building of a pyramid, we got it as far as the house and up on {{to the edge of the}} west verandah--which was the actual drawing- room of the bungalow. There, the case being ripped off cautiously, the beautiful rosewood monster stood revealed at last. In reverent excitement we coaxed it against the wall and drew the first free breath of the day. It was certainly the heaviest movable object on that islet since the creation of the world. The volume of sound it gave out in that bungalow (which acted as a sounding-board) was really astonishing. It thundered sweetly right over the sea. Jasper Allen told me that early of a morning on the deck of the Bonito (his wonderfully fast and pretty brig) he could hear Freya playing her scales quite distinctly. But the fellow always anchored foolishly close to the point, as I told him more than once. Of course, these seas are almost uniformly serene, and the Seven Isles is a particularly calm and cloudless spot as a rule. But still, now and again, an afternoon thunderstorm over Banka, or even one of these vicious thick squalls, from the distant Sumatra coast, would make a sudden sally upon the group, enveloping it for a couple of hours in whirlwinds and bluish-black murk of a particularly sinister aspect. Then, with the lowered rattan- screens rattling desperately in the wind and the bungalow shaking all over, Freya would sit down to the piano and play fierce Wagner music in the flicker of blinding flashes, with thunderbolts falling all round, enough to make your hair stand on end; and Jasper would remain stock still on the verandah, adoring the back view of her supple, swaying figure, the miraculous sheen of her fair head, the rapid hands on the keys, the white nape of her neck--while the brig, down at the point there, surged at her cables within a hundred yards of nasty, shiny, black rock-heads. Ugh! ...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{semaphore}} signals were controlled by levers {{situated at the}} signals. Some early signals protruded {{from the roof of}} the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers connected to the signal by single wires (UK), pairs of wires (Continental Europe), or pipes supported on <b>rollers</b> (US). The <b>levers</b> were grouped together in a building known as a [...] "signal box" [...] (UK & Australia) or [...] "interlocking tower" [...] (US). In the UK multiple signal wires were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single signal wire would cause some of the adjacent wires to 'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until the gradual introduction of colour-light signals from the mid 20th century.|$|R
50|$|It {{could be}} {{regarded}} as having its distant origins in the escapement invented by Robert Robin, C.1792, which gives a single impulse in one direction; with the locking achieved by passive lever pallets, {{the design of the}} coaxial escapement is more akin to that of another Robin variant, the Fasoldt escapement, which was invented and patented by the American Charles Fasoldt in 1859.Both Robin and Fasoldt escapements give impulse in one direction only.The latter escapement has a lever with unequal drops; this engages with two escape wheels of differing diameters. The smaller impulse wheel acts on the single pallet {{at the end of the}} lever, whilst the pointed lever pallets lock on the larger wheel.The balance engages with and is impelled by the <b>lever</b> through a <b>roller</b> pin and <b>lever</b> fork. The lever 'anchor' pallet locks the larger wheel and, on this being unlocked, a pallet on the end of the lever is given an impulse by the smaller wheel through the lever fork. The return stroke is 'dead', with the 'anchor' pallets serving only to lock and unlock, impulse being given in one direction through the single lever pallet.As with the duplex, the locking wheel is larger in order to reduce pressure and thus friction.|$|R
