Since digital and real mock-up must match for the further product development, the transfer of differences between physical and digital mock-up to the CAD format is a crucial issue. In this paper an Augmented Reality (AR) based tool-chain is presented, which allows matching the CAD data with real mock-ups and documents the differences between them.

In this paper, we develop a hybrid camera pose-tracking system that combines vision and inertial sensor technologies. We propose to use the particle filter framework for the sensor fusion system. Particle filters are sequential Monte-Carlo methods based upon a point mass (or 'particle') representation of probability densities, which can be applied to any state space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. We have tested our algorithm to evaluate its performance and have compared the results obtained by the particle filter with those given by a classical extended Kalman filter.

Traditional vision based or inertial sensor based solutions are mostly designed for well-structured environment, which is however unavailable for outdoor uncontrolled road navigation applications. This paper proposed a hybrid camera pose tracking system that combines vision, GPS and 3 D inertial gyroscope technologies. The fusion approach is based on our PMM (parameterized model matching) algorithm, in which the road shape model is derived from the digital map referring to GPS absolute road position, and matches with road features extracted from the real image. Inertial data estimates the initial possible motion, and also serves as the relative tolerance to stabilize output. The algorithms proposed in this paper are validated with the experimental results of real road tests under different conditions and types of road. 1.

The variations of annual mean effective area coefficient with aspect ratio (<b>AR),</b> <b>spacing,</b> tilt angle, and latitude were analyzed using this model.

Telemedicine, which uses communication technology to deliver medical services over distance, is an economical and potentially effective way to address this problem. In this research, we develop a new telepresence application using an Augmented Reality (AR) system. We explore the use of the Microsoft HoloLens to facilitate and enhance remote medical training. Intrinsic advantages of AR systems enable remote learners to perform complex medical procedures such as Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) without visual interference.

40|$|Recently, {{visualization}} of urban scenes with various information attracts attention. For {{the transmission of}} urban scenes, virtual reality has been widely used. Since the virtual reality requires comprehensive and detailed three dimensional models, the manual dependent modelling {{takes a lot of}} time and effort. On the other hand, it has been tackled that various data is superimposed on the scene which the users see at the time instead of comprehensive modelling, which is well known as augmented reality (AR). Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been attempted using simple video cameras for the AR. This method estimates exterior orientation factors of the camera, and three dimensional reconstructions of feature points simultaneously. The method, however, has been applied to only small indoor space. This paper investigates the applicability of the popular method of SALM to wide outdoor space, and improves the stability of the method. Through the application, the tracked feature points successfully are greatly reduced compared with application in indoor environment. According to the experimental result, simple markers or GPS are introduced as auxiliary information. The markers gives the stability of optimization, and GPS gives real scale to <b>AR</b> <b>spaces.</b> Additionally, feature points tracking method is modified by assigning amplitude of displacement and depth. The effect of the markers and GPS are confirmed. On the other hand, some limitations of the method are understood. As a result, more impressive visualization will be accomplished...|$|R

40|$|Augmented Reality (AR) has the {{potential}} of being an effective visualization tool for planning and operations design in construction, manufacturing, and other process-oriented engineering domains. One of the primary challenges in creating AR visualizations is to project graphical 3 D objects onto a user’s view of the real world and create a sustained illusion that the virtual and real objects co-exist across time in the same augmented space. However regardless of the spatial relationship between the real and virtual objects, traditional AR scene composing algorithm displays the real world merely as a background, and superimposes virtual objects in the foreground. This creates incorrect visual occlusion artifacts, that in effect breaks the illusion that real and virtual objects co-exist in AR. The research implements and demonstrates a robust depth sensing and frame buffer algorithm for resolving incorrect occlusion problems in outdoor AR applications. A high-accuracy Time-of-flight (TOF) camera capable of suppressing background illumination (e. g. bright sunlight) in ubiquitous environments is used to capture the depth map of real-world in real time. The preprocessed distance information is rendered into depth buffer, that allows the interpolation of visual or hidden elements in the OpenGL color buffer to generate the composite AR scene. An optimized approach taking advantage of OpenGL texture and GLSL fragment processor is also proposed to speed up sampling distance value and rendering into frame buffer. The designed algorithm is validated in several indoor and outdoor experiments using SMART AR framework.

The dissertation examines who the stakeholder groups are, how they are conceptualizing and pushing the technology, and the future uses and applications they are advancing in order to build coalitions and make the technology a reality. Through participant observation, in-depth interviews, and document analysis, this work has followed the AR community for several years. The dissertation reports on five major areas of contestation: the first is a debate over the form that a commercial AR device should take, whether it is mobile or headworn. The second is the debate over what AR is, and the ways that the definitional debate helps understand the community itself and the tensions within it. The third is the relationship between a particularly strong stakeholder group, marketing and advertising, and the ways that other actors are adjusting and reacting to their influence. The fourth is a contestation over standards in this industry, and how certain groups are negotiating the standards that will enable certain uses of AR. The last debate is over the industrial <b>AR</b> <b>space,</b> as certain groups have been advocating a turn away from consumer AR to more industrial applications, and some of the implications for that move.

40|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of the noble gases, in particular Ar, in samples of ancient atmosphere trapped in rocks and minerals provides the strongest constraints on the timing and rate of Earth atmosphere formation by degassing of the Earth's interior. We have re-measured the {{isotopic composition}} of argon in the Rhynie chert from northeast Scotland using a high precision mass spectrometer {{in an effort to}} provide constraints on the composition of Devonian atmosphere. Irradiated chert samples yield 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratios that are often below the modern atmosphere value. The data define a 40 Ar/ 36 Ar value of 289. 5 ± 0. 4 at K/ 36 Ar = 0. Similarly low 40 Ar/ 36 Ar are measured in un-irradiated chert samples. The simplest explanation for the low 40 Ar/ 36 Ar is the preservation of Devonian atmosphere-derived Ar in the chert, with the intercept value in 40 Ar– 39 Ar– 36 <b>Ar</b> <b>space</b> representing an upper limit. In this case the Earth's atmosphere has accumulated only 3 % (5. 1 ± 0. 4 × 1016  mol) of the total 40 Ar inventory since the Devonian. The average accumulation rate of 1. 27 ± 0. 09 × 108  mol 40 Ar/yr overlaps the rate over the last 800 kyr. This implies that there has been no resolvable temporal change in the outgassing rate of the Earth since the mid-Palaeozoic despite the likely episodicity of Ar degassing from the continental crust. Incorporating the new Devonian atmosphere 40 Ar/ 36 Ar into the Earth degassing model of Pujol et al. (2013) provides the most precise constraints on atmosphere formation so far. The atmosphere formed in the first ∼ 100 Ma after initial accretion during a catastrophic degassing episode.

Aim: To describe epidemiological characteristics of HBsAgpositive patients, especially inactive carriers, and to evaluate how practitioners manage HBV patients in real life. Methods: Belgian physicians were asked to report all chronically infected HBV patients during a one-year period. Results: Among 1, 456 patients included, 1, 035 (71 %) were classified into one of four phases of chronic infection: immune tolerance (n = 10), HBeAg-positive hepatitis (n = 248), HBeAgnegative hepatitis (n = 420) and inactive carrier state (n = 357 HBeAg-negative patients with ALT < upper limit of normal (ULN) and HBV DNA < 2, 000 IU/mL).
