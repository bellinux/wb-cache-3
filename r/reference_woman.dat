They are modifications of the 15 -year-old male/adult female phantom (15 -AF phantom) of Cristy and Eckerman (1987). The model of uterine contents includes the fetus, fetal skeleton, and placenta. The model is suitable for dose calculations for the fetus as a whole; individual organs within the fetus (other than the skeleton) are not modeled. A new model for the nonpregnant adult female is also described, comprising (1) the 15 -AF phantom; (2) an adjustment to specific absorbed fractions for organ self-dose from photons to better match <b>Reference</b> <b>Woman</b> masses; and (3) computation of specific absorbed fractions with <b>Reference</b> <b>Woman</b> masses from ICRP Publication 23 for both penetrating and nonpenetrating radiations.

Although height-weight tables are often {{used to assess the}} extent of 2 ̆ 2 overweightness 2 ̆ 2 based on age and 2 ̆ 2 frame size 2 ̆ 2, auch tables do not provide reliable information about the relative composition or quality of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s body.

In 1978 – 1979, a mass poisoning occurred in central Taiwan due to PCB/PCDF-contaminated cooking oil; this incident was called Yucheng (“oil disease ” in Chinese). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our {{study was to determine}} whether PCB/PCDF exposure affected fertility in exposed women. METHODS: After the event, we followed the exposed individuals and a reference group who were sex-, age-, and community-matched. In 2003, we obtained fertility histories from Yucheng and <b>reference</b> <b>women</b> by telephone interview. We used Kaplan–Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox regression to compare time to pregnancy (TTP) between Yucheng and <b>reference</b> <b>women,</b> and we performed multiple logistic regression to determine whether PCB/PCDF exposure caused infertility. RESULTS: In total, 412 women responded, with a median TTP of 4 months in Yucheng women and 3 months in <b>reference</b> <b>women</b> (p = 0. 019). After adjusting for confounders by Cox regression, we found a fecundability ratio of 0. 90 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 80 – 1. 00] for Yucheng women.

The differences in height and weight between Caucasian and Asian may lead to inaccurate dose estimation. In this study, we developed the Taiwanese reference phantoms. 40 volunteers were recruited. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were obtained, and the contours of 15 organs were drawn. The Taiwanese reference man (TRM) and Taiwanese <b>reference</b> <b>woman</b> (TRW) were constructed. For the SAF calculation, {{the differences in the}} self-absorption SAF (self-SAF) between the TRM, TRW, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) adult phantom were less than 10 % when the difference in organ mass was less than 20 %. The average SAF from liver to pancreas of TRM was 38 % larger than that of the ORNL adult phantom, and the result of TRW was 2. 02 times higher than that of the ORNL adult phantom. For the S-value calculation, the ratios of TRW and ORNL adult phantom ranged from 0. 91 to 1. 57, and the ratios of TRM and ORNL adult phantom ranged from 1. 04 to 2. 29. The SAF and S-value results were dominantly affected by the height, weight, organ mass, and geometric relationship between organs. By using the TRM and TRW, the accuracy of internal dose evaluation can be increased for radiation protection and nuclear medicine...|$|E

40|$|Background: There is a known {{interaction}} between pregnancy and rheumatic disease. Women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA) {{are concerned about the}} potential impact of a pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to get more knowledge on how pregnancy affects these womens health related quality of life (HRQL). Purpose: To study changes in HRQL in Norwegian women with RA and JIA before, during and after pregnancy. Methods: A total 35 patients with RA and 27 patients with JIA were assessed up to six times (before pregnancy, once in each trimester, and at six weeks and six months postpartum) using the short form 36 (SF- 36). In addition, these women were compared to a group of nonpregnant <b>reference</b> <b>women</b> in the same age group, 66 women with RA and 33 women with JIA. Results: In the study group RA women had better HRQL than the JIA patients at baseline in the aspects of mental health, vitality and role physical. Independent of disease group the womens, experience of vitality was lower in 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd trimester compared to baseline. Six months postpartum, the RA women in the study group scored better in the aspects of social function, physical function, role physical and role emotional than the non-pregnant <b>reference</b> <b>women</b> with RA. Conclusion: HRQL was lower during pregnancy for both RA and JIA women. However, despite a wide range, the women seemed to reach the same level as pre-pregnancy at the time of six months postpartum. </p...|$|R

40|$|Studies using 24 h urine {{collections}} need {{to incorporate}} ways {{to validate the}} completeness of the urine samples. Models to predict urinary creatinine excretion (UCE) {{have been developed for}} this purpose; however, information on their usefulness to identify incomplete urine collections is limited. We aimed to develop a model for predicting UCE and to assess the performance of a creatinine index using para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) as a reference. Data were taken from the European Food Consumption Validation study comprising two non-consecutive 24 h urine collections from 600 subjects in five European countries. Data from one collection were used to build a multiple linear regression model to predict UCE, and data from the other collection were used for performance testing of a creatinine index-based strategy to identify incomplete collections. Multiple linear regression (n 458) of UCE showed a significant positive association for body weight (ß = 0 · 07), the interaction term sex × weight (ß = 0 · 09, <b>reference</b> <b>women)</b> and protein intake (ß = 0 · 02). A significant negative association was found for age (ß = - 0 · 09) and sex (ß = - 3 · 14, <b>reference</b> <b>women).</b> An index of observed-to-predicted creatinine resulted in a sensitivity to identify incomplete collections of 0 · 06 (95 % CI 0 · 01, 0 · 20) and 0 · 11 (95 % CI 0 · 03, 0 · 22) in men and women, respectively. Specificity was 0 · 97 (95 % CI 0 · 97, 0 · 98) in men and 0 · 98 (95 % CI 0 · 98, 0 · 99) in women. The present study shows that UCE can be predicted from weight, age and sex. However, the results revealed that a creatinine index based on these predictions is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude incomplete 24 h urine collections...|$|R

The first part of this paper, a literature review, examines women's accounts of their experiences in abusive relationships by looking at common themes across these studies.
