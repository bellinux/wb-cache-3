40|$|U radu se razmatraju pravna sredstva za pobijanje nevaljanih pravnih poslova. Prikazuje se razlika između pravnih poredaka u kojima se pobojne pravne poslove poništava sudskim putem u odnosu na one u kojima se pobijanje provodi jednostranim očitovanjem volje. Na temelju tog prikaza analizira se hrvatsko obvezno pravo, preciznije odredbe Zakona o obveznim odnosima, ali i drugih propisa koji uređuju pobijanje nevaljanih pravnih poslova. Također se upućuje na razliku prema pobijanju pravnih poslova koji su valjani, ali ih se pobija zbog oštećenja vjerovnika (tzv. paulijanske tužbe). Different {{legal systems}} solve {{problems}} <b>of</b> invalid <b>legal</b> <b>transactions</b> in different ways. Differences are particularly emphasized in respect <b>of</b> so-called avoidable <b>legal</b> <b>transactions.</b> In some <b>legal</b> systems <b>of</b> continental Europe such <b>legal</b> <b>transactions</b> are avoided {{on the basis}} of a unilateral declaration of will of one contracting parties. In the words <b>of</b> German <b>legal</b> terminology it is Gestaltungsrecht. On the other hand there are legal systems in which invalid <b>legal</b> <b>transactions</b> are avoided by a decision of the court. In such cases, if one party wants to avoid an invalid <b>legal</b> <b>transaction</b> it is necessary to initiate proceedings before a court. In Croatian law it is generally assumed that avoidance <b>of</b> invalid <b>legal</b> <b>transactions</b> occurs {{on the basis of}} a court decision. Thus, it is necessary to initiate proceedings to avoid such <b>legal</b> <b>transactions.</b> This approach is questionable for several reasons. Unlike the <b>legal</b> regime <b>of</b> fraudulent conveyance that explicitly provides that in order to avoid a <b>legal</b> <b>transaction</b> a lawsuit must be filed in court, the <b>legal</b> regime <b>of</b> invalid <b>legal</b> <b>transaction</b> is silent in this respect. Furthermore, avoidance <b>of</b> invalid <b>legal</b> <b>transactions</b> in its essence is much closer to idea of avoidance {{on the basis of a}} unilateral declaration of will. However, there are arguments in favour of the mainstream approach, meaning that avoidance must be conducted within proceedings before a court, such as for example grammatical interpretation of the law. Therefore, it would be helpful if law were to be amended in order to clear up this ambiguity in Croatian law. There was an opportunity to do this when the Croatian law of obligations was amended in 2006, and it is unfortunate that the opportunity was missed, because it is not very likely that another one will rise in the near future...|$|R

40|$|The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Slovenia {{has found}} that the {{unregulated}} state in the land-register of the land on which classified roads had been constructed was brought about by the ineffective implementation of land acquisition procedures. Such encroachment upon constitutionally guaranteed property rights shall be treated as expropriation, and the expropriation obligor shall in general be entitled to a refund or compensation in kind for the expropriated real estate. In the particular case dealt with herein, concerning real estate compensation, the provisions of the Spatial Planning Act (ZUreP- 1) shall apply, according to which the compensation shall amount to a real estate value which is to be determined by taking into account the actual use of the real estate in question as well as the extra expenses incurred through expropriation. It has been shown that, taking into account the International Agreement and the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia, the value of this particular real estate may be represented by its market value only. Concerning this particular case of real estate compensation, this paper analyses in detail all the elements of compensation, in particular, the decreased value of the remaining land.

40|$|In “Le droit de Rêver” Jan Sanders {{discusses}} the {{important elements of}} the concurrent regulation. He explaines that the regulation, {{as set out in}} the Law on the Taxation <b>of</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Transaction,</b> is condemned to the explanation and interpretation of concepts and provisions of an entirely differently characterised and structured Law on Turnover Taxes 1968 and that, on many points, the connection with the VAT provision is missed. The factors underpinning the application of the concurrent regulation become further divergent and are long unworkable. It appears from the research that certain friction exists when implementing the regulation. Such friction is not removed or resolved by the issuance of policy decisions by the responsible minister that, pour besoin de la cause, is richly blessed with acceptance. When one goes on in the same unworkable and limited vein, the regulation becomes unnecessarily complicated and eventually impracticable. This is accelerated by European case law in disputes concerning the imposition of transfer tax that are decided by an explanation of VAT. The pursuit of this already beaten path is inefficient and unproductive. Sanders demonstrates that this must change. The changes must be sought in the removal of the mandatory references in the Law on Taxation <b>of</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Transactions</b> to concepts or provisions in the Law on Turnover Taxes 1968. A better legislative basis must be created for the application of the exemption as intended by the legislator. This can be done in a relatively simple manner. At a time in which politicians are concerned with the thinning out or simplification of regulations, words should be followed by action. I have set out and substantiated the approach. It is now up to the legislator to pick this up...|$|R

40|$|According to Family and Guardianship Code (F. G. C.), {{adoption}} is realized {{by means of}} guardianship count decision on demand of am adopter. Unless it is otherwise provided by law, consent of specified persons is indispensable for adoption i. e. : consent of an adoptee when he turned thirteen, consent of his parents, of a guardian or an adopter's spouse if both spouses are not adopting jointly. The consent of 'the said persons as an element of adoption's effectuation {{is characterized by the}} fact that it is not creating the relationship of adoption but consists one of the premises of admissibility of deciding adoption by court. There are numerous question open to discussion related to the consent to adoption as a material premise of an adoption decision. One of those of a general impact for the whole institution of consent to adoption as well as related to the consent's positioning in a construction of adoption's realization is discussed in the article. It is a question <b>of</b> establishing <b>legal</b> character <b>of</b> a declaration of consent to adoption. That issue has not yet been satisfactirily clarified in the doctrine and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Particularly, the commonly adopted treatment of the consent as a declaration <b>of</b> will (<b>legal</b> (<b>transaction)</b> in the understanding of Civil Code (C. C.) must raiseobjections. That view can be /traced to a psychological concept of declaration of will according to which the declaration of will means as much as manifesting an intention to cause legal consequences. The reason for doubts lies in the nature of;legal transaction an indispensable element of which is a declaration of will; the fürst is considered to be a (particular element of civil daw system provided for the legal subjects to form independently binding legal relations. Whereas no results turning into a change <b>of</b> previous <b>legal</b> situation <b>of</b> -the subjects are observed with making a statement of consent to adoption. Consequently it can be advocated that the institution <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>transaction</b> (declaration <b>of</b> will) is not applicable in the system of adoption instituted judicially and admitted by F. G. C, for the reason of inadequacy of its function to the statutorily set role of a declaration of consent to adoption. The appraisal of a declaration of consent in the light of the newer concept of declaration of will as a normative statement instituting an individual norm of behavior is positively speaiking against considering the consent to adoption to be a declaration of will. Referring to the theory of conventional acts, which generated the aforementioned concept, it can be maintained that a sense of declaration of consent to adoption as a conventional act <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> consequence consists entirely in creating a situation in which a formerly laid down norm becomes applicable ana duties of court in a shape of an adequate reaction to that act would actualize thenselves. The results of study of the C. C. regulation <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>transactions</b> to solve quétions related to consent to adoption prove that it is of little avail what is ia ::onsequence speaking for differentiating consent to adoption from <b>legal</b> <b>transactions.</b> The article focuses on such controvertible questions as application of C. C. provisions to the consent to adoption i. e. defects in a declaration of will, consent of -the third party, statutory representation. It can be inferred that, irrespective of its features, a déclaration of consent to adoption evades the C. C. regulation <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>transactions.</b> The authoress advocates that upon a legai qualification of declarations of consent to adoption, one ought to refer to a type of acts in the family law, already distinguished in the doctrine and based on general premises of family law. (Particular features of family relations are taken account of in those acts as. veil as a specific regulation of acts concerning those relations including consent to adoption and departing from the civil law constructions can find its explanation there.
