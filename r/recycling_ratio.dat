In this paper, we explore the spatiotemporal links between the recycling mechanism and the Iberian rainfall regime. We use a 9 km resolution Weather Research and Forecasting simulation of 18 years (1990 - 2007) to compute local and regional <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios</b> over Iberia, at the monthly scale, through both an analytical and a numerical recycling model. In contrast to coastal areas, the interior of Iberia experiences a relative maximum of precipitation in spring, suggesting a prominent role of land-atmosphere interactions on the inland precipitation regime during this period of the year. Local <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios</b> are the highest in spring and early summer, coinciding with those areas where this spring peak of rainfall represents the absolute maximum in the annual cycle. This confirms that recycling processes are crucial to explain the Iberian spring precipitation, particularly over the eastern and northeastern sectors. Average monthly recycling values range from 0. 04 in December to 0. 14 in June according to the numerical model and from 0. 03 in December to 0. 07 in May according to the analytical procedure. Our analysis shows that the highest values of recycling are limited by the coexistence of two necessary mechanisms: (1) the availability of sufficient soil moisture and (2) the occurrence of appropriate synoptic configurations favoring the development of convective regimes. The analyzed surplus of rainfall in spring has a critical impact on agriculture over large semiarid regions of the interior of Iberia...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of {{wet and dry}} growing seasons in water-limited regions remains poorly understood, {{partly due to the}} complex role that these regions play in the genesis of their own rainfall. This limits the predictability of global carbon and water budgets, and hinders the regional management of natural resources. Using novel satellite observations and atmospheric trajectory modelling, we unravel the origin and immediate drivers of growing-season precipitation, {{and the extent to which}} ecoregions themselves contribute to their own supply of rainfall. Results show that persistent anomalies in growing-season precipitation - and subsequent biomass anomalies - are caused by a complex interplay of land and ocean evaporation, air circulation and local atmospheric stability changes. For regions such as the Kalahari and Australia, the volumes of moisture recycling decline in dry years, providing a positive feedback that intensifies dry conditions. However, <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios</b> increase up to 40 %, pointing to the crucial role of these regions in generating their own supply of rainfall; transpiration in periods of water stress allows vegetation to partly offset the decrease in regional precipitation.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to quantify {{the degree to which}} terrestrial evaporation supports the occurrence of precipitation within a certain study region (i. e. regional moisture recycling) due to the scale- and shape-dependence of regional moisture <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios.</b> In this paper we present a novel approach to quantify the spatial and temporal scale of moisture recycling, independent of {{the size and shape of}} the region under study. In contrast to previous studies, which essentially used curve fitting, the scaling laws presented by us follow directly from the process equation. thus allowing a fair comparison between regions and seasons. The calculation is based on ERA-Interim reanalysis data for the period 1999 to 2008. It is shown that in the tropics or in mountainous terrain the length scale of recycling can be as low as 500 to 2000 km. In temperate climates the length scale is typically between 3000 to 5000 km whereas it amounts to more than 7000 km in desert areas. The time scale of recycling ranges from 3 to 20 days, with the exception of deserts, where it is much longer. The most distinct seasonal differences can be observed over the Northern Hemisphere: in winter, moisture recycling is insignificant, whereas in summer it plays a major role in the climate.

In the past, most research focused on moisture recycling within a certain region only.

Global maps are presented identifying regions that rely heavily on recycled moisture as well as those that are supplying the moisture. An accounting procedure based on ERA?Interim reanalysis data is used to calculate moisture <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios.</b> It is computed that, on average, 40 % of the terrestrial precipitation originates from land evaporation and that 57 % of all terrestrial evaporation returns as precipitation over land.

All RCMs produced positive precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P âˆ’ E 3 Ì†e 0), though most RCMs produced P âˆ’ Ebelow the observed range. RCM <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios</b> were within the range estimated from observations. No evidence of common errors of E was found. In contrast, common dry bias of P was found in the simulations. Daily cycles of terms in the water vapor conservation equation were qualitatively similar in most RCMs. Nocturnal maximums of P and C (convergence) occurred in 9 of 13 RCMs, consistent with observations. Three of the four driest simulations failed to couple P and C overnight, producing afternoon maximum P. Further, dry simulations tended to produce a larger fraction of their 60 -day accumulated precipitation from low 3 -h totals. In station reports, accumulation from high (low) 3 -h totals had a nocturnal (early morning) maximum. This time lag occurred, in part, because many mesoscale convective systems had reached peak intensity overnight and had declined in intensity by early morning. None of the RCMs contained such a time lag.

The contribution of local evaporation {{in a region}} to the precipitation in the same region is defined as "precipitation recycling. " Precipitation recycling helps in defining the role of land-atmosphere interactions in regional climate. A dynamic precipitation recycling model, which includes the moisture storage term, {{has been applied to}} calculate summer variability of the precipitation recycling over Europe based on 40 -yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) data. Time series for three subregions in Europe (central Europe, the Balkans, and Spain) are obtained to analyze the variability in recycling and to compare the potential in the subregions for interactions between land surface and atmospheric processes. In addition, the recycled precipitation and <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios</b> are linked to several components of the water vapor balance equation [precipitation, evaporation, precipitation minus evaporation (P - E), and moisture transport]. It is found that precipitation recycling is large in dry summers for central Europe, while the opposite is true for the Balkans. Large precipitation recycling is determined in relation with weak moisture transport and high evaporation rates in central Europe. This occurs for dry summers. For the Balkans, precipitation recycling is large in wet summers when moisture transport is weak, and P - E and evaporation are large. Here, the recycling process intensifies the hydrological cycle due to a positive feedback via convective precipitation and therefore the amount of recycled precipitation is larger. For Spain, recycling is also larger when moisture transport is weak, but other correlations are not found.

For example, what {{is the impact of}} irrigated agriculture on downwind rainfall? Global-scale models show that moisture recycling is an important source of water for inland regions around the world, but they do not resolve land surface characteristics that may affect <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios.</b> Observational studies at the local scale report both increased and decreased rainfall likelihood as a result of deforestation. I present a Lagrangian framework based on biophysical land - atmosphere interactions to estimate the influence of land cover on the spatial and temporal scale of rainfall recycling. My results demonstrate that convective rainfall conditions occur more frequently over coniferous forests and irrigated crops relative to bare soils and mixed-use land cover. The increased likelihood of rainfall over vegetated surfaces is caused by the response of the atmospheric boundary layer to high water vapor fluxes from evapotranspiration and the partitioning of available energy at the ground surface. The presence of vegetation causes large variability in rainfall likelihood, but free atmosphere conditions are found to be the primary controls on rainfall initiation. Multi-day model simulations suggest that an initially dry atmosphere will experience rainfall recycling along a Lagrangian trajectory every 2 to 3 days over a completely vegetated surface and every 12 days over bare soils. Application of my model focused on the lower Columbia Basin because it is a major source region of continental evaporation and has a history of dramatic change in land use. The increased rainfall trends observed over the 20 th century in the lower Columbia Basin cannot be significantly associated with land use changes, but modeled estimates suggest an increase in rainfall likelihood of less than 9 % from the change in land cover this region has experienced. The results of this simple physically-based model can be used to quantify the effects of land cover on moisture recycling to better understand processes influencing rainfall patterns at regional scales...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} key conditions for successful industrial implementation of collective extended producer responsibility (EPR) programmes in the Norwegian plastic packaging system, according to an industrial ecology perspective. â€˜Key conditionâ€™ is defined as those factors, both drivers and barriers, which are critical for the outcome of industrial implementation of EPR. As we have seen there are several key conditions to be identified. We have studied this by first developing a theoretical framework based on the industrial ecology perspective and combined with a modified understanding on categories for EPR policy instruments we have developed an analytical framework which combines a material flow approach and an actor approach. Based on this we have carried out {{a case study of}} the Norwegian EPR system for plastic packaging, organised by the producer responsibility organisation Plastretur. We have shown the complexity of this system by doing analysis on various levels, both with respect to material flows and to actors. Our conclusions are primarily valid for this system only, but we have shown how our results correspond to existing literature, both theoretically and in practice. The overall conclusion from this case study is that the Plastretur EPR scheme has proven to be successful with respect to <b>recycling</b> <b>ratios</b> and costs, while it has been less successful concerning dematerialisation and design for recycling. This conclusion is contrary to what is considered to be the strength of EPR policies, but it provides empirical evidence for the arguments put forth by for instance Veerman (2004) on the Dutch system, claiming that EPR has mainly effects downstream. We argue {{that one of the reasons}} to this controversial result is that previous studies have not to a sufficient extent taken into account the need for identifying the causality between EPR policy instruments and the observed effects.

However, land surface processes also have {{a significant role in}} the generation of precipitation within the Indian subcontinent. Evapotranspiration over a region supplies moisture to the atmosphere, which may lead to precipitation in the same region. This is known as recycled precipitation. The role of evapotranspiration as an additional source of moisture to precipitation has been investigated in earlier studies at continental scales; however, the amount of monsoon precipitation generated from evapotranspiration has not been quantified at the daily scale for the Indian subcontinent. To examine the role of land surface hydrology in regional precipitation and to quantify recycled precipitation, the dynamic recycling model at a daily scale with NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data for the period of 1980 - 2010 is used.

40|$|Analysis of {{precipitation}} recycling {{can improve the}} understanding of regional hydrologic anomalies, especially their evolution and maintenance. Diagnostic models of the recycling {{of precipitation}} and are applied to 15 years of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Data Assimilation System (DAS). Recycled precipitation {{is defined as the}} fraction of precipitation within a given region that originated as surface evaporation from the same region. The focus of the present work is on the interannual variability of the central United States hydrologic cycle and precipitation recycling. The extreme years of 1988 (drought) and 1993 (flood) are compared with the 15 year base period mean annual cycle. The results indicate that <b>recycling</b> <b>ratio</b> (the amount of precipitation with a local source relative to the total precipitation) is greater in 1988 than both the base period mean and the 1993 season (with 1993 <b>recycling</b> <b>ratio</b> less than the mean). On the other hand, both the summers of 1988 and 1993 show less total recycled precipitation than the mean. The results also show that precipitation recycling may have been more important in the spring of 1993, when the region was primed for flooding, than the summer, when the sever flooding occurred. The diagnostic approaches to precipitation recycling suffer from some weaknesses. Numerical simulations and assimilation using passive tracers have the potential to provide more accurate calculations of precipitation recycling and the remote sources of water. This ability is being incorporated into the latest GEOS data assimilation system, and some preliminary results will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the use of}} kerbside {{recycling}} facilities by householders {{is often}} key to the reduction of materials disposed of to landfill, the quantitative assessment of householders' recycling behaviour is problematic. This study introduces a method to diagnose recycling behaviour by assessing kerbside scheme use {{in terms of the}} set-out of recyclate containers compared to the proportion of households participating in <b>recycling</b> (participation <b>ratio).</b> Application of numerical behaviour models demonstrated that kerbside recycling in sampled regions of the UK tends to be consistent with householders using kerbside schemes more frequently than would be observed with random patterns of use that are uniform amongst all householders. When aggregated to collection rounds, householders' modal recycling behaviour tended towards either non-participation or frequent participation. We propose that initiatives to enhance kerbside recycling should employ such quantitative assessments of recycling behavioural modes to inform and guide promotional and educational strategies. A conceptual model for prioritizing campaigns to promote recycling at the kerbside on the basis of identifiable and quantifiable patterns of householder recycling behaviour is presented...|$|R
40|$|ProducciÃ³n CientÃ­ficaThe {{bioconversion}} of biogas to biomethane {{coupled to}} centrate treatment was evaluated in an outdoors pilot scale high rate algal pond interconnected to an external CO 2 -H 2 S absorption column (AC) via settled broth recirculation. CO 2 -removal efficiencies ranged from 50 to 95 % {{depending on the}} alkalinity of the cultivation broth and environmental conditions, while a complete H 2 S removal was achieved regardless of the operational conditions. A maximum CH 4 concentration of 94 % with a limited O 2 and N 2 stripping was recorded in the upgraded biogas at <b>recycling</b> liquid/biogas <b>ratios</b> in the AC of 1 and 2. Process operation at a constant biomass productivity of 15 g mâˆ’ 2 dâˆ’ 1 and the minimization of effluent generation supported high carbon and nutrient recoveries in the harvested biomass (C = 66 Â± 8 %, N = 54 Â± 18 %, P â‰ˆ 100 % and S = 16 Â± 3 %). Finally, a low diversity {{in the structure of}} the microalgae population was promoted by the environmental and operational conditions imposed.

40|$|Mass balance relations, {{valid for}} any {{counterflow}} system, are derived {{and applied to}} a central core model of the renal medulla, in which descending Henle's limbs (DHL), ascending Henle's limbs (AHL), and collecting ducts (CD) exchange with a central vascular core (VC) formed by vasa recta loops, assumed so highly permeable that the core functions as a single tube open at the cortical end, closed at the papillary. Solute supplied to the VC primarily by the water impermeable AHL may either enter the DHL to be recycled or remain in the core to extract water by osmosis from DHL and CD. If concentrations in core and descending flows are nearly equal, then for all degrees of <b>recycling</b> the <b>ratio</b> of entering DHL concentration to loop concentration is given by r = 1 /[1 - fT(1 - fU) ], where fT is the fractional net solute transport out of AHL and fU is the ratio of CD flow to the sum of CD and AHL flows. Differential equations for a single solute are derived for core and AHL concentrations. Explicit analytic solutions are given for solute transport out of the AHL governed by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Finally the energy requirements for concentration are analyzed...|$|R
