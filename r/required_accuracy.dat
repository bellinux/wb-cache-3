25|$|In theory, the {{coefficients}} of the characteristic polynomial can be computed exactly, {{since they are}} sums of products of matrix elements; and there are algorithms that can find all the roots of a polynomial of arbitrary degree to any <b>required</b> <b>accuracy.</b> However, this approach is not viable in practice because {{the coefficients}} would be contaminated by unavoidable round-off errors, and the roots of a polynomial can be an extremely sensitive function of the coefficients (as exemplified by Wilkinson's polynomial).|$|E
25|$|MIPS IV added {{several new}} FP {{arithmetic}} instructions for both single- and double-precision FPNs: fused-multiply add or subtract, reciprocal, and reciprocal square-root. The FP fused-multiply add or subtract instructions perform either {{one or two}} roundings (it is implementation-defined), to exceed or meet IEEE 754 accuracy requirements (respectively). The FP reciprocal and reciprocal square-root instructions do not comply with IEEE 754 accuracy requirements, and produce results that differ from the <b>required</b> <b>accuracy</b> by one or two units of last place (it is implementation defined). These instructions serve applications where instruction latency {{is more important than}} accuracy.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, the {{underlying}} idea of Bruns has not proved viable (there were needs for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, which—as Julius Bauschinger could {{show a little}} later—in principle can not be obtained with the <b>required</b> <b>accuracy).</b> On the other hand, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (weather balloon ascents) has since made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between PhD and habilitation Hausdorff completed the yearlong-volunteer military requirement and worked for two years as a human computer at the observatory in Leipzig.|$|E
25|$|The diagram {{depicts the}} {{internal}} mechanism of a residual-current device (RCD). The device {{is designed to}} be wired in-line in an appliance power cord. It is rated to carry a maximal current of 13 A and is designed to trip on a leakage current of 30 mA. This is an active RCD; that is, it latches electrically and therefore trips on power failure, a useful feature for equipment that could be dangerous on unexpected re-energisation. Some early RCDs were entirely electromechanical and relied on finely balanced sprung over-centre mechanisms driven directly from the current transformer. As these are hard to manufacture to the <b>required</b> <b>accuracy</b> and prone to drift in sensitivity both from pivot wear and lubricant dry-out, the electronically amplified type with a more robust solenoid part as illustrated are now dominant.|$|E
25|$|An informal, {{heuristic}} {{meaning of}} the principle is the following: A state that only exists {{for a short time}} cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the <b>required</b> <b>accuracy.</b> For example, in spectroscopy, excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, {{they do not have a}} definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the natural linewidth. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow decaying states have a narrow linewidth.|$|E

25|$|BMP-3F – Specially {{designed}} for operations at sea, with improved seaworthiness and buoyancy, capability to move afloat at sea state 3 and fire with the <b>required</b> <b>accuracy</b> at sea state 2. Compared {{to the basic}} model, the vehicle design features changes increasing floatability and vehicle stability: the self-entrenching equipment is omitted, a lightweight anti-surge vane and an air intake tube are introduced; the BMP-3F turret is also protected by anti-surge vanes. Water jet propellers develop a speed of 10km/h when afloat. The BMP-3F design allows the vehicle to come ashore under rough sea conditions and to tow the same-type vehicle. A new main sight, the SOZH, which has an integrated laser range finder and an ATGM guidance channel, is installed. This version can endure continuous amphibious operation for seven hours with the running engine.|$|E

500|$|Once {{adopted as}} doctrine, {{industrial}} web theory had {{a host of}} effects. To obtain the <b>required</b> <b>accuracy</b> to hit pinpoint targets, bombing {{had to be done}} by daylight. An improved bombsight was required: the Norden bombsight Mark XV, appearing in 1931. Since a pursuit plane did not have the range to accompany the bombers, they {{had to be able to}} defend themselves, and new tactics called for formation flying to maximize the defense against hostile pursuit aircraft. The requirement for a better bomber led to the development of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. [...] Wilson accepted the argument, most forcibly advanced by fellow instructor Kenneth Walker, that fighter aircraft did not have the range or speed to accompany bombers and probably could not shoot them down.|$|E

500|$|The medium {{half-life}} of 227Ac (21.77 years) {{makes it}} very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the <b>required</b> <b>accuracy</b> by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed 235U. Its decay product, 231Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. 231Pa decays to 227Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the 231Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional 227Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both 231Pa and 227Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.Ac in deep ocean water |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=486–488 |date=1984 |doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N}} ...|$|E

Today atomic clocks and relativistic corrections are used in GPS and it is said GPS could not function without them.|$|E
