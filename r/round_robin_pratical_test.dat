40|$|Abstract — <b>Round</b> <b>robin</b> based packet schedulers {{generally}} {{have a low}} complexity and provide long-term fairness.

F RR has similar complexity and longterm fairness properties as the stratified <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> scheduler, a recently proposed scheme that arguably provides the best quality-of-service properties among all existing <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> based low complexity packet schedulers.

40|$|Abstract: Cloud {{computing}} enables {{developers to}} automatically deploy applications during task allocation and storage distribution by using distributed computing technologies in numerous servers. To gain the maximum benefit from cloud computing, developers must design mechanisms that optimize {{the use of}} architectural and deployment paradigms. The role of Virtual Machine’s (VMs) has emerged as an important issue because, through virtualization technology, it makes cloud computing infrastructures to be scalable. Therefore developing on optimal scheduling of virtual machines is an important issue. In this paper a analysis of different existing Virtual Machine’s (VM’s) scheduling algorithms are done and proposed a weighted <b>Round</b> <b>Robin</b> algorithm over <b>Round</b> <b>Robin</b> algorithm in Virtual Machine environment of cloud computing {{in order to achieve}} better overall response time and processing time. The simulation results show the weighted <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> algorithm shows better improvements over Round-Robin algorithm. Then Comparison between <b>Round</b> <b>Robin</b> and Weighted <b>Round</b> <b>Robin</b> algorithm shows there is a improvement in Weighted <b>Round</b> <b>Robin</b> algorithm.
