40|$|This report discuss {{about the}} design and {{development}} of mountain bike <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> for all-mountain riding style. The objective {{of this study is}} to design and develop a proper geometry of <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system for mountain bike, and to study the motion mechanisms of <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system. This study deals with the path analysis (PA) of a wheel axle and pivot position determination for the crank set of mountain bike. The results show that the new developed <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> base on Monolink type have a suitable frame geometry that give a great horizontal and vertical travel for improvement of pedalling efficiency. In addition the crank set position for the Monolink <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> also helping for a smooth ride resulting from the less chain growth and chainstay lengthening. These research uses AutoCAD, Autodesk Sketch Pro and SolidWork to design and analyze the path analysis in terms of displacement of “x” and “y” axis of the developed <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> The results are compared between another several types of <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|M151 (1960) - Initial version. Because of its <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> design {{it had a}} {{dangerous}} tendency to flip over when cornered too aggressively by unaware drivers. The coil spring and swing-axle <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> lay-out (similar to the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> of the early-model Chevrolet Corvair) could result in large rear wheel camber changes, causing drastic oversteer and a subsequent roll-over.|$|R
50|$|Replacing the Milemaster was the 122 cc Imp which sacrificed <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{for light}} weight. However, the later, larger 197 cc Imp Supreme adopted {{conventional}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only the modular six-cylinder engines were {{available}} from model year 1995 on. The front suspension was redesigned to more closely match {{that of the}} 850. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> received a completely redesigned multi-link independent system with a single fibreglass transverse leaf spring. The 1995 estate received independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Volvo reported that the single composite leaf spring used in the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> of the 960 estate had the same mass as {{just one of the}} two springs it replaced. Boge's Nivomat self-levelling <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system became an option rather than standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} must {{be either}} Volkswagen Type 1, 181 ball joint or link pin only. <b>Rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is based on}} Volkswagen Type 1 independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> or swing axle.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> is {{independent}} using conventional springs, with good wheel geometry control and a limited-slip differential. It {{is noteworthy that}} the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> geometry can be finely tuned.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the third}} generation, Ford {{installed}} fully independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> in the 5-door Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer - {{but not in}} the 3-door Sport model. This replaced the non-independent [...] "live axle" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> used in previous model year Explorers. With a fully independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> each <b>rear</b> wheel connects to the rear differential via a half-shaft drive axle. This design offers increased ride comfort, on-road handling, and vehicle stability. Other vehicles have used this setup on both rear and four-wheel drive vehicles for many years. For example, the Hummer H1 and the Mercedes-Benz ML-Class use independent front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> One reason for Fords switch to independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> in the Explorer was due to the well-publicized vehicle rollovers and resulting fatalities that occurred with the previous generations of Ford Explorer. All of the Explorers involved in the rollovers had non-independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> and most of the vehicles had Firestone tires which Ford judged to be defective (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Front {{suspension}} {{is based}} on Volkswagen type 1 link pin style. [...] <b>Rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is based on}} VW Type 1 independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> arms may be lengthened up to 1 inch. Stock track width as measured, wheel mating surface to wheel mating surface must be maintained. No secondary suspension is allowed. Additional modifications are allowed with limitations. No air or coiler shocks allowed.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{supports}} the swingarm, which is attached via the swingarm pivot bolt {{to the frame}} and holds the axle of the rear wheel. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> can consist of several shock arrangements: ...|$|R
50|$|Bikes with a 'floating drivetrain' or 'floating bottom bracket' can use {{any type}} of {{suspension}} system to suspend the rear wheel from the frame, but use linkages to connect the crank assembly to the frame and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Since the linkages {{are connected to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> suspension movement causes the crank assembly to move as well. The floating drivetrain is often employed to compensate for the disadvantages of a particular <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system so the design can make better use of its advantages.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts and the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> is independent semi-trailing arms. In 1982, the front suspension was upgraded to include twin-pivot lower control {{arms and the}} geometry of the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> was revised.|$|R
50|$|Coilover shock {{absorbers}} are usually {{a kind of}} twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring. They are common on motorcycle and scooter <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> and widely used on front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> in cars.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Looking {{at various}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{configuration}}s, design a <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> configuration {{to replace the}} factory Ford Escort Hotchkiss style <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> with a design that will allow for ideal suspension geometry {{to be kept in}} check throughout variances in ride and roll as well as allowing for adjustability to allow the suspension to be tuned for certain track conditions as well as being capable of working in with different vehicle settings as a whole...|$|R
50|$|Plunger <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{was offered}} later, with a {{swingarm}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> frame available from 1954. The model continued in production until 1959, {{by which time}} the traditional Lucas magdyno {{had been replaced by}} an alternator and coil ignition.|$|R
5000|$|Back-halved - a bodied drag {{racing car}} {{that has had}} its stock <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> removed and {{replaced}} with a four-link or ladder bar <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> and narrowed <b>rear</b> axle. This arrangement allows for larger tires and better adjustability.|$|R
25|$|All {{cars are}} {{required}} to use a double wishbone setup for the front <b>suspension</b> and independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Both the front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> systems feature adjustable shock absorbers and an anti-roll bar which can be adjusted from the cockpit.|$|R
2500|$|The Mustang has a MacPherson-strut front {{suspension}} with reverse [...] "L" [...] {{lower control}} arms. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{was a new}} three-link system with a Panhard Rod that controls the vertical and lateral movements of the axle. This live axle <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> while sacrificing handling, provides the benefits of reduced cost and weight over heavier, more expensive independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions.</b> In spite of this, Ford has drawn heavy criticism from the automotive journalism community for the decision to equip the 5th generation Mustang with the live axle system. At a press conference, Ford stated that to include an independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> would have added $5,000 to the showroom price of the car.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s some further prototypes were built, like a four-cylinder with a {{rotary valve}} and carbon seals {{as well as}} a {{two-cylinder}} model with <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> neither of which reached production. Several prototypes with <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> and an Earles front fork were also built.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "softail" [...] is a {{registered}} trademark of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, coined {{with the release of}} the FXST Softail in 1984. Since then, the word has expanded to include other motorcycles with hidden <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> as well as bicycles incorporating a <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
50|$|Obviously any four wheel vehicle needs {{suspension}} {{for both the}} front wheels and the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> but in two wheel drive vehicles these can be very different configuration. For front-wheel drive cars, <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> has few constraints {{and a variety of}} beam axles and independent suspensions are used. For rear-wheel drive cars, <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> has many constraints and the development of the superior but more expensive independent suspension layout has been difficult. Four-wheel drive often have suspensions that are similar for both the front and rear wheels.|$|R

50|$|The Weissach axle (pronounced 'Vise-' as in 'advise' and '-ach' with {{guttural}} 'ch') is {{a special}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> arrangement devised for the Porsche 928. The goal of the Weissach axle was to eliminate lift-throttle oversteer by allowing the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> to adjust itself during cornering maneuvers.|$|R
5000|$|M151A1 (1964) - Second version: {{minor changes}} in the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> mostly aimed at {{allowing}} the vehicle to carry heavier loads. Addition of turn signals to front fenders. The essentials of the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> remained unchanged and {{the same applies to}} the handling problems in corners.|$|R

50|$|The {{platform}} {{features a}} torsion beam <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> with optional Watt's link which improves vehicle handling; such configuration {{is used in}} the Opel Astra and some trim-levels of the American-market Chevrolet Cruze.This suspension is usually described as semi-independent, meaning that the two wheels can move relative to each other, but their motion is still somewhat inter-linked, {{to a greater extent than}} in a true independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> (IRS). This can mildly compromise the handling and ride quality of the vehicle. For this reason, some manufacturers have changed to different linkage designs. As an example, Volkswagen dropped the torsion beam in favour of a true IRS for the Volkswagen Golf Mk5, possibly in response to the Ford Focus' Control Blade <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Opel/Vauxhall have continued to use twist or torsion beam suspension. This is at a cost saving of €100 per car compared to multi-link <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Their latest version as used in the 2009-on Opel Astra uses a Watts linkage at a cost of €20 to address the drawbacks and provide a competitive and cost effective <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> The Renault Megane and Citroen C4 also have stayed with the twist beam. The twist beam has been shown to suffer less from bush wear, than fully independent multi-link suspension, thus resulting in a virtually maintenance free <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
