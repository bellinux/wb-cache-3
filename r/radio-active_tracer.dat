It is postulated that intermittent claudication per se is not an indication for sympathectomy although the operation may {{have a place in}} the treatment of early nutritional disturbances in the ischaemic leg. The object {{of this paper is to}} present the results of an objective study on a series of patients, all complaining of intermittent claudication who were assessed both clinically and objectively using a <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracer</b> technique before and after they had undergone lumbar sympathectomypeer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{studying}} {{the mode of}} action of a drug it is desirable to know the components of its kinetics of action which can {{be accounted for by}} diffusion. The problem has been approached experimentally from two quite different standpoints. Either the pharmacological action of the drug may be used to estimate its concentration around the receptors and hence the diffusion gradient, or the drug may be labeled with a suitable <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracer</b> so that its movements may be followed directly. The diffusion studies on the action of curare by Holmes et a!. (1951) and on epinel) hrine by Bevan (1960) are examples of the first method while the work described in thc l) resent paper {{is an example of the}} second...|$|E
40|$|The ion {{exchange}} resin Amberlite IRA- 400 in iodide and bromide form where equilibrated separately with the respective labeled iodide and bromide ion solution of different concen-trations varying from 0. 005 M to 0. 100 M in the temperature range of 32. 0 ºC to 48. 0 ºC. The dis-tribution coefficient Kd values calculated for iodide and bromide {{ion exchange}} increases with rise in ionic concentration of the external solution, however with rise in temperature the Kd values calculated where found to decrease. Also the Kd values calculated where higher for iodide exchange than bromide exchange. Among the different alternative techniques available for obtaining the Kd values, the <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracer</b> technique {{used in the present}} ex-perimental work offers high detection sensitivity. It is expected that the distribution coefficient data obtained from such experimental work will significant in environmental impact assessment on the disposal of radioactive waste...|$|E
40|$|Methods and Results It is {{important}} to distinguish between global, regional and transmural blood flow measurements. The advantages and limitations of the fol-lowing methods are discussed: diVusible inert and <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracers,</b> dye dilution, roentgendensitometry, magnetic coronary angioplasty and beta-irradiation of coronary re-stenosis, established under the author’s guidance, are put into perspective. The author pays tribute to many excellent colleagues {{who worked with him}} at the Zurich and Geneva University Hospitals. resonance imaging and contrast echocardiography. In inter-ventional cardiology it is most important to be able to measure flow through single coronary vessels. Information on coronary artery Doppler velocity during vasodilation and at rest is less useful than the concept of fractional flow reserve. This is based on pressure measurements under maximal vasodilation to ascertain the presence of border...|$|R
40|$|Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) causes {{damage to}} plants {{when they are}} feeding. Also, this thrips species transmits Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) during stylet penetration. We {{investigated}} the penetration behaviour (probing) of thrips on pepper leaves and on liquid diet by electrical penetration graph (EPG, DC-system) recording. In addition, we used high-magnification video observations to correlate EPG waveforms with the insect's posture, head movements, and muscle contractions. Also, EPGs were correlated with probing on liquid diets containing <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracers</b> to distinguish and quantify ingestion waveforms. The previously described waveforms P, Q, and R were distinguished and additionally, a new waveform 'S' was distinguished. Waveform P could be linked with mandibular leaf penetration, waveform Q presumably with insertion of the maxillary stylets, and waveform R with ingestion of cell contents, whereas waveform S could not be correlated with any behavioural activity. Histology of the feeding damage in pepper leaves shows that thrips ingests the contents of multiple cells per probe. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for the measurement of both the magnitude and the direction of ground-water flow under some natural gradient. These have the advantage that in spite of being single well techniques; {{it is not necessary to}} <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracers</b> for direction measurements. Consequently no health hazards, no costly equipment and, therefore, no foreign exchange component is involved in their operation. Both these component is involved I n their operation. Both these techniques have been published in the international journal of repute viz: journal of hydrology (Netherlands) in its different issues (see references). In the first technique, the ground-water flow has been considered as a vector quantity, consequently by introducing another vector quantity, of known magnitude and direction, both the direction as well as the magnitude of the un-known vector quantity can be easily determined. The new known vector quantity, in ground-water hydrology, can be introduced by installing a small pumped well in the vicinity of an observation well (hence forth called master well). All flow measurements are carried out in this master well when the tubewell is in operation and when it is not in operation. A non radio-active solution of potassium bromide is injected in the master well at horizon where flow measurements are desired. Dilution of this tracer (potassium bromide) takes place due to the ground-water flow. The dilution rates are computed by measuring, at different time intervals, the electrical conductivities (reciprocal of resistances) by using a wheat-stone bridge arrangement energized with low voltage alternating current. Using the mathematical formulae developed in this thesis and the data so collected the magnitude of the ground-water flow can be easily determined. After this the tubewell is started at a discharge such that the velocity, due to pump age, introduced at the master well is in comparison to the velocity of the ground-water flow already measured. The magnitude of the resultant is again determined in the same master well in the some manner as for the case of ground-water flow in the absence of the tubewell. These observations help in determining the direction of the flow of ground-water. Instead of one discrete direction of flow, the mathematical formulae give four directions of flow. For further differentiation among these four directions, to get the true direction of flow, a simple experiment in also described. In the second technique, which strictly a single well technique, no additional tubewell is required. All flow measurements are carried out in the same observation well both for determining the magnitude as well as direction of flow and no <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracers</b> are needed. The observation well, this time, is specially prepared, over short lengths, at those horizons where flow measurements are required. The remaining length of the bore is quite identical with that used in the previous technique. Thus at the selected points, the well screen, instead of being uniformly perforated (slotted) all round, is such that it is slotted over 180 o while the remaining half is all blind. The dilution rates of the injected salt, if computed in this type of bore hole, are a function of the relative orientation of the slotted segment with respect to the direction flow which can, therefore, be easily determined. Apart from the measurement of magnitude and direction of flow, the formulas developed in this thesis have also practical side applications in determining (1) seepage losses from big irrigation channels and (2) the rate and amount of incrustation in tubewells at different horizons. Apart from these two applications, it is also possible to determine the permeability coefficient of a complicated strainer material like coir string (coco-nut fibre string). A strainer prepared with such a has a permeability which cannot ordinarily be determined. The reason being that apart from the fine slits of irregular widths between two consecutive string windings, the string in itself is porous, the measurement of these strainer permeabilities are necessary to determine the head loss through the strainer. This head loss has a great impact on the incrustation of the strainer. Both the formulae as well as the technique for determining these permeabilities are also described in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the {{experimental}} investigation of-such-diseases as tetanus, rabies, and anterior polio-myelitis has so frequently involved the intraneural injection of the specific infective agent that some-assessment of the potential spread of a small-volume of indifferent material is long overdue. *. The object of the present investigation {{was to determine the}} extent to which the intraneural injection of a crystalloid substance not exceeding. 0 * 05 ml. in volume may enter the blood stream, the cerebrospinal fluid, and various regions of the-nervous system. The choice of a <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracer</b> substance for this purpose was made not only because its detection is possible in very high-dilution but because the curves of its concentration in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid can be plotted;throughout the period of the experiment. The chief consideration determining the selection of P 32 (as phosphoric acid) for this work was the-fact that, provided the blood level does not exceed 750 to 800 counts/min. / 100 mg. (in the rabbit) -there is no appreciable concentration of the tracer-lement in the spinal fluid (Table I). Further,-within a survival period of two to two and a half hours there is no significant combination of the phosphorus with the lipoids and proteins of th...|$|E
40|$|A 56 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to the hospital be-cause of progressive paresis of the left arm. Clinical exam-ination revealed upper brachial plexus palsy and complete anesthesia and analgesia in segments C 5 – 7. MRI demon-strated diffuse tumorous infiltration of the left brachial plexus with centrifugal growth from the dorsal spinal root of segment C 6. Biopsy of the lesion revealed a malignant schwannoma and resection was performed. Two months postoperatively, tumor recurrence was suspected on MRI in the left axilla and the supraclavicular part of the bra-chial plexus. However, {{it was not possible to}} define the extent of tumor recurrence exactly owing to limitations of MRI in differentiating viable tumor from postoperative scar tissue. PET imaging, conversely, provides functional data for detection of viable tumor regions and is considered a sensitive tool in the diagnosis of schwannoma. 1 Accurate anatomic localization of focal tracer uptake is, however, difficult because of the reduced spatial information. 2 Therefore, we decided to perform dual-modality PET/CT imaging using [18 F]- 2 -fluoro- 2 -desoxy-D-glucose as a <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracer.</b> By combining function and anatomy, PET/CT was able to detect residual tumor in the dorsal roots of C 4 – 7 and to define different sites of viable tumor along the axis of resection extending to the proximal left arm (fig-ure). Based on the PET/CT data, operative exploration was extended into the spinal canal to obtain complete tumor resection...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of pigment dispersions containing {{high solid}} concentrations {{has been studied}} when the dispersions settled {{in such a manner}} that the classical Stokes' Law was inoperative. The sedimentation of the solid particles in such suspensions occurs with the movement of an interface, and this is termed "hindered settling" when above the interface is tne clear supernatant liquid and below the interface is the suspended solid. The properties of the suspensions were judged in terms of the interface's behaviour as a function of time. The observation of the interface's behaviour as a function of time, was used to determine the effect of adsorbed alKyd resin [a polyester) from xylene onto the surface of iron oxide, titanium dioxide and alpha copper phthalocyanine had on hindered settling parameters. The measurement of tne mass of polymer absorbed was undertaken by infrared spectroscopy and a <b>radio-active</b> <b>tracer</b> method. The work was concerned witn tne inorganic and organic pigments i,i the same bulk solution and provided information about eacn pigment in tne same solution. The hindered settling exneriments took place at specific points on each pigtrant's alkyd resin adsorption isotherm to provide an understanding of Darameters involved in sedimentation equations in chemical and physical terms. Complementary experimental techniques were necessary, microelectrophoresis, optical and scanning electron microscopy, which enabled a more concise understanding of changing parameters involved in hindered settling equations. This provided information on the effect of adsorbed alKyd resin on the stabilisation/destabilisation of the pigment particles. The experimental results indicated that the adsorbed alkyd resin stabilised iron oxide by an electrical double layer mechanism, the titanium dioxide by a ster...|$|E
