5000|$|The last title {{developed}} by Ratbag (prior to their acquisition) was The Dukes of Hazzard: Return of the General Lee for the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox. The [...] "Adventure/Racing" [...] title {{was the first}} Ratbag title to break <b>from</b> <b>the</b> simulation tradition set forth by previous titles and features simple [...] "on-foot" [...] gameplay in addition to various story-driven racing missions. Coming after a wave of similar mission-based driving games and with a rushed development, The Dukes of Hazzard: Return of the General Lee received a lukewarm <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gaming <b>press.</b>|$|R
5000|$|So {{the studio}} polled their {{audience}} {{to find out}} what kind of game they wanted to play, and found that fans wanted Abe's Oddysee redone like Stranger's Wrath. While the relationship between Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water was symbiotic, with JAW constantly running things by Oddworld Inhabitants via email conversations, Lanning told JAW to ask the audience for input in answering their questions about the game, because they are the ones that will be playing it. The more you engage them in the process, [...] "that feedback is going to be really, really valuable" [...] and when they see that you are genuinely listening, they feel like they are being heard and it creates [...] "deeper more passionate fan bases". Audiences also had an influence on choosing the next project after New 'n' Tasty! saying they wanted Exoddus redone in the same way, resulting in what will become Oddworld: Soulstorm in 2017, and the <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> release showed them that interest in the brand was still very much alive.|$|E
40|$|The University of Ghent {{plans to}} open a new science museum in 2019. Academic {{collections}} from various disciplines, currently scattered throughout the campus, will be centralized in a permanent exhibition on the nature of science. In her mission statement the Ghent University Museum focuses on a philosophical storyline, a metaphysic rather than a historical vision on science. The museological scenography will aim to engage the visitor through evoking ethical reflections on science and scientific practice. To test and fine-tune this approach, the museum is currently engaged in putting on temporary exhibitions. From the 15 th of October to the 20 th of December (2015) the “Post Mortem” exhibition ran in the library, laboratory and autopsy room of the department of Forensic Medicine, shortly after the department had moved. The show addressed the confrontation with the dead body through an art-science dialogue. The visitor was guided on a tour through a clinical setting juxtaposing medical, zoological, archeological and ethnographic collections alongside contemporary works of art. This created a stimulating platform that provoked numerous ethical questions such as “How and why does the scientist approach the dead body as a study object?”, “How can collections that result from medical research, be exhibited to the broad public without objectifying human remains?”. By including contemporary art, visitors became more aware and receptive to human aspects in those scientific disciplines that deal with the dead body. The show opened to a positive <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> attracting more than 5000 visitors over the course of 10 weekends...|$|E
25|$|Lowell's Collected Poems, {{edited by}} Frank Bidart and David Gewanter, was {{published}} in 2003. The Collected Poems was a very comprehensive volume that included all of Lowell's major works {{with the exception of}} Notebook 1967-1968 and Notebook. However, many of <b>the</b> poems <b>from</b> these volumes were republished, in revised forms, in History and For Lizzie and Harriet. Soon after the publication of The Collected Poems, The Letters of Robert Lowell, edited by Saskia Hamilton, {{was published in}} 2005. Both Lowell's Collected Poems and his Letters received positive critical <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mainstream <b>press.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Globe and Mail review from 1983 {{described}} Lechay {{as having}} [...] "an obvious antipathy to prettiness" [...] and of using dance [...] "as an art/act of aggression." [...] The reviewer further described Lechay's creative ambition as [...] "to balance dynamics of jabbing, flailing speed with concentration and attenuation; to look careless while in fact being meticulous; to be ever watchful {{and thus to}} fool the enemy." [...] A production from this period entitled Ice was given favourable reviews, although a subsequent work called Take Five received an ambivalent <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Montreal <b>press.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Škoda 120L {{was sold}} in Australia during the late 1970s and early 1980s though sales {{suffered}} from laws that limited numbers imported annually due to their being manufactured in Czechoslovakia which was a communist state. Despite this the 120L received a positive <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> motoring <b>press</b> who acknowledged it as offering good value for money. This was the last Škoda model sold in Australia until the 2007 launch of the Škoda Octavia and Škoda Roomster. It is estimated that approximately 20 Škoda 120L's survive in Australia.|$|R

The Bentley EXP 9 F's design proved to be controversial, and it received a mixed <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> automobile <b>press.</b> After some criticism {{for the design of}} the EXP 9 F, Bentley announced that it would change the styling for the production version of the SUV, the Bentayga.|$|R

[...] In North America, Variety described it as [...] "direct, uncomplicated and incredibly moving," [...] and the Montreal Gazette as a [...] "brave, handsomely mounted film." [...] At the BeyondHollywood website, British reviewer James Mudge called A Little Pond an [...] "admirable, if gruelling effort to bring more attention to a truly appalling incident. ... a sterling piece of work." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British <b>press</b> towards Blyk placed its {{emphasis}} on debating the potential effectiveness of mobile-based advertising, with concerns that it may prove intrusive {{in a similar manner}} to pop-ups on websites or spam email. The Guardian commented that [...] "advertisers will have {{to be careful not to}} annoy their new users with the mobile equivalent of spam", with Channel 4 stating that the fact that [...] "you have to suffer the ads" [...] was the network's downside. Tech Digest also noted that if advertisers don't embrace the interactivity offered by the network, they may have to resort to spam.|$|R

5000|$|Shockley {{conducted}} a widespread publicity campaign for Jensen's article, {{supported by the}} Pioneer Fund. Jensen's views became widely known in many spheres. As a result, there was renewed academic interest in the hereditarian viewpoint and in intelligence tests. Jensen's original article was widely circulated and often cited; the material was taught in university courses over a range of academic disciplines. In response to his critics, Jensen wrote a series of books on all aspects of psychometrics. There was also a widespread positive <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> popular <b>press</b> — with <b>The</b> New York Times Magazine dubbing the topic [...] "Jensenism" [...] — and amongst politicians and policy makers.|$|R
5000|$|But <b>response</b> <b>from</b> {{observers}} in <b>the</b> <b>press</b> and throughout baseball was widely critical. Stephen Cannella of Sports Illustrated wrote: [...] "Seaver's right. Hall of Fame standards should be high. But letting the inmates play gatekeeper {{allows them to}} make those standards unreachable. ... it might {{be too much to}} ask Hall of Famers to be guardians of their realm. ... Would you want to belong to a club that would have anyone else as a member?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite being highly {{regarded}} by fans, the album failed to chart {{and met with}} critical <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> music <b>press.</b> Writing for Smash Hits, Neil Tennant said of the [...] "Lightning Flash" [...] song that despite its synthesized sound, [...] "the group have failed to capture the freshness that new pop demands". In reviewing the album, Record Mirror commented on the low budget sound of the music claiming that it was [...] "mortgaged to the hilt". Lightning Flash was to be Brotherhood of Man's final release for a record company as they parted with EMI soon after its release. The group did go on to produce three more albums which were released independently by themselves (The Butterfly Children in 1992, Greenhouse in 1997 and The Seventies Story in 2002).|$|R
50|$|The {{exhibition}} Nuphoria held in {{the year}} 2000, generated interest and <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> both <b>the</b> local <b>press</b> and <b>the</b> public. Among the viewers attending that artshow, students from junior colleges and Polytechnic were seen sketching the artworks on display, interacting and fielding questions to the artists present at the show. This unprecedented public interest in nude art broke the taboo associated with the art form - something that the Group had hoped for since their inception.|$|R

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{have tried to}} {{describe}} the brass instrument chromaticism process by means of covering the corpus by hand and especially by applying a key mechanism. I {{have dealt with the}} first sources, discoveries and experiments which preceded the spread of keyed brass instruments. I worked closely with the personages Anton Weidinger and J. L. Kunerth, who were considered as first inventors of the keyed trumpet. I have formulated a hypothesis concerning the identification of lost compositions for the keyed trumpet by J. N. Hummel, including the reconstruction and a practical example of the Quartet in E Major. I have discussed methodologies of playing the keyed trumpet and collected <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> contemporary <b>press</b> concerning <b>the</b> use of the keyed trumpet in concert life in this period. I have created lists of detailed information on the traditional keyed trumpets and their literature...|$|R

5000|$|The {{following}} day, the White House {{released a}} statement headed, [...] "Booker T Washington of Tuskegee, Alabama, dined with the President last evening". <b>The</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>press</b> and politicians was immediate, sustained and vicious. For example, Senator James K. Vardaman (D) of Mississippi complained that the White House was now, [...] "so saturated with the odor of nigger that the rats had taken refuge in the stable"; the Memphis Scimitar declared it [...] "the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the United States" [...] and on 25 October the Missouri Sedalia Sentinel published on its front page a poem entitled [...] "Niggers in the White House", which ended suggesting that either the president's daughter should marry Washington or his son one of Washington's relatives. Senator Benjamin Tillman (D) of South Carolina said [...] "we shall have to kill a thousand niggers {{to get them back}} in their places". <b>The</b> Northern <b>presses</b> were more generous, acknowledging Washington's accomplishments and suggesting that the dinner was an attempt by Roosevelt to emphasize he was everybody's president.|$|R
50|$|The Wind & Wuthering Tour was an English, North American, South American and European concert tour by the English {{rock band}} Genesis.
