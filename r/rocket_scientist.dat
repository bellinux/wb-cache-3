5|$|Set in 1964 (three {{decades before}} {{the events of}} the {{original}} Metal Gear), the story centers on FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss. While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor. The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cut scenes and radio conversations.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{characters}} are playable in Crash Team Racing, although only {{eight of them}} are playable from the start. Crash Bandicoot, the main protagonist of the series, is an all-round racer with balanced acceleration, top speed and handling. Doctor Neo Cortex, Crash's archenemy, is a mad scientist who wants to stop Nitros Oxide so that he may conquer the world himself. Like Crash, his kart is an all-round performer. Coco Bandicoot, Crash's younger sister, is a computer genius who installed computer chips into her kart to increase its acceleration prowess. Doctor N. Gin is a <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> who, like Coco, added custom parts to his kart to improve its acceleration. Pura and Polar pilot karts with low speed but improved handling, allowing them to navigate tight corners. Tiny Tiger and Dingodile control karts built for top speed {{at the cost of}} turning prowess.|$|E
5|$|Attending Middleton High School {{alongside}} Ron, {{her best}} female friend Monique and rival schoolmate Bonnie Rockwaller, Kim {{lives with her}} family: father James, a <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist,</b> and Ann, a brain surgeon, {{as well as her}} younger brothers, identical twins Jim and Tim, both of whom possess genius-level intellect. Fully aware of their daughter's occupation, Kim's parents remain completely supportive of her crime-fighting endeavors so long as she continues to obey curfew, but tend to be more-so concerned about the character's performance in school, as well as her love life. Lacking a secret identity, Kim is world famous and her profession, although accepted by her peers, is seldom acknowledged by her schoolmates or teachers. Captain of her high school's cheerleading squad, Kim Possible also explores the highs and lows of Kim's life as a high school student attempting to navigate dating, academics, homework, exams and eventually learning to drive, all the while striving to maintain a healthy work-life balance; fighting crime typically comes to Kim more naturally than the more standard components of adolescence.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, the German Reichswehr (which in 1935 {{became the}} Wehrmacht) {{began to take}} an {{interest}} in rocketry. Artillery restrictions imposed by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles limited Germany's access to long-distance weaponry. Seeing the possibility of using rockets as long-range artillery fire, the Wehrmacht initially funded the VfR team, but because their focus was strictly scientific, created its own research team. At the behest of military leaders, Wernher von Braun, at the time a young aspiring <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist,</b> joined the military (followed by two former VfR members) and developed long-range weapons for use in World War II by Nazi Germany.|$|E

Although rumors of his execution circulated widely, Theremin was, in fact, put to work in a sharashka (a secret research-laboratory), together with other scientists and engineers, including aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev and <b>rocket</b> <b>scientist</b> Sergei Korolyov (also a Kolyma inmate). The Soviet Union rehabilitated Theremin in 1956.|$|E
