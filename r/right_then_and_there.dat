While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized.

500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan. She {{credited}} Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as an inspiration, saying [...] "Well, when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' I knew <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E

We can understand laws to keep government officials from leaking sensitive secrets, but once {{that information is}} out, {{do we really want}} to start prosecuting journalists and others who publish it? That sounds more like Britain's Official Secrets Act than an American law consonant with the 1st Amendment. When Congress passed the Espionage Act, it explicitly rejected a version that would have punished newspapers for printing information [...] "useful to the enemy."

40|$|During {{the decade}} of the 19602 ̆ 7 s there was {{continually}} increasing interest in the programs of public welfare. This interest sprang from several sources. Citizens, always worried about welfare expenditures, developed resurgent concern. Recipients, long a quiet group, became more active, forming the National Welfare <b>Rights</b> Organization. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> was the rediscovery of poverty as a social problem, and a realization that very many Americans were poor, many more than anyone had somehow realized. The general interest in poverty and the measures used to relieve it had an effect on the academic community, generating some sustained and critical attention to public welfare by people other than those identifiid with the social work profession {{for the first time in}} many years. Of particular interest were the rates of welfare utilization and the amount of money the client on welfare received. The purpose of this paper is to review literature in the area of welfare utilization analysis, to present some new data in the area, and to present a hypothetical model which accounts for some of the differences in the data, and provides an integration of the mechanism used by welfare agencies to deal with the multiple contingency situation they face...|$|R
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>there...</b> She {{said she was going}} to be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E
500|$|Under his {{new stage}} name, LL Cool J (an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James), Smith {{was signed by}} Def Jam, {{which led to the}} release of his first {{official}} record, the 12-inch single [...] "I Need a Beat" [...] (1984). The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating [...] "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home." [...] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating [...] "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. <b>Right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> I said 'This is what I want to do'." [...] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of [...] "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys' single [...] "Rock Hard" [...] (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E

500|$|The season {{also saw}} {{several of the}} show's cast write their own episodes. Series co-star Gillian Anderson {{directed}} and wrote her first episode of the series, [...] "all things". Anderson originally approached Carter about writing and directing an episode of the series during the sixth season. Anderson crafted a script that would see Scully pursuing a [...] "deeply personal X-File, one which in [...] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her". Anderson had only a rough outline of the script until one day she wrote {{a majority of the}} story in one sitting. She explained, [...] "A certain concept began to form, [...] I just wrote the entire outline for 'all things' <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>there.</b> It all just kind of came together on the page". The next day, Anderson pitched the script to Carter, who approved of the [...] "personal and quiet" [...] characteristics of the story. In addition, series regular Davis wrote his only episode, [...] "En Ami". Davis approached Carter with his idea about Cigarette Smoking Man trying to seduce Scully with medical knowledge, and Carter, who was intrigued, responded positively to the idea. He assigned executive producer Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full-fledged script. The script went through many revisions. Because Cigarette Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to the [...] "En Ami" [...] as [...] "the creepiest episode of the year." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} cast in roles which recurred {{throughout}} the seven seasons {{on television and}} into the four feature films. Majel Barrett, referred to as [...] "The First Lady of Star Trek" [...] due to her marriage with Roddenberry, appeared both {{as the voice of}} Starfleet computers and as Lwaxana Troi. The part of Lwaxana was specifically created for her. She had appeared in The Original Series and two Star Trek films as Christine Chapel, and as Number One in the original pilot [...] "". John de Lancie was cast as Q despite missing his first audition as it conflicted with a play he was in at the time. A second audition was arranged, where de Lancie impressed Roddenberry, who told him that [...] "You make my words sound better than they are." [...] Colm Meaney was originally cast as an unnamed Ensign in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but was subsequently cast as the Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, appearing in 52 episodes in that role. Whoopi Goldberg approached the producers and asked for a role in the show, resulting in Roddenberry writing her the part of Guinan. She credits Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as inspiring her, saying [...] "when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!'

2500|$|Madame Nhu's brother-in-law, Ngo Dinh Diem, {{had been}} {{appointed}} Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by her mother's distant cousin, Emperor Bảo Đại, after the French had been defeated at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the south. After the French defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, the French wanted {{to hang on to}} a zone of influence in the south by keeping the Emperor Bảo Đại, while the Americans wanted to push the French out by having Diem create a republic [...] Diem in the words of an American diplomat had developed [...] "a blind hatred of the French" [...] and the Americans believed that South Vietnam needed an anti-Communist leader who was not tainted with any associations with the French, which led them to back Diem. Madame Nhu had lobbied Bao Dai to appoint her brother-in-law Prime Minister and believed that it was her influence that led to the appointment. She was deeply shocked to learn the real reason why Bao Dai had appointed Diem Prime Minister was out of the expectation that he would fail in order to neutralize him as the State of Vietnam was in a serious political and economic crisis by 1954 that almost nobody expected Diem to master, and she never forgave either the Emperor or the French for their plot to ruin Diem. In order to ensure American support for Diem, Madame Nhu befriended Americans working at the embassy in Saigon known to be CIA agents. For their part, the French backed General Nguyễn Văn Hinh as Prime Minister, and he in his turn had won the support of the Binh Xuyen crime syndicate that dominated the economic life of Saigon. Giving Madame Nhu an additional reason to intrigue against Hinh was his repeated boasting when he deposed Diem he would make Madame Nhu into another of his concubines. At a party, Madame Nhu confronted Hinh to tell him: [...] "You are never going to overthrow this government because you don't have the guts. And if you do overthrow the government, you will never have me because I will claw your throat out first!" [...] To win support for Diem, Madame Nhu hit upon the idea of enlisting support from the million or so refugees, many of them Catholics who fled to the south after the Geneva accords had partitioned Vietnam, organizing them for a massive pro-Diem demonstration on 21 September 1954. The rally in Saigon led a confrontation on the streets between Madame Nhu and Binh Xuyen gunmen, with Nhu daring the thugs to kill her <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> which caused them to demurr, and the rally went on. Emboldened by this triumph, Diem saw a chance to put his puritanical Roman Catholic values into practice and to strike a blow at the Binh Xuyen at the same time by shutting down the brothels, gambling houses and opium dens of Saigon owned by the Binh Xuyen while having pornographic magazines burned on the streets (the Binh Xuyen were the largest producers and sellers of pornography in Vietnam).|$|E
