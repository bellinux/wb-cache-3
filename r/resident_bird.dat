50|$|According to Ashmoleâ€™s Hypothesis, {{the clutch}} size of <b>resident</b> <b>birds</b> is {{proportional}} to the level of competition with migrant birds. This {{is due to the fact}} that competition between migrant <b>birds</b> and <b>resident</b> (i.e. non-migrant) <b>birds</b> leads to greater mortality among <b>resident</b> <b>birds.</b> The resultant lower competition during the reproductive season enables the <b>resident</b> <b>birds</b> that survived to lay larger eggs. A study performed supported this hypothesis. In the study, they compared the evolutionary history of birds inhabiting Australia, Southern Africa and India because these regions have different proportions of migrants. India had the largest proportion of migrants while Australia had the smallest. The study found that clutch size was significantly higher in India than in the other two regions (Australia, Southern Africa). Furthermore, the study tested whether there exists a negative relationship between clutch size and the length of the breeding season (i.e. the larger the clutch size the shorter the breeding season). The length of the reproductive season was greater in Australia than in India (with South Africa having a breeding season lower than Australia but higher than India). The researchers attributed the differences in the clutch size of <b>resident</b> <b>birds</b> to the larger proportion of Palearctic migrants wintering in India. The differences that the study found in terms of the length of breeding seasons were accounted for by differences in the climatic characteristics between the regions.|$|R

40|$|Declining {{populations of}} greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; {{hereafter}} sage-grouse) have increased stakeholder concerns regarding {{the management and}} stability of the species range-wide. Numerous conservation strategies have been identified to restoring sage-grouse population declines to include species translocations. Translocations {{have been used for}} many different wildlife species to help sustain genetic heterogeneity, reestablish, and augment declining populations. In a recent translocation study, researchers identified the protocols used to successfully translocate sage-grouse to restore declining populations in Strawberry Valley, Utah. This translocation occurred in a high elevation basin buffered by geomorphic barriers. I evaluated these protocols for use in translocating sage-grouse to augment a declining population that inhabited Anthro Mountain in northwest Utah. Anthro Mountain is a high elevation mountain dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) void of geomorphic barriers. I compared annual production, survival (i. e., vital rates), habitat use, and movements of translocated birds and their progeny to the resident population. Lastly, I described the integration of translocated <b>birds</b> with <b>resident</b> <b>birds</b> and the overall efficacy of the translocation effort. I radio-collared and monitored 60 translocated female sage-grouse from Parker Mountain, Utah over a 2 -year period (2009 and 2010) and compared their vital rates to 19 radio-marked resident sage-grouse. Adult survival was similar for <b>resident</b> and translocated <b>birds,</b> but higher for both groups in 2010 than in 2009. However, overall survival of both <b>resident</b> and translocated <b>birds</b> was lower than range-wide survival estimates. Nest success was slightly higher for <b>resident</b> <b>birds</b> than translocated birds but positively correlated to grass height for both groups. Chick survival was also slightly higher for <b>resident</b> <b>birds</b> than for translocated birds, and higher overall in 2010 than in 2009. Chick survival was positively correlated to grass cover for both groups. Translocated birds used similar habitats and exhibited migration behaviors similar to <b>resident</b> <b>birds.</b> From a methodology perspective, the translocations protocols were successful because the translocated birds quickly acclimated to the release area, and their survival and reproductive success were similar to the <b>resident</b> <b>birds.</b> The effect of the translocation on augmenting the local population was inconclusive...|$|R
