50|$|<b>RTGS</b> <b>system</b> {{does not}} require any {{physical}} exchange of money; the central bank makes adjustments in the electronic accounts of Bank A and Bank B, reducing the balance in Bank A's account by the amount in question and increasing the balance of Bank B's account by the same amount. The <b>RTGS</b> <b>system</b> is suited for low-volume, high-value transactions. It lowers settlement risk, besides giving an accurate picture of an institution's account at any point of time. The objective of RTGS systems by central banks throughout the world is to minimize risk in high-value electronic payment settlement systems. In an <b>RTGS</b> <b>system,</b> transactions are settled across accounts held at a central bank on a continuous gross basis. Settlement is immediate, final and irrevocable. Credit risks due to settlement lags are eliminated. The best RTGS national payment system cover up to 95% of high-value transactions within the national monetary market.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of CHATS as a <b>RTGS</b> <b>system,</b> interbank {{settlements}} in Hong Kong relied on a multi-tier system which settled in a daily net basis. About 170 banks settled with 10 banks. These 10 banks, in turn, settled with Hongkong Bank, which then settled with the HKMA in a one-to-one basis. Hongkong Bank acted as the clearing house under this system, settling payments across its books in a net basis on the day following the transactions. The HKMA decided that this did not meet international standards as set by G10's Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems; following a six-month feasibility study, in June 1994, it decided to develop CHATS as a <b>RTGS</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} examination is reported of several special ways for space disposal of nuclear waste material which utilize the radioactive {{heat in the}} waste {{to assist in the}} propulsion for deep space trajectories. These include use of the wastes in a thermoelectric generator (RTG) which operates an electric propulsion device and a radioisotope - thermal thruster which uses hydrogen or ammonia as the propellant. These propulsive devices are compared to the space tug and the space tug/solar electric propulsion combination for disposal of waste on a solar system escape trajectory. Such comparisons indicate that the waste-RTG approach has considerable potential provided the combined specific mass of the waste container - <b>RTG</b> <b>system</b> does not exceed approximately 150 kg/kw sub e.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the adult heart to {{regenerate}} cardio- myocytes (CMs) lost after injury is limited, generating interest in developing efficient cell-based transplantation therapies. Rigid car- bon nanotubes (CNTs) scaffolds {{have been used to}} improve CMs viability, proliferation, and maturation, but they require undesirable invasive surgeries for implantation. To overcome this limitation, we developed an injectable reverse thermal gel (RTG) functionalized with CNTs (RTG-CNT) that transitions from a solution at room temperature to a three-dimensional (3 D) gel-based matrix shortly after reaching body temperature. Here we show experimental evi- dence that this 3 D RTG-CNT system supports long-term CMs survival, promotes CMs alignment and proliferation, and improves CMs function when compared with traditional two-dimensional gelatin controls and 3 D plain <b>RTG</b> <b>system</b> without CNTs.

40|$|Deep {{space science}} {{missions}} have typically used radioisotope thermoelectric generator (<b>RTG)</b> power <b>systems.</b> The <b>RTG</b> power <b>system</b> has proven {{itself to be}} a rugged and highly reliable power system over many missions, however the thermal-to-electric conversion technology used was approximately 5 % efficient. While the relatively low efficiency has some benefits in terms of system integration, there are compelling reasons why a more efficient conversion system should be pursued. The cost savings alone that are available {{as a result of}} the reduced isotope inventory are significant. The Advanced Radioisotope Power System (ARPS) project was established to fulfill this goal. Although it was not part of the ARPS project, Stirling conversion technology is being demonstrated with a low level of funding by both NASA and DOE. A power system with Stirling convertors. although intended for use with an isotope heat source. can be combined with other advanced technologies to provide a novel power system for deep space missions. An inflatable primary concentrator would be used in combination with a refractive secondary concentrator (RSC) as the heat source to power the system. The inflatable technology as a structure has made great progress for a variety of potential applications such as communications reflectors, radiators and solar arrays. The RSC has been pursued for use in solar thermal propulsion applications, and it's unique properties allow some advantageous system trades to be made. The power system proposed would completely eliminate the isotope heat source and could potentially provide power for science missions to planets as distant as Uranus. This paper will present the background and developmental status of the technologies and will then describe the power system being proposed...|$|R
40|$|The Hap 2, 3, 4, 5 p {{transcription}} complex {{is required for}} expression of many mitochondrial proteins that function in electron transport and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. We show that as the cells’ respiratory function is reduced or eliminated, the expression of four TCA cycle genes, CIT 1, ACO 1, IDH 1, and IDH 2, switches from HAP control to control by three genes, RTG 1, RTG 2, and RTG 3. The expression of four additional TCA cycle genes downstream of IDH 1 and IDH 2 is independent of the RTG genes. We have previously shown that the RTG genes control the retrograde pathway, defined as {{a change in the}} expression of a subset of nuclear genes, e. g., the glyoxylate cycle CIT 2 gene, in response to changes in the functional state of mitochondria. We show that the cis-acting sequence controlling RTG-dependent expression of CIT 1 includes an R box element, GTCAC, located 70 bp upstream of the Hap 2, 3, 4, 5 p binding site in the CIT 1 upstream activation sequence. The R box is a binding site for Rtg 1 p-Rtg 3 p, a heterodimeric, basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor complex. We propose that in cells with compromised mitochondrial function, the RTG genes take control of the expression of genes leading to the synthesis of α-ketoglutarate to ensure that sufficient glutamate is available for biosynthetic processes and that increased flux of the glyoxylate cycle, via elevated CIT 2 expression, provides a supply of metabolites entering the TCA cycle sufficient to support anabolic pathways. Glutamate is a potent repressor of RTG-dependent expression of genes encoding both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial proteins, suggesting that it is a specific feedback regulator of the <b>RTG</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} reasons for central banks to adopt RTGS. First, a {{decision}} to adopt is influenced by competitive pressure from the global financial markets. Second, it is more beneficial to adopt an <b>RTGS</b> <b>system</b> for central bank when this allows access to a broad system of other countries' RTGS systems. Third, {{it is very likely}} that the knowledge acquired through experiences with RTGS systems spills over to other central banks and helps them make their adoption decision. Fourth, central banks do not necessarily have to install and develop RTGS themselves. The possibility of sharing development with providers that have built RTGS systems in more than one country (CGI of UK, CMA Small System of Sweden, JV Perago of South Africa and SIA SpA of Italy, Montran of USA) has presumably lowered the cost and hence made it feasible for many countries to adopt.|$|E

The first portion of this paper presents the second series of drop testing required to demonstrate that the RTG package design meets the requirements of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, ``Part 71 `` (10 CFR 71). Results of the first test series, performed in July 1994, demonstrated that some design changes were necessary. The package design was modified to improve test performance and the design changes were incorporated into the Safety Analysis Report for Packaging (SARP). The second full-size certification test article (CTA- 2) incorporated the modified design and was tested at the US Department of Energy`s (DOE) Hanford Site near Richland, Washington. With the successful completion of the test series, and pending DOE Office of Facility Safety Analysis approval of the SARP, a certificate of compliance will be issued for the RTG package allowing its use.
