5|$|The Crisis carried editorials by Du Bois that {{supported}} the ideals of unionized labor but excoriated the racism demonstrated by its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership. Du Bois also supported {{the principles of the}} Socialist Party (he was briefly a member of the party from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders.Lewis, p. 275 (denounced). Frustrated by <b>Republican</b> <b>president</b> Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of <b>Republican</b> <b>president</b> William McKinley in 1896 deepened the Democrats' resolve {{to oppose the}} Republican governor and his allies. Moreover, when the legislature convened in 1898, the Democratic majority in both houses was overwhelming. Bradley's message to the General Assembly in 1898 called for numerous reforms including spending cuts to reduce government waste, putting the state's charitable institutions under control of a non-partisan board, and reforms to public education and legal system.|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a <b>Republican</b> <b>president</b> and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E

Despite the reelection of incumbent <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him {{to cash in on}} his life insurance.|$|E

The fixes that have been enacted for Obama's cabinet have passed in both the House and the Senate without amendment and by unanimous consent. Outgoing <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> George W.

5|$|<b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex Hawaii {{through a}} Senate treaty. When this failed, {{he was asked}} to {{consider}} the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue the annexation of Hawaii. When President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898.|$|E

5|$|Texas has a plural {{executive}} branch system limiting {{the power of}} the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the Secretary of State, voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor. This election system has led to some {{executive branch}}es split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. When <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> George W. Bush served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Land Commissioner, Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|The third administrator, James E. Webb (1961–1968), {{appointed}} by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman. In order {{to implement the}} Apollo program to achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal {{by the end of}} the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at {{negotiations}} with the Republic and believing it weakened by both the Darul Islam and Madiun insurgencies, the Dutch launched a military offensive on 19 December 1948 which it termed 'Operatie Kraai' (Operation Crow). By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, {{the location of the}} temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands. The <b>Republican</b> <b>President,</b> Vice-President, and all but six Republic of Indonesia ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a guerrilla war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff General Sudirman who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia (PDRI), was established in West Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 19th century, Ohio was deemed a crucial battleground state; taking its electoral votes was thought {{essential}} for a Republican to win the White House. One way of, hopefully, assuring victory there was to nominate a son of Ohio. Between 1865 and 1929, every <b>Republican</b> <b>president</b> who first gained his office by election (that is, rather than succeeding on the death of his predecessor) was born in Ohio. Deadlocked Republican conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888 turned to men born in Ohio, and in each case the nominee won the presidency. Thus, any successful Ohio Republican was a plausible president. One of McKinley's rivals among the Ohio contenders was Governor Joseph B. Foraker, but Foraker's light dimmed when he was defeated for a third two-year term in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} John Marshall Harlan, who {{had served}} in the Union Army. In joint debates across the state, McCreary stressed what many Kentuckians felt were abuses of power by <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Ulysses S. Grant during the Reconstruction Era. Harlan countered by faulting the state's Democratic politicians for continuing to dwell on war issues almost a decade after the war's end. He also attacked what he perceived as Democratic financial extravagance and the high number of pardons granted by sitting Democratic governor Preston Leslie. Harlan claimed these as evidence of widespread corruption in the Democratic Party. McCreary received solid support from the state's newspapers, nearly all of which had Democratic sympathies. Despite a late infusion of cash and stump speakers in favor of his opponent, McCreary won the general election by a vote of 130,026 to 94,236.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{maintained}} {{his interest in}} politics, and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Since the incumbent <b>Republican</b> <b>president,</b> Herbert Hoover, was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed the stock market crash, the nominee would {{have a good chance}} of becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith's successor as New York's governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner, and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker sought the nomination. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention in the hope that it would turn to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker in the event of a stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{confirmation}} of Neil Gorsuch in 2017, the Court consists of five justices appointed by <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents</b> and four appointed by Democratic presidents. It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and associate justices Thomas and Alito (appointed by <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents)</b> comprise the Court's conservative wing. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan (appointed by Democratic presidents) comprise the Court's liberal wing. Justice Kennedy (appointed by President Reagan) is generally considered [...] "a conservative who has occasionally voted with liberals", and up until Justice Scalia's death, he was often the swing vote that determined the outcome of cases divided between the conservative and liberal wings. Gorsuch had a track record as a reliably conservative judge in the 10th circuit.|$|R
50|$|Throughout his Senate career, Kerry {{was also}} a staunch critic of many foreign policy {{initiatives}} of <b>Republican</b> <b>Presidents.</b> He opposed and voted against the Gulf War in 1991, and opposed funding the Contras in Nicaragua and similar armed groups in Latin America.|$|R
5000|$|The {{result was}} {{a victory for the}} <b>Republicans.</b> <b>President</b> Patrice MacMahon {{subsequently}} invited Jules Simon, who declared himself [...] "resolutely republican and resolutely conservative", to form a government, but dismissed him on 16 May 1877, precipitating the Seize Mai crisis and further elections.|$|R
5|$|As the 1931 gubernatorial {{election}} approached, Chandler and Prestonsburg native Jack Howard {{were mentioned}} as candidates for lieutenant governor. Congressman Fred M. Vinson backed Howard, a fellow Eastern Kentuckian, while political bosses Billy Klair, Johnson N. Camden, Jr., and Ben Johnson supported Chandler. The support of another political boss, Mickey Brennan, gave Chandler the edge at the party's nominating convention. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ruby Laffoon also owed his selection to the machinations of the state's political bosses, notably his uncle, Congressman Polk Laffoon. Problematically, Chandler was {{an ally of}} former Governor J. C. W. Beckham, Louisville Courier-Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham, and political boss Percy Haly, which put him at odds with Laffoon, {{a member of a}} Democratic faction headed by Russellville political boss Thomas Rhea and opposed to Beckham, Worth, and Haly. Despite disharmony within the ticket, the worsening of the Great Depression under <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Herbert Hoover and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory. Chandler was elected over John C. Worsham by a vote of 426,247 to 353,573. In a break with precedent, Chandler set up an office on the executive floor of the state capitol and worked there full-time; previous lieutenant governors had stayed in Frankfort only during legislative sessions, when they were charged with presiding over the state senate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Republican</b> <b>president</b> Dwight D. Eisenhower {{convinced}} John Sherman Cooper, {{a former}} senator and ambassador who was immensely popular in Kentucky, to challenge Wetherby, hoping his {{presence on the}} ticket would aid his own re-election bid. In the Republican primary, voters chose Thruston B. Morton to challenge Clements. With two of his factional enemies as candidates for the Senate, Governor Chandler bolted the party and supported the Republican candidates. Further complicating Clements' campaign {{was the fact that}} Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson suffered a heart attack in 1956, and as majority whip, Clements had to spend much of his time in Washington, D.C. covering Johnson's duties in the Senate. What time he was in Kentucky was usually devoted to Wetherby's campaign, since the Democrats believed Clements would be re-elected easily while Wetherby faced much stiffer odds. These factors, combined with the landslide of support for Eisenhower, the Republican presidential candidate, contributed to the defeat of both Wetherby and Clements. Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes, while Clements lost to Morton by a margin of 7,000 votes out of more than 1 million that were cast in the election. It was Clements' first defeat for elected office in a career that spanned thirty years.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{progressive}} {{leaders in}} the Republican party supported environmental protection. <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies {{eventually led to the}} creation of the National Park Service. While <b>Republican</b> <b>President</b> Richard Nixon was not an environmentalist, he signed legislation to create the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and had a comprehensive environmental program. However, this position has changed since the 1980s and the administration of President Ronald Reagan, who labeled environmental regulations a burden on the economy. Since then Republicans have increasingly taken positions against environmental regulation.|$|E

40|$|Census Bureau data reveal large, {{consistent}} {{differences in}} patterns of real pre-tax income growth under Democratic and <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents</b> in the post-war U. S. Democratic presidents have produced slightly more income growth for poor families than for rich families, resulting in a modest decrease in overall inequality. <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents</b> have produced {{a great deal more}} income growth for rich families than for poor families, resulting in a substantial increase in inequality. On average, families at the 95 th percentile of the income distribution have experienced identical income growth under Democratic and <b>Republican</b> <b>presidents,</b> while those at the 20 th percentile have experienced more than four times as much income growth under Democrats as they have under Republicans. These differences are attributable to partisan differences in unemployment (which has been 30 percent lower under Democratic presidents, on average) and GDP growth (which has been 30 percent higher under Democratic presidents, on average); both unemployment and GDP growth have much stronger effects on income growth {{at the bottom of the}} income distribution than at the top. Similar partisan differences appear in the distribution of post-tax income growth of households since 1980, despite the fact that the corresponding pre-tax income growth data for that period show little evidence of partisa...|$|R
