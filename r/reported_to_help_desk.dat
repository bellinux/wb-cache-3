50|$|Support {{tools are}} {{generally}} {{built around a}} common paradigm that begins with a customer making a request or an incident report, these create a ticket. Each ticket has a progress status and is updated with annotations and attachments. These annotations and attachments may be visible to the customer (public) or only visible to analysts (private). Customers are notified of progress made on their ticket until it is complete. If the people necessary to complete a ticket are using separate support tools, additional overhead is introduced in maintaining the relevant information in the ticket in each tool while notifying the customer of progress made by each group in completing their ticket. For example, if a customer support issue {{is caused by a}} software bug and <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> a <b>help</b> <b>desk</b> using one system, and then the fix is documented by the developers in another, and analyzed in a customer relationship management tool, keeping the records in each system up-to-date and notifying the customer manually using a swivel chair approach is unnecessarily time-consuming and error-prone. If information is not transferred correctly, a customer may have to re-explain their problem each time their ticket is transferred.|$|R

Because reporting of suspected cases only could underestimate the true rate of infection, we conducted a seroprevalence study in the Netherlands to detect past exposure to SBV among dairy cattle. A total of 1, 123 serum samples collected from cattle during November 2011 –January 2012 were tested for antibodies against SBV by using a virus neutralization test; seroprevalence was 72. 5 %.

In addition, high (70 %– 100 %) within-herd seroprevalence was observed in 2 SBV-infected dairy herds and 2 SBV-infected sheep herds.

40|$|Queueing {{models have}} been used {{extensively}} {{in the design of}} call centres. In particular, a queueing model will be used <b>to</b> describe a <b>help</b> <b>desk</b> which is a form of a call centre. The design of the queueing model involves modelling the arrival an service processes of the system. Conventionally, the arrival process is assumed to be Poisson and service times are assumed to be exponentially distributed. But it has been proposed that practically these are seldom the case. Past research reveals that the log-normal distribution can be used to model the service times in call centres. Also, services may involve stages/tasks before completion. This motivates the use of a phase-type distribution to model the underlying stages of service. This research work focuses on developing statistical models for the overall service times and the service times by job types in a particular <b>help</b> <b>desk.</b> The assumption of exponential service times was investigated and a log-normal distribution was fitted to service times of this <b>help</b> <b>desk.</b> Each stage of the service in this <b>help</b> <b>desk</b> was modelled as a phase in the phase-type distribution. Results from the analysis carried out in this work confirmed the irrelevance of the assumption of exponential service times <b>to</b> this <b>help</b> <b>desk</b> and it was apparent that log-normal distributions provided a reasonable fit to the service times. A phase-type distribution with three phases fitted the overall service times and the service times of administrative and miscellaneous jobs very well. For the service times of e-mail and network jobs, a phase-type distribution with two phases served as a good model. Finally, log-normal models of service times in this <b>help</b> <b>desk</b> were approximated using an order three phase-type distribution...|$|R
