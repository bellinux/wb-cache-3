40|$|This paper {{provides}} a legal-economic {{analysis of the}} Appellate Body decision in Brazil – Retreaded Tyres. We develop a simple economic model that we use to analyze the market structure and environmental externalities that were most relevant to this case. We start by analyzing Brazil's policies in a model in which tyre retreading generates a positive production externality through the delay it provides society before a used tyre becomes a waste product {{with the potential to}} harm society through its adverse impact on human health and the environment. We examine the different welfare implications of (i) a production subsidy for <b>retreading</b> <b>of</b> once-used Brazilian <b>tyres,</b> (ii) a tariff on imports <b>of</b> <b>retreaded</b> <b>tyres,</b> and (iii) a ban on imports <b>of</b> <b>retreaded</b> <b>tyres.</b> While a production subsidy is the first-best instrument to address this type of externality, there are reasons to believe that it might be infeasible. The welfare implications of the other measures depend importantly on the magnitude of the positive production externality. From the lens provided by this economic analysis, we draw three primary insights. First, we identify the critical piece of empirical information that the Panel and Appellate Body require to make a rational judgment of the utility of the Brazilia...|$|R

Pridobil sem informacije, koliko so stari, kakšne avtomobile vozijo, kakšne so njihove nakupovalne navade, itd. S tem namenom sem izpeljal anketo in pridobil nekaj ključnih informacij. Glavni dve hipotezi sta bili, ali obstaja odvisnost med vrednostjo avtomobila in pripravljenostjo nakupa obnovljenih gum, in ali stopnjo izobrazbe vpliva in na nakup obnovljenih gum. The {{main subject}} I {{was working on}} {{was to make a}} profile <b>of</b> <b>retread</b> <b>tyre</b> consumer. I wanted to get {{information}} about their age, what kind of cars they are driving, what kind of shopping habits they have,etc. I made a question form and I got some major information, which I tested them. The main hypotesis were if there is any correlation between value of the car and willing to buy a retread tyre and if there any connection between graduation level and willing to buy a retread. I got a conclusion that there is no connection between graduation level and willing to buy a retreaded tyres.

40|$|The recent {{decisions}} of the panel and Appellate Body in Brazil - Measures Affecting Imports <b>of</b> <b>Retreaded</b> <b>Tyres</b> touched upon {{a number of issues}} of ongoing significance to the application of necessity tests, such as those in Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This article argues that the dispute represents a mixed outcome for the application of necessity tests. The express recognition that some regulatory measures are complementary to one another rather than reasonably available alternatives constitutes a welcome step forward. On the other hand, the panel's characterization of Brazil's regulatory goal highlights an approach common to a number of panel reports that could justify a perception of arbitrariness in application of necessity tests. Similarly, comments made by the Appellate Body to the effect that a panel is obliged to consider the importance of a state's regulatory goal extend the role of a panel in an unjustifiable manner., Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Mixtures <b>of</b> {{shredded}} <b>tyres</b> {{with sand}} have become accepted geo-materials {{in the past}} decade, especially for use as fill materials. Owing to the large size <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds commonly used in practice, large-scale direct shear testing equipment is specially fabricated to obtain the shear strength parameters of mixtures. The effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-tosand mixing ratio on the mechanical response of the mixtures is studied by performing direct shear tests on mixtures prepared at different mixing ratios. Out of the four types of samples tested, three (with mixing ratios of 20 / 80, 25 / 75 and 35 / 65 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds to sand) are prepared using 50 to 100 mm long tyre shreds and one (25 / 75 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> chips to sand) using tyre chips with nominal size of 9. 5 mm. The end-of-test friction angle <b>of</b> all the <b>tyre</b> shred-sand mixtures considered in this research is in the 30 - 33 degrees range. Results of direct shear testing {{from the present study}} and other studies in the literature show that the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-sand mixtures is greater than that <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> chip-sand mixtures because the elongated tyre shred pieces are able to provide greater reinforcement effects than are possible with equidimensional (cubical) tyre chips...|$|R
