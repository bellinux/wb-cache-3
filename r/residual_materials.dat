40|$|Abstract. In milling pocket corner, there maybe <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> left at {{sharp corners}} when {{stepover}} is extremely large in contour-parallel toolpath. This paper describes an improved pocket toolpath by inserting biarc transitions segments in contour-parallel toolpath. When reaching the sharp corner, the cutter moves along the biarc transitions toolpath {{so that the}} corner material is removed. The efficient toolpath is continuous for clearing <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> at sharp corner. Milling test has been conducted to demonstrate and verify {{the significance of the}} proposed method...|$|R
30|$|It {{was also}} shown that with the plant {{capacities}} assumed here, only the 2 G stand-alone plant and the combined 1 G and 2 G plant were self-sufficient in heat by burning the <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> and biogas produced in the process. In the other cases external energy had {{to be added to}} supply the process with heat. Heat had to be supplied to the 1 G plant as it was assumed that the DDGS produced would be sold, and thus no <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> would be available for incineration. The <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> obtained from the 2 G process was not enough to supply both the 1 G and 2 G plants with energy. However, a reduction of about 30 % in the external energy required for heating in the 1 G plant could be accomplished, while completely satisfying the heat demand in the 2 G plant.|$|R

30|$|Fire {{damage to}} {{concrete}} causes contact-type defects that degrade its durability through impaired mechanical properties. Various nondestructive tests {{are used to}} evaluate defects induced by fire damage. Recently, nonlinear ultrasonic methods such as the nonlinear resonance vibration method and nonlinear modulation method have been introduced. These nonlinear methods are more sensitive to fire-induced contact-type defects than the linear ultrasonic method. This study involved an experimental analysis of the <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> properties of fire-damaged concrete, specifically, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and static elastic modulus. The <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> properties of 116 cylindrical concrete samples with various mix proportions and subjected to various heating temperatures were measured by a destructive method, and their nonlinearity parameters were measured by two nonlinear ultrasonic methods. Through regression analysis, correlated relationships that can facilitate the prediction of <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> properties of fire-damaged concrete using measured nonlinearity parameters were identified. In addition, the effect of fire damage on the mechanical strength of concrete was investigated by comparison with the relationships for undamaged concrete, and relationships {{for the evaluation of}} fire-damaged concrete were identified through regression analysis.|$|R

5000|$|The {{shredding}} {{of automobiles}} and major household appliances {{is a process}} where a hammermill acts as a giant tree chipper by grinding the materials fed into it to fist-size pieces. The shredding of automobiles results {{in a mixture of}} ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal (e.g. alloys of copper and aluminium) and shredder waste, called automotive shredder residue or automobile shredder residue (ASR). ASR consists of glass, fiber, rubber, automobile liquids, plastics and dirt. ASR is sometimes differentiated into shredder light fraction and dust.

50|$|Approximately 12-15 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the}} end of their use each year in just the United States alone. These automobiles, although out of commission, can still have a purpose by giving back the metal and other recyclable materials that are contained in them. The vehicles are shredded and the metal content is recovered for recycling, while in many areas, the rest is further sorted by machine for recycling of additional materials such as glass and plastics. The remainder, known as automotive shredder residue, is put into a landfill.The shredder residue of the vehicles that is not recovered for metal contains many other recyclable materials including 30% of it as polymers, and 5-10% of it as residual metals. Modern vehicle recycling attempts to be as cost-effective as possible in recycling those <b>residual</b> <b>materials.</b> Currently, 75% of the materials are able to be recycled. As the most recycled consumer product, end-of-life vehicles provide the steel industry with more than 14 million tons of steel.|$|E
40|$|Micro-Optical-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MOEMS) employ batch {{fabrication}} {{processes to}} construct miniature devices with macroscopic functionality. Surface micromachined MOEMS structures are manufactured by the deposition and patterning of thin films. In marked contrast with conventional fabrication processes (and bulk micromachining), the thin film {{materials used in}} surface micromachined structures are formed as the device is processed. In general, the material properties of thin films are not controlled during deposition, and are only measured after processing is completed. Characterization methods include wafer curvature measurements {{and a variety of}} test structures. None of the thin film characterization techniques currently employed is entirely satisfactory and all methods rely on process repeatability to be useful. The ultimate optical performance of MOEMS depends directly on the materials properties of the thin films employed. Differing <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> stresses and <b>residual</b> stress gradients cause curvature which degrades the optical performance of nominally flat reflecting surfaces. For multilayer structures like most micromirrors curvature due to the bimetallic effect can not be ignored. Recent work in which foundry processes were used to fabricate low-cost deformable mirrors (MEM-DMs) for adaptive optics illustrates the impact of <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> stress on system level optical performance. In other MOEMS devices <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> stress can be exploited to produce unique structures. More precise monitoring and control of film stress during deposition remains as a challenge for MEMS and MOEMS. This paper will address the principal materials issues for MOEMS and suggest both design and process control solutions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Residual</b> {{chipping}} <b>material,</b> {{also called}} clean chip residual (CCR), has potential {{use as a}} growth substrate in the nursery and greenhouse horticultural industries. A survey was conducted in the southeastern United States among companies conducting harvesting operations on pine (Pinus sp.) plantations {{for the production of}} pulpwood in the forest industry. Fourteen operators in four states (Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida) were visited to evaluate the on-site status of <b>residual</b> <b>material.</b> Sample analysis of CCR revealed that it was composed of ≈ 37. 7 % wood (range, 14. 2 % to 50. 5 %), 36. 6 % bark (range, 16. 1 % to 68. 5 %), 8. 8 % needles (range, 0. 1 % to 19. 2 %), and 16. 9 % indistinguishable (fine) particles (range, 7. 5 % to 31 %). pH ranged from 4. 3 to 5. 5 for all locations and electrical conductivity (EC) averaged 0. 24 mmho/cm. Most nutrients were in acceptable ranges for plant growth with the exception of three sites above recommended levels for iron and four sites for manganese. Survey participants estimated that ≈ 27. 5 % of the harvest site biomass was composed of CCR. Some harvesters were able to sell CCR as fuelwood to pulp mills, while others did not recover the <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> and left it on the forest floor (44. 3 % total site biomass). Operations in this survey included typical pine plantation chipping and grinding operations (harvesters), woodyards (lumber, fuelwood, etc.), and operations processing mixed material (salvage from trees damaged in hurricanes or mixed tree species cleared from a site that was not under management as a plantation). <b>Residual</b> <b>material</b> varied depending on the plantation age, species composition, site quality, and natural actions such as fire. Average tree age was 11. 5 years (range, 8 to 15 years), while average tree stand height was 37. 0 ft (range, 25 to 50 ft) and average diameter at breast height (DBH) was 5. 9 inches (range, 4 to 7 inches). <b>Residual</b> <b>material</b> on site was either sold immediately (28. 6 %), left on site for 1 to 3 months (28. 6 %), left on site for up to 2 years (7. 1 %), or not collected/sold (35. 7 %). Several loggers were interested in making CCR available to horticultural industries. Adequate resources are available to horticultural industries, rendering the use of CCR in ornamental plant production a viable option...|$|R
