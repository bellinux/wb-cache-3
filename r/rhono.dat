Connie (Peggy Converse), the owner of the tavern, tells Tip that night that she wants money to {{continue}} keeping quiet about his shady meetings with ship mates at her place. the next day Arno finds a body floating in the bay, and recognizes it as Bill. He calls the police and is questioned by detective Whalen (Ken Christy) about his finding, but he doesn't reveal that he had witnessed Bill's meeting with Tip two nights before. Tip realises that Arno has kept his mouth shut, and as a reward he offers Arno a job in his operation. Arno accepts the offer and later in the day, after escaping from the friendly Rhino, he meets with his government contact.|$|E

Different control strategies have been proposed, {{but most of these}} techniques need sensors to measure process main variables. This paper presents a discrete- time recurrent high order neural observer (<b>RHONO)</b> to estimate substrate and biomass concentrations in an activated sludge {{wastewater treatment}} plant. The <b>RHONO</b> is trained on-line with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) -based algorithm. Then this observer is associated with a hybrid intelligent system based on fuzzy logic to control the substrate/biomass concentration ratio using the external recycle flow rate and the injected oxygen as control actions. The intelligent system and neural observer performance is illustrated via simulations...|$|E
