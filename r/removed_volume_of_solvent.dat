40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to explore the potential and cheaper source of major and abundantly found sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in chicken keel cartilage. Chicken is comparatively readily accessible to all the communities of Pakistan and its cartilages are the rich source of sulphated GAGs. The GAGs were extracted from prewashed and ground keel cartilages (n= 3) of chicken using 3 M MgCl 2, dialyzed, digested with papain, precipitated with three <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> ethanol, and finally lyophilized to dry powder. The dry products were used for proximate analysis (carbohydrates 65. 49 ± 0. 10, crude protein 12. 82 ± 0. 26, ash 11. 12 ±. 56, moisture 9. 88 ± 0. 32 and fat 0. 69 ± 0. 14 %). Dimethylmethylene blue binding (DMMB) assay was performed to determine the quantity of total GAGs in each group of product and protein contents were estimated by Bradford method. Identification of extracted samples of GAGs was performed with FTIR spectrometer using KBr disc and purity of the samples was determined by SDS-PAGE. Quantity of total GAGs in extracted samples was 70. 77 ± 2. 27 % and estimated amount of protein was 4. 64 ± 0. 29 %. FTIR spectra of standard and samples of CS showed identical and characteristic peaks in finger print region. Finger print region revealed the presence of C-O-S, S=O, -COO, -C-C, R-SO 2 –R, -CONH 2 and R-SO 2 -NH 2 molecules. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of 77. 8 and 50. 5 kDa proteins in all extracted samples of GAGs. It can be concluded that chicken keel cartilage is the potential and cheap source of GAGs. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed that most of the non-collagen protein can be <b>removed</b> by three <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction and FTIR is an advance technique for identification of GAGs in mid infrared region (400 - 4000 cm- 1) ...|$|R

Orthogonal array L 18 was selected for the proposed design and ANOVA method was used for recognizing the relative influence of the process parameters. Six different studies have been carried out: To obtain a high yield of the pomelo extraction the most important parameters were: Pomelo´s material, ratio between mass <b>of</b> material and <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> and type <b>of</b> extraction. The content of total extracted phenols (according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure) was analyzed by UV spectrophotometry. The most influential parameters were Pomelo´s material and ratio between mass <b>of</b> material and <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvent.</b> Extracts were analyzed for the contents of naringin by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analysis was performed by solubiliring the extracts in methanol. The most important parameters for extraction of naringin were: Pomelo´s material, ratio between mass <b>of</b> material and <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvent,</b> time, type <b>of</b> extraction and temperature. For determination of antioxidant properties of extracts three different methods were used.

Several studies had shown the effect of various parameters on the betacyanin concentration in peel and flesh of dragon fruit. However, the comparison {{on the effect of}} different parameters to the betacyanin concentration in peel and flesh of dragon fruit has not been extensively studied. There is also lack of information on the antimicrobial potential and mineral profile in dragon fruit. This study was carried out to compare the effect of several parameters on the betacyanin concentration of peel and flesh of dragon fruit by subjecting the samples to different type <b>of</b> <b>solvent,</b> varied composition <b>of</b> weight <b>of</b> sample to <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvent,</b> different length <b>of</b> heating time and a series of temperature. Thus, identify the optimum parameters to extract the highest yield of betacyanin in each sample. The antimicrobial potential was investigated by applying Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in the samples. The mineral profile was analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The result showed the highest yield of betacyanin in peel when extracted using acetone with the weight of sample to the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>of</b> 1 : 1 (w/v) within 4 minutes at temperature of 90 °C.

Betacyanin showed no indication of antimicrobial properties and calcium was detected in flesh of dragon fruit. This preliminary research had found that dragon fruit flesh have a higher stability compared to the peel. However, both have a great potential to be utilize as an antioxidant and natural colorant.
