40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a lightweight origami-inspired foldable hexapod robot. Using a single sheet of polyester and a laser cutter, the hexapod robot can be fabricated and assembled in less than one hour from scratch. No screw or other external tools are required for as-sembly. The robot has built-in polyester fasteners considered in its crease pattern. The design uses four-bar mechanisms, which makes the robot flexible to be adjusted for different speeds or other task metrics. For a given desired locomotion velocity, various parameters of the four-bar mechanisms in the crease pattern can be modified accordingly. Design flexibility, ease of fabrication, and low cost make the robot suitable as an agent for swarm objectives. This work {{presents the}} foldable hexapod design and its kinematic analysis. The robot is fabricated, assembled, and tested for functionality. Experimental results show that the robot prototype runs with a maximum forward speed of 5 body lengths <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and turns in place with a speed of 1 <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The final robot weighs 42 grams.

Methods of reactive magnetron sputtering using the sequential oxidisation of a sputtered metal film from two magnetron sources, in a rotating substrate system, have been developed. A rotation rate of around one <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> enhanced atomic level mixing of the film constituents on the substrate. Depending on the materials involved, two very fast feedback methods were employed to automatically control the admission rate of oxygen into the sputtering system. These methods were plasma emission monitoring (PEM), which was used to control the reactive sputter-deposition of In, Zn, W, V, Mo and Ti oxide, and voltage control, which was used to control the reactive sputter-deposition of Zn, Cu, Pb and Al oxide. The stoichiometry of the film was controlled by PEM or voltage control on one magnetron, and dopants were added by sputtering from the other magnetron. In other words, the former magnetron served two purposes; the first was to sputter metal and oxidise it, and the second purpose was to oxidise the metal sputtered from the other magnetron [...] . cont'...|$|R

This paper discusses the sensor fusion approach taken to perform intelligent alarm analysis for the Advanced Exterior Sensor (AES). The AES is an intrusion detection and assessment system designed for wide-area coverage, quick deployment, low false/nuisance alarm operation, and immediate visual assessment.

In milling operation, self excited vibrations also called the chatter {{are one of the}} main factors that limit productivity. The project is used sensor chatter and non-sensor chatter to measure the variance of the signal sampled at a once <b>per</b> <b>revolution</b> rate. The sensor chatter {{is one of the main}} factors that lower the productivity. Higher efforts tend to accelerate tool wear and can lead to tool breakage. This project used the accelerometer to measures vibration and proper acceleration. The mounting of an accelerometer is easy but it is location must be carefully chosen. Indeed, if the sensor is close to a vibration node, signal amplitude would be very low. It is very difficult to put accelerometer on a rotating part. Beside that, the sensor tachometer (RPM gauge) is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a tool milling machine. The device usually displays the <b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but for this project the software of DasyLab that used can convert to <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (RPS).

Two days after that launch, the backup probe and booster (Atlas vehicle 179D) were rolled out to LC-12. Mariner 2 nearly met the same fate as its predecessor {{when one of the}} Atlas's verniers moved to maximum stop shortly before BECO.

With the structural integrity of the booster in jeopardy, the Range Safety officer prepared to issue the destruct command, but after a few tense moments, the rolling motion stopped and the launch proceeded uneventfully. The incident was traced to a loose wire in the Atlas programmer which was pushed back into place by the centrifugal force of the roll, which also by fortunate coincidence left the Atlas only a few degrees off from where it started and within the range of the Agena's horizontal sensor.|$|R
