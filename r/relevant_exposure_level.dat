40|$|Identification {{of common}} {{mechanistic}} principles that {{shed light on}} the action of the many chemically diverse toxicants to which we are exposed is of central importance in understanding how toxicants disrupt normal cellular function and in developing more effective means of protecting against such effects. Of particular importance is identifying mechanisms operative at environmentally <b>relevant</b> toxicant <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> Chemically diverse toxicants exhibit striking convergence, at environmentally <b>relevant</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> on pathway-specific disruption of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling required for cell division in central nervous system (CNS) progenitor cells. Relatively small toxicant-induced increases in oxidative status are associated with Fyn kinase activation, leading to secondary activation of the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase. Fyn/c-Cbl pathway activation by these pro-oxidative changes causes specific reductions, in vitro and in vivo, in levels of the c-Cbl target platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a and other c-Cbl targets, but not of the TrkC RTK (which is not a c-Cbl target). Sequential Fyn and c-Cbl activation, with consequent pathway-specific suppression of RTK signaling, is induced by levels of methylmercury and lead that affect large segments of the population, as well as by paraquat, an organic herbicide. Our results identify a novel regulatory pathway of oxidant-mediated Fyn/c-Cbl activation as a shared mechanism of action of chemically diverse toxicants at environmentally relevant levels, and as a means by which increased oxidative status may disrupt mitogenic signaling. These results provide one of a small number of general mechanistic principles in toxicology, and the only suc...|$|R

In spite of their preferential affinity for oestrogen receptor (ER) b in vitro, isoflavonoids act in vivo through both ERa and ERb.

The objectives of this paper were to (i) review available literature regarding adverse effects of hormonally active pharmaceuticals on amphibians, with special reference to environmentally <b>relevant</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> and (ii) expand the knowledge on toxicity of progestagens in amphibians by determining effects of norethindrone (NET) and progesterone (P) exposure to 0, 1, 10 or 100 ng l(- 1) (nominal) on oogenesis in the test species Xenopus tropicalis. Very little information was found on toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals on amphibians. Research has shown that environmental concentrations (1. 8 ng l(- 1)) of the pharmaceutical oestrogen ethinylestradiol (EE 2) cause developmental reproductive toxicity involving impaired spermatogenesis in frogs. Recently, {{it was found that}} the progestagen levonorgestrel (LNG) inhibited oogenesis in frogs by interrupting the formation of vitellogenic oocytes at an environmentally relevant concentration (1. 3 ng l(- 1)). Results from the present study revealed that 1 ng NET l(- 1) and 10 ng P l(- 1) caused reduced proportions of vitellogenic oocytes and increased proportions of previtellogenic oocytes compared with the controls, thereby indicating inhibited vitellogenesis.

Environmental stressors that can impact on DOHaD encompass a variety of environmental and occupational hazards as well as deficiency and oversupply of nutrients and energy. They can disrupt early developmental processes and lead to increased susceptibility to disease/dysfunctions later in life. Presentations at the fourth Conference on Prenatal Programming and Toxicity in Boston, in October 2014, provided important insights and led to new recommendations for research and public health action. The conference highlighted vulnerable exposure windows that can occur as early as the preconception period and epigenetics as a major mechanism than can lead to disadvantageous "reprogramming" of the genome, thereby potentially resulting in transgenerational effects. Stem cells can also be targets of environmental stressors, thus paving another way for effects that may last a lifetime.

40|$|Recently, several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to verify exposure to nerve agents. Most of these methods, such as the fluoride reactivation technique and the analysis of inhibited phosphonylated butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), are based on mass spectrometry. The high specificity of the mass spectrometer might also imply a disadvantage, because the acquisition mass, i. e. the identity of the analyte must be known beforehand in order to direct the MS analysis in the most sensitive mode. In real cases, the identity of the nerve agent is not always known beforehand and the mass spectrometer should be operated in a scanning mode, with the consequence that sensitivity of the method will be lower. Comprehensive GC, or GC Ã GC, is a technique which offers enhanced separation. The implied larger selectivity of the GC separation allows mass spectrometry to be conducted in a less specific, scanning, mode. By the use of this configuration, the identity of the nerve agent {{does not have to be}} known beforehand but can be traced. In order to be able to detect lower concentrations and assess lower <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> a large volume injection technique was developed allowing sample sizes up to 100 Î¼L. The technique was tested with plasma samples that had been inhibited with various nerve agents. Subsequently, the cholinesterase-bound nerve agent was regenerated by the fluoride reactivation technique. Using the newly developed comprehensive GC-MS method it was possible to detect nerve agent at an <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> of 1 % BuChE inhibition, which is approximately 70 pg nerve agent/mL. These low <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> cannot be verified with a cholinesterase (ChE) activity assay. Moreover, the identity of the regenerated nerve agent was verified by the mass spectrum that was generated by the TOF mass spectrometer.

40|$|Abstract Background Chemotherapy {{in cancer}} {{patients}} can {{be associated with}} serious short- and long-term adverse neurological effects, such as leukoencephalopathy and cognitive impairment, even when therapy is delivered systemically. The underlying cellular basis for these adverse effects is poorly understood. Results We found that three mainstream chemotherapeutic agents â carmustine (BCNU), cisplatin, and cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine), representing two DNA cross-linking agents and an antimetabolite, respectively â applied at clinically <b>relevant</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to cultured cells are more toxic for the progenitor cells of the CNS and for nondividing oligodendrocytes than they are for multiple cancer cell lines. Enhancement of cell death and suppression of cell division were seen in vitro and in vivo. When administered systemically in mice, these chemotherapeutic agents were associated with increased cell death and decreased cell division in the subventricular zone, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the corpus callosum of the CNS. In some cases, cell division was reduced, and cell death increased, for weeks after drug administration ended. Conclusion Identifying neural populations at risk during any cancer treatment is of great importance in developing means of reducing neurotoxicity and preserving quality of life in long-term survivors. Thus, as well as providing possible explanations for the adverse neurological effects of systemic chemotherapy, the strong correlations between our in vitro and in vivo analyses indicate that the same approaches we used to identify the reported toxicities can also provide rapid in vitro screens for analyzing new therapies and discovering means of achieving selective protection or targeted killing. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} environmental pollutant Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP) is a {{known to}} have anti-androgenic like properties. DBP exposure {{has been linked to}} a range of developmental disorders in males such as hypospadias (defect of the penis) and cryptorchidism (undescended testes). Humans are exposed to DBP daily; therefore, it is essential to fully understand the role DBP in the pathogenesis of these developmental disorders. The mechanism of toxicity has yet to be fully established; however, DBP has been shown to reduce testosterone biosynthesis and is thought to disrupt the embryological androgen:estrogen ratio. The present study developed and characterized a LC- 540 Leydig cell line model system. This model system was used to investigate the effects of DBP at physiologically relevant concentrations on key genes of testosterone biosynthesis via the use of NanostringÂ® nCounter technology. The metabolism of DBP was investigated using HPLC to identify if any potentially estrogenic metabolites are produced. The estrogenicity of DBP was investigated using a MCF- 7 proliferation assay. The LC- 540 model system is able to produce detectable quantities of testosterone with and without external stimulation in culture. The metabolism of DBP did not produce any potentially estrogenic metabolites; however, the LC- 540 Phase I and Phase II processes were identified. DBP appears to be slightly estrogenic and promotes growth of MCF- 7 cells. Key genes in testosterone biosynthesis are changed following exposure to DBP. The gene that codes for testosterone biosynthesis (hsd 17 b 3) is down-regulated at normal daily exposure concentrations and occupational exposure concentrations. The gene that codes for 17 Î²-estradiol synthesis (cyp 19 a 1) is up-regulated at occupational exposure concentrations. The likely result of these gene changes is the feminization of males which explains the role of DBP in the pathogenesis of hypospadias and cryptorchidism.

One way to refocus and mobilize new research funds would be to better match the priorities in regulatory issues and direct the research {{within the field of}} toxicology more to low-dose toxicology and risk-benefit analysis. Low-dose toxicology can only be developed when taking into account mechanistic insight and will require risk-benefit analysis and a definition of interactions between compounds at realistic doses of exposure, {{especially in the case of}} dietary constituents. This is because the biological effects at low <b>levels</b> of <b>exposure</b> not only may be adverse but also can be beneficial depending on the target organ, the actual end point studied, the receptors activated, and/or the gene expression, protein, and metabolite patterns affected. Toxicologists have the tools and knowledge to study mechanisms of biological effects of chemicals on living organisms, and they should redirect their focus from looking only at adverse effects at high <b>levels</b> of <b>exposure</b> to characterizing the complex biological effects, both adverse and beneficial, at low <b>levels</b> of <b>exposure.</b> This may even result in the notion that beneficial effects can be the result of reaction pathways that are generally considered adverse and vice versa. Low-dose toxicology not only will provide a significant research challenge for the years ahead but also should contribute to better methods for low-dose risk assessment for complex mixtures of chemical compounds. This refocusing from high- to low-dose effects turns the field from a science focusing on adverse effects into a science studying the biological effects of chemical compounds on living organisms, taking into account the realization that the ultimate biological effect of a chemical may vary with its dose, the end point or target organ considered, and/or the combined exposure with other chemicals. By defining the effects of chemicals on living organisms at physiologically <b>relevant</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> toxicologists may contribute not only to better risk and safety assessment but also to preventive medicine, generating knowledge on possible adverse and also beneficial effects of chemicals.

Many {{of these}} chemicals enter rivers and the ocean, where they directly interact with fish and disrupt endocrine responses. Human {{are exposed to}} these chemicals from drinking water and consumption of fish. The detailed mechanisms by which ED compounds act is not completely understood, but many are known to bind to nuclear receptors, such as the estrogen receptor (ER), retinoid X receptor (RXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Two important EDS are 17 ??-ethynylestradiol (EE 2) and bisphenol-A (BPA). EE 2 is an orally bio-active estragon used in almost all modern formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills. It is widely dispersed in municipal wastewater effluent discharges in US and Europe. EE 2 is active in very small amounts (pM levels) and can alter sex ratios in fish. BPA serves as a chemical building block for the polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins found in many consumer products. BPA's ubiquitous nature in the environment is highlighted {{by the fact that}} 92. 6 % of adults excrete BPA in their urine, with levels averaging 2. 4 and 2. 9 ??g/L in females and males respectively. Evidence of endocrine-related effects has been reported in fish, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians and reptiles at environmentally <b>relevant</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> which are generally much lower than those required for acute toxicity. To understand in full detail the complexity of EDs and how they interact, with different cellular signaling programs, I have employed a pathway based discovery approach. Whole genome micro arrays and next generation sequencing data sets, which probe global gene expression changes in response to EDs (including EE 2 and BPA) will provide an unbiased view of the entire transcriptome. I will exploit this property to allow the experiment itself to reveal the pathways involved, by combining the gene expression data with a database of gene-gene, gene-protein, and protein-protein interactions: the interactome. I will combine experimental gene expression results with the network. For instance, a measure of potential involvement of a gene can be calculated as the absolute value of the log-ratio between gene expression in the control tissue and that of the exposed. This information is then projected onto the network. By drawing each node of the network with a full circle whose radius is proportional to the experimentally-determined measure of involvement, sub-networks (pathways or groups of genes) potentially relevant to the phenotype of the exposed tissue will become evident.

To further understand the mechanisms of neurotoxic injury associated with DA exposure, we examined the transcriptome of whole brains from zebrafish (Danio rerio) receiving intracoelomic (IC) injection of DA at both symptomatic and asymptomatic doses. A majority of zebrafish exposed to high-dose DA (1. 2 Î¼g DA/g) exhibited clinical signs of neuroexcitotoxicity (EC 50 of 0. 86 Î¼g DA/g) within 5 â 20 min of IC injection. All zebrafish receiving low-dose DA (0. 47 Î¼g DA/g) or vehicle only maintained normal behavior. Microarray analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic exposures collectively yielded 306 differentially expressed genes (1. 5 -fold, p â¤ 0. 05) predominately represented by signal transduction, ion transport, and transcription factor functional categories.

Chronic low dose acrylamide <b>exposure</b> in mice <b>relevant</b> to human <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> results in significantly increased levels of DNA damage in terms of glycidamide adducts in spermatocytes, the specific germ cell stage where Cyp 2 e 1 is expressed.

For each environment, limiting daily exposure durations were estimated by comparing the frequency weighted root mean square (i. e., r. m. s.) accelerations and the vibration dose values (i. e., VDV), calculated according to each standard with the <b>relevant</b> <b>exposure</b> limits, action <b>level</b> and health guidance caution zones. Very different estimates of the limiting daily exposure duration can be obtained using the methods described in the three standards. Differences were observed due to variations in the shapes of the frequency weightings, the phase responses of the frequency weighting filters, the method of combining multi-axis vibration, the averaging method, and the assessment method. With the evaluated motions, differences in the shapes of the weighting filters resulted in up to about 31 % difference in r. m. s. acceleration between the "old" and the "new" ISO standard and up to about 14 % difference between BS 6841 and the "new" ISO 2631. There were correspondingly greater differences in the estimates of safe daily exposure durations. With three of the more severe motions there was a difference of more then 250 % between estimated safe daily exposure durations based on r. m. s. acceleration and those based on fourth power vibration dose values. The vibration dose values provided the more cautious assessments of the limiting daily exposure duration. Â© 1998 Academic Press. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were a) to summarize measurements of airborne (respirable) crystalline silica dust <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> among U. S. workers, b) to provide an update of the 1990 Stewart and Rice report on airborne silica <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> in high-risk industries and occupations with data for the time period 1988 â 2003, c) to estimate the number of workers potentially exposed to silica in industries that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspected for high <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> and d) to conduct time trend analyses on airborne silica dust <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for time-weighted average (TWA) measurements. Compliance inspection data that were taken from the OSHA Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) for 1988 â 2003 (n = 7, 209) were used to measure the airborne crystalline silica dust <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> among U. S. workers. A secondorder autoregressive model was applied to assess the change in the mean silica exposure measurements over time. The overall geometric mean of silica <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for 8 -hr personal TWA samples collected during programmed inspections was 0. 077 mg/m 3, well above the applicable American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists threshold limit value of 0. 05 mg/m 3. Surgical appliances supplies industry [Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3842] had the lowest geometric mean silica <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> of 0. 017 mg/m 3, compared with the highest level, 0. 166 mg/m 3, for the metal valves and pipe fitting industry (SIC 3494), for an 8 -hr TWA measurement. Although a downward trend in the airborne silica <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> was observed during 1988 â 2003, the results showed that 3. 6 % of the sampled workers were exposed above the OSHAcalculated permissible exposure limit.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess particulate matter (PM) <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for both the farmer and the veterinarian during different operational tasks in pig-fattening houses, and to estimate their <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> on a daily working basis (time-weighted average (TWA)). The measured PM fractions were: inhalable and respirable PM, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1. The effects of pig age, pen floor type (conventional or low emission surface) and cleaning of the pens on the personal PM exposure were also investigated. Indoor concentrations of NH[sub] 3 [/sub], CH[sub] 4 [/sub], and CO[sub] 2 [/sub] were additionally measured during some operational tasks. The results showed that personal <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> can become extremely high during some operational tasks performed by the farmer or veterinarian. The highest concentration levels were observed during feed shovelling and blood sampling, the lowest during the weighing of the pigs. For the farmer, the estimated TWA <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> of inhalable and respirable PM were 6. 0 and 0. 29 mg m[sup] - 3 [/sup], respectively. These <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for the veterinarian were, respectively, 10. 6 and 0. 74 mg m[sup] - 3 [/sup]. The PM concentration levels were mainly determined by the performed operational tasks. There was no significant effect of pig age, pen floor type, nor cleaning of the pens on the personal <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{modeling}} of <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> has been popular for identifying exposure determinants in occupational hygiene. Traditional data-driven {{methods used to}} choose a model {{on which to base}} inferences have typically not accounted for the uncertainty linked to the process of select-ing the final model. Several new approaches propose making statistical inferences from a set of plausible models rather than from a single model regarded as âbestâ. This paper introduces the multimodel averaging approach described in the monograph by Burnham and Anderson. In their approach, a set of plausible models are defined a priori by taking into account the sample size and previous knowledge of variables influent on <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> The Akaike information criterion is then calculated to evaluate the relative support of the data for each model, ex-pressed as Akaike weight, to be interpreted as the probability of the model being the best ap-proximating model given the model set. The model weights can then be used to rank models, quantify the evidence favoring one over another, perform multimodel prediction, estimate the relative influence of the potential predictors and estimate multimodel-averaged effects of determinants. The whole approach is illustrated with the analysis of a data set of 1500 volatile organic compound <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> collected by the Institute for work and health (Lausanne, Switzerland) over 20 years, each concentration having been divided by the <b>relevant</b> Swiss oc-cupational <b>exposure</b> limit and log-transformed before analysis. Multimodel inference repre-sents a promising procedure for modeling <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> that incorporates the notion that several models can be supported by the data and permits to evaluate to a certain extent model selection uncertainty, which is seldom mentioned in current practice...|$|R
