5|$|Birmingham is a snowy city <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> large UK conurbations, {{due to its}} inland {{location}} and comparatively high elevation. Between 1961 and 1990 Birmingham Airport averaged 13.0 days of snow lying annually, compared to 5.33 at London Heathrow. Snow showers often pass through the city via the Cheshire gap on north westerly airstreams, but can also come off the North Sea from north easterly airstreams.|$|E

5|$|Depletion or {{enrichment}} of europium in minerals <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> rare-earth elements {{is known}} as the europium anomaly. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|The Apex of the Sun's Way, or {{the solar}} apex, is the {{direction}} that the Sun travels <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> nearby stars.

30|$|Turning to {{the case}} of German interregional migration, Decressin (1994) {{examined}} gross migration flows for West German states up to 1988. His results show that a wage increase in one region <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> causes a disproportional rise in the gross migration levels in the first region. On the other hand, a rise in the unemployment in a region <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> disproportionally lowers the gross migration levels. Decressin does not find a significant connection between bilateral gross migration and regional differences in wage level or unemployment when purely cross-sectional estimates are considered.|$|R
5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. <b>Relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
40|$|A general {{prediction}} {{from the}} economic theory of tax reporting is that taxpayers will report more income as the tax rate increases, but the related empirical evidence has been mixed. We conducted an experiment to examine whether taxpayers' responses to a tax-rate change depend on both economic effects and perceptions of horizontal and exchange inequity. Our findings reconcile the previously inconsistent empirical results by identifying conditions under which perceptions of inequity drive taxpayers' reporting decisions. In summary, subjects reported less (more) income as tax rates increased (decreased) when they were inequitably treated <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>others,</b> but not when they were equitably treated <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>others...</b>|$|R

There are many situations where identifying which genes are most strongly expressed in one cell type <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> can provide important biological insights. CellMapper infers which genes are strongly expressed in one cell type <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> by identifying genes that share an expression profile similar to an established set of cell type-specific markers, referred to here as 'query genes'. CellMapper can incorporate information from heterogeneous samples that contain mixtures {{of many different}} cell types, and can provide accurate predictions even when a cell type has not been isolated...|$|R

5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and family law. While {{this is a major}} advancement <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> religions in India, it is still not a complete triumph in terms of feminism and relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of knowledge and the deity of wealth are female.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> energy technologies.

5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. <b>Relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E
