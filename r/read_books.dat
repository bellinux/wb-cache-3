He also learned field hockey there. Qandil {{was at the top}} of his class throughout his later school years and initially sought to enter the medical profession, a typical career aspiration for students with high marks. His mother particularly encouraged him to become a doctor. Qandil simultaneously took an interest in writing, Arabic calligraphy and foreign languages.|$|E
5|$|Toulmin {{was born}} April 7, 1766, in Taunton, Somersetshire, England. His parents were Joshua Toulmin, a noted Dissenting minister, {{and his wife}} Jane (Smith) Toulmin. He {{received}} little formal education, but frequently <b>read</b> <b>books</b> in his mother's bookstore and benefited from listening to conversations between his father and other noted ministers such as Joseph Priestley and Theophilus Lindsey. After attending Hoxton Academy and studying under Thomas Barnes and William Hawes, he followed his father into the ministry in 1786.|$|E

40|$|RESUMÉ The {{essence of}} this thesis {{is to compare}} {{selected}} <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> or workbooks {{in terms of the}} accompanying questions and issues. The work is theoretically based on the characteristics of the pubescent reader and also Bloom's taxonomy, classification and results in international tests like PISA etc. The thesis is also examining the readers' literacy. Its definition is changing in time. Literacy is not only focusing on the knowledge, but also {{plays an important role in}} integrating into society. It is a complex of several dimensions (relationship to reading, literal understanding, deduction, metacognition, sharing and application). Each of the components is indispensable. Five <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> of the 9 th year of elementary school from different publishers (SPN, New School, Fraus, Alter) were analyzed. Two <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> are published by SPN, but each represents a different approach (the older one is based on the school curriculum, newer relates to teaching according to the RVP ZV). It was not a representative analysis of the whole supply of current <b>reading</b> <b>books,</b> but only a selected sample. Analysis of particular <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> is devoted to the general characteristics and context (author, declared associations with RVP ZV, illustrations, general structure of <b>reading</b> <b>book,</b> etc).

5|$|Between 1893 and 1897, {{the years}} when Bauer and Nold were also in the Western Penitentiary for their part in the {{assassination}} attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell. They managed to send the completed newsletters, which they called Prison Blossoms, to friends outside the prison. Participating in Prison Blossoms, initially written in German and later in English, helped Berkman improve his English. He developed a friendship with the prison chaplain, John Lynn Milligan, who was a strong advocate {{on behalf of the}} prison library. Milligan encouraged Berkman to <b>read</b> <b>books</b> from the library, a process that furthered his knowledge of English.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they <b>read</b> <b>books</b> together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E
5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to <b>read</b> <b>books</b> and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E

40|$|Resume Principle of this {{bachelor}} {{labor is}} to analyze texts in <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> for pupils of age 11 to 15. It {{is focused on}} adolescent reader mainly. I {{tried to find out}} whether articles in <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> have respected a pupil as a specific reader with specific needs, interests and preferences. I analyzed six different <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> in my labor. Each of them represented another author's style of writing. My analyses on <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> have been more complex. First of all I have made short characteristics and next I closely analyze articles from different aspects, e. g. representation of national and world literature, representation of female and male writer etc. Part of my labor was a survey among pupils of ninth class which compared theoretical information's gained from specialized publication, information from questionnaires and the present state of adolescents reading. I tried to find out what is the interest in <b>books</b> or <b>reading</b> in a sequence on texts in <b>reading</b> <b>books</b> for pupils of age 11 - 15...|$|R

5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or <b>read</b> <b>books,</b> convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, new {{insights}} into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a press release, of a study conducted by UCLA's Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had <b>read</b> <b>books</b> or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} project, 127 Hours, {{directed}} by Danny Boyle, Franco portrayed real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston. It {{was given a}} limited release starting on November 5, 2010. 127 Hours centered on Ralston trying to free his hand after it became trapped under a boulder in a ravine while canyoneering alone in Utah and resorting to desperate measures in order to survive, eventually amputating his arm. During the five-week, 12-hours-per-day shoot, Franco would only leave the gully set to use the lavatory and would <b>read</b> <b>books</b> such as academic textbooks to keep busy. Franco later called making 127 Hours a {{once in a lifetime}} experience. To date, 127 Hours is one of his most well-reviewed movies and was also a commercial success, earning $60.7million against an $18million budget. His performance earned him universal acclaim from critics. Subsequently, he was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe and SAG award, as well as winning an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E

At age 12, he {{attempted}} to recreate the film using his parents' Super 8 mm film camera and a model of Kong made of wire and rubber with his mother's fur coat for the hair, but eventually gave up on the project. King Kong eventually became his favorite film and was the primary inspiration for his decision to become a filmmaker as a teenager. He <b>read</b> <b>books</b> about the making of King Kong and collected memorabilia, as well as articles from Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson paid tribute to the 1933 film by including Skull Island as the origin of the zombie plague in his 1992 film Braindead.|$|E

Guest, his mother and {{stepfather}} Martin moved to north London, and he began the process of experiencing adolescence in a society different from that inside the Rajneesh movement. Guest reentered society at age 11, and faced confusion over the contrast in experiences between his childhood in the Rajneesh movement and his new experiences as a teenager in London. He enrolled in the Haverstock School in north London, but had trouble during his teen years with drugs and alcohol. He had difficult relations with his stepfather, and had not spent much time with him prior to the move to London. Anne and Martin went through a period of time where they thought they were beings from a different world, and <b>read</b> <b>books</b> on UFOs.

5|$|Whitaker's 2006 {{portrayal}} of Idi Amin in the film, The Last King of Scotland earned him positive reviews by critics {{as well as}} multiple awards and honors. To portray the dictator, Whitaker gained 50 pounds, learned to play the accordion, and immersed himself in research. He <b>read</b> <b>books</b> about Amin, watched news and documentary footage featuring Amin, and spent time in Uganda meeting with Amin's friends, relatives, generals, and victims; he also learned Swahili and mastered Amin's East African accent. His performance earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the fourth African-American actor in history to do so, joining the ranks of Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington, and Jamie Foxx. For that same role, he was also recognized with the British Academy Film Award, Golden Globe Award, National Board of Review Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and accolades from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, London Film Critics’ Circle Award, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics, and New York Film Critics Circle among others.|$|E
