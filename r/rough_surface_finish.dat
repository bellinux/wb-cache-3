The main aim of this research is to develop a methodology of controlling the input material properties of PA 12 powder that will ensure consistent and good quality of the fabricated parts.

40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) is {{the next}} {{frontier}} in manufacturing technology, but with this new frontier comes new challenges in post processing techniques. In an attempt to gain further knowledge of the post processing of metal AM components, the Electropolishing (EP) of Electron Beam Melting (EBM), Additively Manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy parts is investigated in the following work. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is predominant {{in a number of}} industries, with electronics and consumer goods, aerospace, automotive and medical constituting the majority of AM sales. For most of these, Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM technology is of great interest given the ability of PBF to manufacture using metallic materials. Within metal PBF, {{there are a number of}} alloys considered most useful for their existing commonality in industry, good compatibility with metal PBF, and principally performance characteristics, with the most popular of these metals being Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Given that many of the intended applications of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts require good fatigue performance (such as in engine and structural components) and that <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> is one of the leading limits to fatigue life, the <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> improvement of AM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V a pressing need. Since AM parts inherently contain difficult, if not impossible to reach, features using traditional methods, EP may be vi a promising alternative towards improving <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> Of the common metal PBF AM technologies, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM), the EP of EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts holds the greatest challenge and greatest reward, as EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts have a <b>rougher</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> than SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts, but also contain better resultant performance characteristics than SLM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts. EP is inherently challenging given the wide range of factors concurrently affecting polishing quality, and even more so a challenge when performed on AM parts. AM parts have a <b>rougher</b> initial <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> and can be more complex than parts that are typically polished using EP. Gaining proper insight into controlling temperature, time, voltage, electrolyte flow, and other factors such that the uncommonly complex and <b>rough</b> AM part <b>surface</b> can be uniformly leveled and polished is a sizeable task that will take years of careful research. However, laying groundwork in this area, through methodical research and experimentation, has provided a number of valuable insights, pointing future research in the right direction. This work has shown that careful focus must be given to the diffusion layer, surface film, the greatest attribute and also challenge of controlling polish quality in EP. If surface EP proves a viable post processing method for EP, then managing many of the factors effecting EP, including time, temperature, voltage, etc., concurrently must be achieved if metal PBF AM components are to be made as equally useable as existing components...|$|R

The <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> and geometry of the gear tooth flanks were measured. Transmission error, which {{is considered to be}} an important excitation mechanism for gear noise, was predicted and measured. LDP software from Ohio State University was used for the transmission error computations. A specially built test rig was used to measure gearbox noise and vibration for the different test gear pairs. The measurements show that disassembly and reassembly of the gearbox with the same gear pair can change the levels of measured noise and vibration considerably. The rebuild variations are sometimes in the same order of magnitude as the differences between different tested gear pairs, indicating that other factors besides the gears affect gear noise. Most of the experimental results can be understood and explained in terms of measured and predicted transmission error. However, it does not seem possible to find one single parameter, such as measured peak to peak transmission error, that can be related directly to measured noise and vibration. Shaved gears {{do not seem to be}} noisier than ground gears even if their gear tooth deviations are larger. Factors that do seem to reduce gear noise, when compared with profile ground reference gears, are threaded wheel grinding, increased face-width, decreased lead crowning, increased pitch errors and decreased lead twist.

In this class the manufacturing processes is demonstrated through the production of guitar kits. A problem with the class is that the CNC machine gets backed up causing a bottleneck in the production line. The {{solution to this problem}} was to make a pin router duplicator. A pin router duplicator is a device that allows the operator to trace a finished part with a pin while a router mimics its movements, cutting a new part.

The main requirement for this project were limiting the amount of deflection in the shafts to maintain a part tolerances of 5 thousandths and a repeatability of 2 thousandths. To achieve these requirements, linear bearings and precision shafting were to be used. However, due to cost restraints, a prototype design had to be substituted. The design ended up going to smaller diameter shafts with a <b>rougher</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finish,</b> and substituted bearings for plastic sliders.

40|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the aerospace industry due to their high specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance. However, their poor thermal conductivity and high chemical reactivity with tool materials make the machining difficult, especially when grinding. During grinding, the excessive heat generated at the wheel-work piece interface may result in poor surface finisil, 1 _, a transformed surface layer, excessive plastic deformation, thermallyinduced residual tensile stress, burn and micro-cracking on the ground surface. The poor surface integrity and metallurgical changes of the surface and sub-surface may impair the surface sensitive properties such as fatigue life during service. ln order to overcome the thermal problems when grinding titanium alloys, a new cooling strategy, cryogenic grinding, was studied which involves the supply of liquid nitrogen into the grinding zone using a nozzle jet system. lt was found that cryo-cooling with conventional grinding wheel decreased surface roughness values, burn and plastic deformation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys and produced better a cutting mechanism than when using water-based coolant, especially at higher depths of cut. However, the thermal problems still introduced high residual tensile stress which degraded the fatigue life of ground specimens. Another approach to reducing the grinding temperature was to use a superabrasive wheel (diamond), because of its superior thermal conductivity, {{the integrity of the}} ground surface was improved and the fatigue life properties of the specimen were maintained at higher values than for conventional grinding wheels. An ultra stiff machine tool, Tetraform C, was also used to grind Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys and under selected conditions the ground surface reached a good <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> and the fatigue properties were also retained at lower depth of cut.

40|$|Although stress {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that the mechanical endurance of cemented femoral THA reconstructions is served by stems that firmly bond to their cement mantles, retrieval studies suggest that this may be difficult to achieve. Clinical studies with roentgen stereophotogrammetric analyses {{have shown that}} stems may gradually debond from their cement mantle. Accepting the fact that stem debonding is unavoidable, stem subsidence and cement stresses can be reduced by increasing stem-cement friction, as indicated by finite element stress analyses. Hence, it can be hypothesized that debonded stems with high surface roughness values would damage the cement mantle to a lesser extent as compared to polished ones. To confirm this hypothesis, tapered stems with polished and <b>rough</b> <b>surface</b> <b>finishes</b> were implanted in cement mantles and cyclically loaded for 1. 7 million times. It was investigated how surface roughness affected the damage in the cement mantle, and how it was related to prosthetic subsidence. The polished taper subsided considerably more than the rough one (630 vs. 270 m {{at the end of the}} experiments). In addition, it was found that the polished taper displayed step-wise subsidence, which is probably due to the interaction of stick-slip processes at the interface, associated with creep of the acrylic cement. The rough taper subsided monotonously. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) analysis of the taper-cement structures showed that the rough taper was completely debonded from the cement mantle, creating a gap at the interface, and that many large cement cracks and particles were created. Around the polished taper, only a few cracks were found and the taper-cement interface seemed undamaged. It was concluded that an increased surface roughness does not necessarily lead to a reduction in cement damage. On the contrary, compared to polished ones, debonded rough stems may produce more cement cracks and acrylic cement debris, and provide routes to transport these wear products. Hence, after failure of the stem-cement interface, straight-tapered stems with an increased surface roughness accelerate the failure process due to inferior fail-safe features. Consequently, in vivo subsidence patterns at the stem-cement interface should he considered in combination with the <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> of the implant. An amount of post-operative subsidence of a rough stem may be much more damaging for the reconstruction than the same amount for a polished stem. [Author abstract; 23 Refs; In English...|$|R

While the use of granite reduced the density of sculptured works, granite was a more durable material for the temple structure.
