25|$|The air {{conditioning}} system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to conventional systems. Unlike the separate low pressure and high pressure refrigerant pipes used in conventional systems, the Insight has its low pressure cold pipe enclosing the high pressure hot <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pipe</b> that allows the cold refrigerant on its {{way back to the}} engine bay to cool the warm refrigerant traveling to the cabin. A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and inner tubes. This improves the thermal efficiency of the air-conditioning system and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{air-conditioning}} has become a basic requirement in industrial, commercial and residential sectors. With the widened use of air-conditioning in all the sectors, the human community has faced serious environmental and socio economic problems. Prevailing energy crisis and ever increasing energy pieces has made the situation worst. Under the scenario, various novel technologies have been emerged to the airconditioner market. Variable Refrigerant Volume (VRV) air-conditioning technology is also considered as an advanced technology developed to cater the need of efficient use of energy for air-conditioning. The major objective of the research study was to analyze the suitability of VRV airconditioning system, analyze the actual saving potential and cost effectiveness of VRV airconditioning system {{compared to the other}} available types of air-conditioning systems and access the maintainability of VRV air-conditioning system. The study was conducted at a selected representative installation namely at the Sovereign Residences of Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Summary of findings are as follows,  VRV air-conditioners are suitable for medium scale hotel applications. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized for all the installations and the appropriate air-conditioning system for particular building should be selected only after performing a comprehensive analysis of energy performance of considered options on that particular installation (preferably after a computer simulation and life cycle cost analysis of different options). Therefore, though the demand for VRV airconditioning system is prevailing due to the higher efficiency rating and the part load performance of the air-conditioning appliances, the desires of the purchases on energy saving potential of VRV air-conditioners could be satisfied only when it is selected for an appropriate application.  Saving potential of VRV air conditioners could be high as 18 % compared to the energy consumed by split air-conditioning systems when used for appropriate applications. Therefore, the VRV system can be considered as a potential candidate for the installations where the building occupancy and cooling load are regularly varying. Further, Chiller (Central) air-conditioning system can also be considered as a potential candidate as it performs almost efficiently as the VRV system. It consumes around 4 % more energy than VRV system. Study on VRV Air conditioning system Abstract v University of Moratuwa  Computer simulation (Equest) shown that VRV air-conditioning system is the most efficient option among the potentially applicable options considered for the building. However, the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis shows that Chiller system is the most economical air-conditioning system for the same building. Therefore, it is vital to perform LCC analysis in addition to performance analysis when selecting the appropriate air-conditioning system for a building.  Maintainability of the VRV air-conditioning systems is acceptable. It is necessary to select the correct density and thickness of the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pipe</b> insulation to minimize the possibilities of formation of condensation along the refrigerant pipes. Also, the power quality should be maintained at an acceptable level to ensure the durability and proper functionality of electronics of the VRV air conditioning equipment...|$|E
50|$|The {{fire was}} caused by an {{electrical}} ground fault inside a wall socket. A refrigerated pastry display case was added, after original construction of the hotel, to one of its restaurants (known as The Deli). Unlike a modern display case, which would be totally self-contained (compressor installed in bottom of display case), this unit functioned like a walk-in cooler or central air conditioning system, {{with a pair of}} copper <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pipes</b> connecting its evaporator to a compressor unit located outside the building. When this set-up was installed, the copper pipes were run through the same wall soffit as a pre-existing electrical conduit, and were in physical contact with this conduit.|$|R
50|$|The fan-forced {{evaporator}} {{unit in the}} display case was not properly secured, and thus was able to vibrate constantly while in operation; these vibrations were carried along the copper refrigant pipes, causing the pipes to rub against the electrical conduit in the wall soffit and make it vibrate too. Through a combination of galvanic corrosion (where the copper <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pipes</b> were in physical contact with the aluminum electrical conduit, causing the conduit to erode over time), and vibration - as well as jagged edges and stretched wires resulting from poor workmanship during the installation - the electrical wires inside the conduit ended up missing chunks of their plastic insulation, and the conduit was rendered un-grounded (there was no separate ground wire; the metal conduit itself was designed to function as the ground, so {{the disintegration of the}} conduit rendered the system un-grounded).|$|R

Due to {{the multitude of}} influences very important is mathematical and computer modeling. Its allows for performing calculations for many different refrigerants under different flow conditions. A large number of experimental results published in the literature allows for experimental verification of correctness of the models. In this work is presented a mathematical model for calculation of flow resistance during condensation of <b>refrigerants</b> in the <b>pipe</b> minichannel. The model was developed in environment based on conservation equations. The results of calculations were verified by authors own experimental investigations results...|$|R
50|$|Cube ice {{machines}} are commonly seen as vertical modular devices. The upper part is an evaporator, {{and the lower}} part is an ice bin. The <b>refrigerant</b> circulates inside <b>pipes</b> of sale-contained evaporator, where it conducts the heat exchange with water, and freezes the water into ice cubes. When the water is thoroughly frozen into ice, it is automatically released, and falls into the ice bin.|$|R
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of fault detection and diagnostics tools for air conditioning systems in the market, a fair and reliable evaluator, which tests the tools with a large array of data points {{from a variety of}} conditions and types of units, is needed. However, the number of data points necessary for reliable evaluation is too large to be generated through physical experiments. Also, existing forward models are difficult to employ for this application because of the requirement to have knowledge of many difficult-to-obtain component parameters and because of very long computation times. To address the issue, a gray box modeling approach is being developed to account for the effects of both operating conditions and faults on performance. This gray-box approach uses experimental data and inverse modeling to determine the values of parameters for each component of a vapor compression cycle. This has led to a fast and robust component-based model that is trained with a limited set of experimental data from normal and faulted conditions, and a few readily available geometrical measurements. Existing component modeling approaches have been simplified {{to reduce the number of}} parameters and computational costs. During parameter training for each component, optimization of a cost function is carried out to minimize residuals between experiments and simulation. This paper presents the models, training approaches, and validation results for individual components for a 3 -ton R 410 A packaged air conditioner. Component models constructed included compressor, condenser, evaporator, fixed orifice expansion device, and <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pipes.</b> A companion paper presents the system-level modeling and validation, along with models and results for simulation of faults...|$|R

The results of processing of experimental data allow estimating the de-gree of applicability of refrigerant as a substitute of the traditional widely wide-spread working substances. These data are compared {{with the results of}} calcula-tions in relation with known dependences. The theoretical and experimental analysis of refrigeration work at replacement of ozone destructing refrigerants to alternative ones helped to draw the conclusion, that in this case the investigated mix can be considered as the most expedient substitute which has thermodynamic properties identical to replaceable refrigerant and does not need change of refrigerating machine design...|$|R
40|$|In the {{perspective}} of increasing global temperatures, the periods with natural snow is shorter and in areas, the snow in the winter is disappearing. Therefore, {{it is important to}} produce snow at temperatures above 0 °C to be able to maintain the snow activity close to the cities. Today, temperature independent snow machines(TIS) produce plate ice, flake ice and ice slurry in temperatures above 0 °C. There are four manufacturers of TIS, IDE Technologies, TechnoAlpin(TA), SnowTech and SnowMagic Inc. The machines are using refrigerants with challenging properties, and CO 2 is investigated as a substitute for these. Vacuum and flake ice systems with a production capacity of 50 tons/day are modelled in EES, to investigate the thermodynamic performance at different ambient temperatures. The flake ice model shows that a single stage system(SCS) consumes less energy than a two-stage system(TCS) in ambient temperatures below 14 °C. The U-value and ice growth rate for the flake ice drum(FID) are highly dependent on the ice thickness. Ice has high thermal resistance, and dictates the heat transfer from water to CO 2 rather than the metals or the refrigerants. The vacuum model shows that a two stage system(TVS) is more efficient than a single stage system(SVS) regardless of the ambient temperature. A cascade system with CO 2 is more energy intensive than the two previous systems. The most efficient vacuum system consumes just 20, 8 % of the energy required by the least efficient flake ice system. In terms of operation costs, the snow from the flake ice system is 4, 8 times more expensive than from the vacuum systems. However, the investment costs are much higher for the vacuum system. Both the SCS and TCS is more energy efficient than the TA SF 100. The energy consumption is 3, 4 % and 1, 8 % lower, respectively. A comparison between the vacuum models and existing machines is difficult, due to little known information about the existing machine. COMSOL was used to do calculations on the FID. The results reveal that increasing the number of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pipes</b> in the FID above 200, do not affect the temperature distribution on the freezing surface too much. In addition, the thickness can be optimized regarding the structural strength, rather than the heat transfer. It is suggested to work further with improving the EES- and COMSOL models, investigate heat recovery possibilities, improving the efficiency of the systems, estimating the life cycle cost, look into operation strategies to minimize the energy consumption, and to build prototypes...|$|R
40|$|The oscillatory {{pressure}} disturbance {{created by}} the <b>refrigerant</b> flow through <b>pipes</b> and components {{is one of the}} main sources of noise in household refrigerators. This type of excitation is transmitted to the pipes and travels through the structure reaching the cabinet and other parts exposed to the air, where audible airborne sound waves are created. In order to get a better understanding of this type of noise a household refrigerator was especially instrumented with thermocouples, absolute and dynamic pressure transducers and accelerometers. Tests were carried out at different operating conditions, when it was found that the compressor was the main source of excitation, practically affecting the entire refrigeration loop. It was also found that the flow velocity at the outlet of the capillary tube was high enough to induce significant vibrations in the evaporator. Finally, it was found that the entrance of vapor bubbles in the capillary tube produces sporadic and strong excitations. However those excitations do not travel very far along the flow, being attenuated by the condenser and the evaporator, but can nevertheless be transmitted to the pipes. In view of the collected database, comments and suggestions concerning the design of household refrigerators are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Boiling flows are {{frequently}} found in industry and engineering {{due to the}} large amount of heat that can be transferred within such flows with minimum temperature differences. In the nuclear industry, boiling affects in different ways the operation of almost all water-cooled nuclear reactors. Recently, the use of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approaches to predict boiling flows is increasing and, in the nuclear area, CFD is being developed to solve thermal hydraulic safety issues such as establishing the critical heat flux, which is perhaps the major threat to the integrity of nuclear fuel rods. In this paper, the accuracy of an Eulerian–Eulerian, two-fluid CFD model is evaluated over a large database of subcooled boiling flows, avoiding the rather popular case-by-case tuning of descriptive models to a limited number of experiments. The model includes a Reynolds stress turbulence model, the method of moments-based S-gamma population balance approach and a boiling model derived using the heat flux partitioning approach. The database covers a large range of conditions in subcooled boiling flows of water and <b>refrigerants</b> in vertical <b>pipes</b> and annular channels. Overall, a satisfactory predictive accuracy is achieved for some quantities of interest, such as the void fraction and the turbulence and liquid temperature fields, but results are less satisfactory in other areas, more specifically for the average bubble diameter and the mean velocity profiles close to the wall in annular channels. Agreement may be improved with advances in the treatment of large bubbles and bubble break-up and coalescence, as well as in improved modelling of the boiling region close to the wall, and more specifically the bubble departure diameter, the wall treatment and the contribution of bubbles to turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Typically, the {{residential}} air conditioner uses capillary tube as an expansion device. The friction between <b>refrigerant</b> flow and <b>pipe</b> wall, {{and also the}} changing of the velocity along capillary tube cause energy loss during expansion. The pressure drop from the condenser to the evaporator caused by capillary tube is considered isenthalpic process. An ejector as an expansion device can be used to recover energy loss during expansion process. Many researchers reported that the use of an ejector as an expansion device in vapor compression refrigeration cycle (VCRC) may lead to increase in the system performance. In this study, the numerical investigations were carried out on {{the residential}} air conditioners using the VCRC for various cooling capacity with R 290 as working fluid. At present, the working fluid of R 22 is widely used as refrigerant in residential air conditioners. Because R 22 has a high global warming potential (GWP), as a result it must be phased out in the near future. Researchers recommended R 290 (propane) as a substitute refrigerant for R 22. As a natural refrigerant, R 290 is abundant and relatively cheaper than that of R 22. In addition, many studies reported that retrofit from R 22 to R 290 in air conditioner may result increase in coefficient of performance (COP). As a result, this study investigates the use of R 290 for replacing R 22 in residential air conditioner for various cooling capacity, viz. 2. 5, 3. 8 and 5. 0 kW or the compressor capacity of 1, 1. 5 and 2 HP. Three equations, i. e., conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy were applied to determine physical properties on each section of the ejector and the performances of the air conditioners. The main geometrics parameter of an ejector is area ratio (AR), which is defined as the ratio between the cross-sectional areas of mixing chamber and motive nozzle. The results showed that the diameter of motive nozzle is constant with the increase in ambient temperature, whereas the mixing chamber diameter slightly increases with the increase in ambient temperature. Meanwhile, the area ratio of ejector decreases with the increase in compressor capacity. In addition, the COP improvements of air conditioners are 4. 94, 12. 24 and 20. 28 % for ambient temperature of 30, 35 and 40 °C, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} unceasing human {{population}} growth and fast economic development, the global energy demand is also increasing unceasingly. Meanwhile, the increasing carbon dioxide emission has become a significant environmental problem. Building energy has now accounted for about 1 / 5 of the primary energy consumption all over the world. The number in China was 23. 39 % in 2009 {{and it is still}} growing fast. In particular, building sector has great potential of energy saving. With the development of renewable energy like solar energy and wind power, the energy structure in China can be more reasonable. What s more, part of the heating demand can be covered by heat pump whose efficiency is much higher than electric heating and gas heating. 	The conversion efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) cell is greatly influenced by its temperature. According to experimental results, every 1 °C rise in cell temperature reduces the conversion efficiency by about 0. 4 % for multi-crystalline cells. Therefore, many researches have been done to decrease the PV panel temperature to increase the performance. Different types of PV/T collectors were developed to realize the comprehensive utilization of solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) energy. The main difference of these collectors is working media which can be air, water, <b>refrigerant</b> and heat <b>pipe.</b> 	When the air or the water was used as working media of PV/T collectors, it was usually heated to a high temperature for direct heating usage. This was actually on the opposite direction of conversion efficiency improvement. In this thesis, a PV panel was combined with a heat pump system. The refrigerant used in this work is propane (R 290) and it is an environmental friendly working fluid whose ODP and GWP is 0 and 3. The evaporator of the heat pump was fixed under the PV panel. This combination, which is called PV evaporator in the following, can improve the conversion efficiency by cooling the PV cells and absorb solar thermal energy to produce hot water with the help of heat pump at the same time. What s more, the temperature of refrigerant is constant and relatively low during evaporation, this is good for the performance of PV cells. Based on the concepts above, a test rig of PV/T heat pump system was designed and built. Experimental researches were taken under summer weather conditions of Trondheim. According to the experimental results, the conversion efficiency of the PV panel can reach 15. 5 % in the best case, it was increased by 6. 9 % compared with the nominal value. The efficiency was influenced by solar radiation, ambient temperature and angle of incidence. A higher ambient temperature leads to a lower efficiency. The influence of the solar irradiance is complicated, ordinarily, a higher solar radiation may cause a decline in efficiency. The PV evaporator can absorb heat both from solar radiation and environment, the heat-collecting efficiency ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 77 in the tests. The COP of the heat pump is greatly influenced by the condenser supply water temperature. COP decreases with the increasing condenser supply water temperature. Solar radiation and ambient temperature {{have a positive impact on}} COP. The average COP of the heat pump can reach 4. 3 when the water was heated from 14. 8 °C to 50. 6 °C. The fractional errors of the measured conversion efficiency, COP are 5 % and 5. 2 %. Simulation of the test rig was made by EES to study the performance of PV/T heat pump system at different places and climates. The effectiveness of the simulation was validated by comparing the simulated results and experimental results. Daily performance analysis on April 30 in Shanghai was done, and it indicated that a higher air temperature leads to a better comprehensive performance. Annual operation simulated results in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi were analyzed. Monthly average value of air temperature, solar radiation and wind speed was adopted as the rated condition for annual performance evaluation. The annual average COP in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi are 3. 5, 2. 8 and 4. 4, respectively. And the annual average conversion efficiency in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi are 16. 4 %, 17. 3 %, 15. 5 %. An air evaporator in parallel and an inverter compressor can be used to improve the performance in cold environment without sufficient sunlight...|$|R
