40|$|Verifying {{a ballot}} for {{correctness}} {{in an election}} is a critical task considering the large, negative repercussions of an incorrect ballot. Studies have shown weaknesses in the ballot review process in electronic voting systems, allowing up to 30 % of the ballot to be changed without being noticed by 68 % of voters (Everett, 2007). There is also a noted lack {{of research on the}} effect of navigation style on electronic voting system usability and <b>review</b> <b>screen</b> performance. In response to these issues, this study evaluated the usability and viability of alternative ballot verification and navigation methods in an electronic voting medium, specifically direct recording electronic (DRE) voting systems. Currently, most DRE’s employ an end-of-ballot review where all selections are confirmed at once {{at the end of the}} ballot, which has been proven to be ineffective. Several studies (Holmes and Kortum, 2013; Selker 2007) have also indicated that in-line confirmation, confirming each selection immediately after making it, and a combination of the two confirmation methods (Ghandi et al., 2005; Cohen et al., 1996) may prove to be a suitable alternatives. The current study tested these methods of verification in terms of performance and usability to determine whether they are viable methods of verification as well as to provide a benchmark for <b>review</b> <b>screen</b> performance in a DRE. The method of navigation through the ballot, the ability to move backwards through the ballot or not after selecting a candidate, was also tested for its impact on usability and performance. The verification methods were evaluated on three metrics of usability as defined by ISO 9241 part 11; efficiency (time to complete a ballot), effectiveness (errors), and satisfaction (subjective usability). Participants cast their ballot in a mock national election using a custom DRE interface. Results indicate that in-line and dual confirmation methods prove to be viable alternatives for DRE review screens. In-line and dual confirmation perform similarly to end-of-ballot confirmation in terms of effectiveness, but differed in other usability and performance aspects, though not necessarily in a negative way. The most efficient method is end-of-ballot review, and dual confirmation produced the longest time spent on the <b>review</b> <b>screen.</b> End-of-ballot confirmation produced the highest satisfaction ratings, though survey results indicated that dual confirmation may be the most appropriate method in terms of voting. Based on the results from this study, further studies should be conducted to determine which confirmation method performs best as an error prevention tool...|$|E

40|$|The Plutonium Facility (TA- 55) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) {{has been}} in {{operation}} for over 15 years. It handles projects such as: stockpile maintenance, surveillance, and dismantlement; pit rebuild; plutonium power source fabrication for long duration spacecraft missions (e. g., Cassini); nuclear materials technology research; nuclear materials storage; and remediation of nuclear waste. The Operations Center of TA- 55 is the nerve center of the facility where operators are on duty around the clock and monitor several thousand data points using the Facility Control System (FCS). The FCS monitors, displays, alarms, and provides some limited control of the following systems; HVAC, fire detection and suppression, radiation detection, electrical, and other miscellaneous systems. The FCS was originally based on late 1970 s digital technology, which is not longer supported by the vendors. Additionally, the equipment failure rates increased notably in the 1990 s. Thus, plans were put into place to upgrade and replace the FCS hardware, software, and display components with modernized equipment. The process was complicated by the facts that: the facility was operational {{and could not be}} totally closed for the modifications; complete documentation was not available for the existing system; the Safety Analyses for the facility {{were in the process of}} being upgraded at the same time; and of course limited time and budgets.

40|$|The {{problems}} in the 2000 election in Florida focused national attention {{on the need for}} usable voting systems. As a result, the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 provided funding for updating voting equipment and many states purchased direct recording electronic (DRE) systems. Although these electronic systems have been widely adopted, they have not been empirically proven to be more usable than their predecessors in terms of ballot completion times, error rates, or satisfaction levels for the average voter. The series of studies reported here provides usability data on DREs to compare with that of previous voting technologies (paper ballots, punch cards, and lever machines). Results indicate that there are not differences between DREs and older methods in efficiency or effectiveness. However, in terms of user satisfaction, the DREs are significantly better than the older methods. Paper ballots also perform well, but participants are much more satisfied with their experiences voting on the DREs. These studies also go beyond usability comparisons and test whether voters notice if their final ballots on the DRE reflect choices other than what the voters selected. Results indicate that over 60 % of voters do not notice if their votes as shown on the <b>review</b> <b>screen</b> are different than how they were selected. Entire races can be added or removed from ballots and voter's candidate selections can be flipped and the majority of users do not notice. Beyond discovering that most voters do not detect the changes, these studies also identify several characteristics of the voter and the voting situation that are important in whether participants will or will not notice the changes. This means that attacks could be targeted to only those people who will most likely not notice the changes. The result is that malicious software installed on a DRE could steal votes right in front of voters with a low probability of being detected...|$|E

40|$|Coincidence Timing Calibration (CTC) is an {{essential}} part of ensuring proper PET scanner function. The purpose of CTC is to account for timing differences in detector modules. The importance and precision in which this calibration needs to work is even more stringent for Time-of-Flight (TOF) PET. In this work, we looked to investigate the CTC process by which the TOF capable GE PET/CT Discovery- 690 (D 690) operates. Currently, it uses a 68 Ge rotating pin source (RPS) to perform the calibration. The purpose of this work was to investigate the use of a centrally located source to perform the calibration. The timing resolution of the D 690 was determined and used as a metric to evaluate both methods. 	Two cylindrical 18 F filled phantoms of 7. 5 and 10 cm diameter were used to perform the CTC. The RPS and system table motion had to be disabled in order to use the centrally located sources in the CTC. All CTCs started with the default calibration file in place. Iterations of the CTC were performed until convergence of the calibration was observed on the <b>review</b> <b>screen.</b> Even after convergence, more iterations were performed for further analysis. At the end of the CTC with the centrally located sources, a follow-up iteration with the RPS was performed to see what adjustments would be made. Next, the timing resolution of the system was measured using a 68 Ge line source. An apparatus with known locations to support the source allowed for the evaluation of the timing resolution off the central axis. The importance of this was that it allowed for non-centrally located lines of response to be evaluated. Furthermore, the timing resolution was measured with specific calibration files enabled that corresponded to particular iterations. In addition, a novel way of measuring the timing resolution (propagated method) for a particular calibration result without an actual measurement with that calibration enabled was developed and implemented. This greatly reduced the number of resolution measurements needed, which was particularly helpful for evaluating the improvement for each iteration. 	The timing resolution of the system improved as more iterations were done. The difference between the propagated and measured timing resolution was under 2 % most of the time. The cases in which the discrepancy was larger than 2 % corresponded to one of the first iterations performed. After 15 iterations were performed for both centrally located scanners, the timing resolution of the system was measured through propagation to be 610 ps. The 15 iterations amounts to 15 minutes of acquisition time. After one iteration for the RPS, the timing resolution was measured to be 585 ps (587 ps in the propagated measurement). The single iteration of the RPS corresponded to 8 minutes of acquisition time. When following up the final iterations of the centrally located sources with the RPS, there was a change observed that improved the timing resolution to that measured after only one iteration of the RPS. 	Conclusively, trends in the data showed that the centrally located sources did bring opposing detectors into good timing alignment with one another. These trends also indicated that the current CTC algorithm is not optimized for centrally located sources for the diameters tested. Finally, the method of propagating the change in calibration files illustrated a new CTC process method. Thesi...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{develop and}} test a {{utilization}} <b>review</b> <b>screening</b> tool {{for use in}} European hospitals. Setting. In 1993 a group of researchers financed by a European Union grant reviewed the use of utilization review in Europe. They quickly noticed a lack of specifically designed instruments able {{to take into account}} the health care and cultural differences across Europe, and available for use in different health care systems. Hence, they embarked upon the task of developing and testing a utilization <b>review</b> <b>screening</b> tool for use in European hospitals. Results. The European-Union-Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol's list of reasons was developed and assessed. This is a common taxonomy that classifies days identified as unnecessary and provides a list of levels of care to identify patients' needs. This new protocol not only substitutes for the multiple previous local versions of the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol, but will also facilitate comparisons of the varying experiences in European countries. Main findings. Development of utilization review in Europe has been carried out mostly on a voluntary basis and the main objective was not control. The experience varies widely: from France, where utilization review is still developing and research has been implemented by local teams, to Portugal, where utilization review programmes have been initiated by government authorities.
