50|$|The {{concept of}} {{microstructure}} is observable in macrostructural features in commonplace objects. Galvanized steel, {{such as the}} casing of a lamp post or <b>road</b> <b>divider,</b> exhibits a non-uniformly colored patchwork of interlocking polygons of different shades of grey or silver. Each polygon is a single crystal of zinc adhering {{to the surface of}} the steel beneath. Zinc and lead are two common metals which form large crystals (grains) visible to the naked eye. The atoms in each grain are organized into one of seven 3d stacking arrangements or crystal lattices (cubic, tetrahedral, hexagonal, monoclinic, triclinic, rhombohedral and orthorhombic). The direction of alignment of the matrices differ between adjacent crystals, leading to variance in the reflectivity of each presented face of the interlocked grains on the galvanized surface. The average grain size can be controlled by processing conditions and composition, and most alloys consist of much smaller grains not visible to the naked eye. This is to increase the strength of the material (see Hall-Petch Strengthening).|$|E

Ohba was driving his new 1973 ivory Chevrolet Corvette down an expressway in Tokyo, when he hit a heavy duty eleven ton parked truck on the shoulder of the opposite lane. His Corvette had jumped the <b>road</b> <b>divider</b> when he was unable to negotiate a turn and he was unable to regain control. He was driving around sixty, in a thirty-six mile per hour zone and was an inexperienced driver, having only obtained his driver's license three months before the crash. He was only 23 years old, and still in possession of the WBA title. [...] As a dutiful son, he had just bought his parents a new home. On February 5, 1973, a funeral service was held by the World Boxing Association at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, where he had once boxed. A separate service had been held at his home in Kasuwbe, twenty miles north of Tokyo.|$|E
50|$|Early {{in season}} Gemma is raped by Sons of Anarchy rival AJ Weston {{and two other}} unknown men wearing white masks. During the assault, Gemma is told to tell Clay that it will happen again {{if he does not}} end his {{dealings}} with minorities. Later, Gemma realizes Weston is one of her rapists, when she recognizes his tattoos. When her friend Unser finds her at the rape scene, Gemma demands that he not tell Clay or Jax about the rape so as not to play into AJ Weston and Ethan Zobelle's plans to get Clay and/or Jax to do something rash. Unser complies and further covers up the source of Gemma's injuries by crashing her car into a <b>road</b> <b>divider</b> and taking her to the hospital. The only other person whom Gemma confides in about the rape is Tara Knowles, Jax's girlfriend. Unser later realizes that Chief Deputy Hale is starting to become more involved with Zobelle and his people and tells Hale about Gemma's assault. This causes Hale to re-evaluate his dealing with Zobelle. The rape leaves Gemma with significant and visible emotional trauma, which causes problems in her marriage with Clay. She also feels somewhat paranoid that AJ might try to attack her again. Her paranoia is further compounded when someone from L.O.A.N. mails one of the rapists' white masks to her.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} identifies roadway, traffic, {{and environmental}} factors that influence the injury severity of road traffic crashes in Dhaka. Dhaka provides a rather unusual driving risk environment to study, since virtually anyone can obtain a drivers’ license and very little traffic enforcement and fines are given when drivers violate traffic rules. To examine this city with presumed heightened crash severity risk, police reported crash data from 2007 to 2011 containing about 2714 road traffic crashes were collected. The injury severity of traffic crashes—recorded as either fatal, serious injury, or property damage only—were modeled using an ordered Probit model. Significant factors increasing the probability of fatal injuries include crashes along highways (65 %), absence of a <b>road</b> <b>divider</b> (80 %), crashes during night time (54 %), and vehicle-pedestrian collisions (367 %); whereas two-way traffic configuration (21 %), and traffic police controlled schemes (41 %) decrease the probability of fatalities. Both similarities and differences of the findings between crash risk in Dhaka and developed countries are discussed in policy relevant terms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} properties of concrete containing different particle sizes of crumb rubber. This research {{have been conducted}} on 10 % replacement of fine aggregates by three different particle sizes of crumb rubber which are 1 mm crumb rubber, 0. 4 – 1 mm fine dust crumb rubber, and 0. 2 – 0. 6 mm powder crumb rubber. Laboratory tests include slump test, compressive test, flexural test, bulk density test, water absorption test, porosity test, and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test were conducted on the concrete mixes. All concrete specimens were tested {{at the age of}} 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. The results from laboratory testing on concrete specimens were analyzed. It was found that in the inclusion of crumb rubber into concrete, it will reduce the strength of concrete. The usage of greater particle sizes of crumb rubber which is 1 mm crumb rubber gives better strength of concrete compared to the usage of smaller particle sizes of crumb rubber which is 0. 2 – 0. 6 mm powder crumb rubber. Therefore, the rubberized concrete can absorb the impact energy and suitable usage in roads and highways construction such as <b>road</b> <b>divider,</b> road pavement, and others because it can absorb impact from vehicles load, disaster and others...|$|E
40|$|Statistical or crash {{prediction}} model have frequently {{been used in}} highway safety studies. They {{can be used in}} identify major contributing factors or establish relationship between crashes and explanatory accident variables. The measurements to prevent accident are from the speed reduction, widening the roads, speed enforcement, or construct the <b>road</b> <b>divider,</b> or other else. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to develop an accident {{prediction model}} at federal road FT 050 Batu Pahat to Kluang. The study process involves the identification of accident blackspot locations, establishment of general patterns of accident, analysis of the factors involved, site studies, and development of accident prediction model using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) applied software which named NeuroShell 2. The significant of the variables that are selected from these accident factors are checked to ensure the developed model can give a good prediction results. The performance of neural network is evaluated by using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The study result showed that the best neural network for accident prediction model at federal road FT 050 is 4 - 10 - 1 with 0. 1 learning rate and 0. 2 momentum rate. This network model contains the lowest value of MAPE and highest value of linear correlation, r which is 0. 8986. This study has established the accident point weightage as the rank of the blackspot section by kilometer along the FT 050 road (km 1 – km 103). Several main accident factors also have been determined along this road, and after all the data gained, it has successfully analyzed by using artificial neural network...|$|E

The north end of Lakepoint Road can be found at the shared intersection with Pikes Pond Road. North of there, the road moves away from the tracks again near a side road and former segment called [...] "Blossom Loop" [...] on the southbound side and enters Round Lake where the divider ends again. Blossom Loop ends at US 231 just south of the intersection with Felix Street, but another former segment named [...] "Dryer Street" [...] begins on the northbound side just north of the same intersection, although this former segment is shorter than the latter.

The surroundings in this segment are a repeat of the one south of Round Lake, but the divided section is short-lived however as it eventually approaches a bridge over Stump Creek entering Alford where the divider ends and the road becomes Georgia Street. Compared to the other communities north of Panama City, Alford is more developed and has more paved intersections, among them County Road 1656 (formerly State Road 276A).
