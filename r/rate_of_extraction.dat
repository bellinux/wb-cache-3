Coal was exported to London and other parts of England, but also to Holland, France and Flanders. Coal became by far the most valuable local commodity. As with other traded items, coal could only move through the city of Newcastle if its buying and selling were handled by the town's burgesses.

40|$|Incorporating {{ecological}} disturbance into biogeochemical {{models is}} critical for estimating current and future carbon stocks and fluxes. In particular, anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest conversion and wood harvest, strongly affect forest carbon dynamics within North America. This paper summarizes recent (2000. 2008) <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction,</b> including both conversion and harvest, derived from national forest inventories for North America (the United States, Canada, and Mexico). During the 2000 s, 6. 1 million ha/yr were affected by harvest, another 1. 0 million ha/yr were converted to other land uses through gross deforestation, and 0. 4 million ha/yr were degraded. Thus about 1. 0 % of North America fs forests experienced some form of anthropogenic disturbance each year. However, due to harvest recovery, afforestation, and reforestation, the total forest area on the continent has been roughly stable during the decade. On average, about 110 m 3 of roundwood volume was extracted per hectare harvested across the continent. Patterns <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> vary among the three countries, with U.
