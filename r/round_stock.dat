6000|$|It is {{difficult}} to disconnect the idea of ships' anchors {{from the idea of}} the ship's chief mate--the man who sees them go down clear and come up sometimes foul; because not even the most unremitting care can always prevent a ship, swinging to winds and tide, from taking an awkward turn of the cable <b>round</b> <b>stock</b> or fluke. Then the business of [...] "getting the anchor" [...] and securing it afterwards is unduly prolonged, and made a weariness to the chief mate. He is the man who watches the growth of the cable--a sailor's phrase which has all the force, precision, and imagery of technical language that, created by simple men with keen eyes for the real aspect of the things they see in their trade, achieves the just expression seizing upon the essential, which is the ambition of the artist in words. Therefore the sailor will never say, [...] "cast anchor," [...] and the ship-master aft will hail his chief mate on the forecastle in impressionistic phrase: [...] "How does the cable grow?" [...] Because [...] "grow" [...] is the right word for the long drift of a cable emerging aslant under the strain, taut as a bow-string above the water. And it is the voice of the keeper of the ship's anchors that will answer: [...] "Grows right ahead, sir," [...] or [...] "Broad on the bow," [...] or whatever concise and deferential shout will fit the case.|$|E

50|$|Aepli’s style {{might best}} be {{described}} as the evolution of Modernism, the Bauhaus and Art Déco. Using a scientific approach, compositions would methodically evolve from the basic geometric shapes, using nothing but flat, square or <b>round</b> <b>stock.</b> Yet a close observation of nature and its creations led him to conclude that there were no incorrect forms, colors or sounds in nature, which is recognizable throughout his decade-long creative activity.|$|E
50|$|Historic saddles of the 19th {{century had}} rigging rings made of forged iron <b>round</b> <b>stock,</b> which would rust {{if it was}} exposed to the horse’s sweat. The iron oxide would degrade and rot the leather that it came in contact with, which caused the rigging straps that were held by the rings to break. In order to correct this problem, saddle makers covered the metal rings in 4-5 ounces of medium {{thickness}} belly leather. This was a common remedy for the problem until approximately 1915, when brass rigging hardware became more common.|$|E
5000|$|The drones ("passitoru", [...] "pass", [...] "kai", [...] "tori", [...] "pill", [...] "pulk", [...] "toro") {{were made}} of wooden pipes, {{different}} in shape and diameter.The number of pipes determined their length. If there is only one, it is quite long, if two, they are both shorter. In some rare cases bagpipes with 3 drones could be found.The drone consists of 2 - 3 separate joints. In the lower end there is a wooden bell. The joints can be pulled out in order to tune the drone. The drone is placed in an oval or <b>round</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E

5000|$|All chanters and drones {{are fixed}} {{into a single}} <b>round</b> <b>stock</b> that the bag is {{attached}} to. Each chanter is tuned differently, according to the tradition it represents, and there are dozens. Typically, the double-reeded versions (Marche, Abruzzo, Latium, Campania, southern Basilicata and parts of Sicily and southern Calabria) will have a soprano chanter {{on the right and}} a bass chanter on the left (called, respectively, [...] "ritta" [...] and [...] "manga" [...] — meaning 'right' and 'left' — in the Ciociaro tradition) with an alto drone (bordone being the generic name); but as many as three drones, the other tuned above and below the basic chord can be used, or, {{in the case of the}} Marches tradition, no drones at all.|$|E

Drill rod diameters range from 0.0135 to 1.5 in; in the United States diameters smaller than th of an inch are made in letter drill sizes and number drill sizes, in addition to fractional sizes. Lengths are usually one or three feet (0.3 or 0.9 m). It is commonly used to make drill bits, taps, reamers, punches, dowel pins, and shafts.

50|$|Traditionally {{the bags}} {{are made from}} goat hides that are removed from the {{slaughtered}} animal in one piece, cured, turned inside out, then tied off {{just in front of}} the rear legs, one of the front legs serving to house the blow pipe with its simple leather valve (soffietto), and the other tied off. The typical <b>round</b> <b>stock</b> into which both chanters and drones are fixed goes into the neck of the skin. The hair is left on, and is contained in the inside of the bag (otre). Today, however, some pipers are substituting the traditional goat and sheep hide bags with a rubber inner tube or wintex which is covered with an artificial fleece. This practice of using the synthetic bag is particularly popular among the pipers from Scapoli in the Molise region, and those of Atina in Latium.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the mechanics of deformation of the four-roll pass cold rolling using an elastic-plastic finite element program. This process has been developed at the Anshan Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, People’s Republic of China, where a new four-roll pass small section cold rolling mill has been built. The initial finite element analysis has been carried out for the rolling of 8 mm square section bar from I 0 mm diameter <b>round</b> <b>stock</b> under dry friction conditions. The results show clearly how the areas of plastic dejormation develop during the rolling process. The distributions of the generalized stress and the generalized plastic strain, both on the longitudinal symmetrical plane and on the transverse cross-sections of the workpiece, have been obtained, and the pressure distribution along the arc of contact has been determined. In addition, the roll separation force and the puss elongation of the workpiece predicted by the finite element program have been compared with the corresponding values measured in experiments when rolling 6. 5 mm square section barfrom 8 mm round material with machine oil lubrication. Good agreement has been obtained. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{three sets}} of depth-of-penetration experiments with limestone targets and 3. 0 caliber-radius-head (CRH), ogive-nose steel rod projectiles. The limestone targets had a nominal unconfined compressive strength of 60 MPa, a density of 2. 31 kg/m{sup 3 }, a porosity of 15 %, and a water content less than 0. 4 %. The ogive-nose rod projectiles with length-to-diameter ratios often were machined from 4340 R{sub c} 45 and Aer Met 100 R{sub c} 53 steel, <b>round</b> <b>stock</b> and had diameters and masses of 7. 1 mm, 0. 020 kg; 12. 7 mm, 0. 117 kg; and 25. 4 mm, 0. 931 kg. Powder guns or a two-stage, light-gas gun launched the projectiles at normal impacts to striking velocities between 0. 4 and 1. 9 km/s. For the 4340 R{sub c} 45 and Aer Met 100 R{sub c} 53 steel projectiles, penetration depth increased as striking velocity increased to a striking velocity of 1. 5 and 1. 7 km/s, respectively. For larger striking velocities, the projectiles deformed during penetration without nose erosion, deviated from the shot line, and exited {{the sides of the}} target. We also developed an analytical penetration equation that described the target resistance by its density and a strength parameter determined from depth of penetration versus striking velocity data...|$|E
40|$|Machinability of Aermet 100, an {{ultrahigh}} strength alloy {{developed for}} Navy by Carpenter Technology {{as a candidate}} material for aircraft landing gear application, was studied by performing single-point turning tests. Coated and uncoated carbides, ceramic, and cermet cutting tool inserts of a square geometry (SNG 432 type) were used. <b>Round</b> <b>stock</b> workpieces were tested in the as - received, unaged condition and without using any cutting fluid. The turning tests for each tool material were conducted by (i) first establishing the cutting conditions {{that would allow the}} continued generation of broken chips during a given cutting test, (ii) measuring intermittently the flank wear as a function of cutting time under such established cutting conditions for discontinuous broken chips, and (iii) determining the tool life using the criteria specified in the ISO Standard 3685 : 1993 (E). Cutting tools except some uncoated carbide and ceramic were used with a mechanical chip breaker to induce chip breakage and avoid the generation of long continuous chips. The results obtained include the optimal cutting conditions for discontinuous chips, tool wear - cutting time curves, and records of tool life and tool failure mode for each tool material. From the measured tool life and cutting conditions, the amount of material removed by each cutting material was calculated. Coated carbide with CVD tri-phase coating showed the longest tool life that exceeded the twelve minute criterion and removed the highest amount of material per tool. Other tools failed by cutting edge chipping and their lives were shorter...|$|E
