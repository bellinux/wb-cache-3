40|$|Four {{hand-held}} {{tools were}} tested for failed high-level waste melter decontamination and decommissioning (D&D). The forces {{felt by the}} tools during operation were measured using a tri-axial accelerometer since they will be operated by a remote manipulator. The efficiency of the tools was also recorded. Melter D&D consists of three parts: (1) glass fracturing: removing from the furnace the melted glass {{that can not be}} poured out through normal means, (2) glass cleaning: removing the thin layer of glass that has formed over the surface of the refractory material, and (3) K- 3 refractory breakup: removing the K- 3 refractory material. Surrogate glass, from a formula provided by the Savannah River Site, was melted in a furnace and poured into steel containers. K- 3 refractory material, the same material used in the Defense Waste Processing Facility, was utilized for the demonstrations. Four K- 3 blocks were heated at 1150 C for two weeks with a glass layer on top to simulate the hardened glass layer on the refractory surface in the melter. Tools chosen for the demonstrations were commonly used D&D tools, which have not been tested specifically for the different aspects of melter D&D. A jackhammer and a needle gun were tested for glass fracturing; a needle gun and a rotary grinder with a diamond face wheel (diamond grinder) were tested for glass cleaning; and a jackhammer, diamond grinder, and a circular saw with a diamond blade were tested for refractory breakup. The needle gun was not capable of removing or fracturing the surrogate glass. The diamond grinder only had a removal rate of 3. 0 x 10 - 4 kg/s for K- 3 refractory breakup and needed to be held firmly against the material. However, the diamond grinder was effective for glass cleaning, with a removal rate of 3. 9 cm 2 /s. The jackhammer was successful in fracturing glass and breaking up the K- 3 <b>refractory</b> <b>block.</b> The jackhammer had a glass-fracturing rate of 0. 40 kg/s.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of the waste treatment plant (WTP) being built at the Hanford Site {{is not sufficient to}} process all of the tank waste accumulated from more than 40 years of nuclear materials production.

Bulk vitrification combines LAW and glass-forming chemicals in a large metal container and melts the contents using electrical resistance heating. A castable <b>refractory</b> <b>block</b> (CRB) is used along with sand to insulate the container from the heat generated while melting the contents into a glass waste form. This report describes engineering-scale (ES) and full-scale (FS) tests that have been conducted. Several ES tests showed that a small fraction of soluble Tc moves in the CRB and results in a groundwater peak different than WTP glass. The total soluble Tc- 99 fraction in the FS CRB is expected to be different than that determined in the ES tests, but until FS test results are available, the best-estimate soluble Tc- 99 fraction from the ES tests {{has been used as a}} conservative estimate. The first FS test results are from cold simulant tests that have been spiked with Re. An estimated scale-up factor extrapolates the Tc- 99 data collected at the ES to the FS bulk vitrification waste package. Test FS- 38 A tested the refractory design and did not have a Re spike. Samples were taken and analyzed to help determine Re CRB background concentrations using a Re-spiked, six-tank composite simulant mixed with soil and glass formers to produce the waste feed. Although this feed is not physically the same as the Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System feed, the chemical make-up is the same. Extensive sampling of the CRB was planned, but difficulties with the test prevented completion of a full box.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the work {{reported}} here is to analyze the potential effect of the release of technetium (Tc) from metal inclusions in bulk vitrification waste packages once they are placed in the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF). As part of the strategy for immobilizing waste from the underground tanks at Hanford, selected wastes will be immobilized using bulk vitrification. During analyses of the glass produced in engineering-scale tests, metal inclusions were found in the glass product. This report contains the results from experiments designed to quantify the corrosion rates of metal inclusions found in the glass product from AMEC Test ES- 32 B and simulations designed to compare the rate of Tc release from the metal inclusions to the release of Tc from glass produced with the bulk vitrification process. In the simulations, the Tc in the metal inclusions was assumed to be released congruently during metal corrosion as soluble TcO 4 -. The experimental results and modeling calculations show that the metal corrosion rate will, under all conceivable conditions at the IDF, be dominated by the presence of the passivating layer and corrosion products on the metal particles. As a result, the release of Tc from the metal particles at the surfaces of fractures in the glass releases at a rate similar to the Tc present as a soluble salt. The release of the remaining Tc in the metal is controlled by the dissolution of the glass matrix. To summarize, the release of 99 Tc from the BV glass within precipitated Fe is directly proportional to the diameter of the Fe particles and to the amount of precipitated Fe. However, the main contribution to the Tc release from the iron particles is over the same time period as the release of the soluble Tc salt. For the base case used in this study (0. 48 mass% of 0. 5 mm diameter metal particles homogeneously distributed in the BV glass), the release of 99 Tc from the metal is approximately the same as the release from 0. 3 mass% soluble Tc salt in the castable <b>refractory</b> <b>block</b> and it is released over the same time period as the salt. Therefore, to limit the impact of precipitated Fe on the release of 99 Tc, both the amount of precipitated Fe in the BV glass and the diameter of these particles should be minimized...|$|E
40|$|Bulk {{vitrification}} (BV) {{was selected}} for a pilot-scale test and demonstration facility for supplemental treatment to accelerate the cleanup of low-activity waste (LAW) at the Hanford U. S. DOE Site. During engineering-scale (ES) tests, {{a small fraction of}} radioactive Tc (and Re, its nonradioactive surrogate) were transferred out of the LAW glass feed and molten LAW glass, and deposited on the surface and within the pores of the castable <b>refractory</b> <b>block</b> (CRB). Laboratory experiments were undertaken to understand the mechanisms of the transport Tc/Re into the CRB during vitrification and to evaluate various means of CRB protection against the deposition of leachable Tc/Re. The tests used Re as a chemical surrogate for Tc. The tests with the baseline CRB showed that the molten LAW penetrates into CRB pores before it converts to glass, leaving deposits of sulfates and chlorides when the nitrate components decompose. Na 2 O from the LAW reacts with the CRB to create a durable glass phase that may contain Tc/Re. Limited data from a single CRB sample taken from an ES experiment indicate that, while a fraction of Tc/Re is present in the CRB in a readily leachable form, most of the Tc/Re deposited in the refractory is retained {{in the form of a}} durable glass phase. In addition, the molten salts from the LAW, mainly sulfates, chlorides, and nitrates, begin to evaporate from BV feeds at temperatures below 800 C and condense on solid surfaces at temperatures below 530 C. Three approaches aimed at reducing or preventing the deposition of soluble Tc/Re within the CRB were proposed: metal lining, sealing the CRB surface with a glaze, and lining the CRB with ceramic tiles. Metal liners were deemed unsuitable because evaluations showed that they can cause unacceptable distortions of the electric field in the BV system. Sodium silicate and a low-alkali borosilicate glaze were selected for testing. The glazes slowed down molten salt condensate penetration, but did little to reduce the penetration of molten salt. Out of several refractory tile candidates, only greystone and fused-cast alumina-zirconia-silica (AZS) refractory remained intact and well bonded to the CRB after firing to 1000 C. The deformation of the refractory-tile composite was avoided by prefiring the greystone tile to 800 C. Condensed vapors did not penetrate the tiles, but Re salts condensed on their surface. Refractory corrosion tests indicated that a 0. 25 -inch-thick greystone tile would not corrode during a BV melt. Tiles can reduce both vapor penetration and molten salt penetration, but vapor deposition above the melt line will occur even on tiles. The Tc/Re transport scenario was outlined as follows. At temperatures below 700 C, molten ionic salt (MIS) that includes all the Tc/Re penetrates, by capillarity, from the feed into the CRB open porosity. At approximately 750 C, the MIS decomposes through the loss of NOx, leaving mainly sulfate and chloride salts. The Na 2 O formed in the decomposition of the nitrates reacts with insoluble grains in the feed and with the aluminosilicates in the CRB to form more viscous liquids that reduce further liquid penetration into the CRB. At 800 to 1000 C, a continuous glass phase traps the remains of the MIS in the form of inclusions in the bulk glass melt. At 1000 to 1200 C, the salt inclusions in the glass slowly dissolve but also rise to the surface. The Tc/Re salts also evaporate from the free surface of the glass melt that is rapidly renewed by convective currents. The vapors condense on cooler surfaces in the upper portion of the CRB, the box lid, and the off-gas system...|$|E

The estimation and {{detection of}} stimuli by sensory neurons {{is affected by}} factors that govern a transition from tonic to burst mode and the frequency chracteristics of burst output. Pyramidal cells in the electrosensory lobe of weakly electric fish generate spike bursts {{for the purpose of}} stimulus detec-tion. Spike bursts are generated during repetitive discharge when a frequency-dependent broadening of dendritic spikes increases current flow from dendrite to soma to potentiate a somatic depolarizing afterpotential (DAP). The DAP eventually triggers a somatic spike doublet with an interspike interval that falls inside the dendritic <b>refractory</b> period, <b>blocking</b> spike backpropagiation and the DAP. Repetition of this process gives rise to a rhythmic dendritic spike failure, termed conditional backpropagation, that converts cell output from tonic to burst discharge. Through in vitro recordings and com-partmental modeling we show that burst frequency is regulated by the rate of DAP potentiation during a burst, which determines the time required to discharge the spike doublet that blocks backpropagation. DAP potentiation is maginfied through a postitve feedback process when an increase in dendritic spike duration activates persistent sodium current (INaP). INaP further promotes a slow depolarization that induces a shift from tonic to burst discharge over time. The results are consistent with a dynamical systems analysis that shows that the threshold separating tonic and burst discharge can be represented as a saddle-node bifurcation. The interaction between dendritic K current and INaP provides a physiological explanation for a variable time scale of bursting dynamics characteristic of such a bifurcation...|$|R

40|$|For {{about four}} decades, {{radioactive}} wastes {{have been collected}} and calcined from nuclear fuels reprocessing at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), formerly Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP). Over this time span, secondary radioactive wastes have also been collected and stored as liquid from decontamination, laboratory activities, and fuel-storage activities. These liquid wastes are collectively called sodium-bearing wastes (SBW). About 5. 7 million liters of these wastes are temporarily stored in stainless steel tanks at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Vitrification is being considered as an immobilization step for SBW {{with a number of}} treatment and disposal options. A systematic study was undertaken to develop a glass composition to demonstrate direct vitrification of INEEL's SBW. The objectives of this study were to show the feasibility of SBW vitrification, not a development of an optimum formulation. The waste composition is relatively high in sodium, aluminum, and sulfur. A specific composition and glass property restrictions, discussed in Section 2, were used as a basis for the development. Calculations based on first-order expansions of selected glass properties in composition and some general tenets of glass chemistry led to an additive (fit) composition (68. 69 mass % SiO{sub 2 }, 14. 26 mass% B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, 11. 31 mass% Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, 3. 08 mass% TiO{sub 2 }, and 2. 67 mass % Li{sub 2 }O) that meets all property restrictions when melted with 35 mass % of SBW on an oxide basis, The glass was prepared using oxides, carbonates, and boric acid and tested to confirm the acceptability of its properties. Glass was then made using waste simulant at three facilities, and limited testing was performed to test and optimize processing-related properties and confirm results of glass property testing. The measured glass properties are given in Section 4. The viscosity at 1150 C, 5 Pa{center_dot}s, is nearly ideal for waste-glass processing in a standard liquid-fed joule-heated melter. The normalized elemental releases by 7 -day PCT are all well below 1 g/m{sup 2 }, which is a very conservative set point used in this study. The T{sub L}, ignoring sulfate formation, is less than the 1050 C limit. Based on these observations and the reasonable waste loading of 35 mass 0 / 0, the SBW glass was a prime candidate for further testing. Sulfate salt segregation was observed in all test melts formed from oxidized carbonate precursors. Melts fabricated using SBW simulants suggest that the sulfate-salt segregation seen in oxide and carbonate melts was much less of a problem. The cause for the difference is likely H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } fuming during the boil-down stage of wet-slurry processing. Additionally, some crucible tests with SBW simulant were conducted at higher temperatures (1250 C), which could increase the volatility of sulfate salts. The fate of sulfate during the melting process is still uncertain and should be the topic of future studies. The properties of the simulant glass confirmed those of the oxide and carbonate glass. Corrosion tests on Inconel 690 electrodes and K- 3 <b>refractory</b> <b>blocks</b> conducted at INEEL suggest that the glass is not excessively corrosive. Based on the results of this study, the authors recommend that a glass made of 35 % SBW simulant (on a mass oxide and halide basis) and 65 % of the additive mix (either filled or raw chemical) be used in demonstrating the direct vitrification of INEEL SBW. It is further recommended that a study be conducted to determine the fate of sulfate during glass processing and the tolerance of the chosen melter technology to sulfate salt segregation and corrosivity of the melt...|$|R

Although life-threatening effects are rarely observed in overdose, some previous reports have described the occurrence of cardiac toxicity. The management of sodium channel blocking agent-induced cardiotoxicity conventionally requires sodium bicarbonate administration.

OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study is}} to report the use of intravenous lipid emulsion as adjunctive therapy in a case of lamotrigine overdose in which electrocardiographic changes were unresponsive to bicarbonate therapy. CASE REPORT: We report a case of intentional lamotrigine overdose in a 50 -year-old woman who lost consciousness and developed electrocardiographic aberrations, including widening of QRS with occurrence of left bundle branch block. The patient was initially treated with sodium bicarbonate without effect. Recovery of cardiac conduction was rapidly achieved after infusion of a 20 % lipid emulsion. The exact mechanism of action of lipid emulsion is not fully understood. The lipophilic properties of lamotrigine suggest that it was partially removed by the plasmatic lipid emulsion.

In view of rapid infrastructure growth, there is an emerging need for development of cementitious materials or fillers either to replace cement or fine aggregate for stable growth. One of the industrial wastes is secondary aluminium dross. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the mechanical and durability aspects of concrete incorporated with secondary aluminium dross. Cement has been partially replaced by secondary aluminium dross in different proportions to study the mechanical and durability aspects. Various properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, sorptivity, water absorption, rapid chloride penetration have been studied for the usefulness of secondary aluminium dross as construction material. It is observed that up to 15 % replacement of cement by secondary aluminium dross, the responses are comparable with the conventional concrete. Studies have also been carried out by adding other supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and silica fume in various proportions along with secondary aluminium dross and found the improved mechanical and durability properties. From the overall study, it can be concluded that the concrete incorporated with secondary aluminium dross can be used for making paver <b>blocks,</b> <b>refractory</b> bricks and for normal concrete strength applications...|$|R
40|$|Recent testing {{performed}} at the plasma research center of Retech Systems, LLC processed simulated low- level radioactive wastes (LLW) at a production scale using high-energy plasma as a heat source. Various combinations of metal-oxide feeds were processed {{in order to determine}} their effect on plasma torch operation, throughput, plant performance, glass chemistry and density of poured wastes. Testing took place in November of 1999 using a full-scale production Plasma Arc Centrifugal Treatment (PACT) system located at Retech where the melt zone is a rotating cylindrica l hearth (centrifuge) and the heating source is a swirl flow, hollow electrode, plasma arc torch. The simulated LLW included concrete cinder <b>block,</b> <b>refractory</b> insulation board, soda-lime glass, and sand. This study has shown that processing these simulated LLW and forming slags of various compositions is difficult if the instantaneous feed composition is very high in silica. The electrical resistance of pure silica is high, especially at low temperatures, increasing plasma torch operating voltage markedly. Because the sand can spread rapidly over the centrifuge bottom, feed rates must be reduced when nearly pure sand is fed to reduce the thickness of the unmelted, unmixed surface centrifuge contents. The difficulties may occur either because a whole drum of sand is fed, or because of segregation of sand while a previously mixed drum is fed through our Archimedes type feeder...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicrometric lipid {{compartmentation}} at {{the plasma}} membrane is disputed. Using live confocal imaging, {{we found that}} three unrelated fluorescent sphingomyelin (SM) analogs spontaneously clustered at the outer leaflet into micrometric domains, contrasting with homogeneous labelling by DiIC 18 and TMA-DPH. In erythrocytes, these domains were round, randomly distributed, and reversibly coalesced under hypotonicity. BODIPY-SM and -glucosylceramide showed distinct temperature-dependence, in the same ranking as Tm for corresponding natural lipids, indicating phase behaviour. Scanning electron microscopy excluded micrometric surface structural features. In CHO cells, similar surface micrometric patches were produced by either direct BODIPY-SM insertion or intracellular processing from BODIPY-ceramide, ruling out aggregation artefacts. BODIPY-SM surface micrometric patches were <b>refractory</b> to endocytosis <b>block</b> or actin depolymerization and clustered upon cholesterol deprivation, indicating self-clustering at the plasma membrane. BODIPY-SM excimers further suggested clustering in ordered domains. Segregation of BODIPY-SM and -lactosylceramide micrometric domains showed coexistence of distinct phases. Consistent with micrometric domain boundaries, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed restriction of BODIPY-SM lateral diffusion over long-range, but not short-range, contrasting with comparable high mobile fraction of BODIPY-lactosylceramide in both ranges. Controlled perturbations of endogenous SM pool similarly affected BODIPY-SM domain size by confocal imaging and its mobile fraction by FRAP. The latter evidence supports the hypothesis that, as shown for BODIPY-SM, endogenous SM spontaneously clusters at the plasmalemma outer leaflet of living cells into ordered micrometric domains, defined in shape by liquid-phase coexistence and in size by membrane tension and cholesterol. This proposal remains speculative and calls for further investigations...|$|R
