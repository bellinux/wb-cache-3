5|$|During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, {{six weeks}} before the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close <b>range</b> <b>as</b> she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese.

5|$|Gregory Mathews {{described}} the western subspecies perplexus in 1912, naming it the southwestern crow and noting {{that it was}} smaller than the nominate subspecies. He called C. coronoides coronoides the eastern crow, listing its <b>range</b> <b>as</b> New South Wales, and described {{what is now the}} Australian crow as another subspecies, C. coronoides cecilae, calling it the north-western crow and recording its <b>range</b> <b>as</b> northwestern Australia. In the same work he listed the raven as Corvus marianae, with a type specimen from Gosford and listing its <b>range</b> <b>as</b> New South Wales. He listed the little raven and forest raven as subspecies. Mathews had erected C. marianae in 1911 as the name after declaring Corvus australis Gould to be preoccupied; French-American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First Revisor under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) Code and discarded C. australis as a junior homonym—in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black nunbird—to preserve the stability of the name. This has been followed by later authors.|$|E

5|$|The double drummer has a disjunct distribution, found from {{northern}} tropical Queensland, near Shiptons Flat and Cooktown south to Ingham and Sarina, {{and then from}} Gympie in southeastern Queensland to Moruya in southern New South Wales.

5|$|The red-billed chough has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 86,000 to 210,000 individuals in Europe.

5|$|A 1948 {{review of}} the entire F-84 program {{discovered}} {{that none of the}} F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate and superior maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater <b>range.</b> <b>As</b> a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably reinforcing the wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV <b>range</b> <b>as</b> of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E

5|$|Ball State {{jumped out}} to an early lead via a Wenning to Snead touchdown, and led {{at the end of}} the first quarter 7–0. After the first quarter, due to Kennedy's ineffectiveness, Fredi Knighten took over at quarterback for Arkansas State, and in the second quarter, helped the team score 10 points while Ball State scored only 3 – at half time, the teams were tied at 10. Arkansas State made two field goals in the third quarter, thus {{entering}} the fourth with a six-point lead. However, Ball State scored via a field goal early in the quarter, and a touchdown with less than two minutes to play to retake the lead. Arkansas State promptly responded via a touchdown pass. Although Ball State was able to move the ball into field goal <b>range</b> <b>as</b> time waned, their field goal try was blocked, and ultimately Arkansas State held onto win the game, 23–20.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} this night from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was known he was ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI vectored Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former ground radar operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale sign of an aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and adjusted his speed to match the German pilot. After closing the <b>range</b> <b>as</b> much as he dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E
