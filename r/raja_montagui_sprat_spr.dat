40|$|Egg-capsules of the {{following}} four Raja-species have been known with certainty for many years from {{the shores of the}} Netherlands: Raja clavata Linnaeus, <b>Raja</b> <b>montagui</b> Fowler (<b>Raja</b> maculata Montagu), Raja radiata Donovan, and Raja batis Linnaeus. It is therefore of interest to note that from 1931 to 1935 and in 1936 egg-capsules diverging strongly from the well-known species, have been found on the beach between Wassenaar and Noordwijk (in the province of South-Holland). These capsules appeared to belong to {{the following}} five species: Raja brachyura Lafont, Raja naevus Müller and Henle, Raja undulata Lacépède, Raja microcellata Montagu, and Raja marginata Lacépède. The determinations have been made with Clark's (1922) paper, with the exception of Raja radiata Donovan, as this species is not mentioned by him. After studying and comparing the material of the collections of the Museum of Natural History at Leiden, several private collections, and my own, the following list of the species, occurring on the shore of the Netherlands, could be compiled: 1. Raja clavata Linnaeus. Egg-capsules are known from nearly the whole shore. Very common. 2. <b>Raja</b> <b>montagui</b> Fowler. Egg-capsules known from the shore of the province of South-Holland and the isle of Ameland. Rather common. 3. Raja radiata Donovan.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of morphological and histological maturity {{was conducted on}} a representative sub-sample of 98 individuals from a total database of 538 specimens of the spotted ray, <b>Raja</b> <b>montagui.</b> At a histological level maturity, defined {{by the presence of}} spermatozoa in the testes, was achieved by males at a smaller size than functional maturity, described by current maturity scales. Morphological evidence indicates that nidamental gland width, in females and clasper length, in males, are reliable indicators of maturity in R. montagui when related to total length and the physiological histology of the testes. On the basis of these results the development of an objective measure of maturity for rajids is both possible and practical using these structures. In addition, these measurements provide finer resolution of the process of maturation during the life history of both sexes, without a significant increase in data collection effort. A greater degree of reliability than that provided by the partly subjective nature of current, maturity scales is therefore possible, permitting an improvement in the user confidence of rajid maturity data, for fisheries management purposes...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to detect changes in the diet and the feeding {{intensity}} of demersal fish caused by fishery discarding, two hauls were carried out 22 h apart {{at a depth of}} 90 m in an area of the Cantabrian Sea closed to trawling. Before the second haul, dead fauna that were not common in the sampling area under natural conditions, such as Micromesistius poutassou and squat lobster (Munida spp.), which are both usually discarded by the fleet and mainly found in deeper water, were thrown overboard. A total of 319 stomach contents from 12 demersal fish species caught in both hauls were analysed. The percentage emptiness decreased in the second haul (32 %) with respect to the first (43 %), {{and at the same time}} the feeding intensity of scavenger species such as Trachinus draco, Pagellus acarne, Scyliorhinus canicula, <b>Raja</b> <b>montagui</b> and Leucoraja naevus increased.

40|$|Elasmobranchs are an {{important}} by-catch of commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes. Fisheries targeting sharks are rare, but usually almost all specimen bycatched are marketed. They risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues (Ferretti et al., 2008). Accurate species identification is critical {{for the design of}} sustainable fisheries and appropriate management plans, especially since not all species are equally sensitive to fishing pressure (Walker & Hislop 1998). The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation (Dayrat B et al., 2005). More recently, mtDNA sequencing has also been used for species identification and its use has become widespread under the DNA Barcode initiative (e. g. Hebert et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ward et al. 2005, 2008 a; Moura et al 2008; Steinke et al. 2009). The aims of this work were: 1) identify sharks and skates species using DNA barcode; 2) compare species of different provenance; 3) use DNA barcode for misidentified species. Using DNA barcode 15 species of sharks (Alopias vulpinus, Centrophorus granulosus, Cetorhinus maximus, Dalatias licha, Etmopterus spinax, Galeorhinus galeus, Galeus melastomus, Heptranchias perlo, Hexanchus griseus, Mustelus mustelus, Mustelus punctulatus, Oxynotus centrina, Scyliorhinus canicula Squalus acanthias, Squalus blainville), 1 species of chimaera (Chimaera monstrosa) and 21 species of rays/skayes (Dasyatis centroura, Dasyatis pastinaca, Dasyatis sp., Dipturus nidarosiensis, Dipturus oxyrinchus, Leucoraja circularis, Leucoraja melitensis, Myliobatis aquila, Pteromylaeus bovinus, Pteroplatytrygon violacea, Raja asterias, Raja brachyura, Raja clavata, <b>Raja</b> miraletus, <b>Raja</b> <b>montagui,</b> <b>Raja</b> radula, Raja polystigma, Raja undulata, Rostroraja alba, Torpedo marmorata, Torpedo nobiliana, Torpedo torpedo) was identified...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the mixed-species ray fishery off the east and {{southeast}} coast of Ireland was carried out between 1997 and 1998, which involved port sampling and collection of commercial transactions data and official logbook data. Several years of commercial transactions data collected allowed seasonal trends in the relative abundance of the commercial size grades to be deciphered. Catch composition by species and sex was determined for the entire ray landings of individual vessels in the fishery during each port sampling occasion. Biological {{data were collected from}} 17 450 rays during 1997 and these data were used to reconstruct the size and age structure of the population at the species level. Each species had a narrow age distribution, generally ranging from 2 to 8 years. Total mortality estimates (Z 1) derived from catch curves were high, ranging from 0. 456 for female Raja brachyura to 1. 110 for male <b>Raja</b> <b>montagui,</b> but were generally lower than the total instantaneous mortality derived, with the exception of male R. montagui (Z 1 = 0. 813). Demographic analysis, using life tables, revealed that, with the exception R. montagui (r =- 0. 045), each of the commercial species had positive population growth, ranging from r = 0. 125 for R. clavata to r = 0. 224 for R. brachyura.

40|$|The dorsoventrally {{flattened}} morphology of benthic ray and flatfish {{species is}} perhaps {{assumed to be}} a constraint on their locomotory ability, suggesting these sit-­‐and-­‐wait predators may exhibit reduced movement and low activity with all species exploiting similar niches. Advancing our understanding of ray and flatfish movement behaviour in relation to the environment is required however, because many commercial and non-­‐ commerical populations are threatened by demersal fisheries. The movement patterns and behaviour of the electronic tagged ray species blonde ray Raja brachyura and spotted ray <b>Raja</b> <b>montagui,</b> and benthic teleosts turbot Psetta maxima and plaice Pleuronectes platessa, were investigated off southwest Britain. Mark-­‐recapture data showed some evidence for site fidelity or increased residence time in preferred locations to some degree in all species investigated. Time-­‐series of waiting times (intervals between periods of activity) were analysed statistically, revealing complex movement patterns and behavioural structure over a wide range of temporal scales. Overall, R. brachyura displayed greater horizontal and vertical ranging behaviour with longer waiting times than R. montagui, who inhabited deeper more restricted depths. Comparatively, however, teleosts showed more extensive vertical ranging and much shorter waiting time behaviour, with P. maxima displaying surface swimming, whilst P. platessa performed substantial circa-­‐diel and tidal rhythms. The differences in behaviour patterns observed was attributed to feeding niche differences, among intraspecific variation such as sexual segregation and ontogenic changes. This integrated statistical approach to understand the behavioural strategies of these sit-­‐ and-­‐wait predators helps to assess aspects of behaviour such as decision-­‐making (waiting time between activities) in relation to habitat availability and quality. A deeper understanding of spatiotemporal movements and behaviour, including where species are distributed, how long they stay there and why, will inform better management of populations.

40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (<b>Raja</b> <b>montagui),</b> thornback ray (<b>Raja</b> clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Biologia Marinha, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2010 Skate populations tend to {{be highly}} {{vulnerable}} to exploitation {{as a result of}} the main life history characteristics (slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity). The cuckoo ray, Leucoraja naevus, one of the skate species landed in Portugal, is mainly a by-catch species from the artisanal mixed-fishery, and for this reason it is very difficult to acquire information about its basic biology. The two main goals of the present work were to estimate the length at first maturity, fecundity and reproductive cycle of the species Leucoraja naevus and to compare the microscopic structure and chemical nature of the secretions produced by the oviducal gland of the species Leucoraja naevus with other skate species taking into account their reproductive strategy. Although the species has been studied in other NE Atlantic geographic areas, namely Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and North Sea, this study is the first to provide information on the reproductive biology of Leucoraja naevus in Southern European waters. Length at first maturity was estimated at 57 cm and 55 cm TL for males and females, respectively. Active females were observed in every months of the year suggesting that reproduction may occur year round, with a reproductive peak during winter months between January and April. Females release follicles in batches of 5. However, it was not possible to determine the number of reproductive episodes realized by a female during a 1 -year period. Leucoraja naevus, Raja brachyura, Raja miraletus, Raja undulata, Raja microocellata and <b>Raja</b> <b>montagui,</b> have similar microscopic structure divided in four zones: club, papillary, baffle and terminal. However, differences were found between Leucoraja naevus and the remaining species in the chemical nature of the secretions produced in the papillary zone, that seems to have a higher content of sulphated acid mucins, and in the terminal zone that, like in Raja microocellata, lacks serous gland tubules. The differences found are related with the reproductive strategy displayed by each species, namely with the capsule and spawning habitats characteristics. Sperm was found in all species as laterally aligned bundles in the deep recessed tubules of the baffle zone, adjacent to the muscle layer, suggesting short-term sperm storage. These results provide essential information on the reproductive biology not only about the species Leucoraja naevus but also about other by-catch species inhabiting Portuguese continental waters and, therefore, constitute an important tool for a proper management plan...|$|R
40|$|The European {{sturgeon}} Acipenser sturio L., 1758 {{has nearly}} approached extinction {{in its original}} and overall distribution areas from the White and the Baltic Seas, to the Black Sea, including the North and Mediterranean Seas {{as well as the}} Eastern North Atlantic (HOLCIK et al., 1989). The species occurs regularly only in a recent population in the Gironde basin in France (ROCHARD et al., 1990; WILLIOT et al., 1997, KIRSCHBAUM et al., 2000). This population has still decreased dramatically since the 1970 s, and recovery by natural reproduction does not seem likely (driven by a lack of sufficient adult and mature specimens). The restoration of this species rests almost exclusively on the establishment of a broodstock as an ex-situ measure, in order to manage artificial reproduction to stabilize the endangered stocks. Additionally habitat improvement and protection efforts are major goals of a sturgeon conservation program, implemented in France in the early 1980 s (WILLIOT et al., 1997). The 1981 and 1985 artificial reproduction booked limited success, the rearing of the larvae failed. A third reproduction and larvae rearing effort was successfully conducted in 1995 (WILLIOT et al., 2000). Some of these individuals have been used to build a broodstock to be reared in captivity. Little is known about dietary requirements or other specific conditions for supporting optimal growth that provides a healthy stock during long-term captivity. First results in France indicated that A. sturio grew somewhat restrained under controlled conditions, and relied mainly on natural feed (as opposed to commercial dry feed). The species specific nutrition demands are considered limiting factors raising European sturgeon in captivity. A Franco-German co-operation has been established {{to address the issue of}} the restoration of the European sturgeon in German rivers. 40 juveniles of the batch of 1995 were transferred to the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Berlin (IGB) in April 1996. To gain as much information as possible, two different keeping strategies were applied in France and Germany. In contrast to the French strategy, no special precaution was taken in terms of captivity at IGB. Sturgeons were tagged with passive integrated micro-transponders to identify each fish. Weighing intervals were continuously reduced from about two months in 1996 to two weeks in July 1999. Intimate illumination adopted to the natural photoperiod of Berlin imposed a natural periodicity and allowed for best observation of the feeding behaviour as well as the condition of the fish. The environmental factors of rearing under indoor conditions did not affect the fish or its growth performance. Because of sub-optimal growth during the first three years (1996 - 1998) of breeding juveniles at IGB special feeding trials were designed to explore basic requirements of nutrition, and to support optimal growth rates to promote artificial reproduction as the basis for the restoration of this species in Germany. This PhD thesis is intending to understand these complex relationships. Feeding trails were conducted with different natural feeds as well as commercial dry food. The growth was expressed as specific growth rate (RICKER, 1975) which allowed for comparison of growth between fish of different weights. A starvation experiment provided the basis of an assessment of a negative growth performance (HENSEL et al., 2002). Experiments relating to the impact of the tank size and keeping density on the growth characteristics as well as the chemical analysis of selected feed items were covered in these investigations. An important result of the feeding trials is the ubiquitous feeding selectivity of the European sturgeon. This is not an artefact of indoor rearing under captivity confirmed by BROSSE et al. (2000) who verified this peculiar feeding behaviour also for the juveniles in the Gironde estuary, which preferred the polychaete species Heteromastus filiformis and Polydora sp. By comparing different feed items (also fed from 1996 - 1998) like frozen small marine fish, frozen small chironomids and frozen large chironomids the latter induced the best specific growth rates. Large juvenile fish (total length 80 to 115 cm, 2. 000 to 5. 000 g in 2001) were intended to be accustomed to pieces of <b>sprat</b> Sprattus <b>spr.</b> as a new feed item for an experimental period of 29 weeks (from April to November 2001). These trials were based on the experience of the aquarium at Heligoland Island in the North Sea successfully feeding A. sturio on this item stock (GOEHMANN, personal comm., 2001). The European sturgeon at the IGB, however, rejected this food item despite the extended feeding trial. The only effect was a slight increase of the median SGR for the experimental group which was fed a mixed diet containing frozen large chironomids with a 10 - 25 % addition of the frozen sprat pieces. The individual feeding reactions observed towards different feed items results in a strategy which takes into account the individual food preferences to accustom the fish to new feed items, guaranteeing adequate nutrition promoting optimal growth performance. Rearing conditions and the stocking densities influence the growth of fish in addition to the feeding strategy (JODUN et al. 2002). Experiments were undertaken to determine the effect of stocking densities and tank size on growth: two groups of fish were kept in 11. 6 m 3 tanks at stocking densities of for example 2. 7 kg/m 3 (N = 8) and 2. 9 kg/m 3 (N = 6) respectively, whereas the two other groups were reared in 6. 8 m 3 tanks at densities of e. g. 4. 8 kg/m 3 (N = 5) and 4. 4 kg/m 3 (N = 8) respectively. The average density of 3. 7 kg/m 3 seemed to be the adequate density which did not affect the growth performance of our fish. From all these results it is obvious that the breeding of the European sturgeon is possible and offers the possibility of restoration under consideration of the species specific characteristics...|$|R
