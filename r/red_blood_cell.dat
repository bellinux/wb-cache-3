The main method to freeze the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> is by usage of glycerol. Although the usage of cryopreserved <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> was promising due to the prolonged storage time and the limited cellular deterioration at subzero temperatures, its usage have been hampered due to the more complex and labour intensive procedure and the limited shelf life of thawed products. Since the FDA approval of a closed (de) glycerolization procedure in 2002, allowing a prolonged postthaw storage of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> up to 21 days at 2 - 6 degrees C, cryopreserved <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> have become a more utilized blood product.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Comparatively to open repair, {{endovascular}} aneurysm repair {{has reduced}} transfusion rates but thereâs no recommendation about number of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units to be crossmatched preoperatively. Our aim is {{contribute to the}} analysis of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units needs in endovascular and hybrid aortic aneurysm repair and developing a protocol for maximum surgical blood orders schedule. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed our prospective database of elective endovascular aneurysm repair from 2001 to 2012. We analyzed patients' age, gender, ASA classification, maximum surgical <b>blood</b> orders schedule, <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units transfused and timings, types of endoprosthesis, <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units consumption/endoprosthesis' type ratio, crossmatch to transfusion ratio, conversion to open repair, hemoglobin concentrations before surgery and discharge. RESULTS: We selected 187 patients, 90 % men, mean age 73. 1, ASA mode III. The endoprosthesis were aorto-bi-iliac in 71 %, aorto-uni-iliac in 23 % and thoracic in 6 %. Of these, 72, 6 % of the patients did not require blood transfusion. We transfused 171 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units. Crossmatch to transfusion ratio was 10. 1 until 2010 and 7. 3 after. The ratio of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units consumption/endoprosthesis in the first 24 hours was 0. 21 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/aorto-bi-iliac, 0. 46 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/aorto-uni-iliac, 0. 8 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/thoracic, 1. 3 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/hybrid-thoracic and 2 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units/hybrid-aorto-bi-iliac. A statistical correlation was observed between <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units transfused postoperatively and type of endoprosthesis (p < 0. 001) and between ASA classification and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units transfused after 24 hours (p < 0. 01). DISCUSSION: Guidelines from the British Society of Haematology are based on a crossmatch to transfusion ratio of 2 : 1. Our crossmatch to transfusion ratio was 10. 1 until 2010 and 7. 3 from 2011 to 2012. CONCLUSION: These results changed our policy of maximum surgical blood orders schedule for endovascular aneurysm repair. We now type and screen aorto-bi-iliac and aorto-uni-iliac. We crossmatch two <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units for thoracic, three <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units for hybrid thoracic and four <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> units for hybrid abdominal procedures.

5|$|Owing to {{its high}} radioactivity, curium and its {{compounds}} must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection. If consumed, curium is excreted {{within a few days}} and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the liver, 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates {{on the inside of the}} interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> creation. The biological half-life of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones. Curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of 244Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μC. Intravenous injection of 242Cm and 244Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of bone tumor, and inhalation promoted pulmonary and liver cancer.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanism}} by which topical progesterone in cream and water-based gel forms distributes to tissues throughout the body resulting in very high salivary and capillary blood levels in spite of low circulating levels is not well understood. However, at least one hypothesis has been put forward. Steroid hormones including progesterone {{have been found to}} be transported by <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> in addition to serum carrier proteins like albumin, , and , and as much as 15 to 35% of total steroid hormone content in whole blood may be confined to <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> In the hypothesis, very high local concentrations of progesterone occur in skin capillaries after topical application and this progesterone is taken up by <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> The transit time of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> from capillaries and the release of steroid hormones from <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are both very rapid, so it is suggested that progesterone is delivered through circulation to tissues via <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> without having time to equilibrate with the systemic blood. This could potentially explain the low levels of progesterone in venous blood in spite of very high levels in capillary blood and saliva. However, one study assessed progesterone levels in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> with topical progesterone and found that they were significantly increased but still very low. Nonetheless, according to other authors, [...] "although the investigators of that study concluded that the progesterone levels in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> were too low to be important in the delivery of progesterone to target tissues, it should be realized that even small amounts of progesterone taken up by <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> might be important because the transit time of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> from capillaries is very rapid. ...

25|$|The loss of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> {{elasticity}} {{is central}} to the pathophysiology of sickle-cell disease.

Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK.
