40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} whether the respiratory symptoms and decrements in lung function found in manufacturers of ceramic fibres are related to exposure to the <b>respirable</b> <b>fibre</b> or inspirable mass constituents of {{the air in the}} working environment. METHODS [...] Cross sectional survey of all current European primary producers of ceramic fibre was carried out, with measurement of exposure to respiratory fibres by personal samplers that measured inspirable and total mass, together with a health survey with an expanded respiratory questionnaire and standardised measurement of lung function. Odds ratios were calculated for symptoms and current exposure by multiple logistic regression, and multiple linear regression coefficients for lung function related to cumulative exposures controlled for the effects of <b>respirable</b> <b>fibre</b> and inspirable mass separately and together. RESULTS [...] Significant effects of current exposure to both inspirable dust and respirable fibres were related to dry cough, stuffy nose, eye and skin irritation and breathlessness. The decrements found in smokers and to some extent in ex-smokers in forced expiratory volume in one second and forced expiratory flow from 25 % to 75 % of expiratory volume, seem {{to be related to the}} respirable fibres rather than the inspirable mass constituents of the environment.

40|$|Methods for the {{determination}} of biodurability of man-made vitreous fibres are reviewed. For mineral wools {{the first step was}} the preparation of <b>respirable</b> <b>fibre</b> fractions. Fibres were administered to rats by inhalation or by intratracheal instillation. After serial sacrifice their lungs were digested by low-temperature ashing or by hypochlorite. The total number of fibres per lung and the distributions of length and diameter were analysed by electron microscopy. This resulted in a bivariate distribution of fibres at the various sacrifice dates. If the logarithm of the number of fibres decreased approximately linearly with time after exposure then the elimination kinetics of fibres can be characterized by a half-time. The half-times were compared between various experiments with rats exposed to mineral wool samples. In summary good agreement was found for the elimination of fibres after long-term inhalation and intratracheal instillation whereas shorter half-times were found after short-term inhalation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{experiments}} which were designed to assess the effect of fire on asbestos cement (A/C) roofing with particular reference to the emission of respirable fibres. A series of small-scale laboratory tests were undertaken on samples of asbestos cement roofing — the predominant material found in buildings with asbestos-containing materials. It was found that respirable fibres were released only when the material is spalling explosively under heating. A full-scale test was conducted within a large test facility where asbestos cement roofing was exposed to a real fire. Air within the smoke layer and building was sampled using various methods. Very low concentrations of <b>respirable</b> <b>fibre</b> were detected within the building. It is suggested that these very low concentrations are due to the relatively low emission of fibres per unit of surface area and the significant quantity of air entrained into the fire plume...|$|E
40|$|A {{cohort study}} among 4734 {{employees}} at an English glass fibre plant previously reported no excess {{of lung cancer}} mortality either overall or when examined in broad occupational groups. To investigate occupation in more detail, and {{to test the hypothesis}} that processes producing or using finer (<b>respirable)</b> <b>fibres</b> may be related to a higher risk of lung cancer, a nested case-control study has now been carried out.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the question of}} whether there is an association between exposure to silica or <b>respirable</b> glass <b>fibre</b> and mortality from nephritis or nephrosis among workers in fibrous glass wool manufacturing facilities. METHODS: A case-control study with cases and controls derived from the Owens Corning mortality surveillance system. Two case-control analyses were carried out, one where the cases are defined with nephritis or nephrosis as the underlying cause of death and one where cases are defined as those where nephritis or nephrosis is either the underlying or a contributing cause of death. RESULTS: There is no consistent relation between <b>respirable</b> <b>fibres</b> or <b>respirable</b> silica and nephritis or nephrosis when the analysis is based either on underlying cause only or on underlying plus contributing cause of death. None of the sociodemographic variables considered suggests an increased risk when considering both underlying and contributing cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: These data would seem to support the contention that the most accurate picture of renal disease will be gained from the use of all information on the death certificate and not only the underlying cause. For these data, all odds ratios (ORs) for <b>respirable</b> <b>fibres</b> and silica based on both underlying and contributing cause of death are 1 (OR = 1. 04). Although these results do not prove that there is no association between nephritis and nephrosis and exposure to fibreglass or silica in the fibreglass manufacturing environment, they do not support the assertion that such an association exists...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Very {{high fibre}} {{inhalation}} exposure has been measured while people were wearing {{personal protective equipment}} manufactured from chrysotile asbestos. However, there is little data that relates specifically to wearing asbestos gloves or mitts, particularly when used in hot environments such as those found in glass manufacturing. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the likely personal exposure to asbestos fibres when asbestos mitts were used.

40|$|As {{part of a}} wider {{epidemiological}} research programme, an occupational hygiene study was carried out during 1995 – 1996 to assess workers ’ current exposures to airborne materials in six European refractory ceramic fibre (RCF) plants. These plants had also participated in a cross-sectional occupational hygiene survey in 1987. The sampling strategy focussed princi-pally on personal shift-average exposures of workers, by occupation, to respirable fibres. Mon-itoring was undertaken in two integrated phases: a 1 -week cross-sectional survey followed by a prospective, and ongoing, programme by the RCF industry. Statistical (analysis of variance) analyses to identify patterns of variability by plant, occupational group (OG) and occupations within group were based on 464 individual shift samples, {{the greatest amount of}} data being available for production occupations. Concentrations of respirable fibres showed marked differences between plants and between OGs.

40|$|Abstract—Rats {{exposed to}} UICC {{chrysotile}} 'A', amosite and crocidolite at concentrations close to 1, 5 and 10 mg/m 3 of <b>respirable</b> <b>fibre</b> {{for a total}} of 210 h over a 6 -week period were killed in five groups at approximately monthly intervals. The asbestos retained in the lungs was esti-mated by infra-red spectrophotometry after ashing. The results indicated different initial fractional retentions but that the rate of clearance was independent of the type of asbestos and of the concentration during exposure. The rates of deposition and clearance could be described in terms of a model, modified from that published by MORGAN et al. (1977). In this model it is assumed that a fraction K, of the estimated aggregate dose is deposited in three 'compartments', from which asbestos is subse-quently cleared with half-times of 0. 38, 8 and 118 days. It is also assumed that asbestos enters the three 'compartments ' in the proportions 86. 5 : 5. 3 : 8. 2, respectively. The fractional deposition, K, of chrysotile was much less than for the two amphiboles but increased with diminishing concentration, from 0. 17 at ca. 10 mg/m 3 to 0. 36 at ca. 1 mg/m 3. The A"-value for amosite, 0. 65, was less than for crocidolite, 1. 0, both being independent of con-centration. In view of the nocturnal nature of rats it was thought that the normal practice of dust exposure during daylight, a period of reduced activity, might have led to misleading results. Two further experiments were therefore carried out in which rats were exposed to UICC chrysotile 'A' and crocidolite in a darkened chamber to simulate nocturnal conditions. The rates. of clearance were closely similar to those observed aftCT daylight exposure. Application of the model des-cribed above indicated that, although the fraction of crocidolite deposited was comparable with that observed after daylight exposure, the fraction of chrysotile deposited was approxi-mately three times that deposited during the comparable daylight experiment. Possible reasons for the different retention pattern of chrysotile are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} measurement of the concentrations of airborne asbestos fibres in the rural environment of the Lublin Region in south-east Poland. Methods. Measurements of concentrations of <b>respirable</b> asbestos <b>fibres</b> were carried out in the rural areas of the Lublin Region (Lublin and Włodawa counties) for a period of 24 months. The studies were conducted on 3 farms with various technical conditions of asbestos-containing materials: Farm A – good technical condition of asbestos products, Farm B – poor technical condition, and Farm C – with no asbestos containing products and no such products in its direct vicinity (up to 500 m). On the selected farms, 3 samples on each were simultaneously collected at 3 measuring sites. During the period 2009 – 2011, a total number of 216 samples were collected on all farms. Sampling was performed using JSH 16, 000 stationary aspirators, with air flow velocity of 16 l/min. and sampling time 60 – 80 minutes. The number of fibres on filters was determined using an optical phase contrast microscope. Results.

40|$|Examination of Chrysotile Asbestos {{from the}} Eastern Townships of Quebec using optical and {{electron}} microscopic methods {{has shown that}} Chrysotile fibres are intimately associated with minute particles of magnetite. Measurements were made using a fluxgate magnetometer of the remnant magnetic fields of bulk commercial fibres and of airborne total dust and of the respirable fraction of airborne dust collected in Quebec asbestos mines and mills using a Hexhlet horizontal eleutriator. The validity of the Hexhlet horizontal eleutriator for <b>respirable</b> <b>fibre</b> collection in the mill environment was determined. It was observed that the remnant magnetic field intensities of airborne dust in laboratory generated dust clouds, and in the work places were related {{in a meaningful way}} to the magnetite content of the dust and to the total mass and respirable mass fractions of airborne dust, and also, to the concentrations of fibre greater than 5 micrometre length (aspect ratio > 3 : 1) measured using phase contrast microscopy. Calibration curves were developed for each of 9 Quebec mills. Repeat calibrations showed the lines to be reproducible within (+OR-) 10 percent. The accuracy of the method for mass dust determination was dependent on sample size with errors as low as (+OR-) 7. 5 percent for samples larger than 3 milligrams, and as large as (+OR-) 40 percent for samples of mass smaller than 0. 5 milligrams. The relationships between fibre concentrations and remnant magnetic fields were less reproducible and the lower detection limit was limited by the sensitivity of the fluxgate magnetometer. Although the measured remnant magnetic field varied as the magnetite content varied between different mills and commercial fibre products, magnetite to chrysotile ratio remained constant for a given mill and commercial product. Measurements of the remnant magnetic fields of airborne dusts collected in mill environments can thus provide the possibility of the rapid determination of airborne chrysotile fibre concentrations both in terms of mass and number of fibres per litre of air sampled as well as their iron content. Measurement of the magnetic content of specimens of autopsied lung tissue from asbestos exposed workers indicated that the residual estimated fibre content measured by electron microscopy was less than estimated using magnetic field measurements....

40|$|A {{case-control study}} of {{malignant}} and non-malignant respiratory disease among {{employees of the}} Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation's Newark, Ohio plant was undertaken. The aim {{was to determine the}} extent to which exposures to substances in the Newark plant environment, to non-workplace factors, or to a combination may play a part in the risk of mortality from respiratory disease among workers in this plant. A historical environmental reconstruction of the plant was undertaken to characterise the exposure profile for workers in this plant from its beginnings in 1934 to the end of 1987. The exposure profile provided estimates of cumulative exposure to respirable fibres, fine fibres, asbestos, talc, formaldehyde, silica, and asphalt fumes. Employment histories from Owens-Corning Fiberglas provided information on employment characteristics (duration of employment, year of hire, age at first hire) and an interview survey obtained information on demographic characteristics (birthdate, race, education, marital state, parent's ethnic background, and place of birth), lifetime residence, occupational and smoking histories, hobbies, and personal and family medical history. Matched, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to assess the association between lung cancer or non-malignant respiratory disease and the cumulative exposure history, demographic characteristics, and employment variables. Only the smoking variables and employment characteristics (year of hire and age at first hire) were statistically significant for lung cancer. For non-malignant respiratory disease, only the smoking variables were statistically significant in the univariate analysis. Of the variables entered into a conditional logistic regression model for lung cancer, only smoking (smoked for six months or more v never smoked: OR = 26. 17, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 3. 316 - 206. 5) and age at first hire (35 and over v less than 35 : OR = 0. 244, 95 % CI 0. 083 - 0. 717) were statistically significant. There were, however, increased ORs for year of employment (first hired before 1945 v first hire after 1945 : OR = 1. 944, 95 % CI 0. 850 - 4. 445), talc (cumulative exposure > 1000 fibres/ml days v never exposed: OR = 1. 355, 95 % CI 0. 407 - 5. 515), and asphalt fumes (cumulative exposure > 0. 01 mg/m(3) days v never exposed: OR 1. 131, 95 % CI 0. 468 - 2. 730). For non-malignant respiratory disease, only the smoking variable was significant in the conditional logistic regression analysis (OR = 2. 637, 95 % CI 1. 146 - 6. 069). There were raised ORs for the higher cumulative exposure categories for respirable fibres, asbestos, silica, and asphalt fumes. For both silica and asphalt fumes, ORs were more than double the reference groups for all exposure categories. A limited number of subjects were exposed to fine fibres. The scarcity of cases and controls limits the extent to which analyses for fine fibre may be carried out. Within those limitations, among those who had worked with fine fibre, the unadjusted, unmatched OR for lung cancer was (1. 0 (95 % CI 0. 229 - 4. 373) and for non-malignant respiratory disease, the OR was 1. 5 (95 % CI 0. 336 - 6. 702). The unadjusted OR for lung cancer for exposure to fine fibre was consistent with that for all <b>respirable</b> <b>fibre</b> and does not suggest an association. For non-malignant respiratory disease, the unadjusted OR for fine fibre was opposite in direction from that for all respirable fibres. Within the limitations of the available data on fibre, there is o suggestion that exposure to fine fibre has resulted in an increase in risk of lung cancer. The increased OR for non-malignant respiratory disease is inconclusive. The results of this population, in this place and time, neither respirable fibres nor any of the substances investigated as part of the plant environment are statistically significant factors for lung cancer risk although there are increased ORs for exposure to talc and asphalt fumes. Smoking is the most important factors in risk for lung cancer in this population. The situation is less clear for non-malignant respiratory disease. Unlike lung cancer, non-malignant respiratory represents a constellation of outcomes and not a single well defined end point. Although smoking was the only statistically significant factor for non-malignant respiratory disease in this analysis, the ORs for respirable fibres, asbestos, silica, and asphalt fumes were greater than unity for the highest exposure categories. Although the raised ORs for these substances may represent the results of a random process, they may be suggestive of an increased risk and require further investigation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} possible {{relations between}} respiratory health and past airborne exposure to refractory ceramic <b>fibres</b> (RCFs) and <b>respirable</b> dust in workers at six European factories, studied previously in 1987.  METHODS—The target population comprised all current workers associated with RCF production, plus {{others who had}} participated in 1987  "leavers". Information was collected on personal characteristics, chest radiographs, lung function, respiratory symptoms, smoking, and full occupational history. Regression analysis was used to study relations between indices of health of individual workers and of cumulative exposure to airborne dust and fibres, and likely past exposure to asbestos.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION— 774 workers participated (90 % of current workers, 37 % of leavers). Profusion of small opacities in exposed workers (51 % 0 / 1 +; 8 % 1 / 0 +) was similar to that among an unexposed control group but higher than in new readings of the 1987  study films (11 % 0 / 1 +, 2 % 1 / 0 +). The large difference between 1987  and recent films may be, at least in part, a reading artefact associated with film appearance. Small opacities of International Labour Organisation (ILO) category 1 / 0 + were not associated with exposure. An association of borderline significance overall between 0 / 1 + opacities and exposure to <b>respirable</b> <b>fibres</b> was found for some exposure periods only, the time related pattern being biologically implausible. Pleural changes were related to age and exposure to asbestos, and findings were consistent with an effect of time since first exposure to RCFs. Among men, forced expired volume in 1  second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were inversely related to exposure to fibres, in current smokers only. FEV 1 / FVC ratio and transfer factor (TLCO) were not related to exposures. The estimated restrictive effect was on average mild. Prevalence of respiratory symptoms was low. Chronic bronchitis and its associated symptoms (cough, phlegm) showed some association with recent exposure to <b>respirable</b> <b>fibres.</b> This could be due to an irritant effect of RCFs.    Keywords: respiratory health; ceramic fibre...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{relation}} between occupational exposure to ceramic fibres during manufacture and respiratory health. METHODS [...] The respiratory health of 628 current employees {{in the manufacture of}} ceramic fibres in seven European plants in three countries was studied with a respiratory questionnaire, lung function tests, and chest radiography. Simultaneous plant hygiene surveys measured subjects' current exposure to airborne ceramic fibres from personal samples with optical microscopy fibre counts. The measured exposures were combined with occupational histories to derive estimates of each subject's cumulative exposure to <b>respirable</b> <b>fibres.</b> Symptoms were related to current and cumulative exposure to ceramic fibres and lung function and findings from chest radiographs were related to cumulative exposure. RESULTS [...] The mean duration of employment was 10. 2 years and mean (range) cumulative exposure was 3. 84 (0 - 22. 94) (f. ml- 1. y). Eye and skin symptoms were frequent in all plants and increased significantly, as did breathlessness and wheeze, with increasing current exposure. Dry cough and stuffy nose were less common in the least exposed group but did not increase with increasing exposure. After adjustment for the effects of age, sex, height, smoking, and past occupational exposures to respiratory hazards, there was a significant decrease in both forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced midexpiratory flow related to cumulative exposure in current smokers (P < 0. 05) and in FEV 1 in ex-smokers (P < 0. 05). Small opacities were found in 13 % of the chest radiographs; their prevalence was not related to cumulative exposure to ceramic fibres.

National death rates and national cancer incidence rates, where applicable, were used for each of the seven countries for comparison with the workers' cohort. A single death from mesothelioma was reported {{out of a total of}} 309 353 person-years of observation. No consistent differences (within and between plants) were noted between observed and expected numbers concerning individual causes of death or individual cancer sites, apart from lung cancer.

An investigation of the efficiency of various total inhalable and respirable dust samplers has been conducted to identify the most convenient way of collecting dust particles to examine their physical characteristics. The efficiency of a variety of dust samplers were investigated using limestone dust clouds generated inside an environmental dust chamber. Various sampling periods were employed to establish dust concentrations in the environmental dust chamber. The experimental dust cloud was found to contain on average 55. 74 % of respirable dust as defined by different instruments while a consistent dust concentration of approx 200 mg/m 3 was repeatedly produced. The methods for collecting and estimating airborne asbestos fibre concentrations were studied and found to be extremely limited. Standard optical techniques grossly underestimated both airborne <b>fibre</b> concentrations and <b>respirable</b> dimensions of <b>fibres.</b> The size and dimensions of <b>respirable</b> asbestos <b>fibres</b> are defined by their ability to gain access to the lungs and there is no instrument or technique available at present, which will allow collection and estimation of respirable fibrous dust clouds.

For the mineral wools special sizing techniques have been used to obtain these respirable fractions. The bivariate size distribution of fibres was analysed by scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the biological effect of ceramic fibres on the clearance function of alveolar macrophages (AMs) morphological changes and phagocytic activity of AMs were assessed. Rats {{were exposed to}} <b>respirable</b> ceramic <b>fibres</b> with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 4. 4 microns and a concentration of 20. 1 mg/m 3 in an exposure chamber. They were killed after one week (group A) and two weeks (group B) of exposure, and four weeks (group C) and 12 weeks (group D) after exposure for two weeks. The AMs recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from each test group were incubated with yeast and phagocytic activity was determined by {{counting the number of}} yeast cells in AMs. Morphological features of AMs were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and quantified according to morphological changes. Total cell counts in BAL fluid from exposed rats in group A were higher than in control rats. Phagocytic activity of exposed AMs in group B and C exceeded that of control AMs. Morphological changes of the exposed AMs in groups A, B, and C were greater than those of control AMs. These findings suggest that ceramic fibres induced the phagocytic activity and morphological changes in AMs, and that the clearance function of AMs was stimulated by the inhaled ceramic fibres...|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{nanotechnology}} industries {{has led to}} {{the design}} and production of new nano-scaled materials such as quantum dots, nano-metals, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and a myriad of functionalised derivatives. Extensive work concerning well characterised pathogenic fibres {{has led to the}} development of a fibre paradigm that suggests <b>respirable</b> <b>fibres</b> vary in their ability to cause disease based on length and pulmonary bio-persistence. Induction of oxidative stress is also a central plank of the mechanism used to explain inflammatory, fibrotic and carcinogenic effects of fibres. The toxicity of different particle types has consistently been shown to depend upon particle size and surface area, reactive surface molecular groups, metal content, organic content and the presence of endotoxins. A growing body of work has begun to examine the potential pathogenicity of carbon nanotubes to the pulmonary system as a consequence of superficial similarities to known pathogenic particle and fibres. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the potential toxicity of two commercially manufactured multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) compared to a panel of low and high toxicity particles and fibres. The pro-inflammatory nature of MWCNT was examined in vitro and in vivo to determine the effects they may exert in the pulmonary system. In aqueous solutions of phosphate buffered saline, saline and cell culture medium (with or without foetal calf serum supplementation) MWCNT were found to exist as tight aggregates even after sonication. Analysis of metal content of MWCNT by ICP-AES revealed the presence of a low percentage of non extractable residual iron. From analysis of MWCNT by electron spin resonance (ESR) the CNT were found to be ready producers of a free radical species, despite this MWCNT were not able to cleave plasmid DNA. Upon incubation with the alveolar epithelial cell line A 549 MWCNTs did not cause noticeable toxicity but did dose dependently deplete total glutathione levels. No increase in production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 8 could be detected at the level of protein or at the level of mRNA. Analysis of the levels (protein and mRNA) of the pro-fibrotic mediator TGF-β did not indicate induction of a fibrotic response to MWCNT. Neither were MWCNTs found to consistently activate the pro-inflammatory associated transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Upon instillation into the peritoneal cavity of mice MWCNT failed to induce a pro-inflammatory response in contrast to long amosite asbestos that induced an extensive inflammatory reaction. Analysis of the diaphragms of exposed animals revealed the induction by MWCNT of an apparent foreign body type reaction. Overall with limited processing and dispersion MWCNT were morphologically more akin to particles than fibres. Although apparently able to spontaneously generate ROS in aqueous solution this did not translate into a capacity to cause toxicity or a capacity to induce inflammation either in vitro or in vivo.

40|$|Themain {{objective}} of the present paper is {{to report on the}} concentration of silicon carbide (SiC) fibres, crystalline silica and respirable dust in a Canadian SiC production plant and to compare the results with earlier investigations. The second objective is to tentatively explain the differ-ences in concentration of the fibrogenic substances between different countries. The assessment of SiC <b>fibres,</b> dusts, <b>respirable</b> quartz and cristobalite was performed according to standard procedures. The highest 8 h time-weighted average concentrations of fibres were found among the crusher and backhoe attendants and the carboselectors with an arithmetic mean of 0. 63 fibres ml 1 for the former group and 0. 51 fibres ml 1 for the latter group. The results of <b>respirable</b> SiC <b>fibres</b> in the Canadian plant were lower than in the Norwegian and Italian industries. Most of the 8 h time-weighted average concentrations for quartz were less than or around the limit of detection of 0. 01 mg m 3. The maximum 8 h time-weighted average con-centration for quartz was found among the carboselectors (0. 157 mg m 3), followed by the labourers (0. 032 mg m 3). Similarly, most of the 8 h time-weighted average cristobalite measurements were less than the limit of detection of 0. 01 mg m 3 except for the carboselectors where it was found to be 0. 044 mg m 3.

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} effects of <b>respirable</b> cellulose <b>fibres</b> were studied in two short-term animal models: intraperitoneal injection in mice, and inhalation in rats. The mouse peritoneal cavity is particularly sensitive to fibrous compared to non-fibrous particles. Both cellulose fibres and the positive control fibre, crocidolite asbestos, were administered in doses ranging from 104 to 108 fibres and caused marked, dose-dependent recruitment of inflammatory cells to the mouse peritoneal cavity, which was highest 1 day following injection. Crocidolite {{was much more}} active than cellulose, despite the mass dose of cellulose being 66 times greater for an equivalent number of fibres. Crocidolite at the higher doses caused inflammation to persist through 7 days. For the inhalation study, rats were exposed daily, 5 days per week, to aerosols of cellulose dust for ca. 3 weeks at a concentration of 1000 fibres ml- 1. Inhalation exposure induced an early inflammatory response in rat lungs, as determined by bronchoalveolar lavage, which peaked at 1 day following the start of inhalation and thereafter declined, despite a further 13 days of exposure {{over a period of}} 18 calendar days. In vitro production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) by lavaged alveolar macrophages was markedly depressed {{by the end of the}} exposure period in cellulose-exposed animals, compared to sham-exposed controls, and this effect was still present in rats that had been allowed to recover for 28 days beyond the end of exposure. We conclude that the cellulose material studied is less inflammogenic than crocidolite and that the extent of the inflammatory response within the lung appears to reduce with continued exposure over a 14 -day period.

40|$|Stratigraphic {{units with}} the {{potential}} for carbonate-hosted asbestos account for < 3 % of the land area of South Australia. Known asbestos occurrences are small, low grade and commonly weathered. The main mode of occurrence is as cross-fibre and slip-fibre veins of asbestiform magnesio-riebeckite (AMR) in metasomatised dolomites, and fibrous tremolite associated with talc mineralisation in the Adelaide Geosyncline. Small occurrences of chrysotile asbestos are hosted by dolomites in the Hutchison Group in the eastern Gawler Craton. Hyperspectral mapping could be used to locate additional asbestos mineralisation. Disturbance of natural asbestos-bearing materials in South Australia has been through mining, agriculture and natural weathering processes. Release of <b>respirable</b> asbestos <b>fibres</b> from rocks and soils is feasible and could potentially account for some cases of mesothelioma in South Australia. Only a very small portion of the population is considered at risk of being exposed to fibres from disturbance of natural asbestos fibres. Persons considered most at risk of potential exposure include: rural workers and communities residing close to areas of intense agricultural disturbance of asbestos-bearing soils; construction workers involved in large-scale earthworks projects in areas underlain by asbestos-bearing rocks and soils; and quarry workers who unwittingly disturb asbestos-bearing materials. Populations regularly exposed to amphibole fibres {{for a long period of}} time are at greatest risk with respect to mesothelioma. Epidemiological studies suggest that the risks of mesothelioma for those exposed to chrysotile fibres alone are negligible. Toxicological studies are required to better understand the potential health risks associated with AMR. Current medical reporting of asbestos in South Australia does not include detailed residential or occupational histories required to undertake a statistically significant study of the possible health effects of asbestos from natural sources. Government authorities and private enterprises need to take geological factors into account to reduce the likelihood of unplanned disturbance of natural asbestos-bearing materials. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Tobacco smoke {{contains}} many toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic chemicals, {{as well as}} stable and unstable free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the particulate and the gas phase {{with the potential for}} biological oxidative damage. Epidemiological evidence established that smoking {{is one of the most}} important extrinsic factor of premature morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to investigate oxidative and carcinogenic mechanisms of tobacco and synergistic action with other respirable particles in the respiratory system of smokers. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and spin-trapping techniques were used to study stable free radicals in the cigarette tar, and unstable superoxide anion (O 2 •−) and hydroxyl (HO•) radicals in the smoke Results showed that the semiquinone radical system has the potential for redox recycling and oxidative action. Further, results proved that aqueous cigarette tar (ACT) solutions can generate adducts with DNA nucleobases, particularly the mutagenic 8 -hydroxy- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine (a biomarker for carcinogenesis). Also, we observed synergistic effects in the generation of HO•, through the Fenton reaction, with environmental <b>respirable</b> particles (asbestos <b>fibres,</b> coal dust, etc.) and ambient particulate matter (PM), such as PM 10, PM 2. 5 and diesel exhaust particle...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} <b>respirable</b> {{man-made}} mineral <b>fibres</b> were tested {{for evidence of}} carcinogenicity by injection into the peritoneal cavity of male SPF Wistar rats; and dierences in carcinogenicity {{were related to the}} dimensions and biopersistence of the injected fibres. The fibres tested included an amosite asbestos, a silicon carbide whisker, a special purpose glass microfibre, and a range of other man-made vitreous fibres (MMVFs) and refractory ceramic fibres (RCFs) from the TIMA fibre repository. The injected dose of each was designed as the estimated mass required to contain 109 fibres> 5 mm in length, as determined by optical microscopy. The numbers of long fibres (> 15 mm) contained in these doses ranged across fibres from 0. 1109 to 0. 8109 fibres; the number of long fibres thinner than 0. 95 mm ranged from 0. 015109 to 0. 4 109. The treatment groups contained between 18 and 24 animals. Animals were killed when they showed signs of debilitation. At autopsy, the diagnosis of mesothelioma was usually obvious macroscopically. Otherwise, histological examination of peritoneal organs was used to search for early tumour development. Judged by median survival time, four of the fibre types, in the doses administered, presented higher mesothelioma activity than amosite asbestos. The other fibres tested were less carcinogenic than the amosite. Only a ceramic material derived b...|$|R

40|$|Carcinogenicity {{studies with}} {{several types of}} <b>respirable</b> {{particles}} and <b>fibres</b> indicate a carcinogenic potential from inhalation and there is concern that the carcinogenic potency of nanomaterials is higher than for the corresponding micromaterials. In this research project, long term studies with nanomaterials were used to identify relevant indicators of toxicity of nanomaterials including possible precursors of carcinogenicity. Due to the heterogeneous characteristics of the materials and the different study types, a structured and systematic data analysis was performed {{by means of a}} relational database (PaFtox). More than 100 inhalation studies and instillation studies with rodents with Carbon Black, silicon dioxide, metals or metal oxides, and carbonnanotubes were analysed. Effects like neutrophil number, total protein and LDH content in the bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are frequently measured and are sensitive indicators of toxicity of all particles investigated. In addition, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung and increased lung weights are often observed. The LOELs of nano-objects are generally lower than the LOELs of the corresponding larger objects and they differ by several orders of magnitude between analysed substances: Silver was identified as the most toxic nanomaterial within our selection of nanomaterials. Sustained inflammation can be seen as one possible early event in the sequence of cancer development and nanomaterials can be grouped on basis of their potential to generate inflammation. A preliminary LOEL (based on inflammatory parameters) of 0. 1 mg/m 3 (exposure 24 h/d, 7 d/wk) is proposed to distinguish the so called "inert" nanomaterials (e. g. Carbon Black) from nanomaterials with specific toxicity. Our data further support to have nanotubes in a separate group...|$|R
