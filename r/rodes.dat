5|$|Gossip {{was born}} in New York City on December 6, 1841, to George Hatfeild Gossip, an Englishman, and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip, of New York. When he was sixteen months old, his mother died; about two years later, {{he and his father}} moved to England. His aunt, Mrs. Reaston <b>Rodes,</b> raised him, {{apparently}} with little involvement by his father. Gossip grew up at Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire (the <b>Rodes</b> family seat) and at Hatfield, in Yorkshire. Both the Gossip and <b>Rodes</b> families are listed in Burke's Landed Gentry. He was educated at Windermere College, Westmorland, and won a scholarship to Oxford University, but was unable to attend as his father, uncle, and aunts lost a lawsuit that ruined them financially. As a result, Gossip had to support himself through his own labors.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, {{there was}} {{fighting}} both west (Hill's Corps renewing their {{attacks on the}} I Corps) and north (Ewell's Corps attacking the I and XI Corps) of Gettysburg. Ewell, on Oak Hill with <b>Rodes,</b> saw Howard's troops deploying before him, and he interpreted this as the start of an attack and implicit permission to set aside Gen. Lee's order not {{to bring about a}} general engagement.|$|E
5|$|Rodes's {{original}} faulty {{attack at}} 2:00 had stalled, but he launched his reserve brigade, under Ramseur, against Paul's Brigade in the salient on the Mummasburg Road, with Doles's Brigade against the left {{flank of the}} XI Corps. Daniel's Brigade resumed its attack, now to the east against Baxter on Oak Ridge. This time <b>Rodes</b> was more successful, mostly because Early coordinated an attack on his flank.|$|E
50|$|Gautam <b>Rode</b> {{was born}} on 14 August 1977 in Delhi, India. Earlier, <b>Rode</b> and his family used to stay in New Delhi, but later they shifted to Mumbai. <b>Rode</b> had to face many {{financial}} crises in Mumbai. <b>Rode's</b> father, Surendra <b>Rode</b> is a retired broker and his mother, Sangeeta <b>Rode</b> is a jewellery designer. <b>Rode</b> also has an elder sister, Rashmi. <b>Rode</b> did his schooling from Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan in Delhi. He completed his college from Shaheed Bhagat Singh College. He is a fitness enthusiast and a vegetarian. He currently stays in Kandivali, Mumbai.|$|R
50|$|But <b>Rode</b> Jeugd {{would also}} give {{problems}} to the <b>Rode</b> Vlag-group. A clash of generations erupted, and in October 1967 the <b>Rode</b> Jeugd-group broke away {{and formed a}} separate organization called <b>Rode</b> Jeugd.|$|R

5|$|Baxter's brigade {{was worn}} {{down and out}} of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson {{replaced}} it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul. <b>Rodes</b> then committed his two reserve brigades: Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, but Paul's brigade held its crucial position. Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before {{the end of the}} day, three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter {{was elected}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 1808. In a four-man race, he {{received more than}} three times the number of votes as his nearest opponent. His four-year term under Governor Charles Scott was largely undistinguished. Although the exact date is unknown, it is likely that the death of Slaughter's second wife preceded his election as lieutenant governor. On October 3, 1811, he married his third wife, Elizabeth (Thompson) <b>Rodes,</b> a widow from Scott County.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Clements {{worked as}} a rigger in the oil fields of east Texas. In 1921, however, his father's health began to fail, and he {{returned}} to Kentucky to help him on the farm and served as his deputy sheriff. As a hobby, he also coached football at his high school alma mater. One of his assistant coaches, <b>Rodes</b> K. Myers, {{would go on to}} be lieutenant governor under Keen Johnson. On January 18, 1927, Clements married Sara M. Blue. Their only child, Elizabeth (Bess) Hughes Clements Abell, became social secretary to Lady Bird Johnson and Walter Mondale.|$|E
50|$|He was {{a son of}} Margrethe <b>Rode,</b> {{the brother}} of {{politician}} Ove <b>Rode,</b> and father of actor Ebbe <b>Rode.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1966 the <b>Rode</b> Vlag-group started another periodical, <b>Rode</b> Jeugd (Red Youth). Through <b>Rode</b> Jeugd. Through {{the militant}} {{messages}} given in <b>Rode</b> Jeugd, the group expanded. It gained supporters in IJmuiden, Kampen, Eindhoven, Hague and Rotterdam.|$|R
50|$|There is a Local Nature Reserve at <b>Roding</b> Valley Meadows off <b>Roding</b> Lane {{which follows}} the River <b>Roding</b> up to Loughton.|$|R
5|$|<b>Rodes</b> {{initially}} sent three brigades south against Union {{troops that}} represented the right {{flank of the}} I Corps and the left flank of the XI Corps: from east to west, Brig. Gen. George P. Doles, Col. Edward A. O'Neal, and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson. Doles's Georgia brigade stood guarding the flank, awaiting the arrival of Early's division. Both O'Neal's and Iverson's attacks fared poorly against the six veteran regiments in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter, manning a line in a shallow inverted V, facing north on the ridge behind the Mummasburg Road. O'Neal's men were sent forward without coordinating with Iverson on their flank and fell back under heavy fire from the I Corps troops.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Opequon, {{also known}} as the Third Battle of Winchester, began in the morning on September 19, 1864. Some historians {{consider}} this the most important battle of the Shenandoah Campaign. Philip Sheridan's Army of the Shenandoah defeated Jubal Early's Army of the Valley. Union casualties were about 5,000 out of 40,000 men, while Confederate casualties were about 3,600 out of 12,000 men. Generals and colonels on both sides were killed, including Confederate Colonel George S. Patton Sr.—grandfather of the famous World War II tank commander, General George S. Patton. Confederate General Robert E. <b>Rodes</b> was killed, and Confederate cavalry generals Fitzhugh Lee and Bradley Johnson were among the wounded. General David Allen Russell, killed in action, was among the Union casualties.|$|E
5|$|Around 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps {{divisions}} of Maj. Gens. Robert E. <b>Rodes</b> and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. Edward A. O'Neal and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a blunder by Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly {{north of town}} and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a salient in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rode</b> Heath is a {{small village}} in the civil parish of Odd <b>Rode,</b> within the unitary {{authority}} of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of in Cheshire, England near Alsager. According to the 2001 census, <b>Rode</b> Heath had a population of 2,150. The village was previously two villages, <b>Rode</b> Heath and Thurlwood. Since extensive housing developments in Thurlwood the two are known simply as <b>Rode</b> Heath.|$|R
50|$|Red Youth (<b>Rode</b> Jeugd) was a {{communist}} {{organization in the}} Netherlands. It originated in the group around the periodical <b>Rode</b> Jeugd, which had been started by the pro-China <b>Rode</b> Vlag-grouping in 1966. In October 1967 the group around <b>Rode</b> Jeugd broke away, and formed their own organisation, Red Youth.|$|R
50|$|The Trent and Mersey Canal {{runs through}} <b>Rode</b> Heath. The village has two pubs, a primary school, post office, shop and takeaway. There are two churches; the Church of the Good Shepherd, {{one of the}} three churches that make up the Parish of Odd <b>Rode,</b> and the Rhema Mission Church (<b>Rode</b> Heath Chapel). Close by is <b>Rode</b> Hall, the gardens of which are a tourist attraction. The current owner of <b>Rode</b> Hall is Lady Wilbraham.|$|R
5|$|Breckinridge visited Kentucky in May 1843. His {{efforts to}} mediate between {{his mother and}} the Breckinridges {{extended}} his visit and after he contracted influenza, he decided to remain for the summer rather than returning to Iowa's colder climate. While at home, he met Bullock's cousin, Mary Cyrene Burch, and by September, they were engaged. In October, Breckinridge went to Iowa to close out his business, then returned to Kentucky and formed a law partnership with Samuel Bullock, Thomas's cousin. He married on December 12, 1843, and settled in Georgetown, Kentucky. The couple had six children – Joseph Cabell (b. 1844), Clifton <b>Rodes</b> (b. 1846; later a Congressman from Arkansas), Frances (b. 1848), John Milton (b. 1849), John Witherspoon (b. 1850) and Mary Desha (b. 1854). Gaining confidence in his ability as a lawyer, Breckinridge moved his family back to Lexington in 1845 and formed a partnership with future U.S. Senator James B. Beck.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>Rodes</b> beat Schurz to Oak Hill, so the XI Corps {{division}} {{was forced to}} take up positions in the broad plain north of the town, below and {{to the east of}} Oak Hill. They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when he heard about Ewell's arrival. Howard's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north. He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for the Confederates, <b>Rodes</b> {{lost control}} of his men, who ran beyond their {{objectives}} and descended into confusion. <b>Rodes</b> hesitated to continue with Early's plan, which called for him to push north into the rear area of Warren's corps. Much of Early's corps was still in march column. Also, Anderson's corps, {{which was supposed to}} support Early, was delayed in arriving. Warren began shifting his corps to face south toward Early and Crawford reformed at the farm lane. Griffin's division moved in to support him and the V Corps artillery, under Col. Charles S. Wainwright, arrived and set up several batteries north of Shady Grove Road, on Crawford's left. Griffin's division dug in on Crawford's right.|$|E
25|$|Although lacking {{military}} {{education or}} experience, Gordon was elected captain {{of a company}} of the 6th Alabama Infantry Regiment. He was present at First Bull Run, but did not see any action. During a reorganization of the Confederate army in May 1862, the regiment's original colonel, John Siebels, resigned and Gordon was elected the new colonel. Gordon's first combat experience happened {{a few weeks later}} at Seven Pines, when his regiment was {{in the thick of the}} fighting and he took over as brigade commander from Brig. Gen Robert <b>Rodes</b> when the latter was wounded. Shortly after the battle, the 26th Alabama was transferred to Rodes' brigade as part of an army reorganization. Its commander, Col. Edward O'Neal, outranked Gordon, and thus took command of the brigade until <b>Rodes</b> resumed command just in time for the Seven Days Battles. Gordon was again hotly engaged at Gaines Mill, and he was wounded in the eyes during the assault on Malvern Hill. On June 29, <b>Rodes,</b> still suffering from the effects of his wound from Seven Pines, took a leave of absence, with O'Neal commanding the brigade once again. During the Northern Virginia Campaign, Gordon and his regiment were kept in the Richmond area.|$|E
