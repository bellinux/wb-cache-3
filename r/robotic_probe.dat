5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a <b>robotic</b> <b>probe</b> would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E
25|$|Slow {{interstellar}} missions {{based on}} current and near-future propulsion technologies are associated with trip times starting from about one hundred years to thousands of years. These missions consist of sending a <b>robotic</b> <b>probe</b> to a nearby star for exploration, similar to interplanetary probes such as used in the Voyager program. By taking along no crew, the cost {{and complexity of the}} mission is significantly reduced although technology lifetime is still a significant issue next to obtaining a reasonable speed of travel. Proposed concepts include Project Daedalus, Project Icarus, Project Dragonfly, Project Longshot., and more recently Breakthrough Starshot.|$|E
25|$|Warren Ellis' Ultimate Galactus Trilogy {{originally}} {{suggested that}} the Ultimates' ally the Vision was the herald of Galactus, a <b>robotic</b> <b>probe</b> that travels through space warning civilizations of the impending arrival of Gah Lak Tus. In the final miniseries of the trilogy, Ultimate Extinction, silvery humanoids began to appear, sent to trigger mass suicides {{in order to reduce}} the population's resistance. Suicide cults founded by the creatures began to appear all across the globe as Gah Lak Tus drew near. These silvery beings had the ability to grow wings; morph into an ovoid; form spikes; or take an intermediary form, gliding on an oval surface. They also demonstrated the ability to manipulate large quantities of energy.|$|E

25|$|However, the 16-year-old Robert Goddard was {{inspired}} by the story and spent much of his life building rockets. The research into rockets begun by Goddard eventually culminated in the Apollo program's manned landing on the Moon, and the landing of <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> on Mars.|$|R

50|$|One of his discoveries was 253 Mathilde, {{which was}} visited by the {{spacecraft}} NEAR Shoemaker on June 27, 1997. The <b>robotic</b> <b>probe</b> passed within 1200 km of Mathilde at 12:56 UT at 9.93 km/s, returning imaging and other instrument data including over 500 images which covered 60% of Mathilde's surface.|$|E
25|$|Advances in {{technology}} {{over the last}} decade have made probes smaller and lighter. As a result, <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> and communications satellites can now use expendable launch vehicles, such as the Delta and Atlas V, which are less expensive and perceived to be more reliable than the Shuttle.|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{extraterrestrial}} intelligence must include complementary observing programs that investigate {{our solar system}} and near Earth. Solar system observing strategies involve a search for energy (e. g., artificial microwaves) or physical manifestations (e. g., exploratory <b>robotic</b> <b>probes)</b> that may be present. Artificial electromagnetic emissions from <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> may be detectable using existing ground-based radio-telescope observatories like Arecibo, or those undergoing construction such as the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). Future systems like the SETI League’s Array 2 k and the SETI Institute’s ATA are well suited {{to the task of}} searching the solar system for anomalous microwave phenomena. Steerable phased arrays have the unique ability to produce multiple beams, and shaped antenna patterns to target and track specific planet-moon systems or regions of deep space. At distances less than 50 AU, large SETI arrays can detect electromagnetic emissions much fainter than those from light years away. Lower free space attenuation (i. e., higher signal-to-noise ratios), a reduced amount of scintillation from the interstellar medium, and other factors improve system performance. Solar System SETI is a search for active exploratory <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> within the solar system. These probes can possibly be discovered if they emit secondary or leakage microwave energy. The radial velocity, range and location of these emissions can be estimated from analysis of measured one-way doppler drifts and data from a synthesized quad-beam monopulse antenna array configuration. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Another of John Karidis inventions {{was one of}} the world's fastest <b>robotic</b> <b>probing</b> systems. Called the [...] "Hummingbird minipositioner". This robot can {{probe and}} test 40-100 {{contacts}} per second on very fine geometry multi-chip modules. The design is used as an exemplar of engineering and robotic discipline in courses at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Michigan, and McGill University.|$|R
5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|R
25|$|Extraterrestrial craft {{are another}} {{target in the}} search for technosignatures. Magnetic sail {{interstellar}} spacecraft should be detectable over thousands of light-years of distance through the synchrotron radiation they would produce through interaction with the interstellar medium; other interstellar spacecraft designs may be detectable at more modest distances. In addition, <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> within the Solar System are also being sought out with optical and radio searches.|$|R
50|$|Percival Lowell {{believed}} that it was the planetary capital of Mars due to the number of canals he claimed intersected at the region. In The Lost Worlds of 2001, Arthur C. Clarke had it as the landing site of the first <b>robotic</b> <b>probe</b> to Mars. In Robert Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, the manned exploratory vessel Envoy lands just south of Solis Lacus.|$|E
50|$|In deep space, {{an alien}} {{overlord}} named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) is alerted {{to the presence}} of quantonium, a powerful energy source on Earth, and he sends a <b>robotic</b> <b>probe</b> to retrieve it. The probe later lands on Earth where the President of the United States (Stephen Colbert) attempts to make first contact with it. However, the attempt fails and the probe goes on a destructive rampage, headed straight for San Francisco.|$|E
50|$|SuperDraco {{is derived}} from Draco, and {{utilizes}} the same storable (non-cryogenic) propellant as the small Draco thrusters, but are over 100 times larger in terms of delivered thrust. The much larger SuperDraco engines will be used on later versions of the Dragon spacecraft to provide launch-escape capability on crew transport flights to low Earth orbit, as well as entry, descent and landing control of the proposed Red Dragon <b>robotic</b> <b>probe</b> to Mars.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{underwater}} {{search on}} {{an area of}} 50000 m2 around the finding, using <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> and metal detectors, revealed fragments of the bronze base of the statue, a lead anchor bar, and some amphorae remains.

50|$|The Grand Tour was a NASA {{program that}} would have sent two groups of <b>robotic</b> <b>probes</b> to all the planets of the outer Solar System. It called for four spacecraft, two of which would visit Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto, while the other two would visit Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The {{enormous}} cost of the project, around $1 billion, led to its cancellation and replacement with Mariner Jupiter-Saturn, which became the Voyager program.|$|R
50|$|Descent {{of a small}} lander {{occurred}} on 12 November 2014. Philae is a 220 lb <b>robotic</b> <b>probe</b> that set down on the surface with landing gear.
