50|$|The XT {{received}} a minor update in 1987 {{for the second}} half of the 1987 model year, roughly corresponding to the 1988 launch of the XT6. Early XTs are easily distinguished from later models by inspecting the taillight and <b>reverse</b> <b>light</b> configuration - early models had reverse lights in the rear bumper, while 1987-up models had the reverse lights in the center taillight panel. All wheel drive turbo and six-cylinder models can be distinguished by the shape of the headrests; base models had solid headrests, whereas the turbo AWD and six-cylinder models had a large rectangular hole through the center.|$|E

50|$|In the front, the Marauder shares {{most of its}} trim {{with the}} Grand Marquis; much of the rear and side trim is shared with the Crown Victoria. Both bumpers are unique to the Marauder; the rear {{features}} the model name debossed on the bumper and is redesigned to accommodate the larger Megs tailpipe tips. The front bumper was redesigned with a central air intake added to improve engine ventilation along with twin Cibié fog lamps. The headlight and corner light lenses (from the Grand Marquis) had their non-reflective surfaces blacked out and the grille was painted black with a body-color surround. The taillight and <b>reverse</b> <b>light</b> lenses (from the Crown Victoria) were dark-tinted to the minimum of DOT standards. Unique to the Marauder, the center caps of wheels featured a revival of a 1960s Mercury logo (a silhouette of the Roman god Mercury).|$|E
5000|$|MY 2003 {{also saw}} {{cosmetic}} {{changes to the}} CL. The 5 watt road/fog lamps found on the 2001-02 models were deleted, and non-functional air vents were installed in their place. The grille surround and door handles were now body color, {{as opposed to being}} chrome on the 01-02. The side mirrors were also redesigned (for both the 2002 and 2003 models) by having a more square shape, full body matched paint, and tinted glass since customers had complained about excessive wind noise coming from the mirror seam. The 2003 models also saw new headlights which now featured a blacked-out interior, and the taillight lenses had a cleared turn signal and <b>reverse</b> <b>light.</b> Type-S's now included updated 17 × 7" [...] 12-spoke wheels. Revised thicker exhaust tips were also a new addition. Canadian CLs offer daytime running lights and a windshield washer fluid level sensor as standard equipment (USDM CL's do not have these as an option).|$|E

Replacing the seatbelt interlock, a buzzer would sound if both front seatbelts weren't buckled; the addition of 5-mph bumpers to the rear added still more curb weight. While the 429 V8 {{was replaced by the}} more powerful 460 V8 sourced from Lincoln-Mercury, it now required the use of unleaded gasoline; a low-fuel warning light was added to the dashboard. The gas filler door was moved from behind the license plate to the driver's side rear panel. While looking similar to the 1960s sequential taillights, the new-full width taillights were of a conventional design separated by a central <b>reverse</b> <b>light.</b> [...] 1974 was the first year for special luxury group trim options, the burgundy luxury group ($411) and the white and gold luxury group ($546). These groups added upgraded paint and exterior and interior trim. Standard equipment remained unchanged but there were several new items listed as optional. Some of the most notable, and costly, included power moon roof ($798), auto lamp for automatic on/off of headlights [...] ($34), and power mini-vent windows ($70). AM/FM stereo ($152) or with tape player ($311), power drivers seat ($105), dual power front seats ($210), rear window defroster ($85), power antenna ($31), automatic temperature control ($74), and front cornering lights ($43) also appeared on the option list.|$|E

40|$|Magnesium (Mg) {{has been}} {{described}} to possess an anxiolytic function, {{but a number of}} studies present inconsistent results on this matter. In this study the effect of Mg deficiency on anxiety-related behavior, brain and blood plasma Mg in young adult male C 57 BL/ 6 JOlaHsd and C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl mice was studied. The animals were put on a control or Mg deficient diet from day 0 and significant hypomagnesaemia was evident from day 12 onwards in the test animals. Housing and test conditions were under either conventional light regime (white light behavioral test conditions) or <b>reverse</b> <b>light</b> regime (red light behavioral test conditions). The animals were tested in three tests for unconditioned anxiety: the modified Hole Board (day 14), the light-dark test (day 21) and the elevated plus maze (day 28). Overall integrated behavioral z-scores were calculated over these three behavioral tests. Mg showed a structure dependent distribution {{at the level of the}} brain, that differed between C 57 BL/ 6 substrain and light regime (conventional versus reverse), respectively. Likewise, total brain Mg did differ between substrain and light regime, but was not affected by the diet. Animals on the Mg deficient diet housed under conventional light regime had a higher final (day 28) blood plasma corticosterone level as compared to controls. Animals housed under <b>reverse</b> <b>light</b> regime exhibited no diet effect of plasma corticosterone levels. The significant hypomagnesaemia at blood plasma level resulted in an effect of Mg deficiency on avoidance, but not overall anxiety-related behavior. Significant differences regarding avoidance behavior were found between the two substrains and light regimes, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{heuristic}} {{algorithm is proposed}} for assigning light trail in a WDM mesh topology. For the given network and connection requests, a minimum number of light trail is to be assigned such that all the given connection requests are satisfied. The approach {{is divided into three}} parts. First a Hamiltonian path is found and two light trails are set up along this path, one in the direct direction and other in the reverse direction. Next the traffic matrix (connection request) is divided into two matrices, called downstream matrix and upstream matrix. Next the traffic flow of the downstream matrix using direct light trail is satisfied. Then the upstream matrix using the <b>reverse</b> <b>light</b> trail is satisfied. This minimises the flow time and the number of light trail assigned to be two. The time complexity of the heuristic is computed to be O(n 2), where n is the number of nodes in the network. Major limitation of the presented heuristic is that it works only for topologies which have a Hamiltonian path in it...|$|E
40|$|Substrains of the C 57 BL/ 6 inbred mouse {{are widely}} used in genetic, {{behavioral}} and physiological research, as well as models for human disease. Throughout, {{the choice of the}} respective substrain can have a large influence on experimental results. Likewise, the conditions under which experiments are performed, such as the light regime, can significantly affect the outcome of an experiment, especially when aiming at experimental behavior. Here, two commonly used mouse substrains, C 57 BL/ 6 JOlaHsd and C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl, were housed under either a conventional or a <b>reverse</b> <b>light</b> regime and were tested in either the light phase or the dark phase, respectively. All animals were exposed to three unconditioned anxiety-related behavior set-ups: the modified Hole Board test, the light-dark box and the elevated plus maze. Significant substrain and light regime effects were found in all three behavioral tests, with some of the latter being substrain and test specific. This signifies the importance of the choice of substrain used in for example, a mouse knockout experiment studying behavior, also in relation to light regime under which the animals are tested...|$|E
