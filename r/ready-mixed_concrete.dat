25|$|Extensive {{destruction}} {{was caused}} to commercial enterprises and to public infrastructure. According to Palestinian industrialists, 219 factories were destroyed or severely damaged during the Israeli military operation. Of the three per cent of industrial capacity {{that was still}} operating after the 18-month Israeli blockade, much has now been destroyed. The biggest Palestinian food-processing plant, Alweyda was devastated, as were both Abu Eida, the largest <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> producer, with four factories demolished, and the Al Badr flour mills, with the biggest storage facilities in the Strip. All three had close and long-standing contact with Israeli partner firms and suppliers. The owners stated that they see this {{as part of an}} economic war to make Gaza dependent on Israel.|$|E

Globally, the ready-mix concrete industry, the largest segment of the concrete market, is projected to exceed $100 billion in revenue by 2015.

30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate the protecting performance of hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete against lateral forces such as explosives or flying objects. The objective of {{this research}} is to better prepare this concrete for use in the <b>ready-mix</b> <b>concrete</b> industry. Even though the fiber addition gives it strong mechanical properties, it also decreases workability due to the inefficient dispersion of fibers. Therefore, it has been difficult to apply to the <b>ready-mix</b> <b>concrete</b> plant’s mixing, delivery and on-site placement. The authors have developed a combined steel and polyaramid fiber that gives the favorable protection needed against high-impact forces and provides a suitable workability for the <b>ready-mix</b> <b>concrete</b> system. To evaluate the required performance, the hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete specimen was subjected to high-speed projectiles and had its workability and performance tested on a construction site of an established <b>ready-mix</b> <b>concrete</b> company. The hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete successfully provided the protection capabilities sought for the finished product and provided a workable-ready mix applicability.|$|R
