It is shown that statistically significant gross profits can be generated by a naïve strategy for most of the considered holding periods ranging from 3 months to 18 months. However, after the deduction of generous transaction costs, the net profits are statistically significant only for the 6 -month holding period returns. The implications of the profits produced by <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> trading methodology on the efficiency of the BAB futures market are also addressed.

5000|$|In futures trading, a {{box spread}} is a spread {{constructed}} from two consecutive butterfly spreads (also {{known as a}} [...] "double butterfly"), summing to +1 -3 +3 -1 in consecutive, or at least equally spaced, contracts. The term also has an alternative meaning {{within the context of}} inter-commodity spreads whereby it refers to either an inter-commodity spread within one month offset by the same inter-commodity spread but in another month (or alternatively a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> for each respective instrument). Often presumed not to move much (as in theory they are practically non directional) they typically, but not always, trade in a range. The box spread, like normal butterfly and <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads,</b> derives it's hedging construction from characteristics of Pascal's Triangle.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis are futures spreads, more {{specifically}} trading strategies based on two approaches - cointegration tested on inter-commodity spreads and seasonality observed amongst <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads.</b> Commodity pairs which we identify to be cointegrated are tested for four mean reversion strategies, three of them being based on fair value approach, the fourth on the relative value approach. Similarly <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> exhibiting seasonality are optimized for naive buy and hold trading strategies. Both approaches are tested on in-sample and out-of-sample data. Amongst seasonal strategies we have not found a pattern yielding sufficiently profitable signals in both in-sample and out-of-sample periods. Inter-commodity spreads on the other returned profitable strategies on cointegrated spreads which were also similar in physical nature. The exception to that rule were spreads known well in the industry, which failed to deliver positive results in the out-of-sample period...|$|R

50|$|In Derivatives trading, a term {{diagonal}} spread {{is applied to}} an options spread position that shares features of both a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> and a vertical spread.

50|$|In finance, a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> (also {{called a}} time spread or {{horizontal}} spread) is a spread trade involving the simultaneous purchase of futures or options expiring {{on a particular}} date and {{the sale of the}} same instrument expiring on another date. The legs of the spread vary only in expiration date; they are based on the same underlying market and strike price.|$|R

50|$|If, on {{the other}} hand, the spread between a future traded on an {{underlying}} asset and the spot price of the underlying asset was set to widen, possibly due to a rise in short-term interest rates, then an investor would be advised to sell the <b>spread</b> (i.e. a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> where the trader sells the near-dated instrument and simultaneously buys the future on the underlying).|$|R
50|$|The last risk {{to avoid}} when trading <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> is an {{untimely}} entry. In general, market timing {{is much less}} critical when trading spreads, but a trade that is very ill-timed {{can result in a}} max loss very quickly.

5000|$|For traders who own {{calls or}} puts against a stock, {{they can sell}} an option against this {{position}} and [...] "leg" [...] into a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> at any point. For example, if you own calls on a particular stock and it has made a significant move to the upside but has recently leveled out, you can sell a call against this stock if you are neutral over the short term. Traders can use this legging-in strategy to ride out the dips in an upward trending stock.|$|R
50|$|A {{great deal}} of the trading on these {{contracts}} is exchange traded multi-leg strategies, essentially bets upon the future shape of the yield curve and/or basis. Both Liffe and CME allow direct exchange trading in <b>calendar</b> <b>spreads</b> (the order book for spreads is separate from that of the underlying futures), which are quoted in terms of implied prices (price differences between futures of different expiries). Exchange-traded futures spreads greatly reduce execution risk and slippage, allowing traders to place guaranteed limit orders for entire spreads, otherwise impossible when entering into spreads via two separate futures orders.|$|R

50|$|If {{short-term}} interest rates were expected to fall in a contango market, this would narrow the spread between a futures contract and an underlying asset in good supply. This is because the cost of carry will fall due to the lower interest rate, which in turn results in {{the difference between the}} price of the future and the underlying growing smaller (i.e. narrowing). An investor would be advised to buy the spread in these circumstances: this is a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> trade where the trader buys the near-dated instrument and simultaneously sells the far-dated instrument (i.e. the future).|$|R
40|$|One {{distinguishable}} {{feature of}} storable commodities {{is that they}} relate to two markets: cash market and storage market. This paper proves that, if no arbitrage exists in the storage-cash dual markets, the commodity convenience yield has to be non-negative. However, classical reduced-form models for futures term structures could allow serious arbitrages due to the high volatility of the convenience yield. To avoid negative convenience yield, this paper proposes a semi-affine arbitrage-free model, which prices futures analytically and fits futures term structures reasonably well. Importantly, our model prices commodity-related contingent claims (such as <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> options) quite differently with classical models. No-arbitrage condition Exponential affine model Convenience yield Kalman filter...|$|R
50|$|In summary, it is {{important}} to remember that a long <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> is a neutral - and in some instances a directional - trading strategy that is used when a trader expects a gradual or sideways movement in the short term and has more direction bias over the life of the longer-dated option. This trade is constructed by selling a short-dated option and buying a longer-dated option, resulting in a net debit. This spread can be created with either calls or puts, and therefore can be a bullish or bearish strategy. The trader wants to see the short-dated option decay at a faster rate than the longer-dated option.|$|R
5000|$|A {{common use}} of the <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> is to [...] "roll over" [...] an expiring {{position}} into the future. When a futures contract expires, its seller is nominally obliged to physically deliver some quantity of the underlying commodity to the purchaser. In practice, this is almost never done; {{it is far more}} convenient for both buyers and sellers to settle the trade financially rather than arrange for physical delivery. This is most commonly done by entering into an offsetting position in the market. For example, someone who has sold a futures contract can effectively cancel the position out by purchasing an identical futures contract, and vice versa.|$|R

50|$|When trading a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread,</b> try {{to think}} of this {{strategy}} as a covered call. The only difference is that you do not own the underlying stock, but you do own the right to purchase it. By treating this trade like a covered call, it will help you pick expiration months quickly. When selecting the expiration date of the long option, it is wise to go at least two to three months out. This will depend largely on your forecast. However, when selecting the short strike, it is a good practice to always sell the shortest dated option available. These options lose value the fastest, and can be rolled out month-to-month {{over the life of the}} trade.|$|R
25|$|While {{the use of}} the {{calendar}} appears to have spread southward to Sukhothai and eastward to Laotian states in the following centuries, the official adoption farther south by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and farther east by Lan Xang came only after King Bayinnaung's conquests of those kingdoms in the 16th century. Subsequent Siamese kingdoms retained the Burmese calendar as the official calendar under the name of Chulasakarat (Pali: Culāsakaraj) until 1889.

50|$|According to Sosnoff, the {{two main}} keys to {{successful}} options trading are the market liquidity of options and understanding volatility and, in particular, implied volatility and implied volatility rank. Options trading can be successful in liquid underlyings, when volatility is properly assessed, and options strategies appropriate to an individual investor's risk and financial resources are used. For example, for an investor with a sufficiently large margin account, with stocks with liquid options and high implied volatility rank, selling a straddle or strangle might be a viable strategy. Similarly, for an investor with a smaller margin account, selling an iron condor or iron butterfly (iron fly) might be more appropriate. When implied volatility is low, a <b>calendar</b> <b>spread</b> {{might be a better}} option.|$|R
