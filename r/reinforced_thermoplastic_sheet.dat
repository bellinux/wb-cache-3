40|$|AbstractPress forming of {{a carbon}} fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>sheet</b> with {{consolidated}} thermoplastic resin was studied. The carbon fibers deform during the press forming {{of a flat}} plane weave sheet to a rectangle cup. The fabric deformation depends {{on the relationship between}} the direction of fibers and that of the die corners. The difference in the deformation is attributed to the deformation availability of the woven carbon fiber. The deformation behavior in the forming should be considered in the design of die profiles, die clearance, and the requirements for the mechanical properties of the formed product...|$|E
40|$|A heating-transferring {{equipment}} {{of carbon}} fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>sheet</b> (CFRTP sheet) for press forming was developed. The functions of heating, transferring and placing the CFRTP sheet onto the die were {{integrated into the}} equipment {{in order to prevent}} the heated CFRTP sheet from being cooled during transferring. The height of the heater is 50 mm {{so that it can be}} inserted between the upper and the lower die when the die is open in order to minimize the distance between the heater and the die. The placing function of the heated CFRTP sheet was realized using the belt conveyor mechanism of combination of heating panel and belt. The heating-transferring equipment can place the CFRTP sheet of 850 mm length, 450 mm width and 3 mm thick onto the lower die within 5 s after heating it up to 260 °C. This paper presents details of the function and the mechanism, the result of verification of the performance and the future development of the heating-transferring equipment.

40|$|Long-Fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>Thermoplastics</b> (LFT) {{have gained}} an {{increasing}} {{market share in}} the automotive industry since the last decade. Already known in some large scale applications, the processing of semi-finished products, as GMT (glass-mat <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>sheets)</b> and LFT-G (long-fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> granules), constitutes the state-of-the-art of these materials. The LFT-D process, in which continuous rovings are fed directly into the polymer melt, differs fundamentally from the GMT and LFT-G processes in that it avoids the need of semi-finished products manufactured by the material supplier. It is therefore a cost effective measure. Further advantages of this technology are high output-capacity and flexibility in fiber and polymer-modification {{in accordance with the}} customers needs.

40|$|Endless fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>sheets</b> (organic sheets) are {{significantly}} gaining in importance {{due to their}} outstanding characteristics. In comparison to common thermoplastic press moulding composites with random reinforcement like GMT and LFRT they offer remarkably better specific mechanical properties (stiffness, strength). And different from endless fibre reinforced thermosets, they also possess high toughness and show good impact behaviour. Furthermore, they enable welding and have an appreciable recycling potential. The manufacturing steps, beginning from impregnation and consolidation of the semi-finished sheets up to thermoforming and welding to obtain the final part, represent a closed processing chain. This results in short cycle times {{and the potential for}} mass production. However, this material class is rarely used because of its cost and surface quality problems. Therefore, only a few applications exist as demanding functional or structural parts. (orig.)

40|$|To build a {{processing}} method for textile carbon fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> (CFRTP) <b>sheets,</b> a production system to form, cut, and join the sheets by using a mechanical servo press machine was developed and examined. The system's problems were analyzed, and {{attempts were made to}} solve them through a series of processes. In press forming, the effects of sheet geometry, fiber orientation, and slide motion on the forming of the variant-cross-sectional-beam, which has a narrow and wide part, were investigated. In addition, the shear-cutting method was chosen trimming the unnecessary region of the variant-cross-sectional-beam. For the joining process, a thermal welding method that uses a heating-plate was chosen. The closed-sectional-beam was fabricated by thermally welding a pair of the variant-cross-sectional-beams. Finally, the potential of the production system for textile CFRTP sheets using the mechanical servo press machine was discussed. © 2016 The Authors Polymer Composites published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society of Plastics Engineers. in Press / Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R

50|$|Short fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastics</b> have a {{broad range}} of {{applications}} due to fiber reinforcement properties. Short fiber thermoplastics are able to withstand up to 30,000 psi of applied tensile load and have an elastic modulus on the order of 2 x 106 psi. They are ideal for applications for which toughness is of critical importance, high volume production is involved, and long shelf life and scrap recycling are important issues. With all of these performance capabilities, one of the greatest advantages to using short fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastics</b> is their ease of processing and reprocessability.Ease of processing has been the key factor to the widespread use of short fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastics.</b> Effective processing techniques and the ability to recycle scrap offer significant cost reductions that compare to those of thermoset compounds and metals. Because of this, short fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>thermoplastics</b> are desired in the electrical and electronic, automotive, oilfield, chemical process, and defense industries. Although short fiber thermoplastics have progressed considerably over the years and have a secured spot in a colossally-sized market, further refinement of compounding and process technology along with improvements in part design could allow the performance window of these materials to widen significantly, allowing them to be used for more applications in the future.|$|R

This intermediate material has been called “microbraid yarn (MBY.) ” Moreover, {{it is well known that}} the interfacial properties between natural fiber and resin are low; therefore, surface treatment on continuous natural fiber was performed by using polyurethane (PU) and flexible epoxy (FLEX) to improve the interfacial properties.
