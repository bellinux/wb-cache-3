40|$|Abstract—This letter {{analyzes}} the impact, from a networklayer perspective, {{of having a}} single cognitive radio transmitterreceiver pair share the spectrum with multiple primary users wishing to communicate to a single receiver in a multi-access channel (MAC). In contrast to previous work which assumes a time division multi-access strategy, here, we assume the set of primary users simultaneously access the channel to deliver their packets to a common destination. We derive the symmetric stable throughput regions, consisting of maximal arrival rates for primary and secondary (or cognitive radio) users under two investigated protocols. The first protocol is a conventional MAC scheme where the primary and secondary nodes operate independenly. The second protocol corresponds to a multi-access <b>relay</b> <b>channel</b> (MARC) which exploits user cooperation between primary and secondary nodes. We prove that cooperation is beneficial in the considered MARC as it enables higher throughputs for both primary and secondary users.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand for multimedia services {{has led to}} the extensive use of fixed wireless outdoor networks, where the transmitted information signals arrive to the final destination through a relay node, creating a dual-hop transmission. Due to the increased demand for bandwidth and the spectral congestion at low frequencies, operation at frequencies above 10 GHz satisfying the Line-Of-Sight condition is required. At this frequency range, the dominant fading mechanism exposing spatial and temporal stochastic properties is rain attenuation, typically modeled as a lognormal flat fading channel when expressed in dB (log-lognormal in linear scale). In this paper, the outage performance of a dual hop system using several <b>radio</b> <b>relay</b> types is presented and physical prediction models with analytical formulas are proposed, employing spatially correlated lognormal fading channels.

40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of communication networks, cooperative communication {{has been more}} widely used in many different fields, such as satellite networks, broadcast networks, internet and so on. Therefore <b>relay</b> <b>channels</b> have been playing a pivotal role since their definitions were proposed by Van-der Meulen. However, the general achievable rate region of a <b>relay</b> <b>channel</b> is still unknown which inspires more people to persistently work on. There are several different kinds of coding schemes proposed by people after <b>relay</b> <b>channels</b> came into our lives. Until now, the two most commonly used coding strategies of <b>relay</b> <b>channels</b> are Decode-and-Forward and Compress-and-Forward. In this thesis we will provide a way to obtain the achievable rate region for two-way <b>relay</b> <b>channels</b> by using decode-and-forward coding. With the knowledge of basic information theory and network information theory, we will focus our study on the achievable rates of <b>relay</b> <b>channels.</b> Most of the previous study of <b>relay</b> <b>channels</b> are aiming to find a more general achievable rate region. In this thesis, an intuitional way {{will be used to}} study four-terminal <b>relay</b> <b>channels.</b> This method makes a good use of the information from three-terminal <b>relay</b> <b>channels</b> by separating a four-terminal <b>relay</b> <b>channel</b> into two parts: (1). a three-terminal relay channel; (2). a common end node. The final achievable rate region is obtained by combing together the separate achievable rates of the two parts. We split the complex model to two easier ones, this idea may give help for doing researches on more complicated channels. Eliminating interferences is also a difficulty in the study of <b>relay</b> <b>channels.</b> Comparing with the achievable rate regions of two-way two-relay channels which have already been proved, we found that it is feasible to separate a two-way two-relay channel into a three-terminal <b>relay</b> <b>channel</b> and an common end node. Therefore, we apply this method to all two-way four-terminal <b>relay</b> <b>channels.</b> After fixing two different source nodes, all of the possible transmission schemes are presented in this thesis. However not all of the four-terminal channels can be separated into two parts. By studying the schemes failed to be decomposed to a three-terminal <b>relay</b> <b>channel</b> and a common end node, we found that these schemes are infeasible for message transmission.

40|$|Abstract—In an {{underlay}} {{cognitive radio}} (CR) system, a sec-ondary user can transmit when the primary is transmitting but {{is subject to}} tight constraints on the interference it causes to the primary receiver. Amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying is an effec-tive technique that significantly improves {{the performance of a}} CR by providing an alternate path for the secondary transmitter’s signal to reach the secondary receiver. We present and analyze a novel optimal relay gain adaptation policy (ORGAP) in which the relay is interference aware and optimally adapts both its gain and transmit power as a function of its local channel gains. ORGAP minimizes the symbol error probability at the secondary receiver subject to constraints on the average relay transmit power and on the average interference caused to the primary. It is different from ad hoc AF relaying policies and serves as a new and fundamental theoretical benchmark for relaying in an underlay CR. We also develop a near-optimal and simpler relay gain adaptation policy that is easy to implement. An extension to a multirelay scenario with selection is also developed. Our extensive numerical results for single and multiple relay systems quantify the power savings achieved over several ad hoc policies for both MPSK and MQAM constellations.

40|$|Ever {{evolving}} bandwidth hungry applications {{present a}} gigantic challenge and an unprecedented opportunity for wireless communication. Radio spectrum is already congested. The researchers are vigorously pursuing e?cient utilisation of radio spectrum {{and use of}} alternate media. Optical wireless is an attractive alternative media that can provide ultra high bandwidth and unregulated spectrum. However, its area of coverage is severely restricted by atmospheric turbulence and misalignment errors. Cooperative relaying can enhance the coverage and availability of optical wireless. This motivates the present study of an optical wireless <b>relay</b> <b>channel</b> (OWRC). Whereas <b>radio</b> frequency wireless <b>relay</b> <b>channel</b> has been widely investigated, study of an OWRC is a novel subject. Focus of this thesis is to develop capacity region by de?ning upper and lower bounds, the minimum energy per bit required for reliable communication and the outage capacity due to fading induced by scintillation and misalignment errors. An OWRC is the classical three node network comprising source, relay and destination nodes. The nodes are interconnected by optical wireless. The optical wireless links of the OWRC {{are assumed to be}} Gaussian. The upper bounds are based on the principle of min-max cut ?ow. Expectation of the information divergence between an output measure and the channel law over the joint input probability measure is used to derive the bounds. The choice of output measure is critical in obtaining a tight upper bound. The lower bounds are computed in terms of entropy of the input probability measures. Capacity approaching measures are used for obtaining tight lower bounds. The lower bounds also depend on the relaying strategy. Decode and forward, compress and forward, and amplify and forward relaying is considered in this thesis. It is shown that upper and lower bounds tend to converge when peak signal to noise ratio is high. Fading due to scintillation and misalignment is investigated for di?erent relaying strategies. Probability of outage is derived in closed form for the above mentioned relaying strategies. Bounds on the minimum energy per bit required for reliable communication over an OWRC are de?ned as a function of peak signal level. They are closely related to the lower and upper bounds on the capacity. It is shown that the minimum energy per bit is inversely proportional to the square root of the low signal asymptotic capacity. The results of this thesis provide a comprehensive and novel study of an optical wireless <b>relay</b> <b>channel.</b> It will help in estimating the capacity, coverage and availability issues of optical wireless relay networks in general and <b>relay</b> <b>channels</b> in particular for positioning optical wireless to augment the wireless infrastructure to meet the growing customer needs...|$|R
