5|$|In Puebla, {{a peasant}} died. Inland, 16persons {{were killed in}} the states of Mexico and San Luis Potosí, where heavy rains caused mudslides across higher elevations. In the latter, 11deaths were {{reported}} as two rivers had overflowed their banks while in the former, five people died. Moreover, six people <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> taxi died in Veracruz during Calvin. Across Nayarit, Calvin brought heavy rains to the state. Later in its duration, Calvin struck the Baja California peninsula, though the storm had weakened considerably by that time Offshore, threeships containing 659immigrants were intercepted by the storm, but the ship sustained no damage.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, it proved to be a challenge for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E

5|$|Moon {{earned his}} seat in the 2009 World Series of Poker no-limit Texas hold'em Main Event by winning a $130 {{satellite}} tournament at the Wheeling Island Casino in Wheeling, West Virginia. He lost in two Wheeling Island tournaments before finishing in first place on his third attempt, winning a $10,000 main event seat and $6,000 for expenses. The event marked Moon’s first time playing in the WSOP, as well as visiting Las Vegas, Nevada and <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> commercial plane. Due to the poor economy's impact on the logging business, Moon considered keeping the $10,000 instead of entering the tournament, but decided to play after visiting the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino and watching World Series games there.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 1990, Achebe was <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car to Lagos when an axle {{collapsed}} {{and the car}} flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but {{the weight of the}} vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May 1842, Victoria was <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{carriage}} along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed {{a pistol}} at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster {{and with a}} greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis {{to take a second}} aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.|$|E

5|$|One day later, on February 22, veteran Liberal MP {{and former}} Liberal Party of Canada interim leader Bill Graham {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection in the next federal election. On June 19, 2007, Graham announced he would be resigning his Toronto Centre seat effective July 2, 2007, to allow former Ontario New Democratic Party Premier and Liberal Party leadership candidate Bob Rae to run in the riding.

5|$|During Victoria's first {{pregnancy}} in 1840, in {{the first}} few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason, found not guilty on the grounds of insanity, and committed to an insane asylum indefinitely. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).|$|E
5|$|Several {{portraits of}} Octavius survive. Five portraits of him alone {{and one with}} his brother Alfred are housed in the Royal Collection of the United Kingdom. The first is the more famous {{painting}} by Thomas Gainsborough in 1782, {{which is part of}} a series of paintings of the younger royal children. The second one is after the 1782 portrait by Gainsborough (see above) and is dated to about 1782 or 1784. The third portrait is by Benjamin West and was painted shortly before Octavius's death. Furthermore, among these five portraits, there are two enamels, both after Gainsborough's 1782 portrait; one is by William Bone and the other one is by an anonymous master. The sixth and last portrait represents the apotheosis of Octavius and Alfred (see above) and was painted by West. Another portrait, this time of Queen Charlotte, features Octavius. Painted in 1779 by West, this is both a portrait of the Queen and her children, who are featured in the background. Prince Octavius is at the centre of the group, wearing baby clothes and <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little phaeton. He is pulled along by Prince Ernest and pushed by Prince Adolphus.|$|E

5|$|This {{incident}} arose after Earp {{learned that}} one of his prize horses, stolen more than a year before, was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy. Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton. Accounts differ as to what happened next. Earp later testified that {{when he arrived at the}} Clanton ranch, Billy Clanton gave up the horse even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan's testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft. After the incident, which embarrassed both the Clantons and Behan, Behan testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead.|$|E
5|$|A chapter {{entitled}} Shashthidevyupakhyanam, appended to {{the texts}} Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Devi Bhagavata Purana, narrates {{the tale of}} Shashthi. King Priyavrata – the son of Svayambhuva Manu (the progenitor of mankind) – and his wife Malini performed the putrakamesti yajna (a fire-sacrifice ritual to gain a son) {{in an effort to}} conceive, but after twelve years of pregnancy, a still-born son was delivered to Malini. Priyavrata set off to the cremation grounds with the corpse of his son. On his way, he saw a celestial woman dressed in white silk and jewels, <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavenly chariot. She declared to Priyavrata that she was Devasena, the daughter of Brahma and wife of Skanda. She further said that she was Shashthi, foremost of the Matrikas ("Mothers") of Skanda, and had the power to grant children to devotees. She held the child in her hand and resurrected the infant, then began to leave for her heavenly abode, taking the child with her. Priyavrata stopped the goddess, praising her and pleading that she return his son to him. The goddess agreed on the condition that Priyavrata would initiate and propagate her worship in all three worlds: heaven, earth and the netherworld. She returned the child to the king, naming him Suvrata and declaring that he should become famous as a great, virtuous, and learned ruler. Priyavrata decreed that Shashthi should be worshipped on the sixth day of every month, as well as the sixth and twenty-first days after childbirth, and on all occasions auspicious to a child. She would be worshipped {{in the form of a}} Shaligrama stone, a Purna Ghata under a banyan tree, or an image of her on a wall.|$|E
