The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E
5|$|A <b>retrospective</b> <b>study</b> {{carried out}} at an Auckland {{emergency}} department found that BZP presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database with most cases not producing any significant toxicity. Several cases where BZP individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or illicit drugs resulting in complications exist. One such example is the well publicised case {{of a combination of}} BZP and MDMA by a 23-year-old from Greymouth, New Zealand. Ben Rodham, a DJ, ingested a combination of BZP and MDMA in February 2007, which nearly resulted in his death. Rodham was put into an induced coma in an effort to prevent him from dying. He later recovered.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year <b>retrospective</b> <b>study</b> concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E

5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} <b>retrospective</b> <b>study)</b> and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

40|$|Background: The overall {{prognosis}} {{and survival}} {{of patients with}} advanced gastric cancer are generally poor. Extended lymphadenectomy is recommended for patients with advanced gastric cancer; however, splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy performed with an extended lymph node dissection {{may be associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality. Method: Electronic literature searches were conducted using Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2009. Studies on gastric carcinoma investigating extended lymphadenectomy with splenectomy and/or pancreaticosplenectomy that reported data on surgical outcomes or survival were selected. Results: Forty studies were included in this review. Decreased complication rates were demonstrated with spleen preservation in two prospective <b>studies</b> and three <b>retrospective</b> <b>studies,</b> and with pancreas preservation in five <b>retrospective</b> <b>studies.</b> No randomized controlled trial showed survival benefit or detriment for preservation of spleen or pancreas in extended lymphadenectomy. Improved survival was demonstrated with spleen preservation in two prospective and eight <b>retrospective</b> <b>studies,</b> and with pancreas preservation in one prospective and four <b>retrospective</b> <b>studies.</b> Conclusions: Preservation of the spleen and pancreas during extended lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer decreases complications with no clear evidence of improvement or detriment to overall survival...|$|R

Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant.
