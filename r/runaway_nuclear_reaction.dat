5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> did not take place, the {{pressure}} exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force of gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a <b>runaway</b> <b>nuclear</b> fusion <b>reaction,</b> which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, Pryce {{investigated}} {{how long}} a <b>runaway</b> <b>nuclear</b> chain <b>reaction</b> in an atomic bomb would continue before it blew itself apart. He calculated that since the neutrons produced by fission have energy of about 1 MeV, this corresponded to a speed of [...] The {{major part of the}} chain reaction would be completed in about [...] From 1 to 10 per cent of the fissile material would fission in this time; but even an atomic bomb with 1 per cent efficiency would release as much energy as 180,000 times its weight in [...] TNT.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, while Van Flandern was {{employed}} by the USNO, he began to promote the belief that major planets sometimes explode. In his [...] "Exploded Planet Hypothesis 2000" [...] he lists as possible reasons for explosion either a <b>runaway</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> in uranium in the core, a change of state as the planet cools down, creating a density phase change (like water to ice) and causing it to implode or explode, or absorption of heat from gravitons. In his book Van Flandern described the negative reception of his ideas about exploding planets among mainstream scientists. Van Flandern also speculated that {{the origin of the}} human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded [...] "Planet V".|$|E

5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it {{will no longer}} be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a <b>runaway</b> <b>nuclear</b> fusion <b>reaction</b> that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|R
5000|$|In other words, [...] "thermal runaway" [...] {{describes}} {{a process which}} is accelerated by increased temperature, in turn releasing energy that further increases temperature. In chemistry (and chemical engineering), it is associated with strongly exothermic reactions that are accelerated by temperature rise. In electrical engineering, thermal runaway is typically associated with increased current flow and power dissipation, although exothermic chemical reactions can be of concern here too. Thermal runaway can occur in civil engineering, notably when the heat released by large amounts of curing concrete is not controlled [...] In astrophysics, <b>runaway</b> <b>nuclear</b> fusion <b>reactions</b> in stars can lead to nova and several types of supernova explosions, and also occur as a less dramatic event in the normal evolution of solar mass stars, the [...] "helium flash".|$|R

He joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and helped build the first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. Graves, Harold V. Lichtenberger and Warren Nyer formed Enrico Fermi's [...] "suicide squad" [...] or [...] "liquid-control squad", assigned to smash [...] glass bottles containing a solution of cadmium sulfate over the reactor with hammers if something went wrong. Cadmium is a strong neutron absorber and Fermi hoped that this would halt a <b>runaway</b> <b>nuclear</b> chain <b>reaction,</b> if the reactor control rods proved to be incapable of halting it in the first place.|$|R
2500|$|The {{very first}} uranium bomb, Little Boy, {{dropped by the}} United States on Hiroshima in 1945, used 64 {{kilograms}} of 80% enriched uranium. Wrapping the weapon's fissile core in a neutron reflector (which is standard on all nuclear explosives) can dramatically reduce the critical mass. Because the core {{was surrounded by a}} good neutron reflector, at explosion it comprised almost 2.5 critical masses. Neutron reflectors, compressing the fissile core via implosion, fusion boosting, and [...] "tamping", which slows the expansion of the fissioning core with inertia, allow nuclear weapon designs that use less than what would be one bare-sphere critical mass at normal density. The presence of too much of the 238U isotope inhibits the <b>runaway</b> <b>nuclear</b> chain <b>reaction</b> that is responsible for the weapon's power. The critical mass for 85% highly enriched uranium is about , which at normal density would be a sphere about [...] in diameter.|$|R

25|$|The {{star that}} {{exploded}} as a supernova {{is referred to}} as the supernova's progenitor star. Two types of stars explode as supernovae: white dwarfs and massive stars. In the so-called Type Ia supernovae, gases falling onto a 'dead' white dwarf raise its mass until it nears a critical level, the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in a <b>runaway</b> <b>nuclear</b> fusion explosion that obliterates the star; in Type Ib/c and Type II supernovae, the progenitor star is a massive star whose core runs out of fuel to power its <b>nuclear</b> fusion <b>reactions</b> and collapses in on itself, releasing gravitational potential energy in a form that blows away the star's outer layers. The presence of a pulsar in the Crab Nebula means that it must have formed in a core-collapse supernova; Type Ia supernovae do not produce pulsars.|$|R

TALYS is a <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> {{program which}} simulates <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> that involve neutrons, gamma-rays, protons, deuterons, tritons, helions and alpha-particles, in the 1 keV- 200 MeV energy range. A suite of <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> models has been {{implemented}} {{into a single}} code system, enabling us to evaluate basically all <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> beyond the resonance range. An overview is given of the main nuclear models used, such as newly developed optical models, various compound nucleus, fission, gamma-ray strength, level density and pre-equilibrium models, all driven by a comprehensive database of nuclear structure parameters. The predictive power of the code is demonstrated by comparing calculated results with a very diverse set of experimental observables.
