40|$|Serum {{testosterone}} levels decline progressively as men age, with <b>resulting</b> <b>pathophysiological</b> changes. Because {{the onset of}} andropause is gradual {{and many of its}} symptoms mirror those associated with medications or disease states common in the elderly, a clinical diagnosis can be difficult to make. Additionally, {{because of a lack of}} established normal {{testosterone levels}} for different age groups, as well as confusion regarding what subset of testosterone to measure, simply testing testosterone levels is inadequate. Although clinical studies have shown testosterone supplementation to be safe, no long-term placebo-controlled trials have been performed. Among the possible side effects of testosterone replacement therapy is an increased risk of prostate cancer. While there is no evidence that supplemental testosterone will initiate prostate cancer or cause clinically significant progression of an established occult malignancy, the initial evaluation of patients prior to administration of testosterone requires screening for prostatic carcinoma. A number of formulations of testosterone are currently available; transdermal gels, although expensive, are the preferred modality because of their ease of administration...|$|E
40|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a complex}} cardiac condition characterized by variable degrees of asymmetric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, generally associated with mutations in sarcomere protein genes. While generally perceived as rare, HCM {{is the most common}} genetic heart disease with over one million affected individuals in Europe alone and represents a prevalent cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. To date, HCM remains an orphan disease, as recommended treatment strategies are based on the empirical use of old drugs with little evidence supporting their clinical benefit in this context. In the six decades since the original description of the disease, less than fifty pharmacological studies have been performed in HCM patients, enrolling little over 2, 000 HCM patients, mostly comprising small non-randomized cohorts. No specific agent has been convincingly shown to affect outcome, and critical issues such as prevention of myocardial energy depletion, microvascular ischemia, progressive myocardial fibrosis and the peculiar mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in HCM still need to be addressed in a systematic fashion. However, there is increasing evidence that a variety of drugs may counter the effects of sarcomere protein mutations and the <b>resulting</b> <b>pathophysiological</b> abnormalities at the molecular, cellular and organ level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: 'Preventability' is {{a crucial}} concept in the {{literature}} on adverse drug effects. However, a systematic review of the definitions of preventability of adverse drug effects has suggested that none fits all circumstances. Furthermore, when the reliability of these definitions has been examined they {{have been found to be}} imperfect. OBJECTIVE: To propose and outline a method for determining the theoretical preventability of an adverse drug effect, based on frameworks for classifying adverse drug reactions - the EIDOS and DoTS methods. METHODS: EIDOS is based on the mechanism of action of the drug. It observes that a drug (an Extrinsic species) causes an adverse effect by interacting with an Intrinsic species that is its target when the two are Distributed together, and that the <b>resulting</b> <b>pathophysiological</b> Outcome (the adverse effect) causes the Sequela (the adverse reaction). DoTS observes that the Dose-relatedness of the adverse effect compared with the beneficial effect is relevant (determining toxic, collateral, or hypersusceptibility effects), that adverse effects have Time-courses (varying from immediate to delayed), and that there are individual Susceptibility factors. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We have elicited many published examples that show that each of these factors in the causation of an adverse drug effect can be adduced to assess its preventability. We have constructed a flowchart that illustrates how the processes can be logically analysed. CONCLUSIONS: This approach suggests methods for devising prospective preventive strategies and for deciding retrospectively whether an adverse reaction in an individual should have been prevented...|$|E

40|$|Background: The podocytes {{are injured}} in many {{acquired}} glomerular diseases. This may present as proteinuria or morphological {{changes such as}} foot process effacement (FPE) or loss of podocytes in the urine. The exact mechanisms are still mainly unknown. However, a number of proteins identified in the slit diaphragm (SD) of the podocytes, including Dendrin and Neph 1, {{are believed to be}} of significance in the podocytes’ response to injury and in the <b>resulting</b> <b>pathophysiological</b> development. Dendrin was primarily found to be associated to the actin cytoskeleton in mouse podocytes. Neph 1 is a transmembrane protein that together with Nephrin forms a complex in the SD, involved in polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and proteinuria. Plekhh 2 is an uncharacterized protein that we localized to the podocyte cytoplasm. Aim: The principal aim was to study the expression and role of novel structural glomerular proteins in acquired human glomerular disease. In the first study, focusing on the expression of Dendrin in normal human kidney and in the glomerular disease Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome (MCNS), light and immune electron microscopy (iEM) was used. In the second study, the subcellular localization of the uncharacterized protein Plekhh 2 in normal human kidney and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was investigated by immunofluorescence (IFL) and iEM. Neph 1 and Nephrin were studied in FSGS, MCNS and in the corresponding experimental models Adriamycin nephropathy (ADR) and puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN). Lastly, we returned to Dendrin, and studied the expression in the podocyte nuclei in IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) and Membranous Nephropathy (MN) with iEM and analyzed the gene expression with microarray. Results: Dendrin was localized to the glomerular slit diaphragm (SD). There was no significant change in the amount of Dendrin in MCNS compared to controls by IFL and iEM. In areas of FPE Dendrin was redistributed from the SD to the podocyte cytoplasm. Plekhh 2 was localized mainly to the podocyte cytoplasm. The expression was reduced in FSGS. Double staining of Neph- 1 and Nephrin showed the proteins in close connection in the SD. Neph 1 was significantly reduced in FSGS, MCNS, ADR and PAN. The reduction of Neph 1 was also seen in areas without FPE. Nephrin was unchanged in FSGS, but reduced in MCNS and PAN. Dendrin was increased in the podocyte nuclei in IgAN, with a corresponding two fold increase of the gene expression. Both protein and gene expression of Dendrin was unchanged in MN. Conclusion: In preserved slits and in areas without FPE in MCNS, the amounts of Dendrin were unchanged compared to controls. The redistribution might therefore be secondary to FPE, per se. However, the increase of nuclear Dendrin in IgAN suggests an upregulated apoptotic pathway and a possible role for Dendrin in the pathogenesis of this disease. Plekhh 2 was reduced and relocated from the plasma membrane to centrally in the foot processes in FSGS. Neph 1 was reduced in FSGS, MCNS, ADR and PAN, in contrast to Nephrin which was unchanged in FSGS. This could indicate a disruption of the Neph 1 -Nephrin complex and an involvement of Neph 1 in the pathogenesis of this disease...|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{report that}} tumor cells without {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) show delayed tumor growth, and that tumor formation {{is associated with}} acquisition of mtDNA from host cells. This leads to partial recovery of mitochondrial function in cells derived from primary tumors grown from cells without mtDNA and a shorter lag in tumor growth. Cell lines from circulating tumor cells showed further recovery of mitochondrial respiration and an intermediate lag to tumor growth, while cells from lung metastases exhibited full restoration of respiratory function and no lag in tumor growth. Stepwise assembly of mitochondrial respiratory (super) complexes was correlated with acquisition of respiratory function. Our findings indicate horizontal transfer of mtDNA from host cells in the tumor microenvironment to tumor cells with compromised respiratory function to re-establish respiration and tumor-initiating efficacy.

30|$|Neurocognitive {{impairments}} in ICU survivors may {{be understood as}} a manifestation of occult brain damage <b>resulting</b> from <b>pathophysiological</b> mechanisms related to critical illness and crosstalk between organs [34, 35]. Therefore, it might be interesting to consider ICU patients as a subset of brain-injured patients and treat them with tools such as cognitive stimulation that have proven effective in treating neurocognitive {{impairments in}} outpatient populations [36]. However, neurocognitive stimulation techniques commonly used in post-acute patients are often unfeasible in critically ill patients, who may be bedridden, have low awareness levels that fluctuate during the day, have reduced mobility due to myopathy and ICU-acquired weakness, and are unable to communicate verbally because they are receiving mechanical ventilation. To overcome these barriers to implementing neurocognitive interventions in the ICU, clinicians need safe, feasible, and easy-to-use tools for neurocognitive stimulation. To our knowledge, this study is the first to establish a proof of concept for virtual-reality-based neurocognitive stimulation in critically ill patients.|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) of {{antimicrobial agents}} administered to critically ill patients exhibit marked variability. This variability <b>results</b> from <b>pathophysiological</b> {{changes that occur}} in critically ill patients.

PK-pharmacodynamic indices (fC(max) :MIC; AUC(0 - 24) :MIC; fT(>MIC); fC(min) :MIC) for both antimicrobial effect and suppression of emergence of resistance are described for many antimicrobial drugs. Changing the regimen by which antimicrobial drugs are delivered can help overcome the PK variability and optimise target attainment. This will deliver optimised antimicrobial chemotherapy to individual critically ill patients. Delivery of beta-lactams antimicrobial agents by infusions, rather than bolus dosing, is effective at increasing the duration of the dosing interval that the drug concentration is above the MIC.
