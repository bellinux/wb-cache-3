5|$|East Polynesians {{were the}} first people to reach New Zealand about 1280, {{followed}} by the early European explorers, notably James Cook in 1769 who explored New Zealand three times and mapped the coastline. Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 when the country became a British colony, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia. Due to restrictive policies, limitations were placed on non-European immigrants. During the gold <b>rush</b> <b>period</b> (1858-1880s) large number of young men came from California and Victoria to New Zealand goldfields. Apart from British, there were Irish, North Germans, Scandinavians, Italian and many Chinese. The Chinese were sent special invitations by the Otago Chamber of Commerce in 1866. By 1873 they made up 40 percent of the diggers in Otago and 25 percent of the diggers in Westland. From 1900 there was also significant Dutch, Dalmatian, Italian, and German immigration together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and South Africa. Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased. In 2008–09, a target of 45,000 migrants was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service (plus a 5,000 tolerance).|$|E

50|$|Clown University, {{established}} 1959, is a United States education {{institute for}} people to study clown subjects. The buildings the institution occupies were used as mining camps during gold <b>rush</b> <b>periods.</b> Cyrus Ghanadian has a PHD from Clown University.|$|R
25|$|During {{the gold}} <b>rush</b> <b>period</b> the Djab wurrung saw {{large numbers of}} European and Chinese people camping on their land in search for gold, but the search for gold also {{attracted}} many station hands, and so Djab wurrung people often found employment as station hands and in menial jobs around the stations during this period.|$|E
25|$|Bathurst {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the Gold Country as it was the site of the first gold discovery and where the first gold rush occurred in Australia. Today education, tourism and manufacturing drive the economy. The internationally known racetrack Mount Panorama is a landmark of the city. Bathurst has an historic city centre with many buildings remaining from the gold <b>rush</b> <b>period</b> of the mid to late 1800s.|$|E
25|$|Q85 Limited buses {{make all}} local stops south of Baisley Boulevard and Bedell Street, {{terminating}} at 147th Avenue. During {{most of the}} AM <b>rush</b> <b>period,</b> peak direction (Jamaica-bound) local buses begin service at Farmers Boulevard and Bedell Street in Rochdale Village, at the Locust Manor LIRR station. During the afternoon rush, peak (southbound) local buses alternately terminate at Farmers Boulevard or Green Acres. During all other off-peak periods except late nights, buses alternate between Rosedale and Green Acres.|$|E
50|$|All trains entered Syracuse, New York and Utica, New York on the street, using {{overhead}} trolley.

25|$|The Metropolitan West Side Elevated began service {{onto the}} Loop on October 11, 1897, and a <b>rush</b> <b>period</b> stub {{terminal}} at Wells Street was added October 3, 1904. For {{much of the}} early 20th century and through the 1940s, service on the West Side Elevated lines went unchanged until the Chicago Transit Authority took control of Chicago's Rapid Transit System on October 1, 1947, initiating a series of massive service cuts and station closings (that would last until the 1980s).|$|E
25|$|Bathurst's {{economy was}} {{transformed}} by the discovery of gold in 1851. One illustration of the prosperity gold brought to Bathurst is the growth and status of hotels and inns. The first licensed inn within the township was opened in 1835, the Highland Laddie. At the peak of hotel activity in 1875, coinciding with the gold <b>rush</b> <b>period,</b> there were 61 operating concurrently. A total of 89 hotel locations {{have been identified in}} the town of Bathurst, with 112 operating in the immediate district {{during the course of the}} history in Bathurst. Initially many pubs were simply a cottage with stables. As prosperity increased during the gold rush, the Hotels became typical of architecture of pubs known today.|$|E
500|$|The Palace Hotel in Perth, Western Australia is a {{landmark}} three-storey heritage listed building {{located in the}} city's central business district. [...] Originally built in 1897 as a hotel during the gold <b>rush</b> <b>period</b> of Western Australia's history, it was converted to banking chambers and offices in the 1980s and now accommodates the Perth headquarters of Woods Bagot. The building {{is located on the}} most prominent intersection in the financial district of the city, at the corner of St Georges Terrace and William Street.|$|E

50|$|Despite growing {{ridership}} on the Milton line, GO cannot schedule additional trains {{because of}} the busy Canadian Pacific Railway freight services running on the same tracks. Trains were extended from ten to twelve carriages in a phased roll-out between April 8, 2008 and May 2, 2008 {{in order to increase}} capacity, and congestion is alleviated somewhat by the extensive train-bus services outside of <b>rush</b> <b>periods.</b>|$|R
500|$|Although the 1964 floods had {{initially}} generated support for New Melones, a spirited {{opposition to the}} dam arose from both the river recreation industry and environmentalists who saw the Stanislaus River canyon as having greater value than a reservoir. River runners protested {{the threat to the}} Stanislaus River, which was becoming {{one of the most popular}} whitewater runs in the United States, with the first commercial rafting company established in 1962. The river flowed through the deepest limestone canyon in the US, with cliffs rising [...] above the water in places. Other natural features of the area included extensive limestone caves, and endemic species such as Banksula melones, the Melones cave harvestman. In addition, more than one hundred archaeological and historical sites, left over from Native American inhabitation and the Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>period,</b> were all situated in the reservoir flood zone.|$|E
2500|$|O'Brien's {{parents were}} Luke Joseph O'Brien, a Victorian Police Inspector, and Katherine Josephine Ryan. He was {{the eldest of}} four children, having two {{brothers}} and one sister and was a second generation Victorian on his father's side. His grandfather, James, had immigrated from Ireland during the 1850s Victorian Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As {{the forest}} was almost {{abandoned}} after the gold <b>rush</b> <b>period,</b> a regeneration process emerged. This activity plateaued in the 1960s when shelter wood logging came into effect for silviculture, resulting in more deforestation. However, in the 1970s and 80s, {{the area was}} designated as the [...] "Midlands Forest Management Area" [...] which included the planting of pine trees for commercial exploitation.|$|E
50|$|Translink, the {{regional}} transportation authority, permits two bicycles aboard each SkyTrain car {{at all times}} except in the peak direction at morning and afternoon <b>rush</b> <b>periods.</b> The Canada Line Skytrain permits one bicycle per car with no limitations on time of day or direction.

2500|$|When Prohibition was {{rescinded}} in 1933, {{a private}} {{dining room was}} converted into the El Dorado Diggins bar, evocative of the California Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>period.</b> 1943 saw the United States Navy take over the hotel {{for use as a}} convalescent hospital for war veterans. [...] Some of the changes made to the hotel by the Navy were repainting of the interior, conversion of chauffeur and maid rooms into guest rooms, and enclosure of the original porte-cochere.|$|E
2500|$|Bathurst's {{population}} has had rapid growth periods throughout its history; during {{the mid to}} late 19th century gold <b>rush</b> <b>period,</b> then post World War 2 when migrants from the war ravaged countries were settled in the area and returning soldiers were offered farming land, and at the start of this century has been another fast growth period corresponding in part to Sydney's congestion. [...] Other periods have seen a slightly declining population, including the decade around the 1900s and during the 1960s. The following chart illustrates the growth from 1856 to recent times.|$|E
2500|$|During the California Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>period,</b> the New Almaden Quicksilver Mines {{just south}} of the city were the largest mercury mines in North America (mercury was used to help {{separate}} gold from ore). The cinnabar deposits were discovered in 1845 by a Mexican cavalry captain, Andres Castillero, when he recognized the red powder used by local Ohlone Indians to decorate the chapel at Mission Santa Clara. [...] Mining operations began in 1847 at what was the first operating mine in the province, {{just in time for the}} Gold Rush. The importance of the mercury industry at the time explains why the local newspaper is named the Mercury News.|$|E

25|$|As of , no work to {{date has}} begun and the project remains postponed, {{although}} one additional reversible (zipper-lane) express lane along PR-52 has since been added. Current traffic levels continue to remain heavily congested during <b>rush</b> hour <b>periods.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The [...] and [...] routes {{also provide}} {{service on the}} {{northern}} portion of Merrick Boulevard. At Linden Boulevard, the Q4 turns east towards Cambria Heights. At the intersection of Baisley Boulevard and 120th Avenue, the Q84 turns east along 120th Avenue towards Laurelton near the Montefiore Cemetery. The Q4 also provides limited-stop service along Merrick Boulevard, bidirectional in the AM <b>rush</b> <b>period</b> and towards Cambria Heights during PM rush hours. The n4 local and the n4X express services of the Nassau Inter-County Express also run along Merrick Boulevard from Jamaica to the county line, continuing along Merrick Road to Freeport in Nassau County. These buses, however, only make pick-ups towards Freeport and drop-offs towards Jamaica within Queens.|$|E
2500|$|The CTA [...] also {{embarked}} on a $530 million USD project to rehabilitate and replace stations and infrastructure along the Brown Line. This project was completed in December 2009. Seven of the stations that {{were included in the}} project are shared with the Purple Line, along with the associated trackage and signals from north of the Belmont station to the Loop. Beginning April 2, 2007, operation on the Purple, Brown and Red Lines between Addison and Armitage was restricted to three tracks, down from the previous four, due to construction at the Fullerton and Belmont stations. Because of this, fewer trains operated to downtown during the <b>rush</b> <b>period</b> in order to prevent a bottleneck. Only every other train was sent to the Loop during rush periods; all other trains operated between Linden and Howard only. Full service has since been restored. [...] In addition, the Purple Line Express routing was changed to the Outer Loop, rather than along the Inner Loop, in order to provide riders more options for accessing stations between Belmont and the Loop. This line was returned to the Inner Loop in Spring 2009.|$|E

40|$|NASA and the FAA have {{designed}} and developed and an automation tool {{known as the}} Traffic Management Advisor (TMA). The system was operationally evaluated at the Ft. Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The TMA is a time-based strategic planning tool that provides Traffic Management Coordinators and En Route Air Traffic Controllers the ability to efficiently optimize the capacity of a demand impacted airport. The TMA consists of trajectory prediction, constraint-based runway scheduling, traffic flow visualization and controllers advisories. The TMA was used and operationally evaluated for forty-one <b>rush</b> traffic <b>periods</b> during a one month period in the Summer of 1996. The evaluations included all shifts of air traffic operations as well as periods of inclement weather. Performance data was collected for engineering and human factor analysis and compared with similar operations without the TMA. The engineering data indicates that the operations with the TMA show a one to two minute per aircraft delay reduction during <b>rush</b> <b>periods.</b> The human factor data indicate a perceived reduction in en route controller workload {{as well as an}} increase in job satisfaction. Upon completion of the evaluation, the TMA {{has become part of the}} normal operations at the Ft. Worth ARTCC...|$|R
