60|$|The {{keystone}} of {{the budget}} in Mr. Gladstone's conception was the position to be assigned in it to the income-tax. This he determined to renew {{for a period of}} seven years,--for two years at sevenpence in the pound, for two years more at sixpence, and for the last three at fivepence. By that time he hoped that parliament would be able to dispense with it. Meanwhile it was to be extended to Ireland, in compensation for the <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> owed by Ireland to the British treasury of between four and five millions. It was to be extended, also, at a reduced rate of fivepence, to incomes between a hundred and fifty and a hundred pounds--the former having hitherto been the line of total exemption. From the retention of the income-tax as a portion of the permanent and ordinary finance of the country the chancellor of the exchequer was wholly and strongly averse, and so he remained {{for more than twenty years}} to come. In order, however, to meet a common and a just objection, that under this impost intelligence, enterprise, and skill paid too much and property paid too little, he resolved upon a bold step. He proposed that the legacy duty, hitherto confined to personal property passing on death, either by will or by inheritance and not by settlement, should henceforth be extended to real property, and to both descriptions of property passing by settlement, whether real or personal. In a word, the legacy duty was to extend to all successions whatever. This was the proposal that in many senses cut deepest. It was the first rudimentary breach in the ramparts of the territorial system, unless, indeed, we count as first the abolition of the corn law.[285] Mr. Gladstone eagerly disclaimed any intention of accelerating by the pressure of fiscal enactment changes in the tenure of landed property, and the letters which the reader has already seen (pp. 345-9) show the high social value that he invariably set upon the maintenance of the old landed order. The succession duty, as we shall find, for the time disappointed his expectations, for he counted on two millions, and in fact it yielded little more than half of one. But it secured for its author the lasting resentment of a powerful class.|$|E
40|$|Recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> The thesis aims {{to provide}} {{overview}} of judicial and doctrinal solutions of particular issues regarding the recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> (as {{governed by the}} Czech Commercial Code) and to discuss {{to what extent the}} generally accepted solutions could stand up once the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code (hereinafter referred to as the "New Civil Code") becomes effective. Following the general introduction the recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> is described together with similar legal instruments. Then the thesis focuses on particular issues associated with the instrument <b>of</b> recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt,</b> such as methods of identification of the debt being recognized, relationship between recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> and set-off, ways of explicit and implicit recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> etc. The thesis emphasizes the judicial solutions of these issues and the respective doctrinal scrutiny. The commercial law regulation (as governed by the Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., the Commercial Code) is of the main importance. If appropriate, the civil law regulation (as governed by the Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll., the Civil Code) is used. As the New Civil Code repeals these laws, the thesis looks into the future and attempts to evaluate to what extent the recent conclusions of practice and theory will be applicable.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether and}} the extent to which investors respond to the Rule 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> offering through firm’s stock returns. We conduct an event study methodology with 1, 244 Rule 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> offerings from 1990 to 2012 to answer this question. We find that the announcements <b>of</b> Rule 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> offerings are associated with significant negative abnormal returns and these negative effects are more pronounced for the first-time issuers <b>of</b> 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt.</b> On average, 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> issuers make <b>a</b> loss <b>of</b> 9. 5 basis points (US$ 28. 6 million) from the amount <b>of</b> 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> raised. However, we find a reversal effect on abnormal returns following the registration <b>of</b> 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> after 60 days from the issue date. Our findings suggest that ignoring the sample selection bias <b>of</b> 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> issuance choice can lead to erroneous conclusions that 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> does not affect firm’s abnormal returns. In addition, we also find that firms in larger financial deficit tend to issue 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt...</b>|$|R

These cases show that patients in spontaneous <b>remission</b> <b>of</b> hormonally active pituitary adenomas should be suspected <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pituitary apoplexy.
