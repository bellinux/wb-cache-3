5|$|On 23–24 November 1795, the Battle of Loano was fought. Schérer {{deployed}} Pierre Augereau with 6,961 {{troops on}} the right, Masséna with 13,276 men {{in the center and}} Sérurier with 5,155 soldiers on the left. The plan called for Sérurier to pin down the Allied right while Masséna broke through the center and <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Allied left with the help of Augereau. By luck, Wallis replaced De Vins in command of the Allies on 22 November. That day Sérurier's attack on the Colle San Bernardo was repulsed but it tied down Colli's division. The plan was carried out with success. Masséna and Augereau both defeated the forces in front of them. The Austro-Sardinians suffered losses of 3,000 killed and wounded, 4,000 prisoners, 48 guns and five colors while French losses numbered 2,500 killed and wounded and 500 captured. Snow soon compelled both armies to withdraw into winter quarters. The French soldiers were in a wretched state, with very little food; they became insubordinate and the generals quarreled. Sérurier got into a dispute with Schérer and nearly left the army. On 18 March 1796 Sérurier's division refused to obey orders.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1918, 75th Division joined General Allenby's final {{offensive}} (the Battles of Megiddo). At the Battle of Sharon (19 September), 75th Division successfully assaulted Miske and the Turkish trench system around the village of Et Tire. For this attack Palin also had under his command 'A' Squadron (Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry) and 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery, Machine Gun Corps, which he sent up with {{his chief of staff}} to outflank the village. By 17.00, XXI Corps' attack had <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> whole Turkish right and allowed the Desert Mounted Corps to sweep forward to complete the envelopment of the Turkish army and begin the pursuit.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} match, Octagón teamed with El Consejo members Semental, El Texano Jr. and Toscano against La Parka and Los Psycho Circus members Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown in a Relevos Australianos eight-man tag team match. In the finish of the match, Octagón {{went for a}} low blow on La Parka, but accidentally caught Semental instead. Parka then <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{surprised}} Octagón for the three count and the win. After the match, El Consejo attacked Octagón, before being chased away by La Parka. La Parka then tried to convince Octagón to leave La Sociedad and re-join him, but Octagón instead just walked out. After La Parka also left the ringside area, El Consejo returned and attacked Los Psycho Circus.|$|E
25|$|In the afternoon, Burnside's corps {{crossed a}} stone bridge over Antietam Creek and <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Confederate right. At a crucial moment, A.P. Hill's {{division}} arrived from Harpers Ferry and counterattacked, driving back Burnside's men and saving Lee's army from destruction. Although outnumbered two to one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent {{in less than}} three-quarters of his army. This enabled Lee to shift brigades and concentrate on each individual Union assault. At over 23,000 casualties, it remains the bloodiest single day in American history. Lee ordered the battered Army of Northern Virginia to withdraw across the Potomac into the Shenandoah Valley. Despite being tactically inconclusive, the battle of Antietam is considered a strategic victory for the Union. Lee's strategic initiative to invade Maryland was defeated. But more importantly, President Lincoln used this opportunity to announce his Emancipation Proclamation, after which the prospect of European powers intervening {{in the war on}} behalf of the Confederacy was significantly diminished.|$|E

25|$|Nordmann {{received}} {{promotion to}} Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 24 May 1809. Archduke Charles appointed him {{to lead the}} army Advance Guard, with 11,837 infantry, 2,528 cavalry, and 26 guns. This mass of troops numbered more than the V or VI Armeekorps. Under his command were four brigades under Friedrich Riese, Joseph Mayer, Peter von Vécsey, and Franz Frelich. At the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, Charles assigned the Advance Guard and the VI Armeekorps to cover the river bank {{while the rest of}} the corps assembled farther inland. This doomed Nordmann's force to rough handling on the 5th when Napoleon's troops in greatly superior strength forced a crossing on the east side of Lobau Island and <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Austrian defenses. Before retreating to the north, the Advance Guard suffered heavy losses, including most of its artillery. Nordmann took position on the Austrian left flank, in rear of Prince Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg's IV Armeekorps. That evening, the Advance Guard was subordinated to Rosenberg. On 6 July, Nordmann was slain in heavy fighting at the village of Markgrafneusiedl. He was one of four Austrian generals killed or mortally wounded at Wagram, the others being Josef Philipp Vukassovich, Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspré, and Peter Vécsey.|$|E

2500|$|The Glasgow Highlanders on {{the left}} flank, were {{relieved}} by the 1/5th Battalion, Welch Regiment of the 53rd Division on 17 July. From 18 July, the 34th Tank Brigade operated in close support of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which eventually extended its line from Bougy to the Orne at Maltot. The 153rd RAC returned to the line after eight days of recuperation. On 21 July, at [...] the battalion was attacked by the [...] Division at le Bon Repos and by [...] one company had been overrun.

2500|$|German {{troops had}} been seen {{arriving}} in lorries behind the German front line and they advanced over Anzac Spur at [...] Smoke-shells in the German barrage obscured British SOS rockets and despite the good visibility only a vague warning was delivered by an aircraft on counter-attack reconnaissance. Other German guns placed a barrage from Stirling Castle to Westhoek {{for the rest of}} the day, which intensified at noon and prevented carrying parties from taking food and ammunition forward. The British artillery did not open fire until [...] by when the 25th Brigade, already enfiladed from the right, had been frontally attacked and forced back to the Hanebeek, suffering many casualties. As the 25th Brigade fell back, the right of the 23rd Brigade was exposed and enveloped by the German counter-attackers. The 23rd Brigade retreated to avoid being <b>rolled</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> British troops became disorganised but managed to hold the ground west of the Hanebeek, a few hundred yards forward of the start-line, with the northernmost battalion further forward where the Hanebeke flowed beneath the Ypres–Roulers railway.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the right}} flank, the 26th and 27th brigades got across two belts of barbed wire, cutting by hand in places but the 10th Argyll were held {{up until the}} left flank company broke through and <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> German defenders. All four battalions crossed two trench lines, except for a short delay {{at the south end}} of Longueval, where the Germans were also rolled up from the flank. The {{infantry}} kept going and the support battalions arrived to consolidate. The Germans in Longueval made a determined defence but by [...] the 9th Scottish Rifles had taken their objectives, except the north end and a strong point in the south-east of the village, which resisted until attacked with support from the 7th Seaforth and the 5th Cameron Highlanders at [...] It proved impossible to capture Waterlot Farm in the second position so positions were taken in Longueval Alley, in touch with the 18th Division.

2500|$|Atkinson {{published}} his journals of {{his involvement in}} the campaign in 1842 in The Expedition into Affghanistan, including a background to the conflict, his own journey across northern India to join the Army and his return, the hardship endured by the Army and its followers through the harsh terrain of Afghanistan beset by Beloochee tribesmen [...] and also of the time he spent in Kabul. He writes {{of the history of the}} land, its buildings and people, having met and painted many of the protagonists in the campaign, including both Shah Shoojah-ool-Moolk and Dost Mohammad Khan. He realised the impossibility of controlling a country like Afghanistan in his line “Like Sisyphus, we have <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> huge stone to the top of the mountain, and if we do not keep it there, our labour will be lost”. The same year Atkinson published Sketches in Afghaunistan, a folio of 25 tinted lithographed plates showing the topography and landscapes of Afghanistan and the Punjab creating an important record of “what was then an unexplored country”. Atkinson had planned a second volume but the 'worked up' paintings were lost at sea en route to his British publisher where they were to be engraved; the original sketches he had prepared on the spot however are in the British Library.|$|E
2500|$|On September 16, McClellan confronted Lee near Sharpsburg. [...] Lee was {{defending}} {{a line to}} the west of Antietam Creek. At dawn on September 17, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's I Corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee's left flank that began the bloody battle. Attacks and counterattacks swept across the Miller Cornfield and the woods near the Dunker Church as Maj. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield's XII Corps joined to reinforce Hooker. Union assaults against the Sunken Road ("Bloody Lane") by Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner's II Corps eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not pressed. In the afternoon, Burnside's IX Corps crossed a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Confederate right. At a crucial moment, A.P. Hill's division arrived from Harpers Ferry and counterattacked, driving back Burnside's men and saving Lee's army from destruction. Although outnumbered two to one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in only four of his six available corps. This enabled Lee to shift brigades across the battlefield and counter each individual Union assault. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualtiesUnion 12,401, or 25%; Confederate 10,316, or 31%Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18, while transporting his wounded men south of the Potomac. McClellan did not renew the offensive. After dark, Lee ordered the battered Army of Northern Virginia to withdraw across the Potomac into the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 May 1940, {{elements}} of German Army Group A, including the German 8th and 28th Infantry Divisions crossed the Belgian-French border, heading east along the frontier, directly for Maubeuge. [...] Just {{to the south}} the German 5th and 7th Panzer Divisions moved on a parallel line, along with the German 12th Infantry Division. The retreating French 1st and 9th Armies fell back to Maubeuge. The 28th ID and the 5th Panzer Division quickly moved against Maubeuge from the south, capturing the city's Vauban citadel on 17–18 May. Fort de Leveau to the northwest of Maubeuge fell on 18 May, a victim of German forces that had moved behind Maubeuge. By the 19th the German formations had <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fortification lines along their path, and had encircled the remaining Maubeuge fortifications. [...] Boussois, the easternmost ouvrage, came under attack on the 18th from the 28th ID and the 5th Panzer Division. As the day wore on, Ouvrage La Salmagne, Ouvrage Bersillies and Ouvrage Les Sarts all came under fire from the rear. Each position resisted fiercely, holding off the attack for several days, despite direct fire by German 8.8cm anti-tank guns that progressively reduced their ability to respond. Boussois and Les Sarts came under attack by Stukas on 20 May. The Héronfontaine casemate came under sustained attack on 21 May, and a German 210mm mortar began firing on Boussois the same day. The bombardments continued, but {{were not able to}} bring about a surrender. Infantry assaults eventually reduced the positions one by one: Boussois at 1100 and La Salmagne at 2030 hours on 22 May, Bersillies at 1015 on 23 May with the nearby casemate Crèvecoeur, and finally Les Sarts at 1100 on 23 May. The garrison of casemate Héronfontaine held out until nightfall, when they were able to slip away.|$|E
