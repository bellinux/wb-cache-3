Persons filling out an online entry form were sent a <b>reservation</b> <b>confirmation</b> via email which stated that no ticket was needed and that IDs would be checked against a list of names. The producers also held invitation-only screenings for religious organizations and government officials, including screenings for legislators to promote anti-evolution Academic Freedom bills.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{a slotted}} {{protocol}} {{can be either}} connectionless or connection-oriented. However, only the latter case represents a true alternative to IEEE 802.11p, by introducing the determinism which {{carrier sense multiple access}} with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) lacks. In vehicle networks the connection set-up phases of a telephone call (<b>reservation</b> request, <b>confirmation,</b> data exchange, tear-down) cannot be applied (it does not hold for broadcast communications, it is hampered by hidden stations, it is not manageable with heavy losses, mobility and varying channel conditions). For these reasons MS-Aloha is connection oriented and continuously refreshes each reservation simply by transmitting each period. MS-Aloha adopts a different approach and subtends the following hypotheses and rules which, basically, define all its main mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|The travel {{industry}} {{is one of}} the few industries where there is an increased interest among consumers for on-line reservations. The purpose of this study is to explore and describe consumers’ attitudes towards travel reservations and purchases on the Internet. A questionnaire was distributed to 400 consumers in Gothenburg. The study indicates that consumers generally have a positive attitude towards travel reservations and purchases on the Internet, although the perceived risks are high. Certain consumers consider the payments insecure. A <b>reservation</b> <b>confirmation</b> is of crucial importance to consumers’ willingness to make their travel reservations on the Internet. eCommerce; consumer behaviour; tourism; travel; consumer research; attitudes...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the critical dominant incidents and key instigators that influence on usage or lack of usage of e-ticketing by Kosovo Air Passengers. The research at hand utilizes the Grounded Theory of Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss, and the Critical Incident Technique in order {{to identify}} the factors that influence on the (diss) satisfaction of the travellers in using e-ticketing. For the purpose of this paper, the empirical data were gathered through interviews by using open ended questions. Among 93 interviews with the random selected passengers, 13 interviews were deemed as invalid. The empirical results highlighted the need for raising the consciousness regarding the efficacy and the advantages of eticketing. On the other hand, many other passengers cannot conceive the possibility of travelling without use of e-ticketing, given that in the past they spent much time in finding the right agent, desired destination, purchase difficulties in making <b>reservation,</b> <b>confirmation,</b> changes, or they had to carry large amounts of cash money to buy tickets which raised insecurity concerns. Research is limited only to the description of critical incidents that occurred in Prishtina International Airport. Majority of the respondents were highly-educated with high income status. These characteristics create a bias and constrain our ability to extrapolate from the findings. Nevertheless, the study serves as a point for more in-depth analysis and discussion on e-ticketing behaviour in Airline industry...|$|E
30|$|The MAC {{protocols}} for {{the resource}} competition are mainly divided into handshake protocol, channel reservation protocol, {{and the corresponding}} improved protocols. The typical handshake MAC protocols include the MACA-MN [5], RIPT [6], and S-FAMA [7] protocol. These protocols can obtain channels via the control packet handshake negotiation, allowing it to effectively alleviate the hiding terminal problem and reduce waste time caused by transmission delay. When data packets conflict, the backoff algorithm is used for backoff or retransmission, {{in order to reduce}} the conflictions of data packets and improve the channel reuse rate. Multiple handshakes of control packets of such protocol would lead to some overhead, which not only reduces network throughput, but also consumes the limited energy of nodes and affects the survival cycle of the whole network. The typical channel reservation MAC protocols mainly include the T-Lohi [8] protocol. The T-Lohi protocol proposes three channel reservation mechanisms, including ST-Lohi, CUT-Lohi, and AUT-Lohi. These three channel reservation mechanisms can better solve time-space uncertainties when nodes use a channel, but some problems exist. For example, the time synchronization is difficult in the communication slot for ST-Lohi. CUT-Lohi shall avoid difficulties in complicated clock synchronization, extend channel competition time, and reduce network throughput based on ST-Lohi. AUT-Lohi combines the strengths of the above two mechanisms and reduces channel competition time. For low-probability, packet tone collision is controlled, and the collision backoff algorithm is used to reduce the data packet collision of channels, reduce the loss rate of AUT-Lohi data packets, and improve the success rate of data packets. However, it cannot effectively solve the hiding terminal problem, which leads to data packet confliction and data retransmission, and waste limited bandwidth and node energy. Based on this, for the severity of time-time uncertainties, Li et al. proposed one underwater MAC protocol (PC-MAC) for presetting receiving and transmission time. This protocol mainly considers the possible position changes of transmission nodes. The receiving nodes predefine the time window of the receiving packets. Furthermore, the transmission nodes calculate the transmission time of packets based on the receiving window, in order to prevent packet conflictions [9]. QianLiangfang et al. [10] proposed the MAC protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks based on the reserved data queue. This protocol sets the channel reservation cycle and <b>reservation</b> <b>confirmation</b> cycle in data transmission and completes channel reservation by using RTS-CTS handshake. Furthermore, this method can reduce the average reservation time of nodes, decrease waiting time in the data transmission of nodes, and effectively improve network throughput [11].|$|E
40|$|The {{phone number}} {{is one of the}} {{supporting}} factors are important in running a business. Besides being used to ask for information, the phone number can also be used as a means of <b>reservation</b> and <b>confirmation.</b> Phone number search is difficult and still use the manual search of some communities, especially in the city of Bogor trouble finding the phone number of a business entity. The number of business entities will also make public the difficulty in storing data either manually or electronically. Therefore, we need a dialer program that can provide the mobile phone number data is structured in one application. Mobile dialer is a mobile application that stores data business phone number in Bogor making it easier for people to directly make a phone call without exiting the application. Mobile dialer is built using the Java programming language and platform Android Studio.

50|$|It {{follows that}} the pope is subject to general councils, in which the bishops are his colleagues (conjudices), not merely his consultors; nor has he the {{exclusive}} right to summon such councils. The decrees of general councils need not be confirmed by the pope nor can they be altered by him; on the other hand, appeal may be made from papal decisions to a general council. As {{for the rights of}} the popes in such matters as appeals, <b>reservations,</b> the <b>confirmation,</b> translation and deposition of bishops, these belong properly to the bishops in provincial synods, and were usurped by the papacy gradually {{as the result of a}} variety of causes, notably of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals. The Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals, also known as the False Decretals, are a set of false documents included in a collection of canon law, some concerning the relations of the political and ecclesiastical powers, composed about the middle of the ninth century by an author who used the pseudonym Isidore Mercator. Louis Saltet, in the Catholic Encyclopedia, wrote that the forgeries bear some of the blame for the distorted view the Middle Ages had of ecclesiastical antiquity and they blurred the whole historical perspective.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{attended}} Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, {{where he}} received a degree in political science. He participated in Model United Nations while in college, even traveling to Moscow, Russia {{to participate in the}} International Model United Nations in 1990. Following his undergraduate work, he attended Florida State University, where he graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1995. He started working for the law firm Johnson, Anselmo, Murdoch, Burke & George, P.A., where he currently works. Many critics argue Smith's employment with Johnson, Anselmo, Murdoch, Burke & George, P.A. has led to conflicts in interest during his career in the State Senate: previously serving as a lobbyist for Florida Power & Light (FP&L), Smith protested the confirmation of two former Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) commissioners while serving as State Senator. Though he claimed his <b>reservation</b> for their <b>confirmation</b> was in an effort to increase diversity, it is arguably suspicious that these two commissioners had just denied FP&L's bid for their largest rate increase in history. In 1995, he was appointed to the Fort Lauderdale Planning and Zoning Board.|$|R
40|$|Not {{many people}} use memory cues. For example, only 50 % of {{consumers}} make shopping lists. If memory cues {{are important for}} memory (as previous research shows), why don’t people use them more often? In the first essay of my dissertation, I found that people don’t use memory cues because they are overconfident about their memory. That is, consumers often incorrectly predict that they will remember to do something, do not take appropriate actions to help them remember (e. g., write a shopping list or stick a Post-It on the fridge or the steering wheel) and end up forgetting {{to do what they}} should be doing (e. g., buy grocery items, pay bills, take the baby out of the car). But do reminders always help task completion? Almost all previous research on prospective memory and implementation intentions finds that reminders help people execute tasks. Very few papers found no effects of reminders on task completion (3 papers). Those three papers examined the effect of reminders in the context of multiple tasks. The second essay of my dissertation shows that, when multiple tasks are involved, reminders sometimes benefit, but sometimes harm task completion. Reminders help people high in propensity to plan to resume an interrupted task in the future and to maintain vigilance for opportunities to complete it. But they harm the execution of other tasks that demand immediate attention. On the contrary, reminders hurt those low on propensity to plan to resume an interrupted task and they decrease the urgency to start working on the task. But they also free up cognitive resources to be used for other tasks that require immediate attention. Companies often send special deals, early bird specials, and other promotions that may work as reminders to buy the product. These reminders may accelerate the purchase of the product among consumers high on propensity to plan. But, it may delay the purchase of the product among consumers low on propensity to plan. Companies also send reminders when they send its customers information about hotel and theater <b>reservation</b> or <b>confirmations,</b> bills to be paid, subscriptions to be renewed, prepaid cell phone credit to be topped up. Consumers use reminders for several tasks including going out for groceries, eating healthy, housekeeping and maintenance, taking medicines, calling for pizza. It is important to understand for whom the reminder helps and for whom it hurts task completion and performance such that companies and policy makers can tailor appropriate interventions for different groups of individuals. For example, propensity to plan is related to income, education and strongly related to the FICO credit scores. Perhaps for those {{at the bottom of the}} income distribution, for those with low education levels and for those with low FICO credit scores, reminders should not be used. Among those individuals, a more effective intervention to get something done might be to ask them to either perform the task immediately or as soon as possible. In that case, procrastination is discouraged and, hence, tasks are more likely to be completed...|$|R
