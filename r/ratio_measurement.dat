40|$|Personality characteristics, {{particularly}} impulsive tendencies, {{have long}} been conceived as the primary culprit in delinquent behavior. One crucial question to emerge from {{this line of work}} is whether impulsivity has a biological basis. To test this possibility, 44 male offenders and 46 nonoffenders completed the Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire, and had their 2 D: 4 D ratio measured. Offenders exhibited smaller right hand digit <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> compared to non-offenders, but higher impulsivity scores. Both impulsivity and 2 D: 4 D <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> significantly predicted criminality (offenders vs. nonoffenders). Controlling for education level, the 2 D: 4 D <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> had remained a significant predictor of criminality, while impulsivity scores no longer predicted criminality significantly. Our data, thus, indicates that impulsivity but not 2 D: 4 D <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> relate to educational attainment. As offenders varied in their number of previous convictions and the nature of their individual crimes, we also tested for differences in 2 D: 4 D ratio and impulsivity among offenders. Number of previous convictions did not correlate significantly with the 2 D: 4 D <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> or impulsivity scores. Our study established a link between a biological marker and impulsivity among offenders (and lack thereof among non-offenders), which emphasise the importance of studying the relationship between biological markers, impulsivity and criminal behavior. © 2012 Hanoch et al...|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 6 th August 2002 The capability to determine isotope abundances is a main feature of mass spectrometry. The precise and accurate determination of isotope ratios is required for different application fields, such as: isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> of stable isotopes in nature, especially for the investigation of isotope variation in nature or age dating; determining isotope ratios of radiogenic elements in the nuclear industry; quality assurance of fuel material for reprocessing plants, nuclear material accounting and radioactive waste control; and tracer experiments using highly enriched stable isotopes or long-lived radionuclides in biological or medical studies. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) provides excellent sensitivity, precision and good accuracy for isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> with practically no restriction {{with respect to the}} ionization potential of the element investigated. Therefore both ICP-MS and LA-ICP-MS are increasingly replacing thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), which has been used as the dominant analytical technique for precise isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> for many decades. In the last few years instrumental progress for improving figures of merit in isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> in ICP-MS and LA-ICP-MS with a single ion detector has been achieved by the introduction of the collision cell interface, in order to dissociate disturbing argon-based molecular ions, to reduce the kinetic energy of ions and neutralize the disturbing argon ions of the plasma gas (Ar 1). The application of the collision cell in ICP-MS results in higher ion transmission, improved sensitivity and better precision of isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> compared to ICP-MS without the collision cell. The most important instrumental improvement for isotope analysis by sector field ICP-MS was the application of a multiple ion collector device (MC-ICP-MS) (developed about 10 years ago) in order to obtain better precision of isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> of up to 0. 002 %, RSD. ...|$|R

40|$|Today, MC-ICPMS {{has become}} a {{powerful}} research tool for the high precision isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> with over five-hundred papers published annually {{in the past several}} years 1 - 2. However, MC-ICPMS suffers approximately tenfold larger bias (up to 25 % for lithium 3) in isotope amount <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> as compared to thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). This bias needs to be properly corrected in order to obtain accurate isotope amount <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements.</b> The choice of the fractionation law to calibrate (correct) measured isotope ratios is crucial in isotope science. Over the last decades, the Russell law mass bias correction model (Eq. 1) 4 which is applicable only for mass-dependent fractionation and assumes identical mass bias for both the calibrator and measurand elements, {{has become a}} standard curriculum in isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements.</b> However, it has been reported that not only mass bias is different for different elements but also that the mass bias is different for different isotope pairs of a same element 5 - 6. Mass-independent fractionation in MC-ICPMS has been observed for elements such as Nd, W and Cd 5 - 7. Ri,j = ri,j(mi/mj) -f (1) Here Ri,j = n(iE) /n(jE), ri,j is the measured (uncorrected) isotope ratio and E is the element of interest, f is the fractionation function and mi,mj are the nuclide masses.

40|$|Testosterone is an {{endogenous}} steroid {{which may}} be abused by athletes for performance enhancement. As testosterone is naturally present in the body, identifying administration requires an ability to demonstrate whether the testosterone present in a sample has an origin outside the normal metabolic processes. Analysis of the stable carbon isotopes of urinary steroids is used to determine whether administration of synthetic testosterone has occurred. The aims of this project were {{to find the best}} approach to measurement uncertainty and decision limit estimation of urinary steroid carbon isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurement</b> results for sports drug testing analysis, and to determine how to minimise these measurement uncertainties. The sample preparation was studied, and the steps with the greatest potential for isotopic fractionation were optimised to minimise the introduction of measurement bias during sample preparation. A new approach for the calculation of carbon isotope ratios from Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer measurements was developed. The measurement uncertainty estimation was greatly simplified when using this calculation approach, compared to the more commonly used iterative calculation approaches. The optimised method was found to be rugged, accurate, and suitable for the measurement of carbon isotope ratios of urinary steroids for the detection of testosterone administration. The traceability of the measurements to the carbon isotope ratio embodied in the internationally recognised standard for carbon isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurement</b> results was established. When using the new calculation approach, the expanded uncertainties of the carbon isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurement</b> results at the 95 % level of confidence were between 1. 6 and 4. 0 . For a commonly used iterative calculation approach, the expanded uncertainties of the carbon isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurement</b> results at the 95 % level of confidence were between 2. 0 and 3. 9 . The estimation of the measurement uncertainty when using the iterative calculation approach was difficult, due to the complexity of the measurement function and the calculation of the sensitivity coefficients. By finding simple relationships between the measurement function input factors and the calculated sensitivity coefficients, approximations of these sensitivity coefficients were developed. These approximations gave very similar combined measurement uncertainty estimations compared to estimations made using calculated sensitivity coefficients...|$|E

Due to its high sensitivity, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is today a challenging mass spectrometric technique for the direct determination of precise and accurate isotope ratios in solid samples. In comparison to laser ablation quadrupole ICP-MS (LA-ICP-QMS), laser ablation coupled to a double-focusing sector field ICP-MS (LA-ICP-SFMS) with single ion detection offers a significant improvement of sensitivity at low mass resolution, whereby isotope ratios can be measured with a precision to 0. 1 % relative standard deviation (R.

In LA-ICP-SFMS, many disturbing isobaric interferences of analyte and molecular ions can be separated at the required mass resolution (e. g., (ArO+) -Ar- 40 -O- 16 and Fe- 56 (+) for iron isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements).</b> The precision on isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>measurements</b> was improved by one order of magnitude via the simultaneous detection of mass-separated ion currents of isotopes using multiple ion collectors in LA-ICP-MS (LA-MC-ICP-MS).
