40|$|Several {{researchers}} have shown how sisal fibres possess remarkable tensile properties that yield them good candidates as reinforcement in biocomposite materials. This work aims {{to evaluate the}} effect of an eco-friendly and cost effective surface treatment method based {{on the use of}} commercial sodium bicarbonate (i. e. baking soda) on properties of sisal fibre and its epoxy composites. In particular, <b>raw</b> <b>sisal</b> fibres were treated with a 10 %w/w of sodium bicarbonate solution for different periods (24, 120 and 240 h), at room temperature. Changes occurring in sisal fibres were characterized through scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and helium pycnometer analysis. The mechanical characterization of sisal fibre was carried out through single fibre tensile tests and a reliability analysis of the experimental data was performed. A mathematical model was also applied to investigate the relation between the transverse dimension of the fibres and their tensile properties. Interfacial adhesion of sisal fibre with an epoxy matrix was investigated using single fibre pull out technique. Moreover, to deeper investigate the effect of the proposed treatment, epoxy based composites reinforced with short randomly oriented sisal fibres were manufactured and characterized by means of quasi-static flexural tests. The experimental results showed that 120 h is the optimum time for treating sisal fibre to achieve highest interfacial adhesion and mechanical properties with epoxy matrix...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Agave sisalana (sisal) {{is known}} {{worldwide}} {{as a source}} of hard fibers, and Brazil is the largest producer of sisal. Nonetheless, the process of removing the fibers of the sisal leaf generates 95 % waste. In this study, we applied chemical sequential steps (hydrothermal extraction, precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, crystallization, SiO 2 and Sephadex LH 20 column chromatography) to obtain pectin, mannitol, succinic acid, kaempferol and a mixture of saponins as <b>raw</b> chemicals from <b>sisal</b> biomass. The structural identification of these compounds was performed though spectrometric methods, such as Infrared (IR), Ultraviolet (UV), Mass spectrometry (MS) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). All the sisal chemicals found in this work are used by both the chemical and pharmaceutical industries as excipients or active principles in products...|$|R
40|$|Neste trabalho, os efeitos de diferentes condições de tempo e temperatura usados para a preparação de {{whiskers}} de sisal foram investigados com o objetivo de se determinar a influência destes parâmetros experimentais na morfologia, cristalinidade e estabilidade térmica dos materiais preparados. A obtenção dos whiskers deu-se após o pré-branqueamento da fibra de sisal com solução alcalina de peróxido de hidrogênio. A fibra branqueada foi submetida ao processo de hidrólise com solução de ácido sulfúrico 60 % (m/m) sob três diferentes condições de temperatura e tempos de extração: 45 °C e 60 minutos (WS 45 _ 60); 45 °C e 75 minutos (WS 45 _ 75) e 60 °C e 30 minutos (WS 60 _ 30). Os whiskers foram caracterizados quanto à morfologia por microscopia eletrônica de transmissão (MET), quanto à cristalinidade (DRX), carga superficial (potencial zeta), teor de enxofre (análise elementar) e quanto à estabilidade térmica por termogravimetria (TGA). Os resultados mostraram que os whiskers de sisal apresentaram comprimento e diâmetro médios e 210 nm e 5 nm respectivamente. Devido à alta aglomeração dos whiskers, diferenças relativas às características dimensionais não puderam ser determinadas. Os resultados obtidos revelaram uma forte dependência da cristalinidade final dos whiskers com a temperatura e tempo de extração. O uso de temperatura mais alta (60 °C) associado a um menor tempo de extração (30 minutos) resulta em whiskers com boa estabilidade térmica (235 °C), maior cristalinidade e sem o comprometimento da estrutura cristalina da celulose. In this work, {{the effects}} of different conditions of time and temperature, used for the preparation of whiskers from sisal, were investigated to {{determine the influence of}} experimental parameters on morphology, crystallinity and thermal stability of materials prepared. The whiskers were obtained after the bleaching of <b>sisal</b> <b>raw</b> fiber with a solution of hydrogen peroxide alkaline. The bleached fiber was submitted to the process of hydrolysis with sulphuric acid solution 60 wt. (%) under three different conditions of temperature and time of extraction: 45 °C and 60 minutes (WS 45 _ 60); 45 °C and 75 minutes (WS 45 _ 75) and 60 °C and 30 minutes (WS 60 _ 30). The whiskers were characterized as the morphology by transmission electron microscopy (MET), crystallinity (DRX), surface charge (zeta potential), sulfur content (by elemental analysis) and thermal stability by thermogravimetry (TGA). The sisal whiskers presented an average length and diameter of 210 nm and 5 nm, respectively. Due to the high agglomeration state of whiskers, differences on dimensional features could not be determined. The results showed a strong dependence on crystallinity of whiskers with temperature and time of extraction. Hydrolysis in higher temperature (60 °C) and lower extraction time (30 minutes) resulted in whiskers with good thermal stability (235 °C), higher crystallinity and preserving the crystalline structure of cellulose...|$|R
