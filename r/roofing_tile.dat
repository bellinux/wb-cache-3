40|$|Utilization {{of waste}} matter in {{building}} construction {{is becoming more}} popular in the world mostly because it not only gives alternative for construction material but also gives a solution for waste management while reducing environmental pollution. Among many waste materials, Rice Husk Ash (RHA), a waste from clay products manufacturing process has no proper usage in many countries including in Sri Lanka. Objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of waste RHA collected from a brick kiln on structural and thermal properties of clay <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> <b>Roof</b> <b>tile</b> specimens with different RHA percentages (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %) were manufactured in industrial scale. Structural properties of clay <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> such as transverse breaking load, bulk density and water absorption were determined. In addition, thermal behaviour of <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> was examined. Furthermore, the physical and chemical properties of RHA and clay were also determined in order to find the reasons for characteristic behaviour of RHA added clay <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> For 10 % RHA replacement, transverse breaking load can be increased by 47. 24 %. Bulk density is reduced with the percentage of RHA added, which is a favourable property for <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> as a <b>roofing</b> material. RHA increases water absorption property. However, addition of RHA up to 15 % is acceptable, as it satisfies the limits specified in standards. Heat transmitted through the <b>roof</b> clay <b>tile</b> is reduced with increasing RHA percentage. Hence, cooler environment can be built under RHA added <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> than under conventional <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> It was found that the brick kiln RHA contains high amount of SiO 2 content of 84. 14 % and that may be the most probable reason for the strength gain property of RHA added <b>roof</b> <b>tiles...</b>|$|R

Mechanical properties of the material, i. e. the tensile strength and the elastic modulus, were obtained from the tensile test. Evaluation of the SMC <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> as a <b>roof</b> structure was carried out by static loads testing of the roof structure model. The tensile test according to ASTM D 638 : 2003 shows that the tensile strength and the elastic modulus of the SMC material are 30 ± 3 MPa and 10 ± 1 GPa, respectively.
