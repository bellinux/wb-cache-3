25|$|Vanilla {{convertible}} bonds {{are the most}} plain convertible structures. They grant the holder the right to convert into {{a certain number of}} shares determined according to a conversion price determined in advance. They may offer coupon regular payments during the life of the security and have a fixed maturity date where the nominal value of the bond is redeemable by the holder. This type is the most common convertible type and is typically providing the asymmetric returns profile and positive convexity often wrongly associated to the entire asset class: at maturity the holder would indeed either convert into shares or request the <b>redemption</b> <b>at</b> <b>par</b> depending on whether or not the stock price is above the conversion price.|$|E
