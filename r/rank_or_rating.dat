This paper is intended to help design efficient and rigorous quality assessment experiments and emphasise the key aspects of the results analysis. To promote good standards of data analysis, we review the major methods for data analysis, such as establishing confidence intervals, statistical testing and retrospective power analysis. Two methods of visualising ranking results together with the meaningful information about the statistical and practical significance are explored. Finally, we compare four most prominent subjective quality assessment methods: single-stimulus, double-stimulus, forced-choice pairwise comparison and similarity judgements. We conclude that the forced-choice pairwise comparison method results in the smallest measurement variance and thus produces the most accurate results. This method is also the most time-efficient, assuming a moderate number of compared conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The Act makes {{armed forces}} {{personnel}} {{to be subject}} to same drug and alcohol testing regime as is set out in the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, without specifically removing the military's exemption from that Act.Section 9 amends section 20 of the AFA 2006, by making the test of 'unfitness for duty' have the meaning of the person's 'ability to carry out the duty in question is impaired.'. Section 10 creates an entirely new offence; a person would be guilty of this offence if a sample of their breath, blood or urine contained alcohol above a specified level, and when that person was, or might reasonably be expected, performing a 'prescribed duty'. The prescribed duties themselves would be defined by the Defence Council, and are intended to cover safety-critical tasks, where unfitness of a person performing them could result in 'death, serious injury to any person or property, or serious environmental harm'. Section 11 sets out the testing arrangements for a person suspected of an offence created under section 10.Section 12 makes amendments to reflect the introduction of the rank of lance corporal in the RAF Regiment. [...] Under AFA 2006 (section 132) a commanding officer can only impose service detention as a punishment on the lowest rank of non-commissioned officer (NCO). Until recently, the RAF's lowest NCO rank was corporal, and therefore the creation of the new NCO rank of lance-corporal created an anomaly, whereby the commander of RAF personnel would have had the power to detail corporals, but not the (lower) rank of lance-corporal, since at the point where AFA 2006 became law, the RAF did not have any lance-corporals. Section 12 was aimed at resolving this situation by legally redefining the lowest NCO rank in the RAF Regiment as a lance-corporal.Section 13 repeals section 293 of AFA 2006, so that when a NCO is given detention as part of a disciplinary process, he or she need not automatically be reduced to the lowest possible rank. This section also amends section 138 of AFA 2006, to allow a local commanding officer to combine reduction in rank with a custodial sentence. This section is not retrospective, and therefore does not affect any reductions in rank that occurred before the repeal of section 293 of AFA 2006.Section 19 deals with powers of local COs to reduce the <b>rank</b> <b>or</b> <b>rate</b> of an offender as a result of [...] "administrative action", rather than through Service courts. In this context, [...] "administrative action" [...] is the system of measures to deal with to deal with failures of performance where the bringing of a charge for a disciplinary offence under AFA 2006 is inappropriate; these powers {{are similar to those of}} a civilian employer. The original Section 332 of AFA 2006 restricted reduction in <b>rank</b> <b>or</b> <b>rate</b> by a local CO to only one acting <b>or</b> substantive <b>rank.</b> Section 19 of AFA 2011 amends section 332, so as to allow a CO to reduce a warrant officer or NCO by more than one <b>rank</b> <b>or</b> <b>rate,</b> where this is deemed appropriate.Section 20 amends section 335 of the AFA 2006, requiring that the Defence Council must determine the size of a Service Complaint Panel, subject to the requirements of section 336(2) and section 336(2). It also amends section 336 of the AFA 2006 so as to remove the requirement for at least one member of the Panel to be a senior officer, and for the Panel to include a specified number of independent members, and that certain functions will be carried out by those members. (Although those functions may be delegated.) [...] Section 7 of this section also provides for the Secretary of State to require the Defence Council to delegate its functions in relation to 'any service complaint of a prescribed description', where a majority of the panel are independent, or they require certain functions to be carried out by independent members.|$|R
40|$|Explicit {{assessment}} of the market opportunities and target groups in the market comes late in the product development process, usually when most decisions about the product have already been made (Veryzer, 1998). This is unfortunate, since many {{studies have shown that}} an early customer focus is important for creating a financially successful product with a clear competitive advantage (Cooper & Kleinschmidt, 1986; Langerak, Hultink & Robben, 2004). At the start of the product development process, costs are low and changes are easier to make than in the end. Therefore proper screening of product ideas is necessary. Companies, however, lack proper research methods for idea screening and evaluation when such ideas are highly innovative (O'Connor & Veryzer, 2001; Ulwick, 2002). During idea screening, innovation can be frustrated by traditional market research methods that rely on asking potential customers what they want, or asking them to <b>rank</b> <b>or</b> <b>rate</b> the attractiveness of various predetermined product options (Churchill, 1991; Johnson, 1998). For ideas of really new products, Hoeffler (2003), has shown that consumers are less certain about the benefits of the product, the manufacturer’s ability to overcome the drawbacks and the social implications of usage. Table 1 shows that these uncertainties also coincide with a lower purchase intention. This result means that the development o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a portfolio optimization approach to information technology (IT) security investment decisions in an organization.

30|$|Preference {{valuation}} {{studies are}} another technique to analyse the potential demand for environmental {{goods or services}} which are usually not traded within the market mechanism. Consumer preferences are usually inferred by stated or revealed preference techniques. The stated preference (SP) technique is a survey-based technique that allows researchers to uncover how people value different product/service attributes. The most common SP techniques used in transport studies are the choice modeling (CM) method and the contingent valuation method (CV). CM originates from conjoint analysis, information integration theory in psychology [6] and discrete choice theory in economics/econometrics [58, 59]. It applies a choice experiment approach {{using a variety of}} instruments (e.g., pencil and paper, computer aided personal survey instrument (CAPI), internet-based survey) to indirectly elicit attribute values based on either <b>ranking</b> <b>or</b> <b>rating</b> of products described by a number of attributes in several labelled or unlabelled choice sets [18, 41, 47]. Subsequently, via statistical techniques, the analysis will derive a value for each of these attributes and thus express the relative preferences among vehicle attributes [29, 79]. Conventional discrete choice (DC) models analyse situations in which respondents are asked to choose one alternative from a set of mutually exclusive hypothetical alternatives [17, 50]. Recently, multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) models have been introduced that deal with the existence of multiple-vehicle households, where households own and use multiple vehicles for satisfying their travel needs [16, 17]. Other recent progresses in CM aim to improve realism, by for instance adding a no-choice option [31], or by customising attribute levels based on respondent’s current vehicle choices [10, 31, 62].|$|R
40|$|Shortages of {{suitably}} qualified {{health professionals}} {{prepared to work}} in the NHS are not a new phenomenon. However, there are increasingly widespread claims that the NHS faces the prospect of unprecedented shortages over the next decade. Causal vectors present as multiple, having variously been attributed to changes in training bursaries e. g. nurses; rises in job-demands; budgetary cuts; changes to contractual arrangements, e. g. junior doctors; uncertainty over Brexit implications; and more. Prim face implications relate to training, recruitment and retention. This paper is focused on issues of relevance to staff retention. As a component of our Medical Research Council funded Research ‘Extending Working Lives in the NHS: Opportunities, Challenges and Prospects’, an opportunity sample of NHS employees (N= 1605) completed a paired comparisons exercise on variables identified as representing headline ‘push’ influences in employee early exit. The ratio scale produced by the method of paired comparisons affords a number of advantages over alternatives, e. g. direct <b>ranking</b> <b>or</b> <b>rating</b> scales. Specially, it provided a means of demonstrating the relative distance (importance/salience) between the variables being ranked. It also permitted formal testing of the degree of concordance (shared view) for the sample as a whole and, critically from the perspective of segmented intervention, the degree to which different employee demographics (by profession/role/grade) can be considered to share discrete ‘push’ profiles. Findings indicate the primacy of variables relating to extrinsic components of job demands. The implications of our findings from the perspective of intervention to increase rates of NHS staff retention are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Decision {{making is}} {{necessary}} to provide a synthesis scheme to design activities and identify the most preferred design alternative. There exist several methods that address modeling designer preferences in a graphical manner to aid the decision making process. For instance, the Conjoint Analysis has been proven effective for various multi-attribute design problems by utilizing a ranking- or rating-based approach along with the graphical representation of the designer preference. However, the <b>ranking</b> <b>or</b> <b>rating</b> of design alternatives can be inconsistent from different users and {{it is often difficult}} to get customer responses in a timely fashion. The high number of alternative comparisons required for complex engineering problems can be exhausting for the decision maker. In addition, many design objectives can have interdependencies that can increase complexity and uncertainty throughout the decision making process. The uncertainties apparent in the attainment of subjective data as well as with system models can reduce the reliability of decision analysis results. To address these issues, the use of a new technique, the Improved Conjoint Analysis, is proposed to enable the modeling of designer preferences and trade-offs under the consideration of uncertainty. Specifically, a simulation-based ranking scheme is implemented and incorporated into the traditional process of the Conjoint Analysis. The proposed ranking scheme can reduce user fatigue and provide a better schematic decision support process. In addition, the incorporation of uncertainty in the design process provides the capability of producing robust or reliable products. The efficacy and applicability of the proposed framework are demonstrated with the design of a cantilever beam, a power-generating shock absorber, and a mesostructured hydrogen storage tank. M. S.

40|$|Audit {{quality has}} gained {{intensive}} attention since the cascade of audit {{failures in the}} concluding years {{of the last century}} and {{the first few years of}} our new century. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 [hereafter identified as the Act] introduced a new oversight strategy to enhance the quality of audits. To assure the performance of quality audits, the PCAOB was charged with responsibility for inspecting registered public accounting firms that perform financial audits for publicly-owned companies in the United States. To date, however, this process has not resulted in measurement of audit quality. Since 2002, there have been two additional significant initiatives related to audit quality. One was the Federal Government’s Single Audit Sampling Project which was reported in 2007; the other, the establishment of the Center for Audit Quality, as an affiliate of the American Institute of CPA (AICPA) in early 2007. From a reading of these three initiatives, it was evident that while each makes a contribution none is sufficient to determine audit quality of publicly owned entities. This paper includes a review of these initiatives, as well as a general structure for undertaking an objective statistical study to measure audit quality. The task is feasible, but will require several years of well designed efforts. The development of criteria and of their measurement is not a one-step research effort. Several years of experience of data gathering and careful statistical testing are necessary. Over time, criteria identified must be tested for reliability and validity. The initial years of efforts at objective measurement should be considered experimental; such efforts will not result in <b>ranking</b> <b>or</b> <b>rating</b> particular accounting firms.

Three main landscape components were considered for this analysis: the type of vegetation layer, the density of rural building and the level of incline. Several levels were also considered for each component: abandoned fields, dry farming, irrigation farming and virgin lands were included for the vegetation layer; and three levels (low, intermediate and intense) were considered for the level of incline and rural building. Finally, conclusions were drawn concerning both the preferences for landscapes and the comparative analysis of the results when using either the <b>ranking</b> <b>or</b> scale <b>rating</b> approach.
