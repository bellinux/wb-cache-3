40|$|When 2 {{targets are}} {{presented}} among distractors in rapid serial visual presentation, correct {{identification of the}} 1 st target results in a deficit for a 2 nd target appearing within 200 - 500 ms. This attentional blink (AB; J. E. Raymond, K. L. Shapiro, & K. M. Arnell, 1992) was examined for categorically defined targets (letters among nonletters) in 7 experiments. AB was obtained for the 2 nd letter target among digit distractors (Experiment 1) and also for a 3 <b>rd</b> <b>target</b> (Experiment 2). Results of Experiments 3 - 5 confirmed that AB is triggered by local interference from immediate posttarget stimulation (Raymond et al., 1992) and showed that AB is modulated by the discriminability between the 1 st target and the immediately following distractor. Experiments 5 - 7 further {{examined the effects of}} both local interference and global discriminability. A 2 -stage model is proposed to account for the AB results. Researchers working on visual attention have focused on. capacity limitations that arise when multiple stimuli must be processed in a single spatial array. Different issues arise when stimuli are presented sequentially. In this study, we examined attentional limitations for processing a tempora...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{low-power}} <b>RD</b> modulator <b>targets</b> the DVB-H {{requirements and}} achieves about 10 bit with 6 -MHz signal band. Suitable topological modifications enable {{the realization of}} a third order modulator with two op-amps. Moreover, a technique for swing reduction of the last op-amp strongly reduces the number of comparators in the quantizer. The power reduction techniques limit the consumption to 6. 18 mW, thus yielding a FoM of 0. 58 pJ/ conversion. The area of the circuit, fabricated with a 0. 18 -lm analog CMOS technology, is 0. 32 mm 2. Experi-mental measurements confirm the behavioral study made accounting for the op-amps limitations...|$|R
40|$|A {{scalable}} video bitstream {{specifically designed}} {{for the needs of}} various client terminals, network conditions, and user demands is much desired in current and future video transmission and storage systems. The scalable extension of the H. 264 /AVC standard (SVC) has been developed to satisfy the new challenges posed by heterogeneous environments, as it permits a single video stream to be decoded fully or partially with variable quality, resolution, and frame rate in order to adapt to a specific application. This thesis presents novel improved algorithms for SVC, including: 1) a fast inter-frame and inter-layer coding mode selection algorithm based on motion activity; 2) a hierarchical fast mode selection algorithm; 3) a two-part Rate Distortion (<b>RD)</b> model <b>targeting</b> the properties of different prediction modes for the SVC rate control scheme; and 4) an optimised Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) prediction model. The proposed fast inter-frame and inter-layer mode selection algorithm is based on the empirical observation that a macroblock (MB) with slow movement {{is more likely to be}} best matched by one in the same resolution layer. However, for a macroblock with fast movement, motion estimation between layers is required. Simulation results show that the algorithm can reduce the encoding time by up to 40...|$|R
40|$|In Ethiopia, {{little has}} been done to assess how Mycobacterium bovis has contributed to human tuberculosis, though the {{population}} routinely consumes unpasteurized milk and raw meat. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the proportion of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis as etiological agents of tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLN). Patients with lymphadenopathy (n = 171) were included in a cross-sectional study at Butajira Hospital, Southern Ethiopia. Lymph node biopsies were cultured. Patients' HIV status was identified. DNA from positive cultures was tested by PCR to identify M. bovis and M. tuberculosis. Isolates were genotyped by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. Among 171 patients, 156 had culture results. Of these, 107 (69 %) were positive for M. tuberculosis complex (MTC). Six of the 10 HIV-positive patients were culture positive. M. tuberculosis specific sequences were identified in the DNA of each of 100 samples as assessed by <b>RD</b> 10 <b>targeted</b> PCR, and each of the 95 isolates exhibited the M. tuberculosis specific TbD 1 deletion by MLPA analysis. No M. bovis was identified. These results indicate that all the isolates were modern M. tuberculosis strains. Furthermore, MLPA studies confirmed that 42 % of the isolates showed the Haarlem genotype and 12 % displayed sequences compatible with INH resistance. No mutations conferring resistance to ethambutol or rifampicin were detected. Our data showed that M. tuberculosis strains had common characteristics with strains causing pulmonary TB, which appears to be the main etiological agent of TBL...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{in humans}} {{is caused by}} members of the Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTC). Rapid detection of the MTC is necessary for the timely initiation of antibiotic treatment, while differentiation between members of the complex may be important to guide the appropriate antibiotic treatment and provide epidemiological information. In this study, a multiplex real-time PCR diagnostics assay using novel molecular targets was designed to identify the MTC while simultaneously differentiating between M. tuberculosis and M. canettii. The lepA gene was targeted for the detection of members of the MTC, the wbbl 1 gene was used for the differentiation of M. tuberculosis and M. canettii from the remainder of the complex, and a unique region of the M. canettii genome, a possible novel region of difference (<b>RD),</b> was <b>targeted</b> for the specific identification of M. canettii. The multiplex real-time PCR assay was tested using 125 bacterial strains (64 MTC isolates, 44 nontuberculosis mycobacteria [NTM], and 17 other bacteria). The assay was determined to be 100 % specific for the mycobacteria tested. Limits of detection of 2. 2, 2. 17, and 0. 73 cell equivalents were determined for M. tuberculosis/M. canettii, the MTC, and M. canettii, respectively, using probit regression analysis. Further validation of this diagnostics assay, using clinical samples, should demonstrate its potential for the rapid, accurate, and sensitive diagnosis of TB caused by M. tuberculosis, M. canettii, and {{the other members of the}} MTC...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} growth of {{epitaxial}} Co metal thin film on c-plane sapphire by pulsed laser deposition (<b>RD)</b> using Co:ZnO <b>target</b> utilizing the composition inhomogeneity of the corresponding plasma. Two distinct plasma composition regions have been observed using heavily alloyed Co 0. 6 Zn 0. 4 O target. The central and intense region of the plasma grows Co:ZnO film; the extreme tail grows only Co metal with no trace of either ZnO or Co oxide In between the two extremes, mixed phases (Co +Co-oxides +Co:ZnO) were observed. The Co metal thin film grown in this way shows room temperature ferromagnetism with large in plane magnetization similar to 1288 emu cm(- 3) and a coerciviLy of similar to 230 Oe with applied field parallel to the film-substrate interface. Carrier density {{of the film is}} similar to 10 (22) cm(- 3). The film is epiLaxial single phase Co metal which is confirmed by both X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characierizaLions. Planar Hall Effect (PHE) and Magneto Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements confirm that the film possesses similar attributes of Co metal.

40|$|This ex ante impact {{assessment}} measures the potential {{economic impact of}} and returns to investment in a proposed collaborative ILRI-ICRISAT-NARS (International Livestock Research Institute-International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics-national agricultural research systems) project on genetic improvement of dual-purpose (i. e. grain and fodder) sorghum and pearl millet in India. The approach taken links three methodologies to measure how much impact, where, and how to value it. A feed simulation model is {{used to measure the}} potential productivity gains from more, higher-quality crop residues in terms of meat and milk output. Primary survey data and geographic information systems (GIS) analyses of secondary data are used to assess where these gains are likely to be made. An economic surplus model that links the results of the GIS analysis with the output from the feed model is used to value the potential benefits versus the costs of the research. One hundred and four Districts of India were identified (using GIS) as the recommendation domain (<b>RD)</b> or zone <b>targeted</b> for likely adoption of improved dual-purpose genotypes. Breeders and animal nutritionists estimate that this research could potentially lead to increases in digestibility of sorghum and millet-residues ranging from 1 % to 15 %. The estimated returns to this research are attractive, even when the scope of the benefits is limited to milk and meat production in buffalo and cattle in India...|$|R
40|$|Conference Theme: MultilingualismOral Session: 9. 02 aThis corpus-based study investigates whether cross-linguistic {{influence}} {{occurs in}} the domain of English right-dislocation (RD) in 6 Cantonese-English bilingual children (Yip & Matthews, 2007). RD constructions in Cantonese and English meet the two conditions for cross-linguistic influence proposed by Hulk and MÃ¼ller (2000) : (1) RD is a phenomenon at the interface of syntax and pragmatics, used for topic marking and focusing (Yip, 2013), and (2) <b>RDs</b> in the <b>target</b> languages show partial structural overlap at the surface level. The results show that there is evidence of cross-linguistic influence in this domain. Quantitatively, Cantonese-dominant bilingual children produced a significantly higher percentage of RD than English monolingual children. Qualitatively, some RD structures produced by bilingual children as in (1) cannot be found in monolingual children. 1. So green, this one. (Alicia 2; 10; 15) We argue that some aspects of the results cannot be adequately accounted for without looking at language dominance and properties of parental input. While Notley et al. (2007) claim that there is no overlap in RDs in their study due to the absence of English RD in their sample of input addressed to the child, our data show that RD is indeed present in the input, and even low input frequency of RDs can create overlap in the dual input. The findings have implications for structural overlap as a factor in cross-linguistic influence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Comparative genomic {{analysis}} of M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv and M. bovis BCG {{have shown that}} 16 RDs (Regions of Differences) are deleted in BCG and have shown six deletion regions in M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv. RD 1, is present in M. tuberculosis but is absent in all M. bovis BCG sub-strains. A study from Kerala, a south-western coastal state of India aimed to find out differences in RD 1 region showed {{for the first time}} the presence of moaA 3 gene in majority of their clinical isolates, that was absent in type strain H 37 Rv. We attempted to find out such polymorphism between type strains and the clinical isolates within <b>RD</b> 1, <b>targeting</b> moaA 3 gene among the clinical isolates of Tamil Nadu & Pondicherry, south-eastern coastal states of India Methods One hundred and sixteen clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis were included in the study. PCR using RD 1 DLa and RD 1 DRa primers was carried out to amplify a 652 bp fragment, encoding for cfp 10 and esat 6 proteins of RD 1. A second PCR using primers designed from the surrounding regions of moa A 3 gene was done to confirm the presence of the full Open Reading Frame (ORF) in clinical isolates. Results In M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv the expected 652 bp band was present. In BCG it was absent as expected, but a 386 bp fragment was amplified. Around 12 / 116 (10. 3 %) of our clinical isolates showed both 652 and 386 bp fragments. The additional 386 bp amplicon is a part of the moaA 3 gene which codes for molybdopterin cofactor protein A in M. bovis. The second PCR amplified the flanking sequence of moaA 3 and yielded the expected amplicon of 1254 bp in all those 10. 3 % of clinical isolates which had the 386 bp fragment. However the earlier study carried out in Kerala, reported the presence of moaA 3 gene in majority (97 %) of their clinical isolates. Conclusion This finding showed that there was regional variation presenting polymorphism in moA 3 gene, among the strains of M. tuberculosis and further strengthens the speculation of genetic differences among the strains of Kerala and Tamil Nadu & Pondicherry, the South Indian states</p...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) is a causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals. The burden of tuberculosis in South Africa is worsened by the concurrent epidemic of HIV. The dynamic of TB epidemics {{has been investigated}} and yet little data has been given about the Eastern Cape, particularly Port Elizabeth. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of drug resistant MTBC and to determine the mutations causing resistance in Port Elizabeth. One hundred and ninety (190) DNA samples isolated from sputum specimen in humans suspected of having TB were amplified using the SeeplexÂ® MTB Nested ACE detection assay. To differentiate Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) members for surveillance purposes a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was done based on genomic regions of differences such as RD 1, RD 1 mic, RD 2 seal, RD 4, RD 9 and <b>RD</b> 12. <b>Target</b> genes known to confer resistance to first and second-line drugs were amplified and the amplicons sequenced using Big Dye Terminator DNA sequencing kit v 3. 1 (Applied Biosystems, UK). The patientâs demographic profiles {{were obtained from the}} National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS). All hundred and ninety DNA samples tested positive for MTBC using the SeeplexÂ® MTB Nested ACE assay. Results show a high prevalence of extensive drug resistant TB in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape Province. One hundred and eighty four (184) DNA isolates were used in the identification of different MTBC species. We ended up working with 184 DNA isolates because we ran out of DNA, and we could not go back to isolate DNA from the affected individuals {{due to the fact that}} some patients died, while some have been released to go to their homes. From the 184 DNA isolates 45 (24. 5 %) isolates were identified to be M. tuberculosis, 94 isolates (51. 1 %) to be M. bovis BCG and 3 isolates (1. 6 %) to be M. cannetti. Sequencing results show the position of mutation in each DNA isolate; however in the study we got resistance to MDR to be 100 % and 42 % pre-XDR while 58 % was XDR. These results raise an alarm for the prevalence MDR in MTBC from Port Elizabeth. This is a serious health concern which calls for a need to strategise on the identification of extensive drug resistant TB patients from multi-drug resistant TB patients and ensure monitoring of their treatment...|$|R

In fact, even if the Countries, till the last financial and economic crisis, showed a clear path of convergence (EC, 2008; EC, 2009) with EU average levels of development thanks to a sustained growth in GDP, {{at the same time}} they had to face a notable increase in regional inequality (Brasili, 2005), mainly driven by the persisting backwardness of agricultural and rural areas. The European pre-accession funds had limited effect in preventing the spread in internal divergence because of the lack of ex ante and in itinere monitoring and evaluation (Monasterolo, 2008). Moreover, they failed in addressing specific problems and needs of so variegated areas due to the deficiencies in identifying and defining the characteristics of rural areas (CsÃ¡ki, 2009). This paper will introduce a new map of Serbia, a current EU pre-accession Country, where a clear identification of rural areas is still lacking (Bogdanov, 2007). We identified the dynamic characteristics of urban and rural areas as well as their strengths and weaknesses, computing a principal components analysis on a group of 37 socio-economic, agricultural and structural variables, which are available periodically at a municipality level. Then, we delineated homogeneous regions through the cluster analysis.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to demonstrate the stable operation of a windowless liquid lithium target under extreme thermal loads that are equivalent to uranium beams from the proposed Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) driver linac. The engineering and safety issues accompanying liquid lithium systems are first discussed. The liquid metal technology knowledge base generated primarily for fast reactors, and liquid metal cooled fusion reactors, {{was applied to the}} development of these systems in a nuclear physics laboratory setting. The use of a high energy electron beam for simulating a high power uranium beam produced by the RIA driver linac is also described. Calculations were performed to obtain energy deposition profiles produced by electron beams at up to a few MeV to compare with expected uranium beam energy deposition profiles. It was concluded that an experimental simulation using a 1 -MeV electron beam would be a valuable tool to assess beam-jet interaction. In the experiments, the cross section of the windowless liquid lithium target was 5 mm x 10 mm, which is a 1 / 3 <b>rd</b> scale prototype <b>target,</b> and the velocity of the liquid lithium was varied up to 6 m/s. Thermal loads up to 20 kW within a beam spot diameter of 1 mm were applied on the windowless liquid lithium target by the 1 -MeV electron beam. The calculations showed that the maximum power density and total power deposited within the target, from the electron beam, was equivalent to that of a 200 -kW, 400 -MeV/u uranium beam.
