50|$|A <b>radial</b> <b>turbine</b> is a turbine {{in which}} {{the flow of the}} working fluid is radial to the shaft. The {{difference}} between axial and radial turbines consists in the way the fluid flows through the components (compressor and turbine). Whereas for an axial turbine the rotor is 'impacted' by the fluid flow, for a <b>radial</b> <b>turbine,</b> the flow is smoothly orientated perpendicular to the rotation axis, and it drives the turbine in the same way water drives a watermill. The result is less mechanical stress (and less thermal stress, in case of hot working fluids) which enables a <b>radial</b> <b>turbine</b> to be simpler, more robust, and more efficient (in a similar power range) when compared to axial turbines. When it comes to high power ranges (above 5 MW) the <b>radial</b> <b>turbine</b> is no longer competitive (due to heavy and expensive rotor) and the efficiency becomes {{similar to that of the}} axial turbines.|$|E
40|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>turbines</b> {{preliminary}} {{designs are}} usually carried out through some dimensionless approaches, {{such as the}} loading-to-flow-diagram and/or the blade speed ratio. In case of variable nozzle <b>radial</b> <b>turbines,</b> multi-points specifications must be considered, associated to {{the improvement of the}} operating range. As preliminary design correlations and standards usually taken into consideration arise from fixed nominal geometry <b>radial</b> <b>turbines</b> studies, they need to be updated with regard to nozzle off-design opening configurations. This paper provides some theoretical basics in order to help designers considering variable geometry problems. Some complementary elements about the dimensionless methods are given by taking into account the nozzle opening effect. Then useful considerations are brought regarding the preliminary design of variable geometry <b>radial</b> <b>turbines</b> with multi-points specifications...|$|R

50|$|Compared to an {{axial flow}} turbine, a <b>radial</b> <b>turbine</b> can employ a {{relatively}} higher pressure ratio (≈4) per stage with lower flow rates. Thus these machines {{fall in the}} lower specific speed and power ranges. For high temperature applications rotor blade cooling in radial stages is {{not as easy as}} in axial turbine stages. Variable angle nozzle blades can give higher stage efficiencies in a <b>radial</b> <b>turbine</b> stage even at off-design point operation. In the family of hydro-turbines, Francis turbine is a very well-known IFR turbine which generates much larger power with a relatively large impeller.|$|E

5000|$|An {{axial turbine}} is a turbine {{in which the}} flow of the working fluid is {{parallel}} to the shaft, as opposed to <b>radial</b> <b>turbines,</b> where the fluid runs around a shaft, as in a watermill. An axial turbine has similar construction as an axial compressor, but it operates in the reverse, converting flow of the fluid into rotating mechanical energy.|$|R

The required wide range of operation coupled with the small component size, compact packaging, and low cost of production provide significant aerodynamic challenges.

The compressor achieved design flow, pressure ratio, and surge margin on the initial build. Variable inlet guide vanes have proven effective in modulating flow capacity and in improving part-speed efficiency. With optimum use of the variable inlet guide vanes, the initial efficiency goals have been demonstrated in the critical idle-to- 70 % gasifier speed range.

The overall performances of the turbines under irregular wave conditions, which typically occur in the sea, have been compared by numerical simulation and sea trial.

50|$|The first {{engine was}} finally ready for {{operation}} in 1946. The Army contracted for another four examples. Around this time a turboprop version was proposed, the XT35 Typhoon. This was a fairly simple adaptation of the J37, adding a fifth turbine stage {{at the rear of}} the engine, containing a <b>radial</b> <b>turbine</b> that drove the pusher propeller and exited the exhaust around the outer rim of the engine. An alternate arrangement would send the exhaust through an opening in the propeller boss. In September 1947 Lockheed finally threw in the towel and sold the design to Wright Aeronautical.|$|E
5000|$|The Pelton wheel turbine (better {{described}} as a <b>radial</b> <b>turbine)</b> translates the mechanical action of the Pelton wheel rotating in the liquid flow around an axis into a user-readable rate of flow (gpm, lpm, etc.). The Pelton wheel tends {{to have all the}} flow traveling around it with the inlet flow focused on the blades by a jet. The original Pelton wheels were used for the generation of power and consisted of a radial flow turbine with [...] "reaction cups" [...] which not only move with the force of the water on the face but return the flow in opposite direction using this change of fluid direction to further increase the efficiency of the turbine.|$|E
50|$|Soon enough, {{however, the}} {{brothers}} ventured {{into a new}} enterprise on steam turbines. This project {{was based on a}} new type of steam turbine, the Ljungström <b>radial</b> <b>turbine,</b> invented by the brothers and patented by Birger Ljungström in 1894. The turbine principle was the base for the company ALÅ (Ljungström steam turbine Co.), founded in 1908, that owned all the patents. In 1913 together they founded the separate company STAL (Swedish turbine manufacturing Co.), while the workshop was moved from Stockholm to a factory Finspång, Östergötland. Mechanical engineer Karl Gustaf Karlson, later Professor at Chalmers University of Technology, was connected to the development. This company handled the manufacturing and sales of complete steam turbine driven electric generators. The turbine provided a 10% higher thermodynamic efficiency than previously constructions, in addition to being more compact, requiring less space. STAL:s solutions prooved successful, and with contracts such as with Siemens and General Electric, its activites expanded into Europe and beyond.|$|E

The exit diffuser investigation indicated that a conventional conical outer wall may not provide the velocity variation consistent with minimum overall diffuser loss...|$|R
5000|$|Contra-rotating turbines. With axial turbines, some {{efficiency}} advantage can {{be obtained}} if a downstream turbine rotates {{in the opposite direction}} to an upstream unit. However, the complication can be counter-productive. A contra-rotating steam turbine, usually known as the Ljungström turbine, was originally invented by Swedish Engineer Fredrik Ljungström (1875-1964) in Stockholm, and in partnership with his brother Birger Ljungström he obtained a patent in 1894. The design is essentially a multi-stage <b>radial</b> <b>turbine</b> (or pair of 'nested' turbine rotors) offering great efficiency, four times as large heat drop per stage as in the reaction (Parsons) turbine, extremely compact design and the type met particular success in back pressure power plants. However, contrary to other designs, large steam volumes are handled with difficulty and only a combination with axial flow turbines (DUREX) admits the turbine to be built for power greater than ca 50 MW. In marine applications only about 50 turbo-electric units were ordered (of which a considerable amount were finally sold to land plants) during 1917-19, and during 1920-22 a few turbo-mechanic not very successful units were sold. Only a few turbo-electric marine plants were still in use in the late 1960s (ss Ragne, ss Regin) while most land plants remain in use 2010.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} one-dimensional meanline design {{approach for}} <b>radial</b> inflow <b>turbines</b> {{is described in}} the present work.
