The biodegradation of organic matter, which occurred below the thermocline or at the sediment-water interface, influence the reduction-oxidation potential {{in the water column}}. Fluctuation of the reduction-oxidation potential in the water column influence the distribution of metals which are redox sensitive elements (Mn, Fe and Co). Dissolved Mn and Fe concentrations were high in some cases mainly due to the reduction of Mn- and Fe- oxides which occurred in microenvironments in the dominantly oxic medium at the thermocline or in low O 2 zones near the bottom. The distributions were also influenced by <b>riverine</b> <b>inputs.</b> Dissolved Mn, Fe and Co concentrations were generally higher in the north-western Black Sea than in the Adriatic Sea suggesting that diagenetic reactions involving the destruction of organic carbon are more intense in the north-western Black Sea than in the Adriatic Sea. Total particulate concentrations of Mn and Fe were high, due to reprecipitation of Mn 2 + and Fe 2 + in presence of oxygen, <b>riverine</b> <b>inputs</b> and advective transport. Trace metal distributions (Co, Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni) were influenced by the Mn and Fe cycling and by <b>riverine</b> <b>inputs.</b> Relatively high dissolved and leachable or total particulate concentrations were generally found in surface waters at stations directly influenced by the River Po and the River Danube.

The biogeochemical model was consisted of nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, phytoplankton, zooplankton, pelagic detritus and benthic detritus. The coupled model could reproduce the basic condition of seasonal variability of surface Chl a distribution consistently with satellite data. Model results and satellite data clearly showed seasonal variability of Chl a distributions, influenced by monsoon, through water exchange with adjacent seas and nutrient supply from rivers discharges. Phytoplankton blooming during southeast monsoon is higher in general than northwest monsoon, due to upwelling event in the eastern Java Sea. On the other side, the role of nutrient <b>riverine</b> <b>input</b> during northwest monsoon (rainy season) is only limited in the region near river mouths or coastal regions. The calculated annual new productions (Rnew) suggested that the regenerated production is predominant in the Java Sea, except for some regions (e. g: Jakarta Bay and south-coast of Kalimantan) that is influenced by human activities in the land (anthropogenic perturbation). The anthropogenic impact through <b>riverine</b> <b>input</b> triggers high primary production in the regions, while it subsequently uptakes atmospheric CO 2 in particular monsoon season.

In general, the concentrations found in air are similar to, or below, the levels at coastal or near-coastal sites in Europe. Hexachlorobenzene and α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH) were close to phase equilibrium, whereas net atmospheric deposition was observed for γ-HCH. The results suggest that declining trends of HCH in seawater have been continuing for γ-HCH but have somewhat levelled off for α-HCH. Dieldrin displayed a close to phase equilibrium in nearly all the sampling sites, except in the central southwestern part of the North Sea. Here atmospheric deposition dominates the air-sea exchange. This region, close to the English coast, showed remarkably increased surface seawater concentrations. This observation depended neither on <b>riverine</b> <b>input</b> nor on the elevated abundances of dieldrin in the air masses of central England.

40|$|<b>Riverine</b> <b>input</b> {{often leads}} to high {{biological}} productivity in coastal areas. In coastal areas termed as region of freshwater influence (ROFI), horizontal anticyclonic gyres and vertical circulation form by density differences between buoyant river water and sea water. Previous physical oceanography {{studies have shown that}} the horizontal pattern of anticyclonic gyres and the strength of vertical circulation are dependent on the bottom topography of ROFI. However, the dependencies of biogeochemical cycles such as the net primary production (NPP) on the bottom topography have not been verified. In order to clarify how the bottom topography affects the NPP in phytoplankton blooms caused by <b>riverine</b> <b>input</b> through the physical processes in ROFI, we used an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) including a simple ecosystem model and conducted several case studies varying the bottom slope angle in the ideal settings. We estimated NPP categorized into three nutrients supplied from the river, the sea-subsurface layer and via regeneration: RI-NPP, S-NPP and RE-NPP. S-NPP and RE-NPP are larger and smaller with a steeper slope, respectively, while RI-NPP is not affected by the slope angle. As a result, total NPP is weakly dependent on the slope angle, i. e., because S- and RE-NPPs cancel each other out through two physical processes, (1) S-NPP is controlled by the strength of the vertical circulation and (2) RE-NPP is controlled by the shape of the horizontal gyre, which both vary with the bottom slope angle. We also conducted realistic simulations for Ishikari Bay, Japan and confirmed a similar dependency to that in the above ideal settings. That is, the simulation results are consistent with the regime of ideal settings and show that RI and RE-NPPs are important variables for Ishikari Bay which has a gentle slope. (C) 2016 The Authors.

40|$|We {{assess the}} role of <b>riverine</b> <b>inputs</b> of N, Si, Fe, organic and {{inorganic}} C in the tropical Atlantic Ocean using a global ocean biogeochemistry model. We use two sensitivity tests to investigate {{the role of}} the western (South American Rivers) and eastern (African Rivers) <b>riverine</b> nutrient <b>inputs</b> on the tropical Atlantic Ocean biogeochemistry (between 20 ° S– 20 ° N and 70 ° W– 20 °). Increased nutrient availability from river inputs in this area (compared to an extreme scenario with no river nutrients) leads to an increase in 14 % (0. 7 Pg C a&minus; 1 ) in open ocean primary production (PP), and 21 % (0. 2 Pg C a&minus; 1 ) in coastal ocean PP. We estimate very modest increases in open and coastal ocean export production and sea-air CO 2 fluxes. Results suggest that in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, the large <b>riverine</b> nutrient <b>inputs</b> on the western side have a larger impact on primary production and sea-air CO 2 exchanges. On the other hand, African river inputs, although smaller than South American inputs, have larger impact on the coastal and open tropical Atlantic Ocean export production. This is probably due to a combination of nutrient trapping in upwelling areas off the Congo River outflow, and differences in delivered nutrient ratios leading to alleviation in limitation conditions mainly for diatoms...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect that {{freshwater}} inflow has on the transport of dredged material in Liverpool Bay. The sediment dispersal is first simulated using constant density throughout the domain, and then density gradients and stratification {{will be allowed to}} develop from <b>riverine</b> <b>inputs.</b> The first case shows the sediments slowly being transported east-westwards away from the estuary; while the simulation with freshwater shows the sediment being rapidly transported south-eastward towards the estuary. Model simulations such as these may inform decisions of where to put the dredging spoil to minimise the likelihood of it returning directly to the estuary...|$|R
