40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{geometric}} graph properties of <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> from an algorithmic perspective, focusing on empirical studies that yield useful properties of <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> {{and how these}} properties can be exploited {{in the design of}} fast algorithms. Unlike previous approaches, our study is not {{based on the assumption that}} <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> are planar graphs. Indeed, based on experiments we have performed on the <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> of the 50 United States and District of Columbia, we provide strong empirical evidence that <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> are quite non-planar. Our approach instead is directed at finding algorithmically-motivated properties of <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> as non-planar geometric graphs, focusing on alternative properties of <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> that can still lead to efficient algorithms for such problems as shortest paths and Voronoi diagrams. In particular, we study <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> as multiscale-dispersed graphs, which is a concept we formalize in terms of disk neighborhood systems. This approach allows us to develop fast algorithms for <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> without making any additional assumptions about the distribution of edge weights...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the growth of <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> and regional development. We test for mutual causality between the growth of <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> (which are divided functionally into local roads and highways) and changes in county-level population and employment. We employ a panel data set containing observations of road mileage by type for all Minnesota counties over the period 1988 to 2007 to fit a model describing changes in <b>road</b> <b>networks,</b> population and employment. Results indicate that causality runs in both directions between population and local <b>road</b> <b>networks,</b> while no evidence of causality in either direction is found for networks and local employment. We interpret the findings as evidence of a weakening influence of <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> (and transportation more generally) on location, and suggest methods for refining the empirical approach described herein. 15 1...|$|R
5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> The rural <b>road</b> <b>network</b> expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E

We experimentally evaluate our technique on a large set of real-world <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> of various data sources. With lightweight preprocessing our technique answers long-distance queries across continental networks significantly faster than previous approaches towards the same problem formulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose and test a method for {{comparing}} <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> from the view point of pedestrian flows. We constructed a type of spatial interaction model where the shopping trip distributions were determined using a partially doubly-constrained type of model. The method for comparing the <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> is based on this model. The method is as follows. The <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> are represented by nodes and links. Then, P, the probability for a pedestrian to move from node i to nodej is expressed by the following equation: Pij = Wj exp (- “Ÿcij) /  Wj exp (-iŸ Cij) where Cij is the distance between node i and j, W, is a measure of attraction of node), and beta is the distance-decay parameter. We proved that V., the first eigenvector of transition matrix, (Pij), indicates the ratio of pedestrian flows at node i at a steady-state condition. By using the first eigenvector of the transition matrix, <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> can be compared. In this paper, a general method for calculating the first eigenvectors of transition matrices will be described and several <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> of premodern cities in Europe, Middle East and Japan will be compared. The results indicate that the method of comparing pedestrian <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> by using the first eigenvector of the transition matrix is useful...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only the Via Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region by year 1030. It was an eastwest route {{spanning}} from Pazin to Poreč. Road transport in the region lost significance after the peninsula was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice. From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional <b>road</b> <b>network</b> continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the <b>road</b> <b>network</b> in Istria had expanded to a degree that would not change for a century and a half.
