40|$|Data {{from recent}} {{geophysical}} {{surveys of the}} conjugate Islas Orcadas and Meteor <b>rises</b> in the South Atlantic are discussed in relation to results of ODP Leg 114 drilling of these features. We examine morphology {{and the nature of}} basement on the two <b>rises</b> and correlate seismic horizons with the drilled stratigraphy to establish a depositional history for each <b>rise.</b> Basement on Islas Orcadas <b>Rise</b> is generally smoother than on Meteor <b>Rise,</b> and there is evidence for a younger phase of volcanism on Meteor <b>Rise.</b> Meteor <b>Rise</b> has experienced a more dynamic depositional history, whereas flat-lying sediments on Islas Orcadas <b>Rise</b> are disrupted by Neogene faulting. Paleodepth estimates indicate that significant topography existed during the Paleocene-early Eocene, that the plateau portions of the <b>rises</b> formed below sea level, and that only the seamounts on the Meteor <b>Rise</b> appear to have formed on-ridge. We speculate that the <b>rises</b> formed in the Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary, and that a second phase of volcanism occurred on the Meteor <b>Rise,</b> contemporaneous with the initiation of seafloor spreading that separated the <b>rises</b> at 59 Ma...|$|R
