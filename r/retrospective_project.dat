The intent of this research is to assess the value in conducting retrospectives. The findings are the results of a comprehensive literature search that collects and categorizes the descriptive benefits gained through conducting retrospectives and solicited feedback on these findings from retrospective leaders. The results serve a dual purpose: to provide a consolidated list of benefits that retrospective leaders can use to sell retrospectives to clients; and, to propose a survey that can be used by retrospective leaders to gather quantitative data from their clients for future studies or marketing. The findings provide retrospective leaders and businesses with data for identifying the significance of the retrospective technique, increasing its marketability and aiding in the acceptance of retrospectives by the business community.

40|$|Class of 2011 AbstractOBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare patient clinical outcomes, vascular access line administration complications, and piperacillin-tazobactam costs before and after implementation of an extended infusion piperacillin-tazobactam protocol in adult patients at an academic medical center. METHODS: In this IRB-approved <b>retrospective</b> <b>project,</b> the effect of the implementation of a piperacillin- tazobactam extended infusion protocol at a tertiary care, academic medical center was accessed. The use of piperacillin-tazobactam was accessed during 3 one-month time periods in 2010 : Time Period 1 (pre-education and implementation of protocol), Time Period 2 (post-education of pharmacists and infectious disease physicians), and Time Period 3 (post-education of healthcare professionals and implementation of extended-infusion piperacillin- tazobactam protocol). Patients were excluded if piperacillin-tazobactam therapy was prescribed for less than 72 hours. Data collected in each one-month period included demographic data, culture results, number of piperacillin-tazobactam grams prescribed per day, percentage of patients who received extended-infusion piperacillin-tazobactam, other antimicrobial therapy prescribed, medications prescribed with intravenous incompatibilities with piperacillin-tazobactam, number of intravenous line lumens before and after start of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy, length of stay, and all-cause 30 day mortality. RESULTS: During a three step process, the use of extended infusion piperacillin-tazobactam was implemented at an academic medical center after administration approval, education of healthcare professionals, and development of an electronic piperacillin-tazobactam order set. Use of extended-infusion piperacillin-tazobactam protocol significantly decreased the average daily piperacillin-tazobactam dose per patient. CONCLUSION: Implementation of extended-infusion piperacillin-tazobactam protocol for adult patients did significantly decrease the average daily dose of piperacillin-tazobactam per patient (reduced drug cost) but increased vascular access requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} access primary care {{services}} within {{the local community}} has {{a direct impact on}} the health and wellness of the community. Individuals living in rural settings face multiple challenges when attempting to access care. The purpose of this <b>retrospective</b> <b>project</b> was to identify barriers in 2 rural, underserved communities and make recommendations for process changes that could reduce these barriers. Data were gathered from 2 critical access hospitals and 2 rural health clinics located in rural, underserved areas in Iowa. Both hospitals identified access to health services as an issue within their communities. Administrative data were gathered on nonemergent use of the emergency department, which revealed peak use from 10 a. m. to 11 a. m., 12 p. m. to 1 p. m., and 4 p. m. to 5 p. m. Clinic data included patient demographics, staffing and scheduling patterns, and the number of patient visits. One site provided expanded hours, yet very little difference in the number visits to the emergency room for nonemergent care was identified. Both clinic sites reported the need for additional providers {{to meet the needs of}} their patients and provide more same-day appointments. Recommendations made to increase access were open scheduling, staggered staff schedules to increase appointments over peak demand times, and use of a dedicated case manager to improve communication and coordination of care. Increased use of technology would allow the provision of care outside the clinic setting, enhance care coordination, and promote patient participation in care. With increased knowledge regarding the barriers facing rural communities when accessing care, process changes can be implemented to reduce barriers. The overall goal is to improve health and wellness through increased access...|$|E

The International Staging Committee of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer now issues this call for participation in the Prospective Project designed to assess the validity of each component of T, N, and M, and other factors relevant to lung cancer staging and prognosis. In the <b>Retrospective</b> <b>Project,</b> the original data acquisition was typically motivated by interests other than staging. In contrast, the Prospective Project offers online data entry. Alternatively, participants may transfer existing data, provided core objectives are addressed. Cancer Research and Biostatistics will coordinate data management and analysis. The study population is newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. Data elements include patient characteristics, baseline laboratory values, first-line treatment, TNM plus supporting evidence, and survival. Pretreatment TNM will be collected for all cases; postsurgical TNM, if resection is attempted. T descriptors include size and degree of tumor extension, with further description of extent of visceral pleural invasion, venous invasion, carcinomatous lymphangitis, and pleural lavage cytology. M descriptors characterize the newly proposed M 1 a category and sites of distant metastases. Nodal station involvement is described by means of a newly proposed nodal map, facilitating international participation, and allowing further investigation of nodal zones. Successful collection and analysis of these data can be expected to yield unprecedented improvements in the utility and validity of lung cancer staging.

40|$|Female {{patients}} often visit physicians reporting {{symptoms of}} acute vulvovaginitis. They complain {{of pain and}} irritation and they seek immediate relief and no symptom recurrence. In the past few years, an increase in both the number of first-time incidents of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) {{and the number of}} recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) was noted in women of reproductive age. In recent studies infection by Candida species has been the most common reason of vulvovaginitis in Europe, and the second leading cause in the USA. Furthermore, an increased tolerance of the candida species to the broadly administered antifungal drugs has been observed. Therefore, investigation of the effectiveness of some new antifungal agents would be highly beneficial. AIMS This dissertation aimed in: A. The research of distribution of the Candida species in four groups of patients who present disturbance of the mucosa of vaginal microflora according to their medical history and to clinical and laboratory results: i) patients with Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC), ii) patients with Recurent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC), iii) women in pregnancy, iv) patients with type I and II diabetes. B. An in-vitro evaluation of the susceptibility of the isolated Candida species to two antifungal agents and their clinical efficacy was performed using a broth microdilution method. Two antifungal agents have been tested: i) a triazole, the itraconazole, a broadly per os administered antifungal drug, ii) an imidazole, the fenticonazole a novel topical agent, which was at phase III of clinical trials, in the drug approval procedure, when this project started. C. The <b>retrospective</b> <b>project</b> of in-vitro susceptibility of itraconazole and fenticonazole, that was tested {{for the very first time}} in Greek patients with: i) Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC), ii) Recurent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC), iii) pregnancy, iv) type 1 and 2 diabetes. D. The identification of pathogens such as Mycoplasma hominis, Ureoplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Human Papilloma Virus, E. coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis that were probably responsible for the disturbance of the mucosa of vaginal microflora in the patient groups. E. The study of exogenous predisposing factors, such as antibiotics, oral contraceptives and highestrogen contraceptives for therapy, that according to international evidence provide the disturbance of the mucosa of vaginal microflora, having as result the presence of vulvovaginal candidosis. METHODS The guidelines M 27 -A 2 of CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, USA) and those of Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing (AFST) of the ESCMID European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), were followed while performing the broth microdilution methods to test the susceptibility of the Candida species. These guidelines did not include a method and specific break points for fenticonazole. Consequently, we performed a new, pilot, experimental procedure to test fenticonazole using the break points of itraconazole because they both have similar chemical characteristics (water-insoluble substances). The results of the two broth microdilution reference methods had been compared and no difference of statististical significance was found. The use of these two reference methods validates the credibility of results*. We also examined the clinical efficacy of the antifungal drugs according to the percentages of cure or recurrence.

40|$|Within {{many areas}} of {{medicine}} and science animal experiments are seen as indispensable, however ethically not unproblematic {{by the majority of}} the general public. In Germany these experiments are subject to notification or licensing. In Great Britain regulated procedures must also be licensed. In both countries, the compliance with legal rules and regulations as well as with licensing terms and conditions must be guaranteed through appropriate forms of supervision and control. The present study examines German regulations and their practical implementations in view of a forthcoming amendment of German animal welfare legislation, resulting from changes in the German constitution of 2002. Comparisons with Great Britain might show further potential for improvement for German procedures. To include all relevant aspects, the legal situation of both countries, literature searches, as well as results from a study via questionnaire are being evaluated. Regarding the countries’ legal situation {{it must be noted that}} Germany and Great Britain both share the same legal foundations due to both of them being members of the European Union. However, legal implementation differs between the two countries. In Germany, supervision of animal experiments and of laboratory animals husbandry is being dealt with according to regional law: in four federal states a regional licensing authority and in further twelve states the Veterinäramt (veterinary department) are responsible. In comparison, in Great Britain official supervision is centrally organised and subdivided between two departments within the Home Office: Animal Scientific Procedures Division and Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. Internal control is required explicitly in the German Tierschutzgesetz (Animal Welfare Act). Every establishment carrying out experiments on vertebrates must appoint a Tierschutzbeauftragter (Animal Welfare Officer) who among other duties must take care of the compliance with rules and regulations as well as with terms and conditions in the interest of animal welfare. An obligation for internal control as comprehensive as this does not exist in the British Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. As an element of internal control the local Ethical Review Process of the establishment should, among other things, allow for <b>retrospective</b> <b>project</b> reviews. Furthermore, some of its members like the Named Animal Care & Welfare Officer, the Named Veterinary Surgeon and the project licence holder have additional duties and powers in the interest of internal supervision of regulated procedures. To fulfil their supervision roles there are various possibilities available to the authorities. Visits represent the most important official supervision method and are to be used as often as possible in both Germany and Great Britain. In Germany however, these and other official supervision methods are highly limited by an unsatisfactory staff situation (on average one visit per establishment and year compared with an average of eleven visits per designated establishment and year in Great Britain). In Great Britain a similar number of announced and unannounced visits take place, whereas in Germany unannounced visits are rare. Unannounced visits have the advantage of allowing an insight into everyday routine, but bare the risk that important contact people are unavailable or no experiment currently takes place. Whilst qualification of the supervising staff in Great Britain is no cause for discussion, in Germany it is criticised particularly when delegated to the Veterinärämter. Furthermore, the partly divided responsibility for licensing and supervision or for differing supervision methods and non-uniform nation-wide enforcement in Germany are subject to serious criticism. The necessity for effective supervision is shown clearly by the variety of infringements described. In Germany as in Great Britain, mild consequences such as further instructions or letters of admonition dominate. Although tougher sanctions such as fines or imprisonment are legally possible in both countries, they are rarely imposed. Regarding internal supervision too, on-site controls are viewed as particularly helpful but in Germany as well as in Great Britain are conducted only in a small portion of all animal experiments taking place. Additionally, <b>retrospective</b> <b>project</b> reviews can make a positive contribution to laboratory animal welfare. They are a required method of control in Great Britain and therefore are used regularly, whilst in Germany so far they are applied considerably less often. For the Tierschutzbeauftragter as well as for the Ethical Review Process and its members it is necessary to be supported by the establishment. Although the personnel reviewed in both countries mainly expressed satisfaction with their access to project licence holders, personal licence holders and certificate holders and did not need to reckon with negative consequences for themselves when voicing criticism, German discrimination prohibition for the Tierschutzbeauftragter obviously is not always met and criticism and suggestions in Great Britain are not always taken into account. However, as it has turned out the supervisors’ personal commitment plays an important role, too. Involving the authorities in cases of serious or on-going infringements seems to be seen as a breach of the use of official channels by the Tierschutzbeauftragte reviewed. In comparison, in Great Britain there seem to be no misgivings regarding this. Thus, it can be noted that in Germany internal supervision and control is handled very differently depending on each establishment and its Tierschutzbeauftragter, whereas in Great Britain it is insufficiently regulated and therefore can be regarded as moderately efficient. On the basis of the data, information and findings collected in this study, the nation-wide responsibility of the licensing authorities also for the supervision of projects licensed by them can be recommended for Germany particularly regarding professional competence. Establishments conducting regulated procedures should be visited by the authority considerably more often, at least twice yearly, with as many unannounced as announced visits. For this it is necessary to provide more staff to the authorities responsible. During those visits the authority representatives of both countries should watch the conduction of animal experiments more often to assess the practical abilities of those performing them. In cases of repeated or serious infringements, considerably tougher action with use of those legal instruments available is necessary. To provide effective internal supervision or control by the Tierschutzbeauftragter, his authority to issue directives as legally granted to him, his support by the establishment as well as his personal commitment regarding his regular presence in the laboratories and at experiments taking place must be assured. In Great Britain, however, a comprehensive legal obligation for further control would need to be considered to provide effective internal supervision. Overall it can be noted that regarding supervision and control of regulated procedures there seems to be potential for improvement in both Germany and Great Britain. Germany’s federally structured official supervision seems to be less efficient than the centrally organised supervision by the British Home Office. However, some arguments seem to suggest that compulsory German Tierschutzbeauftragte, despite potential for improvement, can achieve a higher level of efficiency than Great Britain’s Ethical Review Processes...|$|E
