She noted, [...] "the way the script was {{originally}} <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> initially {{seemed to me}} as if Scully kind of {{stepped up to the plate}} and played along with the sheriff's humor". She reportedly performed her lines in a [...] "tongue in cheek"-esque way before receiving a call from Carter. He informed her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to [...] "edit out a lot of stuff" [...] in order to make up for this. Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at the places they stood in for. The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen. The scenes required the store to be closed before Christmas and be installed with up-right freezers.|$|E

In his book Poetical Works vol. 1 a {{footnote}} to Guilt and Sorrow; or, Incidents upon Salisbury Plain states that some of its lines were taken [...] "From a short MS. poem <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when an under-graduate, by my schoolfellow and friend Charles Farish, long since deceased. The verses were by a brother of his, a man of promising genius, who died young."—W. W. 1842 in a statement by the editor of the volume the footnote goes on to say that: [...] "Charles Farish was the author of The Minstrels of Winandermere" [...] as a result there is some debate as to authorship of the song commemorating Richard Gilpin's achievements).|$|E

2500|$|Lake's {{daughter}} Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels was a noted classical scholar. [...] In {{later years}} she {{reflected on the}} impact he had on her life: [...] "my general interests should be attributed mainly {{to the influence of}} my father who was a New testament scholar with a classical education and a passionate love of beauty. [...] He told me the stories of the classics and, long before I could understand them, <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a strange assortment of Browning and the Bible; Swinburne, Tennyson, and Josephus. [...] His attitude to his own work made me think of scholarship as the opening to a world of adventure, not as a retirement from reality." [...] His grandson Anthony Lake is a diplomat.|$|E
