Recently, activation of GABA signaling in stem cells has been reported to suppress cell cycle progression in vivo. Furthermore, possible inhibitory effects of GABA(A) R agonists on hepatocarcinogenesis have been reported. The present study was performed to investigate modulating effects of Valerian on hepatocarcinogenesis using a medium-term <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> <b>bioassay.</b> Male F 344 rats were treated with one of the most powerful Valerian species (Valeriana sitchensis) at doses of 0, 50, 500 and 5000 ppm in their drinking water after initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis with diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Formation of glutathione S-transferase placental form positive (GST-P+) foci was significantly inhibited by Valerian at all applied doses compared with DEN initiation control rats. Generation of 8 -hydroxy- 29 -deoxyguanosine in the rat liver was significantly suppressed by all doses of Valerian, likely due to suppression of Nrf 2, CYP 7 A 1 an...|$|E

The tentative protocol for the GPG 46 model was developed {{based on the results}} of dose-response exposure to diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and treatment with phenobarbital over time following DEN ad-ministration. Briefly, gpt delta rats were exposed to various chemicals for 4 weeks, followed by a partial hepatectomy (PH) to collect samples for an in vivo mutation assay. The mutant frequencies (MFs) of the reporter genes were examined as an indication of tumor initiation. A single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 10 mg/kg DEN was administered to rats 18 h after the PH to initiate hepatocytes. Tumor-promoting activity was evaluated based on the development of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) -positive foci at week 10. The genotoxic carcinogens 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 -AAF), 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo [4, 5 -f] quinolone (IQ) and safrole (SF), the non-genotoxic carcinogens piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and phenytoin (PHE), the non-carcinogen acetaminophen (APAP) and the genotoxic non-hepatocarcinogen aristolochic acid (AA) were tested to validate the GPG 46 model.

40|$|PCBs cause {{a number}} of toxic effects and are present {{in a variety of}} {{biological}} samples including fish, meat and diary products. Cancer is a serious toxic effect by PCBs that has been observed in animal experiments but the knowledge about PCB induced carcinogenicity is still scarce. This thesis is focused on tumour promotive effects by PCBs in rat liver. The ultimate goal was to generate data, which would improve risk assessments of these substances. The specific aims were to analyse the tumour promotive effects of some individual PCBs in livers of rats, to study interactive effects of such substances on tumour promotion, and to study foci growth with a biologically based cancer growth model, using experimental data on cell proliferation and foci occurrence for the selection of growth parameters in the model. The tumour promoting potency of two PCB congeners, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3 ', 4 '-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 156) and 2, 4, 5, 3 ', 4 '-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 118), was studied individually in a two-stage initiation/promotion <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> <b>bioassay.</b> The effect of PCB 156 was studied after 20 weeks of administration and PCB 118 after 20 and 52 weeks of administration. Both substances enhanced the occurrence of preneoplastic lesions in rat liver and relative potencies to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) based on the tumour promotive effect were calculated to be 0. 0001 - 0. 001 for PCB 156 and 50000 times less than TCDD The PCB 118 promoted foci growth was successfully modeled by a biologically based cancer growth model. At the dose levels tested, additivity or weak antagonism could be demonstrated after exposure to mixtures of polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. Based on these results, there is no immediate reason to change the application of the TEF concept, given the uncertainty of the estimated TEFs and the importance of protecting the general human population through conservative risk assessments...|$|E

The by-products of disinfection, including chloramine, halogenated humic acids, halogenated ethanes, halogenated acetonitriles, halogenated methanes, halogenated ethylenes, and N-Cl-piperidine, did not initiate GGT foci, which would indicate that they are not capable of initiating carcinogenesis. Chloroform and halogenated benzenes were tested in this assay for their ability to promote the occurrence of GGT foci and tumors initiated by diethylnitrosamine (DENA). Chloroform (1800 ppm in the drinking water) either had no effect or inhibited the occurrence of GGT foci when administered subsequent to a single dose of DENA. However, when the chloroform was administered in drinking water concurrently with weekly doses of DENA, it enhanced the formation of liver tumors. Of 20 halogenated benzenes tested, only 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene promoted the occurrence of DENA-initiated GGT foci. Thus in <b>rat</b> <b>liver,</b> the tested by-products of drinking water disinfection did not demonstrate tumor-initiating activity, although a few appeared to possess tumor-promoting activity.

This paper evaluates metabolism, genotoxicity, and tumor-initiating activity of these chemicals. The alkylating {{potential of the}} HAN to react with the electrophile-trapping agent, 4 -(p-nitrobenzyl) pyridine, followed the order dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN) > bromochloroacetonitrile (BCAN) > chloroacetonitrile (CAN) > dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) > trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN). When administered orally to rats, the HAN were metabolized to cyanide and excreted in the urine as thiocyanate. The extent of thiocyanate excretion was CAN> BCAN> DCAN> DBAN>> TCAN. Haloacetonitriles inhibited in vitro microsomal dimethylnitrosamine demethylase (DMN-DM) activity. The most potent inhibitors were DBAN and BCAN, with Ki = 3 - 4 x 10 - M; the next potent were DCAN and TCAN, with Ki = 2 x 10 - M; and the least potent inhibitor was CAN, with K, = 9 x 10 - 2 M. When administered orally, TCAN, but not DBAN, inhibited hepatic DMN-DM activity. The HAN produced DNA strand breaks in cultured human lymphoblastic (CCRF-CEM) cells. TCAN was the most potent DNA strand breaker, and BCAN> DBAN> DCAN> CAN, which was only marginally active.

Vance, Eds.), Vol. 209, pp. 248 - 258, Academic Press, San Diego, CA). Like cytidylyltransferase purified from <b>rat</b> <b>liver,</b> the purified recombinant cytidylyltransferase {{has the same}} molecular weight (42 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and reacts to antibodies generated against the N and C termini of <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> cytidylyltransferase. In addition, like the purified <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> enzyme, the recombinant cytidylyltransferase is activated by lipids. We also expressed <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> cytidylyltransferase as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase and with a thrombin cleavage site between the two enzymes for rapid isolation of cytidylyltransferase. Thrombin cleavage was, however, incomplete and prolonged exposure to thrombin resulted in the degradation of cytidylyltransferase itself...|$|R

The distributions of (32) P freed from phosphatidic acid by phosphatidic acid phosphatase were studied on lysolecithin, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholin and phosphatidylethanolamin. The distribution for lysolecithin and sphingomyelin {{were no differences}} between normal and DAB-feeding <b>rat</b> <b>liver.</b> The distribution for phosphatidylcholin was elevated at 80 th day of DAB-feeding <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> than the normal one, and the distribution for phosphatidyl ethanolamin was bighn in DAB-feeding <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> then the normal one at 20 th day, but on the controry, it was changed at 40 and 60 th day, and increased in normal than in DAB-feeding <b>rat</b> <b>liver...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{have found}} that the rat testis {{contains}} a cell surface galactosyl receptor that is antigenically related to the minor species of <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-r) and has binding affinity for galactose coupled to agarose. In immunoblotting experiments, rat testis galactosyl receptor (RTG-r) is recognized by antiserum raised against the minor ASGP-r species of <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> (designated <b>rat</b> hepatic lectin- 2 / 3, RHL- 2 / 3). Antiserum raised against the major species RHL- 1 does not recognize an antigenic protein equivalent to RTG-r. Triton X- 100 -extracted <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> and testes preparations fractionated by affinity chromatography on galactose-agarose and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, show that <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> contains both the major (RHL- 1) and minor (RHL- 2 / 3) ASGP-...|$|R
40|$|A Y-base {{derivative}} {{was isolated}} from <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> tRNAPhe and its structure {{was assigned to}} be alpha-(carboxyamino) -beta-hydroxy- 4, 9 -dihydro- 4, 6 -dimethyl- 9 -oxo- 1 H-imidazol[1, 2 -a]purine- 7 -butyric acid dimethyl ester (hydroxy-Y), {{based on the results}} of mass spectrometry and chemical degradation. This modified base seems to be the major fluorescent component of <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> tRNAPhe; the peroxy-Y base previously isolated from <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> tRNAPhe and characterized by Nakanishi and his coworkers (1, 2) was not present in our preparation...|$|R
40|$|A Na(+) -dependent {{bile acid}} (Na+/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide; Ntcp) and a Na(+) -independent bromosulphophthalein (BSP) /bile acid uptake system (organic-anion-transporting polypeptide; oatp) have been cloned from <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> by using {{functional}} expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To evaluate {{the extent to}} which these cloned transporters could account for overall hepatic bile acid and BSP uptake, we used antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit the expression of Ntcp and oatp in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with total <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> mRNA. An Ntcp-specific antisense oligonucleotide co-injected with total <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> mRNA blocked the expression of Na(+) -dependent taurocholate uptake by approx. 95 %. In contrast, an oatp-specific antisense oligonucleotide when co-injected with total <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> mRNA had no effect on the expression of Na(+) -dependent taurocholate uptake, but it blocked Na(+) -independent uptake of taurocholate by approx. 80 % and of BSP by 50 %. Assuming similar expression of hepatocellular bile acid and organic anion transporters in Xenopus laevis oocytes, these results indicate that Ntcp and oatp respectively represent the major, if not the only, Na(+) -dependent and Na(+) -independent taurocholate uptake systems in <b>rat</b> <b>liver.</b> By contrast, the cloned oatp accounts for only half of BSP transport, suggesting that there must be additional, non-bile acid transporting organic anion uptake systems in <b>rat</b> <b>liver...</b>|$|R
40|$|Kinetic {{experiments}} of labelling in vivo with [14 C]orotate {{of cellular}} free UMP and/or UTP, nucleolar, nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic rRNA in normal and 12 h-regenerating <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> were performed. The specific-radioactivity curves obtained were analysed by {{computer and the}} rates of synthesis of precursor rRNA (45 S pre-rRNA) and cytoplasmic 28 S and 18 S rRNA calculated. (a) The rates of synthesis of 45 S pre-rRNA in normal and regenerating <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> are 1400 and 3700 molecules/min per nucleus respectively; (b) the average rates of formation of mature 28 S and 18 S rRNA are identical with the rates of synthesis of 45 S pre-rRNA in both normal and regenerating <b>rat</b> <b>liver.</b> Thus the synthesis of rRNA in 12 h-regenerating <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> is activated 2. 7 -fold. The analysis of rRNA synthesis in isolated nucleoli also shows a 2. 7 -fold stimulation of transcription in regenerating liver. It is concluded that all the 45 S pre-rRNA molecules synthesized are processed and transferred as 28 S and 18 S rRNA in the cytoplasm, i. e. degradation (wastage) of newly synthesized ribosomes in the nucleus does not occur in both normal and regenerating <b>rat</b> <b>liver.</b> Thus the enhanced production of ribosomes in regenerating <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> is regulated only at the transcriptional level...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} cytochemical {{method was}} developed for measuring the GSH (reduced glutathione) content of hepatocytes in {{different regions of the}} <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> lobule. Use of this method enabled us to show that GSH is not evenly distributed within the <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> lobule. The hepatocytes located within 100 micrometer of the central vein contain much less GSH than do those in other regions of the <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> lobule. We suggest that this partially explains the peculiar susceptibility of these cells to electrophilic attack by toxic metabolites formed via the microsomal cytochrome P- 450 system...|$|R

The subunit composition of purified plant and <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> ATPase were compared by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The delta- and epsilon-subunits {{of the plant}} enzyme are larger than their supposed <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> counterparts and, as such, A. maculatum mitochondrial ATPase shows structural homologies with the enzyme from Escherichia coli [Futai, Sternweis & Heppel (1974) Proc.

For intermembrane interactions, native microsomes of <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> were used as carriers of the enzyme, while heated and phospholipase C-treated microsomes of <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> or brain were employed as carriers of the substrate.

40|$|Evidence for the glyoxylate {{cycle in}} the {{mammalian}} <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> was sought. Activity of two unique glyoxylate cycle enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, {{was found in}} <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> homogenates. Vitamin D 3 treatment of rachitic animals produced a five- and fourfold increase, respectively, in the activity of these enzymes. Vitamin D 3 also increased the peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and the accumulation of glycogen in liver slices {{in the presence of}} palmitate. These data suggest that the mammalian <b>rat</b> <b>liver</b> can convert fatty acid carbon to carbohydrat...|$|R
