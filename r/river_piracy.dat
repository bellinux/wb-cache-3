2500|$|This {{prominence}} of lighter craft {{in the historical}} narrative is perhaps best explained in light of subsequent developments. After Actium, the operational landscape had changed: {{for the remainder of}} the Principate, no opponent existed to challenge Roman naval hegemony, and no massed naval confrontation was likely. The tasks at hand for the Roman navy were now the policing of the Mediterranean waterways and the border <b>rivers,</b> suppression of <b>piracy,</b> and escort duties for the grain shipments to Rome and for imperial army expeditions. Lighter ships were far better suited to these tasks, and after the reorganization of the fleet following Actium, the largest ship kept in service was a hexareme, the flagship of the Classis Misenensis. The bulk of the fleets was composed of the lighter triremes and liburnians (Latin: liburna, Greek: libyrnis), with the latter apparently providing the majority of the provincial fleets. In time, the term [...] "liburnian" [...] came to mean [...] "warship" [...] in a generic sense.|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{evolution}} {{is controlled by}} the development and organization of drainage basins. As a landscape evolves, drainage reorganization events can occur via <b>river</b> capture or <b>piracy,</b> whereby one <b>river</b> basin grows at the expense of another. The river downstream of a capture location will generate a transient topographic response as the added water discharge increases sediment transport and erosion efficiency. This erosional response will propagate upstream through both the captured and original river basins. Here we focus on quantifying the impact of drainage reorganization along the Rhine/Aare River system (~ 45, 000 [*]km 2) during the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene, where gravel remnants indicate total incision of ~ 650 [*]m during the last ~ 4. 2 [*]Myr in the region of the recent Aare‐Rhine confluence. We develop a numerical model of drainage capture to quantify the range of possible magnitudes of erosion and the transient river response resulting from the reorganization of the Rhine River. The model accounts for both fluvial incision and sediment transport. Our model estimates 400 – 800 [*]m of river elevation change (lowering profiles) during the last ~ 4 [*]Myr due to river capture events, providing an important component to the recent exhumation budget of the Swiss Alpine Foreland. The model indicates a rapid response to capture events (re‐equilibration timescale of ~ 1 [*]Myr). The predicted incision magnitudes are consistent with incision measured from the elevation of Pliocene and early Pleistocene river gravels, suggesting that across northern Switzerland, a significant amount of incision can be explained by drainage reorganization. Key Points Drainage capture has caused significant erosion along the Rhine River The transient erosional wave propagates quickly through the landscape The incision is a significant fraction of Plio‐Pleistocene erosion in the regio...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} intramontane Upper Tiber Basin in the Northern Apennines (central Italy), where sub-orthogonal fault systems forced river {{deviation}} and {{the abandonment of}} alluvial fans since the late Middle Pleistocene. Archaeological material, spanning the Middle Palaeolithic-Iron Age, was collected mostly {{from the surface of}} the Late Quaternary alluvial landforms and related deposits (MUP and HOL units). This information contributed to the partial dating of seven major stages of drainage development. Normal faults parallel and transverse to the basin trend were active at different times and conditioned the valley pattern of the Middle (MUP 1 – 2) -Late (MUP 3) Pleistocene Tiber, Singerna, Sovara and Tignana rivers, which still flow today into the basin. The MUP 1 and the MUP 3 fans were beheaded by the displacement of their feeder valleys along the basin-transverse Carmine and Montedoglio faults. In some cases, the former feeder <b>rivers</b> underwent stream <b>piracy</b> but their courses mostly deviated in response of the topographic gradient created by faulting, as well as through the incision of new valleys that exploited the lithological contrast along the fault lines. The MUP 3 Tignana fan was abandoned mostly due to the activity of the basin-parallel, dip-slip Sansepolcro fault. Subsidence driven by the basin-parallel Anghiari and Sansepolcro fault systems also provided the accommodation space for the MUP 3 and HOl 1 - 2 Afra fans between Late Pleistocene and early-mid Holocene. This study exemplifies the interplay between longitudinal and transverse fault systems, and the Late Quaternary hydrographic evolution of an extensional basin settled in the axial zone of an active fold-and-thrust belt. Although the faulting has interacted with the forcing exerted by the Late Quaternary climate fluctuations on the basin drainage systems, the tectonic rates are sufficiently high to represent the prime controller on base-level change and drainage routing patterns...|$|R

40|$|The Emilia and Lombardia 2012 seismic {{sequence}} (two main shocks of Mw ca. 6. 0) revamped {{once again}} the scientific debate about the seismic hazard posed by Quaternary tectonic structures of the Po Plain foredeep (e. g., Serva, 1990; Boccaletti et al., 2004; Picotti and Pazzaglia, 2008; Michetti et al., 2012; Galli et al., 2012). The W sector of the foredeep represents in particular the area with most controversial interpretation in terms of active tectonics and seismic potential. For instance, in the ITHACA catalogue of capable faults the Monferrato Arc {{is regarded as a}} seismogenic structure with potential for surface faulting earthquakes; while in the DISS database the W Lombardia and Piemonte are essentially interpreted as areas lacking any evidence of active faulting and seismic sources with Mw > 5. 5. In order to attack this issue, we conducted field investigation, geomorphic analyses and the revision of the large existing database of seismic reflection profiles covering the study area in order to assess the seismic landscape of the Monferrato Arc. Our investigations confirm that the Late Quaternary landscape evolution of the South-Central Piemonte {{is the result of the}} interaction between active tectonics and widespread phenomena of <b>river</b> avulsion and <b>piracy,</b> which affected virtually the whole Piemonte and nearby Liguria region. In fact, these dramatic changes in the regional drainage network are controlled by shortening and thrust fault growth, which started during Oligo-Miocene times and is still active with visible deformation rates (Carraro et al., 1995). The development of the Apennines buried thrust fronts since Miocene give rise to the progressive uplift of the Monferrato and Torino Hills, translated above the depositional sequences of the Po Plain foredeep. The continuing deformation and displacement of the surficial deposits up to at least the Mid Pleistocene allow us to regard the buried structures of the Monferrato Arc as potentially capable faults (IAEA, 2010). Therefore, based on the available data, the regional seismotectonic framework for the W Po Plain is comparable with the one already recognized in the Emilia Arc or in the LombardiaVeneto S Alps (Modena 2012, Brescia 1222, Verona 1117). The seismic landscape of the Monferrato Arc thus includes potential surface faulting earthquakes, with M max in the order of 6. 0 – 6. 5 (Michetti et al., 2012), and accompanied by considerable liquefaction and earthquake environmental effects...|$|R
