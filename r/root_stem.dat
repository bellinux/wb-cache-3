5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of <b>root,</b> <b>stem</b> (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E

In Scolymus these are ligulate florets, common to the group except for Warionia and Gundelia, which only have disk florets. A unique character setting Scolymus apart from the other Cichorieae are the dorsally compressed cypsellas which are surrounded by scales (or paleae).|$|E
500|$|Wood gives {{structural}} strength {{to the trunk}} of a tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger [...] The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees {{would not be able to}} grow as large as they do. Trees, as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die. The three main parts of trees include the <b>root,</b> <b>stem,</b> and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.|$|E

Polysyllabic athematic nominals (type R+S+E) exhibit four characteristic patterns that include accent and ablaut alternations throughout the paradigm between the root, the stem and the ending: acrostatic (Ancient Greek statikos 'holding still', akros 'beginning', i.e. [...] "stationary on the root"), proterokinetic (kinetikos 'moving', proteros 'before', i.e. [...] "mobile, towards the front"), hysterokinetic (hysteros 'later', i.e. [...] "mobile, towards the back"), amphikinetic (amphis 'on both sides', i.e. [...] "mobile, towards both sides").

The reader may have been surprised at the omission of the fruit from this list. But a plant which has borne fruit is no longer of 'perfect' form. Its flower is dead. And, observe, it is further said, at page 65, (and compare Chapter III., § 2,) {{that the use of}} the fruit is to produce the flower: not of the flower to produce the fruit. Therefore, the plant in perfect blossom, is itself perfect. Nevertheless, the formation of the fruit, practically, is included in the flower, and so spoken of in the fifteenth line of the same page.|$|E

40|$|Twelve {{embryogenesis}} abundant protein (LEA) genes (named ThLEA- 1 to - 12) were cloned from Tamarix hispida. The {{expression profiles}} of these genes {{in response to}} NaCl, PEG, and abscisic acid (ABA) in <b>roots,</b> <b>stems,</b> and leaves of T. hispida were assessed using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These ThLEAs all showed tissue-specific expression patterns in <b>roots,</b> <b>stems,</b> and leaves under normal growth conditions. However, they shared a high similar expression patterns in the <b>roots,</b> <b>stems,</b> and leaves when exposed to NaCl and PEG stress. Furthermore, ThLEA- 1, - 2, - 3, - 4, and - 11 were induced by NaCl and PEG, but ThLEA- 5, - 6, - 8, - 10, and - 12 were downregulated by salt and drought stresses. Under ABA treatment, some ThLEA genes, such as ThLEA- 1, - 2, and - 3, were only slightly differentially expressed in <b>roots,</b> <b>stems,</b> and leaves, indicating {{that they may be}} involved in the ABA-independent signaling pathway.

6000|$|... 1. Plants {{in their}} perfect form consist of four {{principal}} parts,--the <b>Root,</b> <b>Stem,</b> Leaf, and Flower. It {{is true that}} the stem and flower are parts, or remnants, or altered states, of the leaves; and that, speaking with close accuracy, we might say, a perfect plant consists of leaf and root. But the division into these four parts is best for practical purposes, and it will be desirable to note a few general facts about each, before endeavouring to describe any one kind of plant. Only, because the character of the stem depends {{on the nature of the}} leaf and flower, we must put it last in order of examination; and trace the development of the plant first in root and leaf; then in the flower and its fruit; and lastly in the stem.|$|E

'In {{the world}} we see every where evidences of a unity, which the [...] {{component}} parts are so far from explaining, that they necessarily [...] presuppose it as the cause and condition of their existing as those [...] parts, or even of their existing at all. This antecedent unity, or [...] cause and principle of each union, it has {{since the time of}} Bacon and [...] Kepler, been customary to call a law. This crocus, for instance, or [...] any flower the reader may have in sight or choose to bring before his [...] fancy;--that the <b>root,</b> <b>stem,</b> leaves, petals, &c. cohere as one plant, [...] is owing to an antecedent power or principle in the seed, which [...] existed before a single particle of the matters that constitute the [...] size and visibility of the crocus had been attracted from the [...] surrounding soil, air, and moisture. Shall we turn to the seed? Here [...] too the same necessity meets us, an antecedent unity (I speak not of [...] the parent plant, but of an agency antecedent in order of operance, [...] yet remaining present as the conservative and reproductive power,) [...] must here too be supposed. Analyze the seed with the finest tools, and [...] let the solar microscope come in aid of your senses,--what do you [...] find?--means and instruments, a wondrous fairy-tale of nature, [...] magazines of food, stores of various sorts, pipes, spiracles, [...] defences,--a house of many chambers, and the owner and inhabitant [...] invisible.'[4] ...|$|E
60|$|The lowest {{animal and}} vegetal forms--Protozoa and Protophyta--are chiefly {{inhabitants}} of the water. They are minute bodies, {{most of which are}} made individually visible only by the microscope. All of them are extremely simple in structure, and some of them, as the Rhizopods, almost structureless. Multiplying, as they ordinarily do, by the spontaneous division of their bodies, they produce halves which may either become quite separate and move away in different directions, or may continue attached. By the repetition of this process of fission, aggregations of various sizes and kinds are formed. Among the Protophyta we have some classes, as the Diatomaceæ and the Yeast-plant, in which the individuals may be either separate or attached in groups of two, three, four, or more; other classes in which a considerable number of cells are united into a thread (Conferva, Monilia); others in which they form a network (Hydrodictyon); others in which they form plates (Ulva); and others in which they form masses (Laminaria, Agaricus): all which vegetal forms, having no distinction of <b>root,</b> <b>stem,</b> or leaf, are called Thallogens. Among the Protozoa we find parallel facts. Immense numbers of Amoeba-like creatures, massed together in a framework of horny fibres, constitute Sponge. In the Foraminifera we see smaller groups of such creatures arranged into more definite shapes. Not only do these almost structureless Protozoa unite into regular or irregular aggregations of various sizes, but among some of the more organized ones, as the Vorticellæ, there are also produced clusters of individuals united to a common stem. But these little societies of monads, or cells, or whatever else we may call them, are societies only in the lowest sense: there is no subordination of parts among them--no organization. Each of the component units lives by and for itself; neither giving nor receiving aid. The only mutual dependence is that consequent on mechanical union.|$|E

60|$|Now, compare a plant, thus contemplated, with an animal. In the former, the {{productive}} energy exhausts itself, {{and as it}} were, sleeps in the product or 'organismus'--in its <b>root,</b> <b>stem,</b> foliage, blossoms, seed. Its balsams, gums, resins, 'aromata', and all other bases of its sensible qualities, are, it is well known, mere excretions from the vegetable, eliminated, as lifeless, from the actual plant. The qualities are not its properties, but the properties, or far rather, the dispersion and volatilization of these extruded and rejected bases. But in the animal it is otherwise. Here the antecedent unity--{{the productive}} and self-realizing idea--strives, with partial success to re-emancipate itself from its product, and seeks once again to become 'idea': vainly indeed: for in order to this, it must be retrogressive, and it hath subjected itself to the fates, the evolvers of the endless thread--to the stern necessity of progression. 'Idea' itself it cannot become, but it may in long and graduated process, become an image, an ANALOGON, an anti-type of IDEA. And this [Greek: eidolon] may approximate to a perfect likeness. 'Quod est simile, nequit esse idem'. Thus, in the lower animals, we see this process of emancipation commence with the intermediate link, or that which forms the transition from properties to faculties, namely, with sensation. Then the faculties of sense, locomotion, construction, as, for instance, webs, hives, nests, &c. Then the functions; as of instinct, memory, fancy, instinctive intelligence, or understanding, as it exists in the most intelligent animals. Thus the idea (henceforward no more idea, but irrecoverable by its own fatal act) commences the process of its own transmutation, as 'substans in substantiato', as the 'enteleche', or the 'vis formatrix', and it finishes the process as 'substans e substantiato', that is, as the understanding.|$|E
