5000|$|A <b>rubber</b> <b>septum</b> is an {{engineered}} membrane {{that permits}} transfer of a substance (usually liquid or gas) without contact with air, usually using a syringe with needle.|$|E
50|$|The NMR tube is then usually {{sealed with}} a {{polyethylene}} cap, {{but can be}} flame sealed or sealed with a Teflon 'Schlenk' tap or even a very small <b>rubber</b> <b>septum.</b> Parafilm may be wrapped around the cap to reduce solvent evaporation.|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a system using a high-speed electropneumatic mechanism for the rapid (grab) sampling of dusts and gases during an explosion. The sampling system consists of an aluminum housing that incorporates two 30 -cm 3 preevacuated glass vials with <b>rubber</b> <b>septums.</b> Upon actuation, the sampling probe needle is driven through the septum with a pressurized air pulse, filling the tube with gas and dust from the mine explosion. After a predetermined time, the sampling probe needle is retracted by a second high-pressure air pulse to its normal (quiescent) state, allowing the sampling tube to reseal. The onset and the duration of sampling are independently variable and controlled by a time-delay relay package. This technique enables the monitoring of pyrolysis-charring in coal particles and the generation and combustion of the pyrolysis vapors in both large- and small- scale explosions. The following results were obtained from full-scale dust explosion tests at the Bureau of Mines Lake Lynn Laboratory: (1) Gas sampling of {{the leading edge of}} the flame front shows the large concentration changes, characteristic of the flame front; (2) gas samples taken entirely in the flame zone consist of pyrolysis and combustion products with very low residual oxygen; and (3) the particles collected in the flame zone show signs of extensive pyrolysis and charring...|$|R
40|$|When blood stored In glass vials {{sealed with}} natural rubber 9 eptums was {{screened}} for amphetamine, a contaminant was seen. The contamination origin 9 from the rubber ssptums and was Identified by GC/MS as N-ethylbenzenamlne. Like amphetamine, N-ethylbenzenamlne was extracted from strongly alkalin 9 solutions. N-Ethylb 9149 and amphetamine chromatographed {{with the same}} retention time on 9 packed Aplezon/KOH column and on nonpolar capillary columns. Separation w 9149 achieved on s medium polar capillary column. Trlfluoroac 9 derivatives of amphetamine and N-ethylb 9149149 had the same retention time on 9 packed SP- 2250 column, but separated on nonpolar capillary columns. The amounts of N-ethylbenzenamlne found were high enough to give rise to significant false positive results if N-ethylbenzenamln 9 was erroneously read as amphetamine. N-Ethylbenzensmlne Is believed to be formed by thermal decomposition of the vulcanizing agent zinc ethylphenyldlthiocarbamate used In rubber production.

50|$|Cannulae are hollow {{flexible}} {{tubes of}} varying bore, usually 16-22 gauge thick. They are commonly made {{of stainless steel}} or PTFE for chemical resistance. Stainless steel cannulae are usually 2-3 feet long, due to their relative inflexibility, while PTFE cannulae can be much shorter. The ends are usually sharp and non-coring, allowing them to easily pierce a <b>rubber</b> <b>septum,</b> without being clogged by rubber particles. Flat ends may be chosen on occasion, {{because they tend to}} provide more complete transfer of fluids.|$|E

For each sample, the fluids whose IFT was to be measured were introduced into a capillary tube. The tube was first filled with the denser fluid and then closed with teflon cap having a <b>rubber</b> <b>septum.</b> Then, a drop of the less dense fluid (oil) was injected into the tube through the <b>rubber</b> <b>septum</b> using a syringe. The tube-cap assembly was inserted into the tensiometer slot and screwed firmly in place. Appropriate rotation speed was then adjusted, so that the oil droplet can be suitably elongated. Lastly, the IFT between the two fluids were calculated using a built-in software system.|$|E
40|$|Responses from pheromone-specific {{receptor}} neurones in male Agrotis segetum (Denis & Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) {{were recorded}} in a laboratory wind tunnel. Stimuli were: (1) <b>rubber</b> <b>septum</b> dispensers loaded with single components or a four-component pheromone blend, (2) excised glands from female A. segetum, (3) constrained A. segetum females with extruded glands. Dose-response curves for three neurone-types with different specificity were established. The neurones were specifically tuned to respond to either {{one of the two}} pheromone components (Z) - 5 -decenyl acetate and (Z) - 7 -dodecenyl acetate, or to the behavioural antagonist (Z) - 5 -decenol. In parallel, a behavioural dose-response curve with males flying upwind to a four-component pheromone blend was established. There was a clear correlation between behavioural arrestment of upwind flight and maximum spiking activity in ZS- 10 :OAc-specific neurones.

40|$|For rate {{determinations}} of {{anaerobic metabolism}} {{it is essential}} to maintain strictly anoxic conditions throughout the experiment. However, even if oxygen contamination can be avoided while preparing the incubation containers, it is still possible that the incubation containers themselves contaminate the samples by oxygen diffusing from or through their plastic or rubber components. In this study, we investigated the sources and extent of oxygen contamination during anoxic incubations, and present solutions to minimize oxygen contamination. In particular, we investigated oxygen contamination in Labco® Exetainers, glass vials with a butyl <b>rubber</b> <b>septum</b> in the screw cap, which are frequently used in microbiological experiments. Our results show that significant oxygen contamination occurred at different stages during the incubation. Contamination occurred when Exetainers were either filled or incubated for more than 16. h under oxic atmosphere, but also under an oxygen-free atmosphere due to diffusion of oxygen out of the butyl <b>rubber</b> <b>septum.</b> Therefore, to avoid oxygen contamination during incubations, we suggest (1) filling and incubating the incubation containers under anoxic atmosphere (glove bag) and (2) deoxygenating all elastomers in sample processing and incubation equipment. If initial oxygen contamination cannot be avoided, introduction of an anoxic headspace might help extract oxygen from the incubated sample and present a buffer against oxygen diffusing out of the septum. We modeled the amount of oxygen diffusing out of butyl rubber septa under different conditions, and results fitted well with the observed oxygen contamination. Thus, the model can be used to predict oxygen contamination under varying conditions and for differently sized septa. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

This {{was followed by the}} addition of the degassed benzyl methacrylate (17.04 mmol) (50 % v/v of anisole) such that the mole ratio of [BnMA]:[Initiator]:[CuBr]:[PMDETA] is 1900 / 1 / 1 / 1. The mixture was purged with argon for 15 min. and finally, pentamethyldiethyltriamine ligand (0.01 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred, at 30 ± 1 °C. After the required time, the polymerization was stopped by diluting the reaction mixture with THF. This was followed by precipitation in excess of hexane. It was then redispersed in ~ 5 ml of THF and was centrifuged to remove any homopolymer to obtain the hybrid material, (3). This was then analyzed by TGA, TEM, and GPC (after degrafting the polymer from the surface).|$|E
30|$|After {{treatment}} applications, soils {{were wet}} to field capacity and incubated at 24  °C for 42  days. During this time three leaching events were conducted: at days 7, 21 and 35 after treatment application. At each leaching event, soils were adjusted to field capacity moisture and then eluted {{with half a}} bed volume (approximately 11  mL) of distilled water. Leachate was collected in 20  mL scintillation vials for 2  h post-leaching and then frozen for future analysis of mineral N. Greenhouse gas sampling occurred on 1, 3, 8, 10, 13, 17, 22, 24, 27, 31, 36, 38 and 41  days after treatment application, by placing a <b>rubber</b> <b>septum</b> {{over the top of}} the columns and sampling gas (20  mL) with a gas-tight syringe immediately after capping and 1  h later. Gas samples were injected into pre-evacuated 12  mL Exetainer ® vials (Labco, England) for future analysis. Headspace volumes for each column were measured independently.|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} female sex pheromone of {{the oriental}} beetle, Anomala orientalis Waterhouse, was evaluated {{in the field}} and in a sustained-flight tunnel. In a 2 -wk period, > 150, 000 beetles were captured on three golf course fairways in Connecticut. Contrary to earlier reports that these beetles are most active during the warm, sunny portions of the day, we observed that peak activity occurs around sunset. Ten micrograms of either (Z) - 7 -tetradecen- 2 -one or an 89 / 11 (Z/E) blend on a <b>rubber</b> <b>septum</b> was found to be the minimum concentration with which no significant decrease in catch was observed in the field. There was no discrimination between Z and the blend at 1 μg and higher concentrations, but the E-isomer alone trapped significantly fewer beetles than either Z alone or the blend. These results are consistent with the flight tunnel data. The effects of temperature and light intensity on the mating behavior of A. orientalis also are discusse...|$|E
30|$|The {{anchoring}} of 2 -bromoisobutyric acid, {{which is}} a carboxylic acid based ATRP initiator, to magnetite nanoparticles was performed according to the reported literature [43, 44] to get carboxylic immobilized magnetite-ATRP initiator (6). CuBr (0.070 mmol), PMDETA ligand (0.070 mmol), and 50 mg of magnetite-ATRP initiator (6) were added to a dry Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic pellet and <b>rubber</b> <b>septum.</b> It was degassed using the vacuum line. This {{was followed by the}} addition of the degassed methyl methacrylate (27.86 mmol) (50 v/v of anisole) such that the molar ratio of [MMA]:[Initiator]:[CuBr]:[PMDETA] is 335 / 1 / 1 / 1. Then, the flask was purged with argon, and was stirred in an oil bath, maintained at 30 °C. After the desired time, the polymerization was stopped by opening the septum and diluting the reaction mixture with THF. This was followed by precipitation in excess of hexane (200 ml). The precipitate was redispersed in ~ 5 ml of THF and centrifuged to remove any homopolymer, to obtain the hybrid material, (7). This was characterized by FT–IR, TGA, and GPC analyses.|$|E
40|$|Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) {{is added}} to reformulated {{gasoline}} to meet the 1990 Clean Air Act directives. Widespread use of MTBE in gasoline has resulted in groundwater contamination. Because of its undesirable effects on drinking water and ecologically harmful effects, MTBE removal has become a public health and environmental concern. In this study, we have isolated a mixed bacterial culture which is capable of degrading the MTBE as a sole carbon and energy source. This consortium was developed from mixed urban and petrochemical activated sludge after 4 month's enrichment. Enrichment was conducted in batch reactor, fitted with a screw cap and butyl <b>rubber</b> <b>septum.</b> MTBE concentration was measured in head space by gas chromatography. Degradation was determined by MTBE removal. MTBE biodegradation was depended to Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentration and not affected by the changes in concentration of trace element solution or other stimulator Substances. Degradation rates were nearly 1. 478 mg MTBE h - 1 g - 1 (wet biomass) and didn't change with MTBE concentration (up 500 mg L - 1) ...|$|E
30|$|The PAA-b-PEO-b-PAA triblock {{copolymer}} was synthesized via ATRP of t BA {{initiated by the}} Br-PEO-Br macroinitiator and selective acidolysis of the Pt BA block. Br-PEO-Br (3.09 g, 0.3 mmol) and Cu(I)Br (0.0864 g, 0.6 mmol) were added in a 50 -mL round-bottom flask under argon atmosphere, which was then sealed with a <b>rubber</b> <b>septum.</b> Deoxygenated toluene (8 mL) and t BA monomer (4 mL, 27.6 mmol) were introduced into the flask via an Ar-washed syringe. The mixture was stirred until the Br-PEO-Br macroinitiator was totally dissolved and then three freezing–pump–thaw cycles were performed to remove trace of oxygen in the system. After degassing, 125 μL (0.6 mmol) of PMDETA was injected into the flask using an Ar-washed syringe under continuous stirring until the system became homogeneous. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 6 h, and then the reaction was terminated by rapid cooling in liquid nitrogen. The crude product was dissolved in THF and passed through a basic alumina column to remove the catalyst, and then precipitated in a large excess of ether. The {{triblock copolymer}} Pt BA-b-PEO-b-Pt BA was obtained by drying in vacuum at room temperature (5.2 g, 79 % yield).|$|E
