5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E
2500|$|The cell had two access points: a {{hinged door}} that weighed 500kg (1,100lb) which {{is thought to}} have become {{unusable}} over the years because of its weight, and a metal door, reinforced with concrete and on steel rails that weighed 300kg (650lb) and measured [...] high and [...] wide. It was located behind a shelf in Fritzl's basement workshop, protected by an electronic code entered using a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> In order to reach this door, five locking basement rooms had to be crossed. To get to the area where Elisabeth and her children were held, eight doors in total needed to be unlocked, of which two doors were additionally secured by electronic locking devices.|$|E

An RF RCU has a number of advantages, e. g. when in range, ithas 100 % reliable transmission, it is not sensitive to direction, and it doesnot require a free way to the receiver (i. e. it allows the receiver to be hiddenbehind the TV-set or in a cabinet) ...|$|R

50|$|A D-pad (short for {{directional}} pad or digital pad; {{also known}} as a control pad) is a flat, usually thumb-operated four-way directional control with one button on each point, found on nearly all modern video game console gamepads, game controllers, on the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> of some television and DVD players, and smart phones. Like early video game joysticks, the vast majority of D-pads are digital; in other words, only the directions provided on the D-pad buttons can be used, with no intermediate values. However, combinations of two directions (up and left, for example) do provide diagonals and many modern D-pads can be used to provide eight-directional input if appropriate.|$|R

50|$|Fobs vary {{considerably}} in size, style and functionality. Most commonly they are simple discs of smooth metal or plastic, typically {{with a message}} or symbol {{such as that of}} a logo (as with conference trinkets) or a sign of an important group affiliation. A fob may be symbolic or strictly aesthetic, {{but it can also be}} a small tool. Many fobs are small flashlights, compasses, calculators, penknives, discount cards, bottle openers, security tokens and USB flash drives. As electronic technology continues to become smaller and cheaper, miniature key-fob versions of (previously) larger devices are becoming common, such as digital photo frames, <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> for garage door openers, barcode scanners and simple video games (e.g. Tamagotchi) or other gadgets such as breathalyzers.|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} an evualuation {{of the effectiveness}} of electronic student response technologies (SRT). These wireless systems allow students to key in responses with <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> to questions posed by an instructor in the classroom. Student responses then are displayed in real time, allowing both students and instructors to gauge student comprehension instantaneously. Researchers conducted a multi-faceted assessment of the use of SRT in four sections of a high-enrollment introductory Earth Science course at Penn State University. The assessment included quantitative and qualitative perception data from students enrolled in the course and faculty/administrator visitors to the classroom. Preliminary assessment of the pedagogical merits of SRT in the course suggests that this technology is an effective tool for introductory geoscience education.

5000|$|In August 2013, The Force Awakens cinematographer Daniel Mindel and Episode VIII {{director}} Rian Johnson each {{stated that}} The Force Awakens director J. J. Abrams would use little computer-generated imagery (CGI) and more practical, traditional special effects {{in order to}} recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars film. To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors. Seven BB-8 puppets were constructed for filming. The most prominent was a rod puppet, controlled by puppeteers Dave Chapman and Brian Herring. In addition, there were several radio <b>controlled</b> <b>units</b> and some static prop versions. A full functioning, self-contained robotic unit was not practical for shooting, {{so most of the}} [...] "walking" [...] scenes were achieved by the puppet, with rods removed in post production. Later a self standing <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>unit</b> was constructed and used at promotional events.|$|R

In reality, Whyte is keeping Carl's charred {{body in a}} suspension of oxygenating fluid which keeps his brain functioning. Using Carl's space suit and ARC's cutting-edge prosthetics technology, they build Carl a cyborg body and dub him [...] "Project Frankenstein". The rage program is also installed, with a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> acting as a safeguard. The reanimation initially fails, so researcher Gail Vernon (Lynda Mason Green) disassembles the suit. After the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> is removed, a short circuit causes Carl to suddenly revive. When she tries to reinstall his control unit, he pushes Gail away. She falls onto a control panel, which releases all of the lab monkeys. They attack Gail in a rage and kill her.|$|E
