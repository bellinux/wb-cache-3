40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if participants in chronic disease self-management courses have {{a change of}} perspective of their health status (a response shift), {{and if this is}} measurable with a paper-based questionnaire. METHODS: Nine items were developed to measure potential benefits of self-management courses. These were based on the constructs of a previous questionnaire, the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (HEI-Q). Cognitive interviews elicited spontaneous statements about the reasons for paper-based answers. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of items were calculated using the interview as a relative gold standard. Response shift can be negative (i. e., after the course, participants realize that, before the course, they were worse than they thought they were), positive (i. e., participants now realize they were better than they thought they were), or absent (no change). RESULTS: Interviews (n = 39) reflected that true response shift occurred in approximately half the <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>questionnaire</b> items. Of these, 31 % were negative response shift, 20 % were positive response shift. Response shift was absent in 32 % of replies. Presence or absence of response shift could not be determined in 17 % of replies across items. Significant concordance between questionnaires and cognitive interviews (average overall accuracy 0. 79) indicated that the HEI-Q Perspective questionnaire detects response shift in participants of self-management courses. The questionnaire revealed that 87 % of participants had response shift in at least 1 item. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that preintervention/postintervention assessments of interventions such as self-management courses are confounded by a change in perspective of a large proportion of respondents. It also indicates response shift is a valuable outcome of self-management courses that can be measured with a paper-based questionnair...|$|E

METHOD: Thirty-three college freshmen with low vision were asked <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> <b>to</b> <b>questionnaires</b> regarding experience with, knowledge of, and attitudes toward computer use. The demographic and pathological characteristics of each subject were also described. RESULTS: Nearly half of the students were familiar with computers, but about twenty percent of them entered without any computer experience at all. The longer the students used computers, the more frequently they used them (r= 0. 833, p< 0. 01). Experiences with Word Processor, Presentation, Screen Reader, and Screen Magnifier application significantly increased after eight weeks. The relationship between the visual acuity and assistive technology use was found. The knowledge of and attitudes toward computer usage did not change during two periods...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the many}} methods of {{surgical}} treatment {{that have been}} described for the relief of recurrent dislocation of the patella, {{there is still no}} general agreement on its surgical management, and few long-term follow-up studies have been reported. The present study was undertaken to investigate the natural history of the condition, and to assess the value of some of the operations in current use, and also to assess in particular the long-term results of patellectomy and transplant of the tibial tubercle. CLINICAL MATERIAL Case notes were studied from hospitals in Liverpool, Warrington, Preston and Oswestry. The criteria for inclusion-adequate records and a follow-up period of at least a year-were satisfied in operations on ninety knees in seventy-six patients, and in a further sixteen knees not subjected to operation.

40|$|Appropriate {{technologies}} for small-scale, on-farm grain storage in sub-Saharan Africa are reviewed and assessed {{in the light}} of the current pressures resulting from the liberalisation of grain markets. The study was based on a literature survey of recent storage innovations, visits to countries in the SADC region and <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>questionnaires</b> sent <b>to</b> agriculture ministries and other organisations to ascertain the extent to which improved procedures were being promoted and adopted. The reasons for storage, and the factors which may affect the choice of a particular storage system, are noted. The construction, uses, cost and efficiency of the six main storage methods (drying/storage crib, basket, metal tank, mud block/brick silo, pit and grain bag) are compared and contrasted; some suggestions for improvements are included. The problems with high-yielding, improved varieties of maize are assessed with reference to their retention on the farm. It is concluded that support for small-scale, post-harvest storage projects is justified and necessary, but recommendations should reflect social, agroclimatic and economic issues as well as individual need. In most cases, grain bags would be adequate for supplementing storage capacity...|$|R

Appropriate analogies are made to models in the fields of the arts and science. Research in the 50 states in the period 1980 - 1982 led to the following questions: (1) What are the origins of the synaesthetics movement? (2) What are the objectives of the synaesthetics movement?
