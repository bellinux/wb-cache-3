50|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{operated}} by the US Air Force Space Command provides very accurate timing and frequency signals. A GPS receiver works by measuring the <b>relative</b> <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> of signals from a minimum of four, but usually more, GPS satellites, {{each of which has}} at least two onboard caesium and as many as two rubidium atomic clocks. The relative times are mathematically transformed into three absolute spatial coordinates and one absolute time coordinate.GPS Time (GPST) is a continuous time scale and theoretically accurate to about 14 ns. However, most receivers lose accuracy in the interpretation of the signals and are only accurate to 100 ns.The GPST is related to but differs from TAI (International Atomic Time) and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). GPST remains at a constant offset with TAI (TAI - GPST = 19 seconds) and like TAI does not implement leap seconds. Periodic corrections are performed to the on-board clocks in the satellites to keep them synchronized with ground clocks. The GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPST and UTC. As of July 2015, GPST is 17 seconds ahead of UTC because of the leap second added to UTC on 30 June 2015. Receivers subtract this offset from GPS Time to calculate UTC and specific timezone values.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a tomography perfusion source imaging–based assessment of collateral vessel status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who received intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial reper-fusion therapy after CTP were retrospectively analyzed. In those with middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery occlusion, CT perfusion source imaging was used to identify the <b>relative</b> filling <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> between the normal MCA Sylvian branches and those in the affected hemisphere. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the association of the <b>relative</b> filling <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> with the 24 -hour Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score based on noncontrast CT and the 90 -day modified Rankin Scale score. RESULTS: There were 217 patients treated in 2009 – 2011 who had CTP data, of whom 60 had MCA or ICA occlusion and 55 had 90 -day mRS data.

40|$|Localization of {{acoustic}} sources {{has become}} an important task in many practical applications.

40|$|The {{original}} aim of {{this research}} was to determine the best means of calculating the <b>relative</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> parameter of the Laurenson runoff routing method of flood estimation. Early testing conducted as a part of achieving this end showed that the model could be quite insensitive to the means used to calculate relative delay. Model sensitivity to the means of calculating this parameter had apparently not yet been verified, and if it was insensitive, the best means of calculating the parameter was not required. Hence it was decided to test the thesis that the model was insensitive to the means of calculating the <b>relative</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> parameter. The thesis was tested by applying the model to a range of flood sizes on two catchments using five different means of calculating <b>relative</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time.</b> The differences in model output produced by these delay hypotheses were examined in relation to the average model error. In a number of cases the effects on model performance of these different delay hypotheses were quite small, but in other cases they were quite large.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the matter along the line of sight and in the lens environment on the image configurations, <b>relative</b> <b>time</b> <b>delays,</b> and the resulting models of strong gravitational lensing. The distribution of matter in space and properties of gravitationally bound haloes are based on the Millennium Simulation. In our numerical experiments we consider isolated lens in a uniform universe model and the same lens surrounded by close neighbours and/or objects close to the line of sight which gives four different descriptions of the light propagation. We compare the results of the lens modeling which neglects effects of the environment and line of sight, when applied to image configurations resulting from approaches partially or fully taking into account these effects. We show that for a source at the redshift z= 2 the effects are indeed important and may prevent successful fitting of lens models in a substantial part of simulated image configurations, especially when the <b>relative</b> <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> are taken into account. To have good constraints on the models we limit ourselves to configurations of four images. We consider eighty lenses and large number of source positions in each case. The influence of the lens neighbourhood and the line of sight introduces the spread into the fitted values of the deflection angles which translates into the spread in the lens velocity dispersion of 4 per cent. Similarly for the lens axis ratio we get the spread of 10 per cent and for the Hubble's constant of 6 per cent. When averaged over all lenses and all image configurations considered, the median fitted values of the parameters (including the Hubble's constant) do not differ more than 1 per cent from their values used in simulations.

40|$|We {{develop a}} method for {{determining}} the source direction (θ,φ) and the two waveforms h+(t), h×(t) of a gravitational-wave burst using noisy data from three wideband gravitational-wave detectors running in coincidence. The scheme does not rely on any assumptions about the waveforms and in fact it works for gravitational-wave bursts of any kind. To improve {{the accuracy of the}} solution for (θ,φ), h+(t), h×(t), we construct a near optimal filter for the noisy data which is deduced from the data themselves. We implement the method numerically using simulated data for detectors that operate, with white Gaussian noise, in the frequency band of 500 – 2500 Hz. We show that for broadband signals centered around 1 kHz with a conventional signal-to-noise ratio of at least 10 in each detector we are able to locate the source within a solid angle of 1 × 10 ^- 5 sr. If the signals and the detectors’ band were scaled downwards in frequency by a factor ι, at fixed signal-to-noise ratio, then the solid angle of the source’s error box would increase by a factor ι^ 2. The simulated data are assumed to be produced by three detectors: one on the east coast of the United States of America, one on the west coast of the United States of America, and the third in Germany or Western Australia. For conventional signal-to-noise ratios significantly lower than 10 the method still converges to the correct combination of the <b>relative</b> <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> but it is unable to distinguish between the two mirror-image directions defined by the <b>relative</b> <b>time</b> <b>delays.</b> The angular spread around these points increases as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases.
