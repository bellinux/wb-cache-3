50|$|In economics, <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> {{generally}} are time series summarising movements {{in a group}} of related variables. In some cases, however, <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> may compare geographic areas at a point in time. An example is a country's purchasing power parity. The best-known <b>index</b> <b>number</b> is the consumer price index, which measures changes in retail prices paid by consumers. In addition, a cost-of-living index (COLI) is a price <b>index</b> <b>number</b> that measures relative cost of living over time. In contrast to a COLI based on the true but unknown utility function, a superlative <b>index</b> <b>number</b> is an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> that can be calculated. Thus, superlative <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> are used to provide a fairly close approximation to the underlying cost-of-living <b>index</b> <b>number</b> {{in a wide range of}} circumstances.|$|R

A final section notes some of the recent literature on related aspects of <b>index</b> <b>number</b> theory the construction of indexes when there is seasonality in the underlying data, sources of bias in consumer price indexes, the use of <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> in measuring productivity, the problem of quality change and <b>index</b> <b>number</b> theory that is based on taking differences rather than ratios. <b>Index</b> <b>numbers,</b> stochastic, test and economic approaches to <b>index</b> <b>number</b> theory, hedonic regressions, bilateral <b>index</b> <b>number</b> theory, multilateral <b>index...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper defines and {{discusses}} {{the choices that}} are implicit in alternative approaches to constructing <b>index</b> <b>numbers.</b> The central theoretical result is the exogeneity theorem, which states that an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system possesses certain generally desirable properties, associated with meaningfulness, relevance and consistency {{if and only if}} it admits of a welfare interpretation that is invariant to the data to which it is applied. An <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system that does not permit a fixed welfare interpretation of this kind will fail to possess these properties. Moreover, it will not be possible to undertake meaningful multilateral comparisons between all possible units of comparison to which the <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system may be applied without adopting a metaevaluative criterion that expresses welfare judgments concerning the relation between distinct evaluative standards. Therefore, explicit or implicit normative judgments are inescapable in the construction and use of <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> intended to permit meaningful comparisons over an unrestricted domain. We identify a set of bounds on the <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> that an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system produces (the "generalized within bounds" requirement) which define necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be rationalizable (i. e. to possess a welfare interpretation). However, multilateral <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems that are widely in use violate this and other requirements of the exogeneity theorem. As a result, the <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> they produce do not admit of a welfare interpretation which is invariant to the data to which they are applied, and indeed may not admit of any welfare interpretation at all. The exogeneity theorem establishes that the rationale for "exact" <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems is much less compelling than widely believed. A fixed welfare interpretation is also a necessary and sufficient condition for the path independence of the Divisia index. The theorem therefore establishes a three-way equivalence between desirable properties of continuous <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems, desirable properties of discrete <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems and the existence of a fixed welfare interpretation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{problems}} of measuring economic growth under conditions of high inflation. Traditional bilateral <b>index</b> <b>number</b> theory implicitly assumes that variations {{in the price of}} acommodity within a period can be ignored. To justify this assumption under conditions ofhigh inflation, the accounting period must be shortened to a quarter, a month, or possibly a week. However, once the accounting period is less than a year, the problem of seasonal commodities isencountered; i. e., in some subannual periods, many seasonal commodities will be unavailable and hence the usual bilateral <b>index</b> <b>number</b> theory cannot be applied. The paper systematicallyreviews {{the problems of}} <b>index</b> <b>number</b> construction when there are seasonal commodities and highinflation.
