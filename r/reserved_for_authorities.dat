40|$|The papal penitentiary was {{the highest}} body in the later medieval Church {{concerned}} with matters of conscience. It granted absolution in cases <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> papal <b>authority</b> and issued dispensations and licences that were also a papal monopoly. Requests for these papal favours, where approved by the penitentiary, were recorded in registers, and 150 such registers survive in the Vatican Archives for the pre-Tridentine period. Accessible to researchers only since 1983 they represent a major new body of sources for religious, social and cultural history. This Note shows that they are also important for political and diplomatic history since it presents new evidence from the registers of papal dispensations for four fifteenth-century English royal marriages. The couples in question are Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, and Margaret of York; Edward, prince of Wales, and Anne Neville; Richard, duke of Gloucester (later Richard III), and Anne Neville; Henry Tudor (later Henry VII) and Elizabeth of York. The Note includes an edition of the pertinent entries in the registers and of a letter granting a further dispensation for the marriage of Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; this was issued by a papal envoy to England and is held in the Archives départementales du Nord (Lille). The Note arises from research for a calendar of entries concerning England and Wales in the penitentiary registers to 1503, currently being prepared by the author and Patrick Zutshi for the Canterbury and York Society...|$|R

However, it does not deal with those questions which have been exclusively <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> the medical <b>authorities</b> (e. g. relating to the assessment of disablement). Nor does it consider the few peripheral matters which can only be determined by the Secretary of State. In both of these areas not only are laymen excluded from the decision-making, but also hearings are much less common. There may then be less need for guidance. This article therefore, by examining only those questions faced by S. S. A. T. s, does not seek to deal with other, at times important, issues determined elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of Second World War and its impact in North Africa, {{propaganda}} destined for Arab populations takes multiform aspects: radio, newspapers, leaflets, etc [...] The propaganda conducted by Great Britain through the BBC, making use of the Arabic language, began in 1939. Programmes from Radio London were in fact an answer to German radio propaganda which had great success in North Africa. During the brief war operations in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, from 8 November 1942 to 13 May 1943, this propaganda tried to show and to improve the image of different combatants and to convince Arabs of the justice of their cause. A weekly newspaper published by Great Britain, “Akhbar al Ousbou” (or Weekly Information), was exclusively <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> the governmental <b>authorities.</b> During the North Africa campaign (Torch), the Royal Air Force dropped leaflets in Arabic, trying to explain their war aims and to secure {{the support of the}} population.

40|$|In this Essay, Professor Levine briefly explores Dickerson v. United States, the {{important}} 2000 decision {{in which a}} divided United States Supreme Court held that the standard established in Miranda v. Arizona continues to govern the admissibility of confessions, notwithstanding a federal statute enacted subsequent to Miranda that provided an alternative standard. Levine addresses broader theoretical implications of the approaches adopted by the majority and dissenting opinions in Dickerson. Drawing a parallel to {{the interpretation of the}} Torah in Jewish legal theory, he proposes a comparative framework for analyzing the division between the majority and dissent over the concept and status of a “constitutional rule. ” This Essay finds a similar debate among medieval legal authorities over the status of a rule in the Jewish legal system that appears to function in a manner ordinarily <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> legislation. Some <b>authorities</b> categorize the rule as rabbinic legislation, while others understand the rule as a biblical law with quasi-legislative characteristics. Taking the conceptual comparison a step further, Levine considers ways in which Jewish legal theory might elucidate the nature of the “constitutional rule” delineated in Miranda...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} Day {{decision}} {{through the lens}} of past court decisions and legislation in an effort to understand why the court ruled as it did. Part II introduces Texas’s groundwater resources, current uses of that water, and present concerns regarding sustainability. Part III chronicles the line of cases that established capture as the common law rule in Texas. Part IV traces the history of groundwater legislation after courts established rule of capture. This legislation created a regulatory overlay on the common law rule of capture through localized groundwater conservation districts and the statewide planning process. Part V describes the process through which the Edwards Aquifer Authority came into existence and why it is different from other groundwater districts in the state in that its strict pumping cap immediately raised property rights concerns. Part VI explains how groundwater litigation shifted from right of capture limitations to questions of when ownership vests. This change was a product of increased pressure on groundwater resources caused by additional regulations and growing population demands. Finally, Part VII presents three hypotheses regarding why the court came to its decision in the Day case despite the case law history. The first theory is that delineation of property interests is an issue <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> courts’ <b>authority.</b> Another alternative is that the holding in Day was a result of a statewide shift towards the protection of private property rights above other concerns. The final proposed alternative is that the Day holding was actually an effort to define the property right {{in such a way as}} to encourage more regulation or at least limit takings claims through the expansive of correlative rights to groundwater...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{regulation}} of market mechanisms and {{the implementation of}} economic policies for a fair competition in TEs is a challenging issue. The competition is a complex economic phenomenon that is manifested and characterized by the strength and content that gives to the market economy. In Kosovo specific economic entities, {{in one way or}} another, are tempted to gain as much buyers or markets and create much more profits. The problem is connected with the irregularity. Such behavior and unfair actions are not only damaging the image of the country but are a serious threat the harmonious development of the national economy and the country’s accession process to the EU. The parliament of Kosovo established the Kosovo Competition Authority as an independent institution with special competences to control and fight this negative phenomenon. Based to official data {{it turns out that the}} effectiveness of this institution is not only incomplete but also non-functional. This is because of the “ignorance” and non-adequate treatment that is <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> this <b>authority</b> by the parliamentary and governmental institutions. All this because the members are not elected based to regular procedures and not allocating the necessary financial means to operate. At least so far, the Kosovo Competition Authority was not allowed to hire professionals with clear competences to act and investigate the negative phenomenon of unfair competition. Certainly, this situation does not guarantee effective implementation of laws and quality protection of competition. Therefore, the mobilization of parliamentary and governmental levels is needed to enhance professional capacities and increase their competence in scope of the investigation including cooperation with prosecutors and courts. These actions should be reconsidered with the aim of creating a competitive safe environment for all operators. To conclude, the loyal competition policies and legislative framework should be harmonized in forms and content with the policies and rules of the EU...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{sheds light}} on {{the dark side of}} China’s de facto federalism: the {{weakening}} of individual rights as a cost of economic development, in other words “rights-weakening federalism. ” More specifically it argues that de facto local autonomy in land administration and inter-jurisdictional competition have weakened individual land rights in China. Land laws in China, particularly the basic land institutions, are <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> the national <b>authority,</b> the national legislature in particular. Local governments are supposed to implement national laws without any deviation, but have created a variety of property institutions, ranging from ownership and alienation to eminent domain, in violation of China’s Constitution, Property Law, {{and a number of other}} national laws. These “local government outlaws” are weakening individual rights because interjurisdictional competition benefits industrial investors, which can exercise both the right to exit, or at least threatening to exit, and the right to voice, using Albert Hirschman’s dichotomy. Individual property owners, in contrast, whether urban housing owners or rural farmers, cannot effectively threaten to exit, and nor can they routinely participate in local politics in a non-democratic country. The contrast between a national property law system that endeavors to strengthen individual rights and local government outlaws acting to weaken those rights provides a clear case against the argument that local governments protect individual rights better than the national government...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies botanical {{illustration}} by Canadian women between 1830 and 1930 from three aspects: the gendered history of botany from its beginnings {{as a general}} practice that later turned into a systematized science, botany's colonial agency in Canada, and the influence that garden design had on botanical illustration. A botanical illustration is, on the surface, an intense scientific flower study complete with anatomical details intent on documenting the plant's stages of growth. It is a portrait that {{was thought to be}} an appropriate teaching tool. Executed with proper artistic and observational aptitude, the botanical illustration is a striking piece of artwork. However, the nature of art is often too fluid and subjective for the fixity of science. My intention is to discuss nineteenth-century botanical {{illustration by}} Canadian women in terms of it being a cultural product that both fed female amateur floriculture and horticulture in England and Canada and that offered possibilities to cultivate professional identity more usually <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> men. Women's <b>authority</b> to present the new masculine science of botany was at issue as women were caught in a complex social and scientific network that, on the one hand, encouraged them to teach botany and to produce botanical art while, on the other, restricted them from participating in higher scientific circles necessary for their advancement. As a result, their botanical production was a multivalent reflection of botanical education, of personal relationships with nature, and of colonial circumstances and expectations...|$|R

40|$|We generalize {{standard}} delegation {{models to}} consider policymaking when both information and authority are dispersed among multiple actors. In our theory, the principal may delegate partial authority to a privately-informed agent while also <b>reserving</b> some <b>authority</b> <b>for</b> the prin-cipal’s use after observing the agent’s decision. Counterintuitively, the equilibrium amount of authority delegated to the agent is increasing in the preference divergence between {{the principal and}} agent. We also show {{that the amount of}} authority delegated depends upon whether the agent can observe the principal’s own private information (a condition we refer to as “top-down trans-parency”) : this form of transparency increases the authority that must be delegated to the agent to obtain truthful policymaking. Accordingly, such transparency can result in less-informed pol-icymaking. Nonetheless, the principal will sometimes but not always voluntarily choose such transparency. Finally, we apply the results of the model to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). ∗We gratefully acknowledge multiple helpful conversations with Maggie Penn, the comments and suggestions of three anonymous reviewers, and feedback from seminar audiences at the University of Chicago, the University of Pitts-burgh, and Washington University in St. Louis.
