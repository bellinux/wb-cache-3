A significant proportion of individuals defined as treated reported that they received at least one payout for 2016, but not for 2017. This {{is likely to be}} driven by misreporting, as the nature of the eligibility criteria make it unlikely for SSS <b>receipt</b> <b>status</b> to change dramatically in the short run. In addition, some control individuals may have received SSS payouts, as they reported that they received SSS payouts in 2017 but not 2016.

40|$|Regression {{discontinuity}} (RD) {{designs are}} often interpreted as local randomized experiments: a RD design {{can be considered}} as a randomized experiment for units with a realized value of a so-called forcing variable falling around a pre-fixed threshold. Motivated by the evaluation of Italian university grants, we consider a fuzzy RD design where the receipt of the treatment is based on both eligibility criteria and a voluntary application status. Resting on the fact that grant application and grant <b>receipt</b> <b>statuses</b> are post-assignment (eligibility) intermediate vari-ables, we use the principal stratification framework to define causal estimands within the Rubin Causal Model. We then propose a probabilistic formulation of the assignment mechanism under-lying RD designs, by re-formulating the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) and making an explicit local overlap assumption for a subpopulation around the threshold. A local randomization assumption is invoked instead of standard continuity assumptions. We also de-velop a model-based Bayesian approach to select the target subpopulation(s) with adjustment for multiple comparisons, and to draw inference for the target causal estimands in this framework. Applying the method to the data from two Italian universities, we find evidence that university grants are effective in preventing students from low-income families from dropping out of higher eduction...|$|R

40|$|Background: While {{international}} {{research shows}} that receipt of welfare benefits is associated with poor mental health, less {{is known about the}} relationship between welfare receipt and mental health service use. We investigate whether within-person change in welfare recipient status is associated with change in mental health service use. Methods: Analysis of two waves of data from an Australian national household survey. Random- and fixed-effect models considered the effect of change in welfare <b>receipt</b> <b>status,</b> and assessed whether change in mental health service use differed by type of welfare benefit or the direction of welfare transition. Results: Individuals {{were more likely to report}} greater mental health service use at times of welfare receipt. These associations were attenuated, but remained significant, after adjusting for mental health. Increased health service use was not tied to specific types of welfare benefits. The increase in mental health service use associated with a transition onto welfare benefits was much greater than the decline in service use associated with the transition off benefits. Conclusions: Within individuals, welfare receipt is associated with greater mental health service use. While this does reflect poorer mental health at the time of welfare receipt, other factors seem to facilitate health service use. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Like many OECD {{countries}} New Zealand {{has experienced}} a large {{increase in the number}} of working-age people receiving incapacity benefits in the last 3 decades, despite apparent improvements in population health. This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid's benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25 - 64 year olds by benefit <b>receipt</b> <b>status.</b> Standardised rate differences and rate ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2 % to 5 % of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354 / 100 Â  000 in the 1981 - 84 cohort to 1371 / 100 Â  000 in the 2001 - 04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women standardised rate differences decreased from 954 / 100 Â  000 to 688 / 100 Â  000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4. 27 to 4. 54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid's benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.

30|$|In {{the light}} of the {{findings}} that young beneficiaries are not generally at risk to develop dependency in the limited period of observation but process the experience of repeated and long-term unemployment in different ways, it keeps an open empirical question under which conditions young people’s failure in training or job entry affects their labour supply and further transitions to financial independence. The study cannot give evidence in particular to whether recipients develop dependence in the very long run if they fail to establish in stable employment as young adults. Further theoretical discussion and research on benefits receipt will have {{to address the issue of}} how individual orientations develop and affect transitions to financial independence. Qualitative case studies have already shown that the risk of marginalisation among young beneficiaries in insecure school-to-work transitions is dependent on their interpretation of the given biographical context and their resources for coping (Drilling 2004; Leisering and Leibfried 1999; Ludwig 1996).

However the disparity between the parents' ratings of the children's OQL in the two settings was smaller than that of the social workers. Moreover, the parents' economic status contributed to their own assessments, but not to the social workers'. Their cooperation contributed more to the social workers' assessments than to their own.

The goal {{of this study was to}} examine associations of individual-level determinants of health with sexual risk behaviors and protective factors among a sample of African American female adolescents. African American adolescent females were recruited from sexual health clinics to participate in a cross-sectional survey at 18 months post-participation in a STD/HIV prevention trial. Surveys were administered using Audio Computer Assisted Self Interview (ACASI). Statistical analyses were run to determine associations of protective and sexual risk behaviors with age, education, household income status, sexual history, other contraception use and knowledge of emergency contraception (EC). A total of 410 surveys were included in the analyses. (N= 410; mean age= 19. 06) Almost sixteen percent (n= 65) of participants reported ever using emergency contraception.

Objectives: To conduct a comparative analysis of the expectations of older people from urban, rural, and institutional environments concerning nursing care with respect to the care provided and elements of a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Material and methods: The study comprised 2, 627 individuals above the age of 65 years living in urban (n= 935) and rural (n= 812) areas as well as nursing homes (n= 880). Results: Family care was most often expected both in urban (56. 6 %) and rural (54. 7 %) environments, followed by care provided simultaneously by a family and nurse (urban – 18. 8 %; rural – 26. 1 %) and realized only by a nurse (urban – 24. 6 %; rural – 19. 2 %). Not surprisingly, nursing home residents most commonly expected nursing care (57. 5 %) but 33. 1 % preferred care provided by family or friends and neighbors. In the whole cohort of people living in the home environment (n= 1, 718), those living with family demonstrated willingness to use primarily care implemented by the family (62. 0 %), while respondents living alone more often expected nursing services (30. 3 %). In the logistic regression model, among the respondents living in the city, only the form of care already received determined the expectations for nursing care. Among the respondents living in the county, the presence of musculoskeletal disorders, better nutritional status, and current care provided by family decreased expectations for nursing care. Higher cognitive functioning, symptoms of depression, and living alone increased the willingness to obtain nursing care. Conclusion: Older inhabitants of urban areas, rural areas, and those residing in institutions have different expectations for individual nursing care. Nearly 45 % of seniors living in the community expect to obtain nursing care, while only 1. 6 % do not expect any social or nursing help. While the expectations for the provision of nursing care are significantly increased by living alone, they are decreased by having access to care provided by family. Support for families to take care of elderly relatives would appear to be essential for an effective nursing and social care system.

40|$|Infertility {{has been}} {{identified}} as a highly significant social issue and a public health priority. However, those experiencing infertility are typically thought of and portrayed by the media as middle-class White women and couples seeking medical treatment. In fact, the majority of social science literature regarding infertility has focused on this same population while demographic differences in infertility experiences, particularly by economic status and race, have not been the subject of comprehensive study. Guided by the concepts of stratified reproduction, intersectionality, and an infertility helpseeking framework, this dissertation examined the relationships between economic status, race/ethnicity, and four types of infertility experiences using nationally representative cross-sectional data from the National Survey of Fertility Barriers. The sample is drawn from women who meet the medical definition of infertility of having regular, unprotected sex for twelve months or more without conceiving (N = 2, 443). The literature suggests that infertility may be experienced differently by marginalized groups as they are embedded in classist and racist contexts and that being non-White, with access to fewer economic resources, may have multiplicative effects on women 2 ̆ 7 s infertility experiences, both medical and non-medical. Results indicate that the demographic picture of infertility includes women of all economic statuses and race/ethnicities at similar levels. Furthermore, there are significant relationships between economic status, race/ethnicity, and women 2 ̆ 7 s infertility experiences. Joint effects explain fewer differences in experiences than an index of economic status indicators (income/poverty <b>status,</b> insurance <b>status,</b> <b>receipt</b> of public assistance, and economic hardship). Controlling for various life course, fertility history, and certain predisposing and enabling conditions reduces the differences in infertility experiences between Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. Multivariate results suggested that neither economic status nor its joint effects with race were significantly associated with fertility salience (the thoughts, feelings, and plans infertile women have about having children). However, analyses indicated significant racial differences in certainty of pregnancy intent, importance of motherhood (both higher among Whites) and messages from parents (higher among Blacks and Hispanics than Whites). Economic status explained greater differences in self-perception of infertility and the propensity for medicalized infertility experiences (both outcomes were positively associated with economic status) than did race, with the exception that infertile White women {{were significantly more likely to}} think of themselves as having trouble getting pregnant than infertile Black and Hispanic women. Results indicated no significant joint effects of economic status and race on self-perception and level of medicalized infertility help (i. e. talking with a doctor, testing, and treatment). Finally, no significant economic or racial differences in childlessness distress were found. However, analysis indicated support for hypothesized joint effects in that positive association between economic status and childlessness distress is weaker among White women than among Black women. This final result should be interpreted with caution, however, as this subsample was limited to 295 childless women. This research has important implications for both extending the notion of stratified reproduction as well as broadening our understanding of the demography of infertility. The present findings are useful for both the social sciences/public health and the medical and helping professions focused on addressing unmet needs across the infertile population...|$|R
40|$|Background In Norway {{and other}} western {{countries}} many young people experience labour market integration problems, as demonstrated by high rates of unemployment, sickness, disability and welfare dependence. Factors leading to such problems are complex and not well understood. In particular, there is a knowledge gap in how these problems are related to adolescent health and vulnerability, as such knowledge is needed for the understanding of mechanisms leading to non-inclusion or exclusion from work in young people and how this may be prevented. Many adolescents have chronic diseases, mental health problems and school problems, and their health and well-being is continuously influenced by their family and other close environments. Present knowledge indicates that these determinants are likely to influence adolescents’ risk of work integration problems. Aims The general objective of this thesis was to study work integration problems in young adulthood in relation to adolescent health and vulnerability, from a medical perspective and {{by the use of}} epidemiological methods. The objectives of the different papers were to study the prospective associations between selected health, school and family factors in adolescence (reading and writing difficulties, self-rated health, anxiety and depression symptoms, being a high-school dropout, parental anxiety and depression symptoms and parental benefit receipt and other family factors) and work integration problems in young adulthood, assessed by the receipt of long-term social insurance benefits. Methods The relationship between adolescent factors and work-related outcomes in young adulthood was explored by following a Norwegian population cohort (Young-HUNT 1) of almost 9, 000 subjects for more than 10 years – from adolescence to young adulthood – combining questionnaire data completed between ages 12 and 20 years in 1995 - 97 with information on the long-term receipt of social insurance benefits from 1998 to 2007 / 2008. Adolescent data was linked to register data from several national databases and to data on their biological parents, including parental data from the HUNT 2 Survey (1995 - 97). The main study exposures were based on self-reported information by adolescents (reading and writing difficulties, self-rated health, anxiety and depression symptoms) and parents (parental anxiety and depression symptoms and parental health) and on register data on adolescents (high-school dropout) and parents (parental benefit <b>receipt</b> and socioeconomic <b>status).</b> The main outcome was the receipt of long-term social insurance benefits in young adulthood intended to replace income during unemployment or sickness. Medical benefits included disability benefits, rehabilitation benefits and long-term sickness benefits (received for at least 180 days/six months during one calendar year). All social benefits included medical benefits in addition to unemployment benefits and social assistance (received for at least 180 days/six months during one calendar year). Associations between main study exposures and benefit receipt were explored by descriptive statistics and various logistic regression models, including longitudinal assessments and sibling comparisons. Results In total, 2, 396 (27 %) individuals in the Young-HUNT 1 cohort (n= 8907) received a long-term benefit during follow-up (all social benefits included) and 1, 351 (15 %) individuals received a long-term medical benefit. Patterns of benefit receipt over time and associations with adolescent health measures depended on the type of benefit received (Thesis supplement). Sibling analyses indicated that benefit receipt was clustered within families (Thesis supplement). Self-reported reading and writing difficulties were associated with both medical benefits and all social benefits, including also after adjusting for mental health characteristics (Paper I). Self-rated health was associated with receiving both medical and non-medical benefits and dropping out of high school was strongly associated with receiving medical and non-medical benefits (Paper II). Anxiety and depression symptoms were associated with receiving medical benefits, but not with unemployment benefit (Paper III). Parental symptoms of anxiety and depression, however, were associated with adolescents’ risk of both receiving medical benefits and unemployment benefits (Paper III). Parental medical benefits were associated with an adolescent’s later risk of medical benefits, but the association was substantially reduced when adjusting for family health (Paper IV). Additional findings in Paper IV also indicated that family health, parental education, parental income, divorce, parental unemployment and parental social assistance were independent predictors of young adult medical benefits. Conclusions Work integration problems, assessed by the receipt of long-term social insurance benefits in young adulthood, were experienced at some time in their 20 s by one out of four adolescents in the study cohort. Several specific health-related factors were demonstrated to increase adolescents’ vulnerability to experience such problems in the transition to adulthood. Moderate but consistent associations were found for adolescent self-reported reading and writing difficulties, self-rated health, anxiety and depression symptoms and most family factors, while a strong association was found for highschool drop-out. More research is needed on the causes and pathways of work integration problems in young people {{in order to reduce the}} magnitude of the problem, including research from other disciplines and research with other methodological approaches (e. g. qualitative methods and intervention studies). In addition, policy measures are needed to ensure that young people are given a fair chance to succeed in obtaining necessary qualifications and in working life.

The COntinuous REcording of Lettings and Sales (CORE) is a national information source funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government that records information on social housing lettings and sales in England. Information from CORE is used by a range of organisations to inform funding, regulatory and other policy decisions relating to social housing provider activity and analysis feeds into the wider policy debate on areas such as homelessness, low cost home ownership and welfare reform. Social housing providers also use it to monitor their own lettings and sales, benchmark their performance against other providers, and develop internal policy and strategy. The CORE was introduced in 1989 {{to collect data on}} registered social landlord lettings and sales across England. The recording of registered social landlords supported housing lettings began in 1996. In 2004, CORE was extended to include lettings made by local authorities and now CORE is fairly comprehensive across the social housing sector. In 2011, CORE was extended to include affordable lettings made by social housing providers signed up to the Homes and Communities Agency’s Affordable Homes Programme. CORE records information on both general needs and supported housing lettings. The CORE data has been collected from the 1 st of April 1989. However, the series had first been managed by the National Housing Federation up to the 31 March 1995, and then from the 1 April 1995 it has been administered by Department for Communities and Local Government. Hence, CORE data are currently structured in two distinct series, which are provided through separate applications. The Department for Communities and Local Government require all local authorities to provide data on lettings and CORE forms part of the DCLG’s “Single Data List” (see Documentation section). In addition, the social housing regulator, the Homes and Communities Agency, requires all registered providers to provide data on lettings, and all private registered providers additionally on sales. Registered providers receive reports on their own lettings and sales, as well as their full datasets if they wish. They can also access reports assessing their data quality, which can allow them to identify any database or data entry issues. The online analysis tools allow them to benchmark their data against provider(s) of their choice, so that they can look at similar sized organisations working in similar demographic or geographic areas. CORE data focuses on the household profile, financial information, property characteristics and tenancy or sale details at the point of letting or sale. Data are collected through tenant or buyer interviews, housing application forms and from existing in-house computer records. Providers either enter data directly into the central database via an online tool, or upload a data extract from their housing management computer system. The questions on the household members (tenants or purchasers) are not mandatory, since some providers are unable to provide this information, and some household members do not wish to answer individual questions. For private providers, these questions are mostly completed; but for local authorities there tends to be a much bigger gap of data on the household members. All data are provided on an anonymised basis. The CORE datasets cover lettings made by private social housing providers and local authorities who are registered with the Homes and Communities Agency, which regulates social housing providers. As specified previously, data are considered comprehensive on the private provider side, but not comprehensive on the local authority side. Although the majority of local authorities are providing data, a few are yet to come on-board, and therefore the DCLG publish weighted figures for CORE each Autumn to estimate for the small gap in provision. CORE data is collected on a continuous basis between the 1 April and the 31 March of each year. The following provides a summary of available CORE data&# 58; For registered social landlords General Needs lettings – from 1989 Supported Housing lettings – from 1996 Sales – from 1989 Affordable Rent – from August 2011 For local authorities General Needs lettings – from 2004 Supported Housing lettings – from 2004 Affordable Rent – from April 2012 Data are provided on a regular basis (usually monthly) by registered providers. The data are validated and data are available from the CORE website. Annual datasets (based on a year of April to March) are published in September following the year end and weighted data in late Autumn. Providers aim to provide complete data on their lettings. However, {{it is important to note}} that it is possible that data on some lettings are never provided, and to note that a few local authorities are not yet participating in CORE. CORE only records new and permanent general needs lettings. Therefore mutual exchanges, successions and assignments are excluded. Temporary lettings are only included if a household moves into supported housing (see the Documentation section). The definition of supported housing was changed in 2004. Therefore longitudinal analysis of general needs and supported housing lettings over this period will be difficult. The questions in the CORE log may be amended each year so please ensure that you have the correct CORE log to go with your CORE dataset. Generally, CORE data quality is high but there are some issues to take into account depending on the type of CORE data that you use&# 58; Questions on the household members are optional, which allows for those organisations who are unable to collect information directly from the tenants, and for tenants to refuse to answer specific questions if they so wish. Some of the questions rely on using a consistent definition from the CORE manual (for example what is and what is not a major repair) and so there may be some discrepancy in the recording of certain questions between landlords. Some local authorities do not participate, or do not fully participate, in CORE. Please bear in mind that any output of your analysis using local authority data may reflect a participation effect. Some local authorities have been given specific dispensations in the past, such that their data may be incomplete for particular data items. More information, including a data dictionary, is available from&# 58; [URL] The UK Data Service holds CORE data from 2007 - 2008 onwards&# 58; SN 7604 Continuous Recording of Social Housing Lettings and Sales SN 7603 Continuous Recording of Social Housing Lettings and Sales&# 58; Special Licence Access Research Usage and Linkage CORE provides an invaluable source of information about new tenancies and tenants, and about private social housing provider sales and buyers. More specifically, CORE collects data on type of tenancy, household characteristics, economic status, ethnicity, primary reason for housing, source of referral, homelessness <b>status,</b> <b>receipt</b> of housing benefits, and previous tenure of occupant. In addition, since information regarding housing costs is also recorded, broad assessments of housing affordability are also possible. CORE provides central government (Department for Communities and Local Government) with an essential evidence base for monitoring and developing government policy, in particular to assess who is accessing social housing and their associated tenancy and property details. For example, CORE has been used extensively to develop DCLG’s understanding of how social housing allocations are being made and to inform policies on affordable home ownership and welfare reform. It is also used to answer Parliamentary Questions and information on the characteristics of tenants entering social housing is published by the Department through a series of Live Tables. CORE data provides the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) with a better understanding of the socio-economic and demographic makeup of affordable housing customers by tenure. The income and housing costs data allows the HCA to consider affordability levels by tenure. Migration between tenures and areas can also indicate where there is differing demand. This analysis contributes to understanding local housing markets and affordable housing products. The breadth of CORE also allows it to be used for a wide range of research purposes. In the past it has been used to assess the impact of choice based lettings systems, analyse the economic activity of households that were homeless before taking a tenancy, generate profiles of households moving into social housing and evidence patterns of low demand in social housing. With the introduction of more flexible tenancy types through the recently introduced Localism Bill, CORE will be an invaluable tool at assessing the new flexible offers and uptake by tenants from 2012. CORE data cannot be linked to any other data sources. However, each letting recorded in the CORE data also includes the full postcode for the property. The full postcode will not usually be made available, but this enables a wide range of geographic identifying variables to be added. Previous work that has made use of this facility includes the addition of Census Output Areas (OAs) making it possible to add data from the 2001 Census. This has enabled detailed analysis including the proportion of socially rented properties in an OA and the proportion of ethnic minorities and has been used to assess housing preferences of individuals. In addition, the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is released using Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) which can be linked to OAs. This has made it possible to link IMD data from 2001, 2004 and 2006 to the CORE lettings providing neighbourhood context information for the lettings and used to investigate whether social housing reinforces patterns of disadvantage for vulnerable people. </div...|$|R
