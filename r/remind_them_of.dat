5|$|Twilight sadly {{returns to}} the library, {{preparing}} to pack and leave Ponyville, when she finds Spike coughing up scroll after scroll. Twilight is surprised to find these to be the friendship report letters that she had previously sent to Celestia, and the memories of her friendships in Ponyville make her regain her color. Inspired by this, she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> their friendship, cancelling Discord's magic and returning them to normal.|$|E
5|$|The polyptych was {{commissioned}} to provide both comfort and {{warning to the}} dying. It was intended to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> their faith, and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed {{within sight of the}} altarpiece for those too ill to walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only two patients per bed, luxurious at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.|$|E

25|$|In Buddhist practice, humility {{is practiced}} {{in a variety}} of ways. For example, Japanese Soto Zen monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> the {{connection}} of the monk's robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This in itself is a practice of humility.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the number}} of {{proficient}} speakers of Occitan is dropping precipitously. A tourist in the cities in southern France is unlikely to hear a single Occitan word spoken on the street (or, for that matter, in a home), {{and is likely to}} only find the occasional vestige, such as street signs (and, of those, most will have French equivalents more prominently displayed), to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> the traditional language of the area.|$|E
25|$|The lynchers {{sometimes}} murdered their victims, {{but sometimes}} whipped them to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> their former status as slaves. White terrorists often made night-time raids of African-American homes {{in order to}} confiscate firearms. Lynchings to prevent freedmen and their allies from voting and bearing arms were extralegal ways of trying to enforce the previous system of social dominance and the Black Codes, which had been invalidated by the 14th and 15th Amendments in 1868 and 1870.|$|E

25|$|Groups {{such as the}} Tolpuddle Martyrs {{would often}} use a {{skeleton}} painting {{as part of their}} initiation process. The newest member would be blindfolded and made to swear a secret oath of allegiance. The blindfold would then be removed and they would be presented with the skeleton painting. This was to warn them of their own mortality but also to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> what happens to those who break their promises. An example of this skeleton painting is on display at the People's History Museum, Manchester.|$|E
25|$|There {{was more}} {{discussion}} about the Army’s stance over Home Rule outside the Army than within it. Seely spoke to the assembled Commanders-in-Chief of the Army's six Regional Commands, to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> their responsibility to uphold the civil power. They met at the War Office on 16 December 1913 with French and the Adjutant-General Spencer Ewart present. He assured them that the Army would not be called upon for “some outrageous action, for instance, to massacre a demonstration of Orangemen”, but nonetheless officers could not “pick and choose” which lawful orders they would obey, and that any officer who attempted to resign on the issue should instead be dismissed. This did not stop tensions about the Army's role from growing.|$|E
25|$|This did {{not prevent}} the British consul from making contact with the rebels to warn them about French {{intentions}} and <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> the friendly ties between Britain and the Ottoman Empire, which counted for much with a population hoping for an Ottoman intervention to persuade the Bey to reduce his demands. At the same time, despite his instruction, De Beaval sought to use the crisis to strengthen France's role in the country. He made contact with Ben Gedhahem and assured him that {{the aim of the}} French warships was to support his demands and that he was seeking to secure the dismissal of the Grand Vizier. Led by De Beauval, the French Foreign Minister Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys backed his approach and even considered replacing Sadok Bey himself if circumstances allowed. On 29 a June a column of 3,000 soldiers in Algeria was moved up to the Tunisian border in readiness for any eventuality. However the rebel leader ignored these overtures and forwarded the French letters to Khaznadar, who passed them on to the British. The resulting scandal was such that De Beauval was forced to leave the country in January 1865.|$|E

25|$|Owain {{also scored}} {{his first major}} victory {{in the field in}} May or June, at Mynydd Hyddgen near Pumlumon. Owain and his army of a few hundred were camped {{at the bottom of the}} Hyddgen Valley when about fifteen hundred English and Flemish {{settlers}} from Pembrokeshire ('little England beyond Wales'), charged down on them. Owain rallied his army and fought back, killing 200. The situation was sufficiently serious for the King to assemble another punitive expedition. This time he attacked in October through central Wales. From Shrewsbury and Hereford Castle, Henry IV's forces drove through Powys toward the Strata Florida Abbey. The Cistercian house was known to be sympathetic towards Owain and Henry intended to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> their loyalties and prevent the revolt from spreading any further south. After much harassment by Owain's forces he reached Strata Florida. Henry was in no mood to be merciful. His army partially destroyed the abbey and executed a monk suspected of bearing arms against him. However, he failed to engage Owain's forces in any large numbers. Owain's forces harassed him and engaged in hit-and-run tactics on his supply chain but refused to fight in the open. Henry's army was forced to retreat. They arrived at Worcester on 28 October 1401 with little to claim for their efforts. The year came to end with the Battle of Tuthill, an inconclusive battle fought during Owain's siege of Caernarfon Castle on 2 November 1401.|$|E

500|$|Christiane Schönfeld writes that, [...] "(t)he Jew {{as sexual}} beast and vampire, sucking the life spirit from {{individual}} and community alike is an {{all too common}} motif in anti-Semitic propaganda and is put to effective use in Harlan's film." [...] Michael Töteberg writes: [...] "(Jud Süß) openly mobilized fears and sexual aggression and exploited them for anti-Semitic incitement." [...] According to Michael Kater, the film was shown to [...] "a large number of (German) girls" [...] in order to warn them of the [...] "sexual devastation that Jews had wrought in the past" [...] and to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935. In an interview with Der Film given before {{the release of the}} film, Harlan pointed out that Süß was ultimately sentenced to death not for his financial machinations which were technically legal but for violating an ancient law which prohibited Jews from having sexual relations with Christian women. He then cites this as being [...] "an interesting parallel to the Nuremberg Laws.|$|E

500|$|The Kampung Boy is an autobiography. [...] Its author, Lat, {{grew up in}} a kampung {{and moved}} to the city after graduating from high school. [...] He worked there as a crime {{reporter}} and drew cartoons to supplement his incomea hobby he had started at the age of nine. [...] Lat became the column cartoonist for his newspaper after impressing his editors with his cartoons on the bersunat. [...] He was sent to London to study at St Martin's School of Art and on returning to Malaysia in 1975, he reinvented his column, Scenes of Malaysian Life, into an editorial comic series. [...] It proved popular and as Lat's fame grew, he began questioning his city lifestyle and reminiscing about his life in the kampung. [...] Lat felt he and his fellow citizens had all forgotten their village origins and wanted to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> that. [...] He began working on The Kampung Boy in 1977, conceptualising and drawing the scenes when he was not drawing Scenes of Malaysian Life. [...] His labour came to fruition in 1979 when Berita Publishing Sendirian Berhad released The Kampung Boy on the Malaysian market.|$|E

2500|$|White devoted {{himself more}} than ever to his {{teaching}} {{in order to take}} his mind off of these problems. He rarely photographed during this period, and many of his colleagues were similarly affected. Perhaps because they longed for something to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> how things were before the war, White and Stieglitz gradually reconciled many of their differences. This was the only half-way bright spot in an otherwise difficult period. In 1923 White wrote to Stieglitz, saying [...] "I understand that [...] Seeley is doing nothing; Coburn likewise; Day sick in bed. I do not know whether I can again do anything, but I hope someday to try." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sí TV was {{launched}} as a cable network on February 25, 2004, {{becoming the first}} exclusively English-language cable channel catering to the Latino community. It became a bicultural alternative to Spanish-language networks such as Univision and Telemundo. According to Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club, the channel is marketed toward audiences who [...] "enjoy a Spanish flavor without all the actual Spanish". Sí TV's target audience of young adults aged 18–34 are [...] "presumably those who have long since assimilated into American convention", and who [...] "don't necessarily have any particular fealty {{to the sort of}} programming that goes to great lengths to <b>remind</b> <b>them</b> <b>of</b> their heritage – unlike their first-generation parents or grandparents". Within three months of its launch, Sí TV had seven million subscribers nationwide.|$|E
