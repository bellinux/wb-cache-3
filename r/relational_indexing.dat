A composition approach to designing animations based on the Animation Processing Model was developed as a principled alternative to prevailing approaches. It provides learners with pre-decomposed material that is structured and sequenced to facilitate the relation building required for effective mental model construction. Study of a compositional animation that presented material in a contiguous fashion resulted in higher quality mental models of a pianomechanism than non-contiguous or control (conventional) versions. Relation building required to link pre-decomposed material was investigated with eye movements data analysis: a <b>relational</b> <b>index</b> measure was devised and used to asses mental model construction.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} recognizing 3 D objects from 2 D intensity images. It describes the object recognition system named RIO (<b>Relational</b> <b>Indexing</b> of Objects), which contains {{a number of new}} techniques. RIO begins with an edge image obtained from a pair of intensity images taken with a single camera and two dierent lightings. From the edge image, a set of new high-level features and relationships are extracted, and a technique called <b>relational</b> <b>indexing</b> is used to eÆciently recall 2 D view-class object models that have similar relational descriptions from a potentially large database of models. Once a model has been hypothesized, pairs of 2 D- 3 D corresponding features, including point pairs, line-segment pairs, and ellipse-circle pairs are used in a new linear pose estimation framework to produce a hypothesized transformation from a 3 D mesh model of the object to the image. The transformation is either accepted or rejected by a veri cation procedure that projects the 3 D model wireframe to the image and computes a Hausdor-like distance measure between the projected model and the edge image. The resultant object recognition system is able to recognize 3 D objects having planar, cylindrical, and threaded surfaces in complex, multi-object scenes. 2 (a) Polyhedral object (b) Non-polyhedral object Figure 1 : a) Image of a polyhedral object whose junctions and line segments make useful features for recognition and pose estimation. b) Image of a nonpolyhedral object for which line segments and junctions alone are virtually useless as recognition features. ...|$|E

Instead of using simple keywords as an indexing language, we propose to use star-graphs as document descriptors. A star-graph is a conceptual graph that contains a single relation, with some concepts linked to it. They are elementary pieces of information describing combinations of concepts. We use stargraphs as descriptors - or index terms - for image content representation. This allows for <b>relational</b> <b>indexing</b> and expression of complex user needs, in comparison to classical text retrieval, where simple keywords are generally used as document descriptors.

40|$|Self-tuning is a {{cost-effective}} and elegant {{solution to the}} important problem of configuring a database to {{the characteristics of the}} query load. Existing techniques operate in an off-line fashion, by choosing a fixed configuration that is tailored to a subset of the query load. The generated configurations therefore ignore any temporal patterns that may exist in the actual load submitted to the system. This demonstration introduces COLT (Continuous On-Line Tuning), a novel self-tuning framework that continuously monitors the incoming queries and adjusts the system configuration in order to maximize query performance. The key idea behind COLT is to gather performance statistics at different levels of detail and to carefully allocate profiling resources to the most promising candidate configurations. Moreover, COLT uses effective heuristics to regulate its own performance, lowering its overhead when the system is well-tuned, and being more aggressive when the workload shifts and it becomes necessary to re-tune the system. We present a specialization of COLT to the important problem of selecting an effective set of <b>relational</b> <b>indices</b> for the current query load.
