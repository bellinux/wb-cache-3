40|$|The {{resemblance}} nominalist {{says that}} the truthmaker of 〈Socrates is white〉 ultimately involves only concrete particulars that <b>resemble</b> each other.

I shall argue that the resemblance nominalist can say that those conjunctions have the same truthmakers but these truthmakers make them true in different ways. I shall also use this view to account for the truthmakers of propositions like 〈Socrates is white〉, and respond to previous objections by Cian Dorr and Jessica Wilson...|$|R
