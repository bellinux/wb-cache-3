2500|$|Used for lighter hauling tasks, such as setting staysails and jibs or when simply hauling in {{the slack}} of a <b>rope.</b> The <b>action</b> {{is that of}} tugging {{alternately}} with each hand, on each beat.|$|R
50|$|The {{performances}} {{are made up}} of different disciplines, each Kapa Haka team are required to perform six disciplines within their performance piece - whakaeke (a choreographed entry), mōteatea (traditional chant), poi (light ball swung {{on the end of a}} <b>rope),</b> waiata-ā-ringa (<b>action</b> song), haka and whakawātea (exit). They must perfect every discipline in a polished 25-minute performance.|$|R
50|$|In this side-scrolling platformer, {{the player}} {{controls}} Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, {{as well as}} swing from a <b>rope</b> during <b>action</b> sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into {{the plot of the}} film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.|$|R
60|$|Then for a {{while he}} would hold her with his eyes, so that her feet seemed rooted to the ground, till at length it was as though he cut a <b>rope</b> by some <b>action</b> of his will and set her free, and, choked with wrath and blind with tears, Benita would turn and run from him as from a wild beast.|$|R
50|$|The Niskin bottle is a {{development}} of the Nansen bottle patented by Shale Niskin in March 1966. Instead of a metal bottle sealed at one end, the 'bottle' is a tube, usually plastic to minimize contamination of the sample, {{and open to the}} water at both ends. Each end is equipped with a cap which is either spring-loaded or tensioned by an elastic <b>rope.</b> The <b>action</b> of the messenger weight is to trip both caps shut and seal the tube. A reversing thermometer may also be carried on a frame fixed to the Niskin bottle. Since there is no rotation of the bottle to fix the temperature measurement, the thermometer has a separate spring-loaded rotating mechanism of its own tripped by the messenger weight.|$|R
50|$|The same year, Frank {{would also}} fight a {{controversial}} bout with Carlson Gracie BJJ black belt Allan Goes. The Brazilian illegally eye-gouged Shamrock while {{on his back}} without the referee noticing, and also refused to release a rear naked choke despite Shamrock using a <b>rope</b> escape, an <b>action</b> which finally gained him a yellow card. On the other hand, Frank retaliated by breaking his leg with a heel hook. Both fighters ended the match with a point lost, and it was ruled a draw despite Goes's penalization.|$|R
5000|$|Born in 1834 in New York City, Jones {{was still}} living in the state of New York when he joined the Navy. He served in the Civil War as a {{quartermaster}} on the [...] Stationed at the ship's wheel during the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864, the wheel was rendered useless when the ropes which connected it to the tiller were destroyed by hostile fire. Although wounded, Jones helped send and receive signals before installing new wheel <b>ropes.</b> For this <b>action,</b> he was awarded the Medal of Honor four months later, on December 31, 1864.|$|R
5000|$|Edward Ormerod {{developed}} and patented the [...] "Ormerod" [...] safety link or detaching hook, known in mining circles as a [...] "butterfly". This elegant device was {{inserted into the}} winding rope {{in such a way}} that if the lift cage was accidentally overwound the link would be pulled into a bell through which the winding <b>rope</b> passed. This <b>action</b> would not only disconnect the cage from the winding rope but also prevent the cage from falling back down the shaft. The device was patented in 1867 and is manufactured today. It is believed that the lives of many miners have been saved by its use and it has never failed in service.|$|R
50|$|The {{new class}} had two funnels, a long fo'c'sle {{and a tall}} bridge which, unusually, was located behind the break in the main deck. Following {{consultations}} with sea-going officers, a number of novel features were included, principally to enhance sea-keeping capabilities in rough weather and battle-worthiness in night action. Consideration was given to having a well-deck forward of the bridge with an additional pair of torpedo tubes, in the fashion of contemporary German ocean-going torpedo boats, but this arrangement was rejected {{because it would be}} detrimental to ship handling in rough weather. The design had a heavily raked stem and sheer forward, a slight turtleback on the fo'c's'le deck, and a rounded bridge front, intended to deflect waves. Two single 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted under the bridge on single rotating mounts port and starboard, intended to be fired directly by the commanding officer with toggle <b>ropes</b> during night <b>actions,</b> and the searchlight was relocated aft, mounted on top of the aft torpedo tubes (this to avoid the bridge officers being blinded by its glare during night actions). The single 18-inch torpedo tubes proved to be of little use, and were soon removed in the majority of vessels as a weight-saving measure (only Tara, Tintagel and Trojan retained theirs).|$|R
500|$|Rachel Saltz of The New York Times reviewed, [...] "The {{pleasure}} {{principle is}} palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying {{example of the}} new, thoroughly modern Bollywood. It may represent the newfangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs." [...] Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter said, [...] "Dhoom 2 has all {{of the benefits of}} a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world cinema, but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse." [...] L.A. Weeklys David Chute stated the film was, [...] "A movie meal as satisfying as this one can make you feel that nothing else matters." [...] Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing [...] "By <b>roping</b> in acclaimed <b>action</b> director Alan Amin {{to take care of the}} thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial." [...] Manish Gajjar, Bollywood Correspondent for BBC Shropshire said, [...] "With its high-powered action sequences matching Hollywood standards, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way at the box office!" ...|$|R
