40|$|Oculokinetic perimetry is a {{new method}} of visual field {{assessment}} in which the patient moves the eye around a central static target to look sequentially at an array of numbers. When fixation on a number is accompanied by disappearance of the central target, that number is deleted from a <b>recording</b> <b>chart.</b> Inversion of the <b>recording</b> <b>chart</b> gives a plot of the central visual field. In this study we have shown that in 64 eyes of 37 patients, with unequivocal field loss attending a glaucoma clinic, the test is efficient and reliable when compared with conventional static (Dicon 3000) and kinetic (Tübingen Oculus) field tests. The results were identical in 88 % of eyes tested and approximately comparable in another 6 %. Quantitative equivalent targets for the different methods are described.

40|$|A self-recording water-stage or {{rainfall}} gauge exposed {{under the}} severe meteorologicalconditions {{for several years}} has sometimes troubles in the accuracy of time. These troubles are aptto cause fundamental faults in hydrological researches especially in a small or urbanized watershed. In order to mitigate the influence of such troubles, we have developed a device to recordrainfall data simultaneously on self-recording charts of a water gauge without the fundamentalremodeling of the water gauge. Four types of the device are introduced in this paper. Types A and B are both mono-response style to the signal from a tipping backet rain gauge,but the former records the signal in {{one side and the}} latter in both sides to the base line. Types Cand D are both response-cumulating style, but the former is used for a water gauge with the one-scale type of <b>recording</b> <b>chart</b> and the latter for two-scale type.

40|$|Typical {{recorders}} {{commonly used}} now in Japan to record low speed phenomena have chart speeds of several centimeters per hour. These chart speeds are convenient to see daily variations such as earth tides, {{but are not}} adequate {{for the purpose of}} glancing the variations of longer periods. In order to see directly the secular variations of very slowly progressing phenomena such as crustal movements, a recording system which has ultra-low chart speed (several cm/month) and ultra-low frequency characteristics was developed. The method adopted here is to plot the sum of the data which was sampled in the past 24 hours, while the recorder is driven intermittently. The features of this system are as follows: (1) Owing to its ultra-low chart speed, we can directly see the progress of the phenomena within a few days or a few months. This may offer useful information for the short period earthquake prediction. (2) Owing to its ultra-low frequency characteristics, we can pick up the signals which are buried in daily disturbances of large amplitudes. (3) Owing to the durability of the <b>recording</b> <b>chart,</b> we can be free from frequent maintenance of the system. (4) As the system is constructed by use of a microprocessor, we will be easily able to correspond to future demands such as improvement of the data-smoothing algorithm...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} detect {{temporal}} {{variations in the}} amplitude and phase of earth tidal tilts, in rela-tion to crustal deformations, horizontal pendulum and water-tube tiltmeters with electromagnetic transducers have been newly designed. The horizontal pendulum tiltmeter has a pendulum of 2. 6 kg weight, with a free period of about 6 sec and the mechanical amplification factor of about 45. A differential transformer {{is used as a}} transducer. The water-tube tiltmeter consists of three detectors, which are located at the vertices of a triangle and connected by vinyl chloride tubes. Each detector has a float of glass, and its displacement in accordance with the level change of the water surface is detected by a magnetic sensor. Two components of the horizontal pendulum tiltmeters and one set of the water-tube tiltmeter were installed in December 1975 and July 1976, respectively, in the observation vault of the Kami-takara Crustal Movement Observatory (36 ° 17 °N, 137 ° 20 'E, H= 800 m) and the observations have been continued since that time. The overall sensitivities of two kinds of tiltmeters are 4 "x 10 - 4 and 3 " x 10 - 4 /mm on the <b>recording</b> <b>chart,</b> respectively. In this paper, the structures, principles and calibration techniques of these instruments are described, and some preliminary results from tidal analyses of the tiltmeter records are also pre-sented. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study proposes and {{develops}} a new method of recording the working processes of choreographers. Whilst conventional recording methods, such as notes and video / audio-taping, have been employed in previous similar research, {{a search for}} a recording method unique to this part of the choreographic process has been overlooked. Consequently, the methods used by choreographers to create dances within the context of rehearsals, have remained under-explored. Proceeding empirically and employing the precepts of ethnography as a guide, this investigation examines the working methods of six professional choreographers in rehearsal. The six choreographers are Robert North, Richard Alston, Micha Berghese, Ian Spink, Edgar Newman and Emlyn Claid. The study is characterized by datagathering procedures which both derive and evolve from the day-to-day observation of rehearsals. From the initial stage of recording in which notes and diagrams are employed as data-gathering tools, a range of choreographic activities are isolated, codified, classified and finally systemized into a tabulated format for use during rehearsals. This chart serves to eliminate the need for both notes and the more intrusive recording tools such as cameras and tape recorders, and allows the researcher to capture not only every choreographic activity but also a sense of the progression of the creative process. The thesis describes the evolution of research procedure and the modification of focus which occurred {{during the course of the}} investigation, the systemization of observation and recording, the development of the new recording method from its initial forays into codification through eight versions of the <b>recording</b> <b>chart,</b> and documents and analysis the notes and the changes implemented during the development of the chart. The new recording method is intended to form the basis for further research into the choreographic process, but might be used, as it stands, as an aid in the teaching of choreography students...|$|E

Espécimes como: 1) Discos monolíticos de VM 7 (n= 40), 2) VM 7 +agente cimentante (n= 20), 3) VM 7 +agente cimentante+NG 10 (n= 320), e 4) V 9 /YZ+agente cimentante+NG 10 (n= 320) foram confeccionados e testados em compressão após 24 h, 1 mês, 3 e 6 meses de armazenagem em meio úmido. O grupo 3) foi avaliado sob efeito de fadiga cíclica, aplicando-se o 60 % do valor da carga de fratura do teste estático. A porosidade (%) presente na camada de cada agente cimentante quando interposto no conjunto cerâmica-NG 10 foi semelhante foi semelhante após aplicação da carga de fratura estática e cíclica. A união adesiva das estruturas cerâmicas ao substrato análogo à dentina influenciou no comportamento à fratura dos conjuntos formados pela porcelana V 7.

The {{aim of this}} research was 1) to investigate the porosity (%) of resin cements (RC) when adhesively bonded to a ceramic material and a dentin analog material (NG 10); 2) determine the fracture load of a porcelain (VM 7), a polycrystalline framework ceramic (YZ), and a YZ veneered with a porcelain (VM 9) bonded to NG 10; 3) determine the fatigue lifetime of the ceramic-RC-NG 10 assemblies; and 4) determine the mode of failure and the initial defect size of ceramic structures after compression and fatigue testing. 1) VM 7 monolithic disks (V 7) (n= 40), 2) VM 7 +RC (V 7. RC) (n= 20), 3) VM 7 +RC+NG 10 (V 7. RC. NG 10) (n= 320), and 4) VM 9 /YZ+RC+NG 10 (V 9 /YZ. RC. NG 10) (n= 320) were built up, wet aged for 24 h, 1 month, 3 and 6 months, and tested under compression test. The compressive force required to cause fracturing was recorded in Newtons (N). The following RC were used: Panavia F (PF), Variolink II low (VLL) and {{high viscosity}} (VLHV) and Rely X U 100 (RU). V 7 groups were subjected to compressive fatigue loading. At both tests, the crosshead movement was stopped when the first discontinuity appeared in the <b>recording</b> <b>chart,</b> indicating early crack formation.

The fracture compressive values were higher for YZ than for V 7, even independently of dentin bonding. All the YZ assemblies’ fractures occurred within the veneering layer during the fatigue test. There was {{a significant difference between the}} survival rates of the complexes during the fatigue test.
