60|$|By sunset, Minnie {{began to}} rave, softly, babblingly, like a child. Duncan's face grew haggard {{as he watched}} and listened, while in his mind he <b>revolved</b> <b>plans</b> of how best to end the hours of agony that were coming. And, so planning, as they rose on a larger swell than usual, he swept the circle of the sea with his eyes, and saw, what made him cry out.|$|R
60|$|Werper had not {{succeeded in}} {{arranging}} to tent with Mohammed Beyd, {{and so he}} <b>revolved</b> many <b>plans</b> for {{the assassination of the}} Arab that would have been greatly simplified had he been permitted to share the other's nightly shelter.|$|R
50|$|During the Cold War British and American air defences <b>revolved</b> around <b>plans</b> to stop massed Soviet bomber streams, {{leading to}} the US fielding nuclear tipped Nike missiles, and {{at a later date}} the British {{equipping}} trainers as interceptors in order to have enough fighters.|$|R
60|$|My {{soul was}} filled, then, {{with a gentle}} yearning pity for Pogson, and <b>revolved</b> many <b>plans</b> for his rescue: none of these seeming to be practicable, at last we hit on the very wisest of all, and {{determined}} to apply for counsel to no less a person than Major British.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your wife {{might be}} among them," [...] {{suggested}} the Belgian, for {{since he had}} again come into possession of the pouch he had become fearful and suspicious of the ape-man, and in his mind had constantly <b>revolved</b> many <b>plans</b> for eluding this giant Englishman, who was at once his savior and his captor.|$|R
60|$|Harry's fit of crying, unmanly {{as he felt}} it, had afforded him {{an immense}} relief, for he hardly knew himself how great the strain had been upon him of late, and with a more elastic step he strode away into the country, and for hours walked on, <b>revolving</b> <b>plan</b> after plan in his mind for rescuing the girls. Although nothing very {{plausible}} had occurred to him he felt brighter in mind, though weary in body, when, just after nightfall, he again approached {{the spot where he}} had that morning received so heavy a blow. He was not disheartened at the difficulty before him, for he knew that he should have some time yet to hit upon a a plan, and the jails were so crowded with prisoners that he might fairly reckon upon weeks before there was any actual necessity for action. Marthe Pichon was waiting for him.|$|R
60|$|Phoebe {{went to bed}} <b>revolving</b> <b>plans</b> for {{softening}} Bertha, and {{was fast}} asleep when the lock of her door was turned. As she awoke, the terrors of the robbery were upon her far more strongly than at the actual moment of its occurrence; but the voice was familiar, though thin, weak, and gasping. 'O Phoebe, I've done it! I've starved myself. I am dying;' and the sound became a shrill cry. 'The dark! O save me!' There was a heavy fall, and Phoebe, springing {{to the spot where}} the white vision had sunk down, strove to lift a weight, cold as marble, without pulse or motion. She contrived to raise it, and drag it with her into her own bed, though in deadly terror at the icy touch and prone helplessness, and she was feeling in desperation for the bell-rope, when to her great relief, light and steps approached, and Robert spoke. Alas! his candle only served to show the ghastly, senseless face.|$|R
60|$|That {{night as}} he lay {{securely}} bound {{in the corner of}} a lodge, and the long hours wore slowly away, he strained at his stout bonds, and in his mind <b>revolved</b> different <b>plans</b> of escape. It was not in this man's nature to despair; while he had life he would fight. From time to time he expanded his muscles, striving to loosen the wet buckskin thongs.|$|R
50|$|Ghosh is {{the author}} of Nineteenth Street, N.W.—a fictional novel about a global {{financial}} crash. The thriller, now in its second edition, explores the threat of financial terrorism and <b>revolves</b> around a <b>plan</b> to sabotage the global currency markets.|$|R
60|$|Still, as he {{sat there}} with a foreboding of more and darker work ahead of him there was yet a strange {{sweetness}} left to him, and it lay in thought of Jennie. The pressure of her cold little hands lingered in his. He {{did not think of}} her as a woman, and he did not analyze his feelings. He just had vague, dreamy thoughts and imaginations that were interspersed in the constant and stern <b>revolving</b> of <b>plans</b> to save her.|$|R

5000|$|The episodes mainly <b>revolved</b> around <b>planning</b> {{the wedding}} and the hardships {{accompanying}} that though other episodes had different themes such as Marc recording his album, Sarah recording her part for Robots, and Sarah's German National Anthem scandal. The finale was an extra long episode showing {{the day and}} night of the wedding. The couple was successfully remarried. Sarah's next single [...] "Living to Love You" [...] went to #1 and Marc's song [...] "Love to be Loved by You" [...] (which was his wedding present to Sarah and sung during the ceremony) went to #3.|$|R
60|$|Wondering {{what could}} have become of his possessions, the ape-man turned slowly back along the trail in the {{direction}} from which he had come. In his mind he <b>revolved</b> a <b>plan</b> to enter and search the Arab camp, after darkness had again fallen. Taking to the trees, he moved directly south in search of prey, that he might satisfy his hunger before midday, and then lie up for the afternoon in some spot far from the camp, where he might sleep without fear of discovery until {{it came time to}} prosecute his design.|$|R
60|$|Ernest was madly {{impatient}} {{to be out}} in the world and doing, for our ill-fated First Revolt, that had miscarried in the Chicago Commune, was ripening fast. Yet he possessed his soul with patience, and during this time of his torment, when Hadly, who had been brought for the purpose from Illinois, made him over into another man* he <b>revolved</b> great <b>plans</b> in his head for the organization of the learned proletariat, and for the maintenance of at least the rudiments of education amongst the people of the abyss--all this of course in the event of the First Revolt being a failure.|$|R

5000|$|In chapter 8, Hercule Poirot {{mentions}} two of Ariadne Oliver's books, The Lotus Murder and The Clue of The Candle Wax, {{which both}} <b>revolved</b> around victims <b>planning</b> the crime which happened, {{and at the}} last minute [...] "the third person steps in and turns deception into reality".

60|$|I do {{not mean}} by this, that a young man may not make a useful discovery; but only {{that he may be}} led away by the ardor of early life, to fancy that {{essential}} and important, which is really not so.

50|$|The fifth {{week of the}} season, {{the reigning}} Super Bowl {{champion}} Pittsburgh Steelers came to town, and Bill Cowher's defensive game <b>plan</b> <b>revolved</b> around stopping running back LaDainian Tomlinson.

60|$|Agrippina, therefore, supposing {{that her}} son was now far enough {{advanced}} in public consideration {{to make it in}} some degree certain that he would be the emperor's successor, was ready at any time for her husband to die. His sickness therefore filled her mind with excitement and hope. There was another motive too, besides her ambitious desires for the advancement of her son, that made her desirous that Claudius should not live. She had been now for several months somewhat solicitous and anxious about her own safety. Her influence over Claudius, which was at first so absolute and supreme, had afterward greatly declined, and within a few months she had begun to fear that she might be losing it entirely. In fact she had some reason for believing that Claudius regarded her with concealed hostility and hate, and was secretly <b>revolving</b> <b>plans</b> for deposing both her and her son from the high ascendency to which they had raised themselves, and for bringing back his own son to his proper prominence, in Nero's place. Agrippina, too, in the midst of her ambitious projects and plans, led a life of secret vice and crime, and feeling guilty and self-condemned, every trivial indication of danger excited her fears. Some one informed her that Claudius one day when speaking of a woman who had been convicted of crime, said that it had always been his misfortune to have profligate wives, but that he always brought them in the end to the punishment that they deserved. Agrippina was greatly terrified at this report. She considered it a warning that Claudius was meditating some fatal proceedings in respect to her.|$|R

This <b>plan</b> <b>revolves</b> mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|R

5000|$|The town itself (as {{distinct}} from the Château grounds) is about 700 meters long by 500 meters wide.
