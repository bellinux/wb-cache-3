500|$|ABT dancer Sarah Lane {{served as}} a [...] "dance double" [...] for Portman in the film. In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine, {{editor-in-chief}} Wendy Perron asked: [...] "Do people <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that {{many people believe that}} Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan." [...] This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky, who both defended Portman as well as a response from Lane on the subject.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "The first album with Rick {{was also the first}} album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water.

500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or LaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> imaginative expression is without consequence? ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

[...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I think about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Rothbard held strong {{opinions}} about many {{leaders of the}} civil rights movement. He considered black separatist Malcolm X to be a [...] "great black leader" [...] and integrationist Martin Luther King to be favored by whites because he [...] "was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution." [...] Rothbard praised Malcolm X for [...] "acting white" [...] through use of his intellect and wit, and contrasted him favorably with the [...] "fraudulent intellectual with a rococo Black Baptist minister style, [...] "Dr." [...] King". But while he compared Malcolm X's black nationalism favorably to King's integrationism, and for a time praised black nationalism, in 1993 he rejected the vision of a [...] "separate black nation", asking [...] "does anyone <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> ... New Africa would be content to strike out on its own, with no massive [...] "foreign aid" [...] from the U.S.A.?" [...] Rothbard also suggested that opposition to King, whom he demeaned as a [...] "coercive integrationist", should be a litmus test for members of his [...] "paleolibertarian" [...] political movement.|$|E
500|$|Bégin's {{father taught}} his son that his {{best chance of}} making a career in hockey was as a {{defensive}} specialist and impressed on him {{the need for a}} strong work ethic. [...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL. [...] I always admired the way that he played. I look at the spirit, the leadership. Pretty amazing what he’s done for us." ...|$|E

She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E

Shahumyan first raised the specter of what British involvement would entail: [...] "Is your General Dunsterville [...] coming to Baku to turn us out?" [...] MacDonell reassured him that Dunsterville, {{being a member of}} the military, was not claiming any political stake in the conflict but was merely interested in helping him defend the city. Unconvinced, Shahumyan replied, [...] "And you <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a British general and a Bolshevik commissar would make good partners....No!

2500|$|After the Oscar {{ceremony}} on February 27, 2011 {{in which}} Portman won the Academy Award for Best Actress {{and where she}} thanked many people but didn't mention Lane, dancer and editor-in-chief of Dance Magazine Wendy Perron published a March 3, 2011 blog post in which she asks why a visual effects video clip showing Lane's face being replaced by Portman's was once available online but later removed from the Internet prior to the Oscars. She also speculates as to whether Portman deliberately didn't mention Lane, by asking {{if this was a}} case of [...] "forgetfulness {{in the heat of the}} moment?

2500|$|On June 30, {{the defense}} called Krystal Holloway, a {{volunteer}} {{in the search}} for Caylee, who stated that she had had an affair with George Anthony, that he had been to her home, and that he had texted her, [...] "Just thinking about you.

[...] Under cross-examination by prosecutors, they pointed to her sworn police statement in which she had said that George Anthony believed it was an accident, rather than knowing that it was. In her initial report, Holloway reported George Anthony saying, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was an accident that just went wrong and (Casey Anthony) tried to cover it up." [...] She said he had not told her he was present when the alleged accident occurred.

2500|$|During [...] "The Callas Debate", Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated, [...] "The timbre of Callas's voice, {{considered}} purely as sound, {{was essentially}} ugly: {{it was a}} thick sound, which {{gave the impression of}} dryness, of aridity. It lacked those elements which, in a singer's jargon, are described as velvet and varnish... yet I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> part of her appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish, velvet and richness, this voice could acquire such distinctive colours and timbres as to be unforgettable." [...] However, in his review of Callas's 1951 live recording of I vespri siciliani, Ira Siff writes, [...] "Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed, even early on, a flawed voice, unattractive by conventional standards—an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich, spinning sound, ravishing by any standard, capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble, chest tones unforced, and the middle register displays none of the [...] "bottled" [...] quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured." ...|$|E
