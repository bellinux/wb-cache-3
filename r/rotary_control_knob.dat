40|$|Haptic-enabled rotary control knobs are {{increasingly}} being integrated within vehicles to manage vehicular instrumentation. By doing so, driver safety and performance is increased {{as a result of}} the distraction reductions associated with such a system. The integration of window adjustment within such a vehicular instrumentation management system is examined through human factors studies for the purpose of reducing driver distraction. Additional focus is placed on examining the ability of haptic feedback alone to eliminate reliance on visual feedback when adjusting window height. Results indicate that eliminating such reliance is possible by means of a <b>rotary</b> <b>control</b> <b>knob</b> providing varying intermediate haptic feedback as the window is adjusted...|$|E
5000|$|Below each input, {{there are}} usually several <b>rotary</b> <b>controls</b> (<b>knobs</b> or [...] "pots"). The first knob is {{typically}} a trim or gain control. The inputs buffer the signal from the external device and this controls the amount of amplification (boosting) or attenuation (turning down of gain) needed to bring the signal to a nominal level for processing. This stage is where most noise of interference is picked up, due to the high gains involved (around +50 dB, for a microphone). Balanced inputs and connectors, such as XLR or phone connectors, reduce interference problems.|$|R

They are placed in the outer ear, are flesh colored, and amplify {{surrounding}} noise to make hearing much easier for those with impairments.

50|$|In response, several luxury brands had {{switched}} to <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> <b>control</b> devices, {{with the aim}} to simplify cabin layout and consolidate multiple controls with a single device. The BMW iDrive, Audi MMI, and Mercedes-Benz COMAND APS interfaces operated using a circular center knob which can be rotated side to side, and pressed to select items, with the rotary knob scrolling through on-screen menus. Of these systems, some reviewers praised their ability to simplify the dash layout, while others levied criticism for reputed complexity and user difficulty, particularly with iDrive.|$|R
40|$|Instrument {{controls}} have haptic properties (force and compliance) {{to maximize}} the ease of use for vehicle occupants. A single force-feedback knob can emulate the feel of conventional <b>control</b> <b>knobs</b> (detents, limit stops, friction) and can produce new effects as well such as vibration, scrolling, and free-spin, all instantaneously reconfigurable under computer control. Such a haptic knob can simulate the functions of all instrument controls that it replaces and thus reduced to one device, {{the control of the}} dashboard provides the driver with instant access to all functions, quickly and ergonomically. The overall objective is to facilitate driver access to a growing array of electronic devices and vehicle functions for secondary control tasks, such as audio, climate, information and telematics without compromising the primary control task of driving. Several <b>rotary</b> force-feedback <b>control</b> <b>knobs</b> have been proposed for use in vehicular control that use a motor and a microprocessor controller to achieve the desired effect [1 - 4]. However, the magnitude of the torque available from these devices is limited {{by the size of the}} motor and its power consumption, both of which must be limited for practical use in a vehicle. This paper presents a novel haptic knob that additionally incorporates a brake to provide high torque capability in a small volume with low power consumption...|$|R

The outdated horizontal speedometer was replaced by instrument cluster used in the Crown Victoria (adding a voltmeter and oil-pressure gauge); a digital instrument panel with trip computer was still an option.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaAn {{advanced}} {{microwave power}} leveling loop (MPLL) was conceived, designed, fabricated, tested, and used during spacecraft in-orbit testing. The primary {{function of the}} MPLL is to maintain constant RF power transmitted from an earth station antenna during spacecraft in-orbit transponder testing. The MPLL utilizes nonlinear analog electronics with flexible signal path routing under microprocessor control. It achieves a power control dynamic range of greater than 50 dB with better than 0. 1 dB of control resolution. Power level step changes of 20 dB can be accomplished in under 10 ms. The MPLL is IEEE- 488 bus controllable and is designed for use in automated in-orbit test systems to facilitate the measurement process and produce more repeatable results than have previously been possible. Measurements performed {{with the aid of}} the MPLL include transponder frequency response, group delay, gain, and saturation level. The system can also be operated in a manual mode, and utilizes state-ofthe-art human interfacing techniques such as a display/entry panel and a <b>rotary</b> encoder <b>control</b> <b>knob.</b> This paper describes the MPLL design process, including computer simulation work and breadboard testing.
