50|$|In November, a fissure {{eruption}} was noted {{on the new}} island with a chain of cinder <b>cones</b> <b>running</b> from southwest to northeast, the most recent cones were formed {{at the end of}} the chain, with the original cone being destroyed by the waves. The cones were erupting ash to a height of around 300 m.|$|R
50|$|Amongst other things, Rugby Challenge {{will feature}} 98 teams, 31 stadia, and 11 {{competitions}} {{as well as}} extensive Tutorial Mode options available for players new to the sport. The tutorial helps get you up to scratch and various skills, such as <b>running</b> between <b>cones,</b> practicing kicks, and many other drills can be completed. Apart from single and multi-player options, you'll {{also be able to}} play up to 13 seasons and attempt a legacy in Franchise Mode. Franchise mode will include both international and representative teams. You will be able to choose a club and an international side to play as during the years. There is a World Championship in Franchise Mode.|$|R
2500|$|The rudder {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} slightly conical (usually but not always - designs vary), semi-cones mounted on a pivot either side of the propeller with the long axis of the <b>cone</b> <b>running</b> fore and aft when the helm is midships. [...] They are pivoted about a vertical axis such that the cone may close off the propeller thrust aft of the propeller, directing the thrust forwards and thus creating motion astern.|$|R
50|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley in the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic <b>cones</b> <b>running</b> parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|R
50|$|Three cones {{are placed}} five yards apart {{from each other}} forming a right angle. The athlete starts with one hand {{down on the ground}} and runs to the middle cone and touches it. The athlete then reverses {{direction}} back to the starting cone and touches it. The athlete reverses direction again but this time runs around the outside of the middle cone {{on the way to the}} far <b>cone</b> <b>running</b> around it in figure eight fashion on his way back around the outside of the middle cornering cone. Athletes are timed for this whole procedure. This drill is primarily used to determine a player's agility.|$|R
40|$|Demonstrate {{teamwork}} {{while working}} to improve speed and agility. • Demonstrate {{knowledge and understanding of}} warm- up activities and agility. • Recognize individual similarities and differences and participate cooperatively in group activities. SUPPORT NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION (NASPE, 2004) : 1 - Demonstrate competency in motor skills and movement patterns needed to perform a variety of physical activities. 2 - Demonstrate understanding of movement concepts, principles, strategies, and tactics as they apply to the learning and performance of physical activities. 5 - Exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others in physical activity settings. 6 - Values physical activity for health, enjoyment, self-expression, and/or social interaction. MATERIALS NEEDED: <b>Running</b> shoes, <b>cones</b> DESCRIPTION: Students work with a partner, facing each other about 20 meters (21 yards and 32 inches; 65 feet and 6 inches) apart or another designated distance. Use cones to mark each participant’s starting position. Students should number themselves one and two, form two parallel lines and listen for their number to be called. When you have called their number, students should jog towards their partners, go around them and return to their original start position. Instead of just jogging, change the action they carry out each time their number is called. Some examples...|$|R
40|$|Motion of a non-relativistic {{particle}} on a cone with {{a magnetic}} flux <b>running</b> through the <b>cone</b> axis (a ``flux cone'') is studied. It is expressed as {{the motion of}} a particle moving on the Euclidean plane under the action of a velocity-dependent force. Probability fluid (``quantum flow'') associated with a particular stationary state is studied close to the singularity, demonstrating non trivial Aharonov-Bohm effects. For example, it is shown that near the singularity quantum flow departs from classical flow. In {{the context of the}} hydrodynamical approach to quantum mechanics, quantum potential due to the conical singularity is determined and the way it affects quantum flow is analysed. It is shown that the winding number of classical orbits plays a role in the description of the quantum flow. Connectivity of the configuration space is also discussed.

40|$|Volcanic ocean islands grow by complex {{series of}} eruptions, {{tectonics}} and, in some cases, major landslides. The Azores are unusual in {{that many of}} the islands lie about the Africa-Europe plate boundary. Volcanism here is characterized as involving small volume eruptions relative to islands such as Hawaii and significant faulting and associated seismicity. Some observations suggest how tectonism and volcanism might interact. For example, paleoseismological investigations of faults on the islands (Madeira et al., 2003) have shown that a significant amount of the strike-slip faulting occurs along chains of volcanic <b>cones</b> <b>running</b> along the islands, suggesting the interesting possibility that deformation is concentrated where the lithosphere is weakened by the magma feeding the cones. Many marine geological and geophysical datasets have been collected in the Azores over the last decade, allowing a general investigation of their volcanism, tectonics and sedimentary processes. Geophysical data include high-resolution multibeam echo-sounder data of the central group of islands, able to reveal the surface morphology of submarine-emplaced lava flows (Mitchell et al., 2008).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Although the benefits of ICP-MS are well documented, the determination of analytes at low levels in high concentrations of matrix elements has proved difficult. As ICP-MS is a 'flow into' instrument the deposition of salts throughout the system is a common cause of significant loss of signal. The application of desolvation of aluminosilicate samples, {{to aid in the}} production of more robust plasma conditions, was investigated to increase the efficiency of the ICP in processing the sample. The performance of the ICP-MS was monitored with different cone arrangements and by <b>running</b> the skimmer <b>cones</b> at elevated temperatures. An alternative to modification of the instrument is to employ chemical modification of the sample and hence the separation of Au and Pt from an aluminosilicate matrix via the use of solid phase extraction (SPE) columns were investigated as a means of dealing with high levels of dissolved solids. OVB based SPE columns were found to give high retentions of Au and Pt when chelated with ammonium pyrrolidinediethylcarbamate (APOC). A second alternative that avoided digestion of the aluminosilicate matrices, was to carry out the analysis using laser ablation (LA). LA-ICP-MS is becoming increasingly used for trace elemental analysis but as yet no universal calibration method is available. The general problems associated with matrix matched standards are inherent as the ablation mechanism and plasma conditions can differ dramatically with very small changes in matrix composition. Hence the addition of chromophores was employed to increase the absorption of the laser energy. The use of vanillic, nicotinic and pyrazinoic acid were used to improve the ablation of pressed powder discs at the laser wavelength of 213 nm. Synthetic aluminosilicate discs and standard additions were both employed for the calibration and determination of Ti...|$|R
