The averaged ecological status of the water bodies ranges between high and poor and the Ecological Quality Ratio shows a significant negative relationship with a modified LUSI index, thus providing further evidence on the utility of CARLIT to detect anthropogenic pressures. The lowest interannual variability in water quality was found in water bodies having most of their shore covered by natural rocks, while the highest variability was observed in water bodies situated in semi-confined environments or located close to freshwater discharges.

The result for Malawi provides a ‘counterfactual’ in this case. When the SER remained the same and the EFR was reduced to Tanzanian level, the probability of adoption reduced in Malawi’s case from about 34 to 31 %. For the other three countries’ simulations, the increased SER appears to more than compensate for the reductions in EFR, so that probability of adoption increases despite reductions in EFR (Fig.  2).|$|R

40|$|Elliptic curve cryptosystems {{are based}} on the {{elliptic}} curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). If elliptic curve cryptosystems avoid FR-reduction and anomalous elliptic curve over F_q, then with current knowledge we can construct elliptic curve cryptosystems over a smaller definition field. ECDLP has an interesting property that the security deeply depends on elliptic curve traces rather than definition fields, which does not occur {{in the case of the}} discrete logarithm problem (DLP). Therefore it is important to characterize elliptic curve traces explicitly from the security point of view. As for FR-reduction, supersingular elliptic curves or elliptic curve E/F_q with trace 2 have been reported to be vulnerable. However unfortunately these have been only results that characterize elliptic curve traces explicitly for FR- and MOV-reductions. More importantly, the secure trace against FR-reduction has not been reported at all. Elliptic curves with the secure trace means that the <b>reduced</b> <b>extension</b> degree is always higher than a certain level. In this paper, we aim at characterizing elliptic curve traces by FR-reduction and investigate explicit conditions of traces vulnerable or secure against FR-reduction.

In {{order to better}} characterize this animal model for experimental infections, we inoculated C. callosus intraperitoneally with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a thermally dimorphic fungus that causes a chronic disease with severe granuloma formation in the mouse and humans. The dissemination of P. brasiliensis cells through the lungs, liver, pancreas, and spleen was assessed by histological analysis. Results The animals were susceptible to infection and showed a granulomatous reaction. C. callosus presented peritonitis characterized {{by the presence of}} exudates containing a large number of yeast cells. Extensive accumulation of yeast cells with intense destruction of the parenchyma was observed in the pancreas, which reduced the glucose levels of infected animals. These lesions were regressive in the liver, spleen, and lungs until complete recovery. The role of estrogen during C. callosus infection with P. brasiliensis was addressed by infecting ovariectomized animals. It was observed a reduced inflammatory response as well as <b>reduced</b> <b>extension</b> of tissue damage. Removal of ovaries reestablished the normal glucose levels during infection.

High pCO 2 {{had no effect on}} linear extension of M. aequituberculata in Moorea, but in Okinawa, it reduced linear extension 37 %; high pCO 2 had no significant effect on linear extension of P. lutea in Okinawa. Much of the negative effect of high pCO 2 on linear extension for M. aequituberculata in Okinawa was due to <b>reduced</b> <b>extension</b> in control pairings, with corals engaged in intra- and interspecific competition unaffected by OA. Linear extension of M. aequituberculata and P. lutea in interspecific pairings decreased relative to control pairings at ambient pCO 2 by 39 and 71 %, respectively, indicating a strong effect of competition on extension rates. These differences however disappeared at elevated pCO 2 when the linear extension of controls was depressed. Together, our results show that OA can negatively affect the linear extension of corals not engaged in competition, as shown in the control pairings, and suggest that OA does not directly affect the ability of corals to compete with one another for space...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The IntraSPINE {{is a new}} interlaminar {{device that}} has been {{proposed}} with the aim to decompress the spinal canal without <b>reducing</b> the <b>extension</b> motion. The {{purpose of this study}} was therefore to evaluate the biomechanical behavior of L 4 -L 5 spinal units implanted with this interlaminar device, in terms of ranges of motion, intradiscal pressure, and centers of rotation. Material and Methods. Six human lumbar spines were harvested within 10 days after death. A specific spine testing device was used to apply moments up to 10 Nm in flexion-extension, lateral bending (left-right flexion) and left-right axial rotation (torsion), with measurement of vertebral 3 D motion and of intervertebral disc pressure. Protocol was repeated for each specimen in 5 configurations: intact specimen; after L 4 -L 5 bilateral medial hemifacetectomy and both yellow ligament resection; after implantation of the interlaminar device at the L 4 -L 5 level; after removal of the L 4 -L 5 supraspinous ligament, resection of the posterior third of the disc and addition of an artificial ligament; after device and artificial ligament removal.
