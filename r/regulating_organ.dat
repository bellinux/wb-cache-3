40|$|AbstractExperiments in both {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates have {{illustrated the}} competitive nature {{of growth and}} led to the idea that competition is a mechanism of <b>regulating</b> <b>organ</b> and tissue size. We have assessed competitive interactions between cells in a developing organ and examined their effect on its final size. We show that local expression of the Drosophila growth regulator dMyc, a homolog of the c-myc protooncogene, induces cell competition and leads to the death of nearby wild-type cells in developing wings. We demonstrate that cell competition is executed via induction of the proapoptotic gene hid and that both competition and hid function are required for the wing to reach an appropriate size when dMyc is expressed. Moreover, we provide evidence that reproducible wing size during normal development requires apoptosis. Modulating dmyc levels to create cell competition and hid-dependent cell death may be a mechanism used during normal development to control organ size...|$|E
40|$|The mTOR and Hippo {{pathways}} {{have recently}} {{emerged as the}} major signaling transduction cascades <b>regulating</b> <b>organ</b> size and cellular homeostasis. However, direct crosstalk between two pathways {{is yet to be}} determined. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC 2 is a direct negative regulator of the MST 1 kinase, a key component of the Hippo pathway. mTORC 2 phosphorylates MST 1 at serine 438 in the SARAH domain, thereby reducing its homodimerization and activity. We found that Rictor/mTORC 2 preserves cardiac structure and function by restraining the activity of MST 1 kinase. Cardiac-specific mTORC 2 disruption through Rictor deletion leads to a marked activation of MST 1 that, in turn, promotes cardiac dysfunction and dilation, impairing cardiac growth and adaptation in response to pressure overload. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the existence of a direct crosstalk between mTORC 2 and MST 1 that is critical for cardiac cell survival and growth...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of common mechanisms <b>regulating</b> <b>organ</b> regeneration is an intriguing concept. Here {{we report on}} a regulatory element that is transiently activated during heart and fin regeneration in zebrafish. This element contains a ctgfa upstream sequence, called careg, which is induced by TGFβ/Activin-β signalling in the peri-injury zone of the myocardium and the fin mesenchyme. In addition, this reporter demarcates a primordial cardiac layer and intraray osteoblasts. Using genetic fate mapping, we show the regenerative competence of careg-expressing cells. The analysis of the heart reveals that the primordial cardiac layer is incompletely restored after cryoinjury, whereas trabecular and cortical cardiomyocytes contribute to myocardial regrowth. In regenerating fins, the activated mesenchyme of the stump {{gives rise to the}} blastema. Our findings provide evidence of a common regenerative programme in cardiomyocytes and mesenchyme that opens the possibility to further explore conserved mechanisms of the cellular plasticity in diverse vertebrate organs...|$|E
40|$|SummaryHow {{adjacent}} organ fields communicate during {{development is}} not understood. Here, we identify a mechanism in which signaling within the forelimb field restricts {{the potential of}} the neighboring heart field. In zebrafish embryos deficient in retinoic acid (RA) signaling, the pectoral fins (forelimbs) are lost while both chambers of the heart are enlarged. We provide evidence that both of these phenotypes are due to RA signaling acting directly within the forelimb field. hoxb 5 b, an RA-responsive gene expressed within the forelimb field, is required to restrict the number of atrial cells arising from the adjacent heart field, although its function is dispensable for forelimb formation. Together, these data indicate nonautonomous influences downstream of RA signaling that act to limit individual chamber size. Therefore, our results offer new perspectives on the mechanisms <b>regulating</b> <b>organ</b> size and the possible causes of congenital syndromes affecting both the heart and forelimb...|$|E
40|$|YAP/TAZ are nuclear effectors of the Hippo pathway <b>regulating</b> <b>organ</b> {{growth and}} tumorigenesis. Yet, their {{function}} as transcriptional regulators remains underinvestigated. By ChIP-seq analyses {{in breast cancer}} cells, we discovered that the YAP/TAZ transcriptional response is pervasively mediated by a dual element: TEAD factors, through which YAP/TAZ bind to DNA, co-occupying chromatin with activator protein- 1 (AP- 1, dimer of JUN and FOS proteins) at composite cis-regulatory elements harbouring both TEAD and AP- 1 motifs. YAP/TAZ/TEAD and AP- 1 form a complex that synergistically activates target genes {{directly involved in the}} control of S-phase entry and mitosis. This control occurs almost exclusively from distal enhancers that contact target promoters through chromatin looping. YAP/TAZ-induced oncogenic growth is strongly enhanced by gain of AP- 1 and severely blunted by its loss.

Metabolite profiling by targeted LC-MS/MS demonstrated that SepH deficiency impairs redox balance by reducing the levels of ascorbate and methionine, while increasing methionine sulfoxide.

Consequently, loss of seph renders larvae susceptible to oxidative stress and DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrate that seph interacts with p 53 deficiency in adulthood to accelerate gastrointestinal tumor development.
