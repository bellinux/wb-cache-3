The results from the Mount Elbert test well showed that scientists’ efforts to predict where and how much NGH exists in the subsurface using conventional subsurface datasets, such as wireline logs and 3D seismic data were successful in predicting <b>reservoir</b> <b>thickness</b> and general methane hydrate gas saturations.

50|$|Mallik, as {{an ongoing}} gas hydrate {{research}} site, is the first fully integrated field study and modern production test well of natural gas hydrates in Canada. The wells were successfully drilled to test a major natural gas hydrate accumulation in the Mackenzie Delta of the northwestern Canadian Arctic. It gave scientists the opportunity to monitor the physical response of gas hydrate deposits and investigate permafrost gas hydrates {{in one of its}} most prominent occurrences.From a technical perspective, the results from the scientific R&D Program in the Mackenzie Delta basin confirmed pre-drill predictions that gas hydrates were present in high-saturation, sand-rich reservoirs. Resultantly, scientists were able to successfully recover wireline cores through the different gas hydrate intervals. Also, experts could carry out cross-hole tomography experiments not only before, but also during and after the actual production tests. During the project, a suite of several different open-hole logs could be obtained by using advanced and new gas hydrate logging tools, giving first insights into the <b>reservoir</b> <b>thickness</b> and general natural gas hydrate saturations. Unfortunately, {{due to a lack of}} pipeline or gathering system, there is currently only one field in the Mackenzie Delta - providing natural gas to the town of Inuvik - and no commercial oil or gas production.|$|E
5000|$|For the Delta Field, {{the main}} source rock is the Akata Formation with the Agbada Formation acting as the {{reservoir}} rock. [...] However, interbedded shale in the lower Agbada Formation also acts as a source rock. However, the Agbada source rock intervals rarely have the thickness needed {{to be considered a}} world class oil province. A 1980 study of source rocks throughout the delta shows total organic carbon (TOC) ranges from 0.4% to 14.4%. [...] Other studies have only reported TOC values as high as 5.2% or with averages of 2.4%. Another study— who studied the TOC in sandstones, siltstones, and shales—show TOC averages of 1.4% to 1.6% and note that TOC decreases with decreasing age. [...] In other areas of the Niger Delta, particularly in deeper water settings, delta slope and deep turbidite fans are the depositional systems of the source rock, which have organic matter of a terrestrial signature as well as amorphous, hydrogen-rich matter from bacterial degradation. Other studies have speculated that Cretaceous shales could also be source rocks but, because they have not been drilled, no data exist to identify the potential.Hydrocarbons throughout the delta and in the Delta Field are produced from the Agbada Formation, mainly in the form of sandstone and unconsolidated sands. Thicker sand reservoirs represent stacked channels and point bars, distributary channels, and coastal barrier bars are important reservoir types in the delta. The paralic sandstones have porosity values of 40% and 2 darcys permeability. [...] Lateral variations in <b>reservoir</b> <b>thickness</b> are the result of growth faults and porosity slowly increases with depth due to the young age of the sediment.|$|E

Therefore, a radial model is reasonable to study this reservoir.|$|R
30|$|Especially in poorly {{explored}} regions, {{prediction of}} reservoir parameters {{along with an}} assessment of the geological development is needed prior to drilling. Pre-drilling assessments of uncertainties and general <b>reservoir</b> parameters (<b>thickness,</b> porosity, permeability and temperature) are crucial for estimating the geothermal potential in such areas. Seismic interpretation is essential in order to determine depth and thicknesses. Setting up a work programme for a geothermal project thus requires a careful integration of existing geological and geophysical information.|$|R

40|$|The {{dolomite}} reservoirs of the Lower Cambrian Longwangmiao Fm in the Gaoshiti–Moxi area, Sichuan Basin, {{are deeply}} buried (generally 4400 – 4900  m), with high heterogeneity, making reservoir prediction difficult. In this regard, key seismic exploration technologies were developed through researches. Firstly, through in-depth {{analysis on the}} existing geologic, drilling, seismic data and available research findings, basic surface and subsurface structures and geologic conditions within the study area were clarified. Secondly, digital seismic data acquisition technologies with wide azimuth, wide frequency band and minor bins were adopted to ensure even distribution of coverage of target formations through optimization of the 3 D seismic geometry. In this way, high-accuracy 3 D seismic data can be acquired through shallow, middle and deep formations. Thirdly, well-control seismic data processing technologies were applied to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of seismic data for deep formations. Fourthly, a seismic response model was established specifically for the Longwangmiao Fm reservoir. Quantitative prediction of the reservoir was performed through pre-stack geo-statistics. In this way, plan distribution of <b>reservoir</b> <b>thicknesses</b> was mapped. Fifthly, core tests and logging data analysis were conducted to determine gas-sensitive elastic parameters, which were then used in pre-stack hydrocarbon detection to eliminate the multiple solutions in seismic data interpretation. It is concluded that application of the above-mentioned key technologies effectively promote the discovery of largescale marine carbonate gas reservoirs of the Longwangmiao Fm...|$|R

30|$|Spectral {{decomposition}} is {{a simple}} yet robust approach for generating high-resolution seismic images of stratigraphic and structural prospects of reservoirs.

30|$|<b>Reservoir</b> <b>thickness</b> is an {{important}} factor that affects the development effect of steam injection. The development methods used in a thick reservoir usually differ from that in a thin one. Thin reservoirs often cause serious heat loss. Thus, the heat efficiency of the injected hot medium is reduced. But in thick reservoirs, heat utilization may also be reduced because of steam override. In the simulation part, numerical models with thickness ranges from 3 to 6  m are built. The results are shown in Fig.  6. When the <b>reservoir</b> <b>thickness</b> is lower than 5  m, oil recovery is enhanced remarkably as thickness increases. Oil recoveries for cases of 5  m and 6  m are 16.4 % and 16.6 %, respectively, and it tends to be stable when the thickness is higher than 5  m. As the thickness increases, the action of gravity becomes more and more serious, and the vertical sweep efficiency is limited. Therefore, the <b>reservoir</b> <b>thickness</b> limit that is suitable for hot-water flooding is 5  m.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} spring of 2008, the Chevron-led Gulf of Mexico Gas Hydrate Joint Industry Project (JIP) expects to conduct an {{exploratory}} drilling and logging campaign to better understand gas hydrate-bearing sands in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The JIP Site Selection team selected three areas to test alternative geological models and geophysical interpretations supporting the existence of potential high gas hydrate saturations in reservoir-quality sands. The three sites are near existing drill holes which provide geological and geophysical constraints in Alaminos Canyon (AC) lease block 818, Green Canyon (GC) 955, and Walker Ridge (WR) 313. At the AC 818 site, gas hydrate is interpreted to occur within the Oligocene Frio volcaniclastic sand at {{the crest of a}} fold that is shallow enough to be in the hydrate stability zone. Drilling at GC 955 will sample a faulted, buried Pleistocene channel-levee system in an area characterized by seafloor fluid expulsion features, structural closure associated with uplifted salt, and abundant seismic evidence for upward migration of fluids and gas into the sand-rich parts of the sedimentary section. Drilling at WR 313 targets ponded sheet sands and associated channel/levee deposits within a minibasin, making this a non-structural play. The potential for gas hydrate occurrence at WR 313 is supported by shingled phase reversals consistent with the transition from gas-charged sand to overlying gas-hydrate saturated sand. Drilling locations have been selected at each site to 1) test geological methods and models used to infer the occurrence of gas hydrate in sand reservoirs in different settings in the northern Gulf of Mexico; 2) calibrate geophysical models used to detect gas hydrate sands, map <b>reservoir</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> and estimate the degree of gas hydrate saturation; and 3) delineate potential locations for subsequent JIP drilling and coring operations that will collect samples for comprehensive physical property, geochemical and other analyses...|$|R

40|$|The West Netherlands Basin {{is located}} in the {{southwest}} of the Netherlands. The area is known for its extensive horticultural industry, and deep geothermal energy is growing in popularity to heat the power demanding greenhouses. Two producing geothermal wells are located {{in the southern part of}} the study area, which {{is located in}} the northern part of the West Netherlands Basin. No licenses are applied for in the northern part (roughly defined north of the Zoetermeer-Moerkappele structure) of the study area, possibly because geology is not considered suitable for the exploration of geothermal energy. The area has been extensively studied by the oil and gas industry, resulting in a large database of rocks on structural highs, as this is where hydrocarbons tend to migrate to and accumulate. In contrast, geothermal energy demands a high subsurface temperature, usually found in grabens and basins This study aims to provide a better understanding in the geological history of Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, with focus on potential geothermal <b>reservoirs.</b> <b>Thickness</b> and depth of units, in combination with tectonic structures, are of particular interest. Detailed seismic mapping in combination with well log correlation panels give insight into the depth and thickness of the Rijswijk Member and the Nieuwerkerk Formation, which are considered most suitable for geothermal energy exploration. Manual fault mapping on seismic data, seismic attribute analysis and juxtaposition diagrams are used to reveal the tectonic history of the area and to explain depositional patterns. Deposition of Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous sediments is highly influenced by the dominant horst and graben structures formed in the Late Jurassic Kimmerian rifting phase, and three large inversion phases influenced the present day sediment distribution. The rate of inversion increases towards the east of the study area, most likely due to transpression in a right-lateral faulting regime. Core-data analysis points out that the Rijswijk Member and the Nieuwerkerk Formation contain sandstones with sufficient porosities, making them suitable reservoirs for geothermal projects. On the basis of temperature maps and extensive seismic mapping, two areas suitable for geothermal exploration are specified.

40|$|The great {{difference}} in density between steam and liquid during wet steam injection always results in steam override, that is, steam gathers {{on the top}} of the pay zone. In this article, the equation for steam override coefficient was firstly established based on van Lookeren’s steam override theory and then radius of steam zone and hot fluid zone were derived according to a more realistic temperature distribution and an energy balance in the pay zone. On this basis, the equation for the reservoir heat efficiency with the consideration of steam override was developed. Next, predicted results of the new model were compared with these of another analytical model and CMG STARS (a mature commercial reservoir numerical simulator) to verify the accuracy of the new mathematical model. Finally, based on the validated model, we analyzed the effects of injection rate, steam quality and <b>reservoir</b> <b>thickness</b> on the reservoir heat efficiency. The results show that the new model can be simplified to the classic model (Marx-Langenheim model) under the condition of the steam override being not taken into account, which means the Marx-Langenheim model is corresponding to a special case of this new model. The new model is much closer to the actual situation compared to the Marx-Langenheim model because of considering steam override. Moreover, with the help of the new model, it is found that the reservoir heat efficiency is not much affected by injection rate and steam quality but significantly influenced by <b>reservoir</b> <b>thickness,</b> and to ensure that the reservoir can be heated effectively, the <b>reservoir</b> <b>thickness</b> should not be too small...|$|E

However, in Chang 6 ultra-low permeability reservoir, BaiBao block, HuaQing oilfield, the efficiency of fractured-horizontal well is highly poor due to the production swiftly down and water cut sharply up. For studying the unsatisfying oil development by fractured-horizontal well in HuaQing oil field, the evaluation of reservoir properties and the option of stratum for fractured-horizontal well application have been performed based on the practical geological model of BaiBao block in HuaQing oil field. The numerical simulation is used to study the effect of <b>reservoir</b> permeability, <b>Thickness</b> and Aeolotropism on the production and to optimize the horizontal length, fracture spacing, half length and conductivity.

40|$|AbstractThe Qinshui Basin in {{the southeastern}} Shanxi Province is an {{important}} area for coalbed methane (CBM) exploration and production in China, and recent exploration has revealed {{the presence of other}} unconventional types of gases such as shale gas and tight sandstone gas. The reservoirs for these unconventional types of gas in this basin are mainly the coals, mudstones, and sandstones of the Carboniferous and Permian; the <b>reservoir</b> <b>thicknesses</b> are controlled by the depositional environments and palaeogeography. This paper presents the results of sedimentological investigations based on data from outcrop and borehole sections, and basin-wide palaeogeographical maps of each formation were reconstructed {{on the basis of the}} contours of a variety of lithological parameters. The palaeogeographic units include the depositional environments of the fluvial channel, flood basin (lake), upper delta plain, lower delta plain, delta front, lagoon, tidal flat, barrier bar, and carbonate platform. The Benxi and Taiyuan Formations are composed mainly of limestones, bauxitic mudstones, siltstones, silty mudstones, sandstones, and economically exploitable coal seams, which were formed in delta, tidal flat, lagoon, and carbonate platform environments. The Shanxi Formation consists of sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, and coals; during the deposition of the formation, the northern part of the Qinshui Basin was occupied mainly by an upper delta plain environment, while the central and southern parts were mainly occupied by a lower delta plain environment and the southeastern part by a delta front environment. Thick coal zones occur in the central and southern parts, where the main depositional environment was a lower delta plain. The thick coal zones of the Taiyuan Formation evidently occur in the sandstone-rich belts, located mainly in the lower delta plain environment in the northern part of the basin and the barrier bar environments {{in the southeastern}} part of the basin. In contrast, the thick coal zones of the Shanxi Formation extend over the mudstone-rich belts, located in the areas of the lower delta plain environments of the central and southern parts of the Basin. The Xiashihezi, Shangshihezi, and Shiqianfeng Formations consist mainly of red mudstones with thick-interbedded sandstones. During the deposition of these formations, most areas of the basin were occupied by a fluvial channel, resulting in palaeogeographic units that include fluvial channel zones and flood basins. The fluvial channel deposits consist mainly of relatively-thick sandstones, which could have potential for exploration of tight sandstone gas...|$|R
