5|$|Around 1825, Hinde {{settled in}} Mount Carmel, leaving the Methodist circuit {{to focus on}} {{religious}} and historical writing, and business. He founded {{one of the first}} churches in the town and occasionally held Methodist gatherings at his home. On September 20, 1827 more than 27 Methodist ministers met in the upper <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house. It was one of the largest gatherings of the time.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Joey is in a {{hospital}} <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own, where a doctor informs him that he's suffering from kidney stones. As they're too close to his bladder, Joey is given two options: wait until he passes them naturally, or have a procedure, which he finds too invasive. Opting for the former, he gives 'birth' to the kidney stones, concurrent with Phoebe’s birth.|$|E
5|$|Phillips first sold {{bicycles}} and motorbikes, but later started selling and recharging batteries {{in a shop}} in the front <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house in 1925. After a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s, he started selling electrical goods and popular records. In 1955, Phillips set up a recording studio called Phillips' Sound Recording Services.|$|E

25|$|In 1774 he {{realised}} {{an early}} electric telegraph. The telegraph had a separate wire {{for each of}} the 26 letters of the alphabet and its range was only between two <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home.|$|R
60|$|He went {{straight}} to the <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Society in Hanover Square. They were on the top floor, higher than the <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> any other Society in the building--so high, in fact, that from their windows, which began five feet up, you could practically only see the sky.|$|R
5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop in the front <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due {{to a decline in}} demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social service programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to protect himself by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E

50|$|The steps Man takes {{across the}} heavens <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{universe}} are as uncertain as those steps he takes across the <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own life.

25|$|On 29 April 2006, {{police found}} a small {{quantity}} (less than 1gram) of cannabis resin in a guest <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home. Reid denied all knowledge of the drug, and Strathclyde Police have stated {{that he is not}} under suspicion of having committed any offence. The street value of the drugs would have been less than 85p.|$|E
25|$|An early {{electromagnetic}} telegraph {{design was}} created by Russian diplomat Pavel Schilling in 1832. He set it up in his apartment in St. Petersburg and demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals by positioning two telegraphs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> invention in two different <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> apartment. Schilling {{was the first to}} put into practice the idea of a binary system of signal transmissions.|$|R

25|$|Guildford Grammar School traces its {{foundations}} to 1896 when Charles Harper, {{an influential}} Western Australian, {{established in the}} billiard <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house (Woodbridge House) a school (under the guidance of Frank Bennett, the first headmaster) which was to cater to {{the educational needs of}} his children and those from the surrounding district. Harper's vision was to create a school based on the English public school system, whilst also attempting to accommodate the different culture of the modern colonial society.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's {{first solo}} {{exhibition}} {{was held at}} the Galerie Arnaud, Paris, in 1951. His first solo show in New York {{was held at the}} Betty Parsons Gallery in 1956. In 1957, he showed works in a group exhibition at the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles. In 1959 he was included in the Museum of Modern Art's ground-breaking exhibition, Sixteen Americans. Kelly was invited to show at the São Paulo Biennial in 1961. His work was later included in the documenta in 1964, 1968, 1977, 1992. A <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paintings was included in the 2007 Venice Biennale.|$|E

50|$|James Lenox had a {{cataloguing}} system {{known only}} to him, and kept his books bound and piled in the <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> townhouse, not on shelves or in according to any organized system. It was this overcrowding and lack of ease of use of the library that inspired him to build a separate institution with the express purpose <b>of</b> housing <b>his</b> book collection.|$|R
50|$|Vincenzo Mirabella {{assembled}} the objects he excavated into a diverse archaeological collection, which he {{exhibited in the}} <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> palace in Ortygia, at the current Via Mirabella nº23, which he steadily transformed into his own museum. At his death, his heirs donated parts of this collection to the Museu Patrio of Syracuse, which later became the Museo archeologico regionale Paolo Orsi.|$|R
25|$|In 1837, Echeverría {{founded the}} Asociación de Mayo, {{at the back}} <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> store. The meeting was first viewed favorably by top functionaries of the Rosas government, {{even though they were}} {{considered}} suspicious by the Sociedad Popular Restauradora (Rosas' government's political arm). In the same year, the French blockade of the Río de la Plata started, which first for cultural reasons, then political, defined them as anti-Rosas. The threats of the para-military group, the Mazorca, Sastre did not flee to Montevideo, as several of his friends had done. The government's displeasure and the stopping of imports from France caused the bankruptcy of his bookstore. In 1840, Sastre published a novel, Cartas a Germania.|$|E
25|$|The {{first light}} keeper at the Caloundra Head Lightstation was {{appointed}} {{when the light}} became operational in September 1896. One <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cottage functioned as a postal receiving office, complete with telegraph facilities, with the light keeper appointed as the receiving office keeper. In 1910 the telegraph service was discontinued but {{was replaced by a}} telephone service in 1912. The post office remained at the lighthouse until 1934 and as a result, a rough track along the ridge was created by a steady stream of local residents, helping to foster closer settlement around the lighthouse in the immediate years after its erection. This rough track eventually became Canberra Terrace. As a married man with a large family, the arrival of the first lightkeeper also led to the establishment of the first Caloundra School, which for several months in the late 1890s was conducted at the light keeper's cottage.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{crew members}} and a pilot from Hanko {{lost their lives}} in the accident. Due to the {{extensive}} damage suffered by the pusher only two bodies were found and recovered during the initial dives into the capsized vessel in early January — the first engineer was found in the crushed office and the chief steward in the staircase. After the combination had been rightened on 1 February, the purser was found in the shower <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own cabin and the electrician in a spare cabin next to the mess hall. When the detached parts of the superstructure were recovered for official investigation in late February, the body of the first mate was found in the remains of the machinery room located below the bridge. The search for the missing victims continued until July 1991 mainly by the Finnish Navy and a tourist submarine chartered to the investigation board. The bodies of the captain and the pilot, who were at the bridge when Finn-Baltic capsized, were found along the drifting path in May and June, respectively. The body of the deck repair man was never recovered.|$|E

500|$|On Election Night, {{the first}} returns {{came in from}} Sable Island, Nova Scotia. Usually a Liberal stronghold, the handful of {{residents}} there favoured the Tories by two votes. St. Laurent listened to the election returns on a radio in the living <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home on [...] in Quebec City, and when the radio broke, moved to an upstairs television set. Diefenbaker began the evening at his house in Prince Albert, and once his re-election to the Commons was certain, moved to his local campaign headquarters.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, West began {{recording}} {{his seventh}} studio album with collaborators, including No I.D. and DJ Khaled. The first recordings {{were held in}} January 2013, in the living <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personal loft at a Paris hotel, {{referred to in the}} album's credits as the [...] "No Name Hotel". West kept compositions simple in order to hear the tracks more clearly; too much bass or complexity would simply overpower the room's poor acoustics. The beats emanating from the loft space, which sometimes lasted through the night, provoked complaints from neighbors. Reports emerged that he and his then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian had moved to the loft in order for West to begin work on the album.|$|E

Elijah brings David to the back <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studio, extends his hand, and asks David to shake it. Upon doing so, David sees visions of Elijah orchestrating several terrorist disasters, including David's recent train accident, causing hundreds of deaths. David is horrified, but Elijah insists the deaths were justified {{as a means to}} find him. Calling himself [...] "Mr. Glass", a nickname his peers had used to taunt him with when he was growing up, he explains that his own purpose in life is to be the villain to David's hero.|$|E
5000|$|To show connectivity, Kiesler {{included}} curvilinear {{structure that}} is built of one material, concrete, with no structural seams in the building.

50|$|About 1874 Patrick O'Shea {{built the}} first two <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Drayton farmhouse. He used his axe and adze to cut and shape the timber for bearers, joists, walls and {{household}} furniture.

Additions to the house resulted in two front rooms under another shingle gable roof.|$|R
