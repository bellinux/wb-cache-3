25|$|Train crews favored #2450 {{due to the}} {{superior}} <b>riding</b> <b>qualities</b> of its Blomberg trucks, which ran more smoothly than the original AAR Type-A switcher trucks; being several tons heavier than a typical GP7 imparted a higher tractive effort, which was helpful when switching long cuts of cars. The Beep spent many years in lease service performing switching duties for the Port Terminal Railroad Association in Houston. In August, 1974 the unit was re-designated as #1160 {{as part of a}} general locomotive renumbering scheme. It was again renumbered along with the Santa Fe's few remaining EMD switchers and assigned #1460 in January, 1977.|$|E
500|$|The N1 was {{a capable}} class of mixed-traffic {{locomotive}} that could operate over the Southern Railway's gauge-restricted routes and was noted by crews for its comfortable <b>riding</b> <b>qualities.</b> The class also provided Maunsell and his assistants with {{a precedent for}} other compact 3-cylinder locomotive designs and formed a mechanical template for the Southern Railway's K1class tank engine of 1925. However, the prototype offered little improvement in performance over the Nclass when tested on non-restricted routes, which led to an initial reluctance within {{the management of the}} Southern Railway to authorise batch construction. This meant that the non-standard Holcroft valve gear proved expensive to maintain because of the consequent lack of spare parts.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the accident, two Kand K1class engines were trialled on the London and North Eastern Railway's (LNER) Great Northern mainline {{under the supervision of}} that company's CME, Nigel Gresley, to gain an unbiased review of their <b>riding</b> <b>qualities.</b> Locomotives No.A803 (K) and No.A890 (K1), and KingArthurclass No.E782, were tested on the well-maintained LNER line between [...] and [...] in October 1927, where few problems were found with locomotive stability. On runs between Kings Cross and [...] with the LNER's dynamometer car, No.A890 was recorded at a top speed of [...] and A803 at , with no problems in riding. When these engines returned from the LNER, the Southern Railway's General Manager, Sir Herbert Walker ordered further trials to be led by Sir John Aspinall on the Western section main line near [...] These were terminated by the Southern Railway's Operating Department, as the riding of the locomotives at speeds near [...] rendered the locomotives unsafe. The instability of No.A890 at speed was attributed to the helical springs on the Bissel truck and bogie.|$|E

The report accepted that withdrawal of the Mark 1 units was not practical and the design was safe: [...] "The inventory of Mark I coaching stock is large, {{and much of it}} has not reached an end of economic life, nor will do so for another decade or more. Mark I vehicles have good <b>riding</b> <b>qualities,</b> and are not intrinsically lacking in collision resistance."

2500|$|Car 636 {{was part}} of an order for 25 streetcars for the Dallas Railway Co. from the J. G. Brill Company. Petunia, a [...] "Birney Safety Car," [...] (or Birney, for short) is named after its designer, Charles O. Birney of the Stone & Webster Co. [...] The design {{incorporated}} numerous operational and safety improvements over earlier streetcars that permitted one man operation and thereby allowed street railway companies to reduce their expenses. [...] Birneys were known for their bouncy <b>riding</b> <b>qualities</b> and were never very popular with the Dallas riding public. [...] Nevertheless, 636 ran in Dallas until 1947 when it was replaced by more modern equipment. [...] MATA's Ed and John Landrum, Frank Schultz and Dean Smith designed and built 636's current 8-foot-long truck using parts from the extra Melbourne trucks purchased along with Car 369. [...] MATA later added shock absorbers to smooth out the Birney's characteristic bouncy ride.|$|E
2500|$|For railway {{locomotive}} applications {{the main}} benefit sought from compounding is economy in fuel and water consumption plus high power/weight ratio due to temperature and pressure drop taking place {{over a longer}} cycle, this resulting in increased efficiency; additional perceived advantages include more even torque and in many cases, superior <b>riding</b> <b>qualities</b> with consequent less wear on the track. In situations where heavy grades and low axle loads were combined, the ordinary compound locomotive was often deemed {{to be the most}} viable solution. However, in the past, optimum performance demanded constant attention and expert handling, which usually made single-manning advisable, thus reducing a locomotive's availability. At the end of the steam age, this particular problem was being addressed by Andre Chapelon, and Livio Dante Porta also actively pursued this line of research. Successful design of a compound locomotive demands a firm grasp of thermo- and fluid dynamics; that such has frequently not been the case is why many productions in the past have been far from optimal. This is especially true of locomotives built {{in the early years of}} the 20th century. The problem not only affected compounds, but was dramatic in their case due to the long steam cycle which made them particularly sensitive to temperature-drop and condensation of the steam during its lengthy passage. In rebuilding older locomotives from 1929 onwards, Chapelon was able to inexpensively obtain what seemed almost [...] "magical" [...] improvements in power and economy by improving flow through the steam circuit, at the same time putting in a larger superheater in order to increase the initial steam temperature so that cooling took longer. [...] Subsequently, in order to maintain a more constant temperature throughout the cycle, Chapelon successfully applied re-superheating between HP and LP stages plus steam-jacketed cylinders to a [...] "test-bed" [...] freight locomotive, 160 A1 (tested 1948-51). Resuperheating was also a feature of L.D. [...] Porta's prototype 4-8-0 rebuild: 'Presidente Peron'/'Argentina' (tested around the same time in Argentina from 1949). Proponents of simple expansion argue that use of early cut-off in the cylinder thus expanding small quantities of steam at each piston stroke obviates the need for the complication and initial expense of compounding and indeed multi-cylinder single expansion – this is an ongoing debate.|$|E

40|$|When {{introducing}} autonomous functionality {{in personal}} vehicles {{the ability to}} control the <b>quality</b> of the <b>ride</b> is transferred from the driver to the vehicle control system. In this context, a reference method for quantifying <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> may be a useful tool in the development and tuning process. This master’s thesis investigates whether general quantitative measures of <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> can be of value in the tuning of motion controllers for autonomous vehicles. A set of tools is built for a specific case study, analysing a lateral path planning algorithm, based on a finite horizon linear quadratic tracking controller, and how its tuning affects <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance. A graphical user interface is built, with functionality for frequency domainanalysis of the path planning algorithm, individually and in combination with the remaining lateral control system, as well as <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation based on lateral acceleration data, from logged test runs and simulation results. In addition, a simulation environment for the lateral control system is modified to be used in combination with the evaluation tool. Results of the case study indicate a measurable difference in <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance when comparing manual and autonomous driving with the current implementation. Attempts were made to improve <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> by re-tuning the path planning algorithm but little or no improvement from the previous tuning was made. The work has recognized the potential of using <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> measures in the development and tuning process for autonomous vehicles as well as devising a tuning strategy incorporating frequency analysis and <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation through simulation for the lateral control system. To further increase <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance via the path planning algorithm an altered controller structure, such as a frequency weighted linear quadratic controller is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{arguments}} for maintaining <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> of pavement are expanded {{in this paper}} {{to examine the effects}} of deteriorating <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> on vehicle operating costs, freight damage and logistics. The objectives of this paper are to analyse the effects of different levels of <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> on a truck and its freight, and to discuss potential applications of the analysis in terms of effectiveness of the freight transport system. The paper discusses needs and drivers influencing freight transport costs, vehicle-pavement interaction concepts, and the potential physical effects and costs from roads with deteriorating <b>riding</b> <b>quality.</b> A case study is presented analysing vehicle-pavement interaction for selected roadways in California. It is concluded that investments in pavement and freight transport industry improvements can be investigated by applying vehicle-pavement interaction analysis to evaluate damage to pavement, vehicle and freight that would result from alternative levels of pavement <b>riding</b> <b>quality.</b> The paper recommends that existing concepts, tools and resources such as dedicated truck lanes and vehicle-pavement interaction analysis can help to improve the freight transport system. A framework is proposed to better understand the scale of potential impacts of <b>riding</b> <b>quality</b> from localised effects to larger-scale influences, including costs to customers and global competitiveness.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of magnetically levitated (maglev) ground transportation systems has important consequences {{for safety and}} <b>ride</b> <b>quality,</b> guideway design, and system costs. <b>Ride</b> <b>quality</b> is determined by vehicle response and by environmental factors such as humidity and noise. The dynamic {{response of}} the vehicles is the key element in determining <b>ride</b> <b>quality,</b> while vehicle stability is an important safety-related element.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a summary index of a rutted profile for the estimation of <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> of road vehicles in a rutted road. First, the spatial frequency analysis of the rutted profiles by the continuous wavelet transform is conducted to comprehend the wavy characteristics of the profiles associated with the vehicle motion caused by the lane-change maneuver in the rutting. The result shows that the wavy characteristics in the wavelength of 0. 4 m affect the vehicle dynamics with respect to the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> deterioration. Second, a difference filter is designed to detect the wavelength of 0. 4 m from a rutted profile. The filtering manipulation enhances the wavy characteristics of the profile corresponding to the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> of the vehicle. Finally, we develop a summary index of the profile that is the difference between maximum and minimum elevation of the filtered profile. The result of regression analysis shows that the developed index highly correlates with the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> rating value based on the vehicle dynamics.
