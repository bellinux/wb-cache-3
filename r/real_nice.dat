500|$|Hammerstein and Rodgers {{returned}} to the Liliom project in mid-1944. [...] Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing {{that no matter what}} they did, Molnár would disapprove of the results. [...] Green Grow the Lilacs had been a little-known work; Liliom was a theatrical standard. [...] Molnár's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society. [...] A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy. [...] Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers. [...] He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in Liliom; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge. [...] "This Was a <b>Real</b> <b>Nice</b> Clambake" [...] was repurposed from a song, [...] "A <b>Real</b> <b>Nice</b> Hayride", written for Oklahoma! but not used.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Bateman in American Psycho mistakenly {{attributes}} a quote by Kemper to Ed Gein, saying [...] "You {{know what}} Ed Gein said about women?... He said 'When I see {{a pretty girl}} walking down the street, I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out, talk to her, be <b>real</b> <b>nice</b> and sweet and treat her right... what her head would look like on a stick'." ...|$|E

500|$|Everyone reminisces {{about the}} huge meal and much fun ("This Was a <b>Real</b> <b>Nice</b> Clambake"). [...] Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks {{in at the}} wrong moment, and {{declares}} that he is finished with her ("Geraniums In the Winder"), as Jigger jeers ("There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman"). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that [...] "he's your feller and you love him" [...] ("What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"). [...] Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. [...] She begs him {{to give it to}} her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, it was like I was looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together <b>real</b> <b>nice</b> and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E
500|$|When {{the pair}} {{decided to make}} [...] "This Was a <b>Real</b> <b>Nice</b> Clambake" [...] into an {{ensemble}} number, Hammerstein realized {{he had no idea}} what a clambake was like, and researched the matter. [...] Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, [...] "First came codfish chowder". [...] However, further research convinced him the proper term was [...] "codhead chowder", a term unfamiliar to many playgoers. [...] He decided to keep it as [...] "codfish". [...] When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line [...] "We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em good". [...] He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front. [...] The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back. [...] Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back. [...] One error not caught involved the song [...] "June Is Bustin' Out All Over", in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring—they actually do so in the winter. [...] Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.|$|E

500|$|The role of Kimberly Corman {{was given}} to Canadian actress A.J. Cook, who {{previously}} starred in the 1999 film The Virgin Suicides. Cook described her role as [...] "a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, {{right in front of}} her eyes, so she had to grow up quick." [...] Ellis described her role as [...] "a girl who can have some fun cause they're going on a trip and they're gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to Clear, to come and challenge Clear on a race, and to bother with Clear." [...] Cook added that [...] "it's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [...]” Ellis and Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. [...] " [...] were at the beginning of what's going to be a long successful career for her," [...] Perry cited. Michael Landes, who appeared in the TV series , was cast as Thomas Burke. Landes defined him as [...] "a <b>real</b> <b>nice,</b> decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [...] who is very intrigued to begin with" [...] and as [...] "the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector." [...] Ellis pointed out that he [...] "just wanted to find someone who's young and who can relate to these kids. It wasn't an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive. [...] brought this really good balance to his part." [...] Landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments.|$|E
2500|$|Wills {{recalled}} {{the early days}} of what became known as Western swing music in a 1949 interview. [...] "Here's the way I figure it. We sure not tryin' to take credit for swingin' it." [...] Speaking of Milt Brown and himself working with songs done by Jimmie Davis, the Skillet Lickers, Jimmie Rodgers, and others, and songs he'd learned from his father, he said that [...] "We'd pull these tunes down an set 'em in a dance category. It wouldn't be a runaway, and just lay a <b>real</b> <b>nice</b> beat behind it an the people would get to really like it. It was nobody intended to start anything in the world. We was just tryin' to find enough tunes to keep 'em dancin' to not have to repeat so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kalish {{was one of}} New Jersey's top {{high school}} {{baseball}} players. Pitching and playing outfield as a four-year starter for Red Bank Catholic High School, he won all-conference and all-division honors. As a freshman in April 2003, in his first varsity pitching start, Kalish struck out ten batters in six innings. [...] As a sophomore, in May 2004 he pitched a seven-inning no-hitter. For the season, he batted [...]507 with 32 stolen bases, and on the mound he had a 6–1 won-lost record with a 1.60 ERA. In his senior season he hit [...]422 with 30 stolen bases. [...] Baseball America reported {{that it may be}} [...] "apocryphal", but that [...] "legend has it that Kalish didn't swing and miss at a single pitch as a high school senior." [...] Confirming that, Red Sox scout Ray Fagant, who followed him in high school, said: [...] "He went his entire senior year without a swing and miss once. He made hard contact every time." [...] He batted [...]466 in high school, leading his team in batting his last three years. [...] As a pitcher, he threw an 88–89mph fastball, and what his coach called [...] "a good curveball ... a <b>real</b> <b>nice</b> change-up", and had 190 career strikeouts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{notion of}} a Frobenius {{manifold}} with a <b>nice</b> <b>real</b> structure was introduced by Hertling. It is called CDV structure (Cecotti-Dubrovin-Vafa structure). In this paper, we introduce a “positivity condition ” on CDV structures and show that any Frobenius manifold of rank two with real spectrum can be equipped with a positive CDV structure. We extend naturally the symmetries of Frobenius structures given by Dubrovin to symmetries of CDV structures, which will play an important role. 1...|$|R

50|$|Rijvers {{had given}} Van der Kuijlen free playmaker {{role in the}} team. He also formed a {{successful}} striker partnership with new signing Ralf Edström. In 1974, Van der Kuijlen scored 27 goals (which included four in a 10-0 victory against Go Ahead Eagles) and was once again crowned league topscorer. <b>Real</b> Madrid, <b>Nice,</b> Anderlecht and Valencia CF became interested in signing him, but PSV rejected any incoming offers. The offer from Madrid was kept secret by PSV director Ben van Gelder and Van der Kuijlen’s agent Jo Verstappen. The season finale was the KNVB beker final against NAC, which PSV won with 6-0. Van der Kuijlen scored a hat-trick in that match. In the 1974-75 season, Van der Kuijlen won his first Eredivisie title. He contributed to the success with 28 league goals. In November of that season, a peculiar moment occurred for Van der Kuijlen when he shot a free kick at goal in a match against FC Wageningen. The ball entered the goal, but ended up outside the goal because of {{a hole in the}} netting. After long deliberation, the referee acknowledged the goal.|$|R

40|$|The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{promotes}} {{evidence-based medicine}} throughout contemporary health care. Its guidelines {{are employed in}} the United Kingdom and elsewhere, influencing the type and quality of health care provided. NICE considers a range of evidence {{in the process of}} creating guidelines; however, the research accepted as evidence greatly relies on positivist methodologies. At times, it is unnecessarily restricted to quantitative methods of data collection. Using the Clinical Guideline 140, opioids in palliative care, as an example, it is demonstrated that the research accepted as evidence is unable to provide answers to complex problems. In addition, several inherent biases are discussed, such as age inequality and pharmaceutical company influence. In order to provide coherent and useful guidelines relevant to complex problems in a <b>real</b> world setting, <b>NICE</b> must move away from focusing on data from randomised controlled trials. Its epistemological foundation must be questioned, paving the way for alternative research paradigms to be considered as evidence and thereby enriching subsequent guidelines...|$|R
