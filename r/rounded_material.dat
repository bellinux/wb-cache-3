500|$|In a {{study of}} folk {{textiles}} of Anatolia, Greece, Linda Welters identifies the zonari as a long fringed belt constructed of sprang. [...] The zonari is a <b>rounded</b> <b>material</b> of indeterminate length around 2 or 3 meters long and is wrapped multiple times when worn. [...] From interviews conducted during the 1980s, Welters found that the technique was practiced by elderly women and regarded as a specialized skill which they worked on pairs of beams. [...] Their vocabulary had no special term to correspond with sprang, so they referred to it with descriptive phrases such as knitting with sticks, plaiting, and weaving without passing through. [...] The zonari are made from sheep's wool hand spun with a drop spindle and dyed red, blue, or black depending on local custom. [...] Zonari belts are a custom in much of Argolida and Corinthia where they are traditional dowry items worn by women from marriage onward and associated with fertility and donned on ritual occasions. [...] Welters observes that these were mostly owned and worn by older women.|$|E
50|$|Halters may be {{classified}} into two broad categories, {{depending on whether}} the material used is flat or <b>round.</b> <b>Materials</b> include cured leather, rawhide, rope, and many different fibers, including nylon, polyester, cotton, and jute. Leather and rawhide may be flat or rolled. Fibers may be woven into flat webbing or twisted into round rope. Flat or round dictates the construction method: flat materials normally are sewn to buckles or rings at attachment points; <b>round</b> <b>materials</b> are knotted or spliced. Knotted halters often are made from a single piece of rope.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{material}} properties of 26 granular analogue {{materials used in}} 14 analogue modelling laboratories. We determined physical characteristics such as bulk density, grain size distribution, and grain shape, and performed ring shear tests to determine friction angles and cohesion, and uniaxial compression tests to evaluate the compaction behaviour. Mean grain size of the materials varied between c. 100 and 400 μm. Analysis of grain shape factors shows that the four different classes of granular materials (14 quartz sands, 5 dyed quartz sands, 4 heavy mineral sands and 3 size fractions of glass beads) can be broadly {{divided into two groups}} consisting of 12 angular and 14 <b>rounded</b> <b>materials.</b> Grain shape has an influence on friction angles, with most angular materials having higher internal friction angles (between c. 35 ° and 40 °) than <b>rounded</b> <b>materials,</b> whereas well-rounded glass beads have the lowest internal friction angles (between c. 25 ° and 30 °). We interpret this as an effect of intergranular sliding versus rolling. Most angular materials have also higher basal friction angles (tested for a specific foil) than more <b>rounded</b> <b>materials,</b> suggesting that angular grains scratch and wear the foil. Most materials have an internal cohesion in the order of 20 – 100 Pa except for well-rounded glass beads, which show a trend towards a quasi-cohesionless (C < 20 Pa) Coulomb-type material. The uniaxial confined compression tests reveal that rounded grains generally show less compaction than angular grains. We interpret this {{to be related to the}} initial packing density after sifting, which is higher for rounded grains than for angular grains. Ring-shear test data show that angular grains undergo a longer strain-hardening phase than more <b>rounded</b> <b>materials.</b> This might explain why analogue models consisting of angular grains accommodate deformation in a more distributed manner prior to strain localisation than models consisting of rounded grains...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the mechanics of deformation of the four-roll pass cold rolling using an elastic-plastic finite element program. This process has been developed at the Anshan Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, People’s Republic of China, where a new four-roll pass small section cold rolling mill has been built. The initial finite element analysis has been carried out for the rolling of 8 mm square section bar from I 0 mm diameter round stock under dry friction conditions. The results show clearly how the areas of plastic dejormation develop during the rolling process. The distributions of the generalized stress and the generalized plastic strain, both on the longitudinal symmetrical plane and on the transverse cross-sections of the workpiece, have been obtained, and the pressure distribution along the arc of contact has been determined. In addition, the roll separation force and the puss elongation of the workpiece predicted by the finite element program have been compared with the corresponding values measured in experiments when rolling 6. 5 mm square section barfrom 8 mm <b>round</b> <b>material</b> with machine oil lubrication.

We present a first-look analysis of the first results from the BISTRO survey in the OMC 1 region. We see that the magnetic field lies approximately perpendicular to the famous ‘in- tegral filament’ in the densest regions of that filament. Furthermore, we see an ‘hour-glass’ magnetic field morphology extending beyond the densest region of the integral filament into the less-dense sur- <b>rounding</b> <b>material,</b> and discuss possible causes for this.

40|$|Deformation of {{sedimentary}} rocks is widespread within Valles Marineris, characterized by both plastic and brittle deformation identified in Melas, Candor and Ius Chasmata. We have identified four deformation styles using HiRISE and CTX images: km-scale convolute folds, detached slabs, folded strata and pull-apart structures. Convolute folds are detached <b>rounded</b> slabs of <b>material</b> with alternating dark and light-toned strata that show refolded folds with a fold wavelength {{of about one}} kilometer. The detached slabs are also isolated <b>rounded</b> blocks of <b>material,</b> but exhibit only highly localized evidence of stratification. The third style, folded strata, comprises continuously folded layers that are not detached. Finally, pull-apart structures are composed of stratified rock that has broken off into small irregularly-shaped pieces showing evidence of brittle deformation. Some areas exhibit multiple styles of deformation and grade from one type of deformation into another, both laterally and vertically.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} and management aspects of tracheobronchial foreign body (FB) {{in children and}} adults; to judge {{the influence of the}} operator's experience on the outcome of the procedure and to evaluate the factors associated with delayed diagnosis of FB aspiration (FBA) in children; and to compare clinical, radiologic and bronchoscopic findings in the patients with suspected FB inhalation (FBI). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of a 10 -year experience (from 1995 to 2005), involving a 1512 -bed Mansoura university hospital and a 184 -bed Mansoura emergency hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three thousand three hundred patients underwent rigid bronchoscopy for suspected FBI between 1995 and 2005 in Mansoura, Egypt. The data were analyzed in 3 groups: the patients with negative bronchoscopy for FBI (group 1), early (group 2), and delayed diagnosis (group 3). Foreign body was removed using the rigid bronchoscope with or without using the extracting forceps (Egyptian novel technique; Sersar technique). RESULTS: The penetration syndrome and decreased breath sounds were determined in a significantly higher number of the patients with FBI. The plain chest radiography revealed radiopaque foreign bodies (FBs) in 23. 56 % of all patients with FBI. Pneumonia and atelectasis were more common in the groups with negative bronchoscopy and with delayed diagnosis (P < 0. 01). The FBs were mostly of vegetable origin, such as seeds and peanuts. The Egyptian novel (Sersar) technique was used since 2004 April in 100 cases (4. 62 %) with a history of FBI (pins and or small <b>rounded</b> <b>materials).</b> It was successful in 73 cases of nonimpacted inhaled pins. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopy is indicated on appropriate history and on suspicion. To prevent delayed diagnosis, characteristic symptoms, and clinical and radiologic signs of FBI should be checked in all suspected cases. Because clinical and radiologic findings of FBI in delayed cases may mimic other disorders, the clinician must be aware of the likelihood of FBI. EBM rating: C- 4...|$|R

Background:The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the impact of a telemedical robot on trauma {{intensive}} care unit (TICU) clinician teamwork (i. e., team attitudes, behaviors, and cognitions) during patient <b>rounds.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods:Thirty-two healthcare providers who conduct rounds volunteered to take surveys assessing teamwork attitudes and cognitions at three time periods: (1) the onset of the study, (2) the end of the 30 -day control period, and (3) the end of the 30 -day experimental period, which immediately followed the control period. Rounds were recorded throughout the 30 -day control period and 30 -day experimental period to observe provider behaviors. For the initial 30 days, there was no access to telemedicine. For the final 30 days, the rounding healthcare providers had access to the RP- 7 robot (Intouch Health Inc., Santa Barbara, CA), a telemedical tool that can facilitate patient rounds conducted away from bedside. Results:Using a one-tailed, one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare trust at Times 1, 2, and 3, there was no significant effect on trust: F(2, 14) = 1. 20, p= 0. 16. When a one-tailed, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to compare transactive memory systems (TMS) at Times 1, 2, and 3 was conducted, there was no significant effect on TMS: F(2, 15) = 1. 33, p= 0. 15. We conducted a one-tailed, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to compare team psychological safety at Times 1, 2, and 3, and there was no significant effect on team psychological safety: F(2, 15) = 1. 53, p= 0. 12. There was a significant difference in communication between rounds with and without telemedicine [t(25) =- 1. 76, p< 0. 05], such that there was more task-based communication during telerounds. Telemedicine increased task-based communication and did not negatively impact team trust, psychological safety, or TMS during rounds. Conclusions:Telemedicine may offer advantages for some teamwork competencies without sacrificing the efficacy of others and may be adopted by intact rounding teams without hindering teamwork.

Gives a rational justification for using a piecewise linear plasticity material model *MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY (024), LS-DYNA software package for the engineering industry, and presents its main parameters. A technique to identify parameters of piecewise linear plasticity metal material models has been developed.
