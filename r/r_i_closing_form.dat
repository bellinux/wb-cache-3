40|$|This paper {{presents}} an advanced single network adaptive critic (SNAC) aided nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) approach for simultaneous attitude control and trajectory tracking of a micro-quadrotor. Control of micro-quadrotors is a challenging problem {{due to its}} small size, strong coupling in pitch-yaw-roll and aerodynamic effects that often need to be ignored in the control design process to avoid mathematical complexities. In the proposed SNAC aided NDI approach, the gains of the dynamic inversion design are selected {{in such a way}} that the resulting controller behaves closely to a pre-synthesized SNAC controller for the output regulation problem. However, since SNAC is based on optimal control theory, it makes the dynamic inversion controller to operate near optimal and enhances its robustness property as well. More important, it retains two major benefits of dynamic inversion: (<b>i)</b> <b>closed</b> <b>form</b> expression of the controller and (ii) easy scalability to command tracking application even without any apriori knowledge of the reference command. Effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated from six degree-of-freedom simulation studies of a micro-quadrotor.

The delay outage is defined as the probability that the requirement on the average delay in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), could not be sustained in block fading channels. In other words, the system is said to be in outage if the mean delay exceeds a certain threshold θ_m due to the retransmission mechanism of erroneous packets. Our contribution lies in two folds: <b>i)</b> A <b>closed</b> <b>form</b> expression of the end-to-end delay in relay-assisted HARQ scheme is derived. ii) Using the derived delay expression, an analytical form of the delay outage probability is proposed which might be very useful to avoid lengthy simulations...|$|R

In addition, the near focus intensity distribution for a convergent uniform amplitude wave illuminating a semicircular aperture is presented, and it is shown that the fact that the radiation pattern is symmetric only at the focal plane can be used very effectively to determine the exact location of that plane.

Qualitative principles of the effects of geometry, polarization, current efficiency, conductance, tc., on current distribution have been elucidated by Foerster (1), Gardam (2), Hoar and Agar (3), among others.

A critical review of the literature on current distribution problems in electroplating has been presented by Kronsbein (6). In solving these mathematically complex problems it has been assumed that the electrodes are equi-potential, e. g., they are infinitely good conductors. In the following, an attempt is made to clarify under what conditions the electrode can be considered equipotential, and, where the variation of potential along the electrode is not negligible, what effect this boundary condition has on the distribution of current.

40|$|Several {{episodes of}} {{hydrothermal}} activity related to periods of fracturing and/or reactivation of previous structures took place from 300 to - at least - 100 Ma, in the Sierra del Guadarrama, {{which is part}} of the crystalline axis of the Iberian Hercynian Fold Belt (Central-Iberian Zone). One of these episodes led to the formation of episyenites, which are de-quartzified and alkalinized granites. Episyenite formation took place on a regional scale and in a short period (approx. at 277 Ma). The episyenites were formed by the action of fluids at temperatures between 350 °C and 650 °C, at depths of about 6. 5 km, and in microfractured dilatancy zones developed under a regional extensional regime. These zones are crosscut by normal faults, developed during the progressive deformation process accompanying the formation of the episyenites. The calculated regional palaeostress tensor has <b>r</b> <b>I</b> <b>close</b> to vertical and σ 3 between NI 0 - 20 E and an average value of the stress ratio (Ф) of 0. 19 [Ф = (σ 2 - σ 3) /(σ 1 - σ 3) ]. Because σ 1 is close to vertical the stress tensor is compatible with an extensional deformation field. The analysis also shows that most of the faults that slip under this stress field have an average coefficient of friction of 0. 8. This extensional regime was probably accompanied by a regional thermal anomaly, as suggested by the high temperature of the fluids involved, which are amagmatic. This thermo-tectonic episode is interpreted as representative of the generalized extensional regime corresponding to the onset of the Alpine Cycle. The episode was preceded by a wrench-faulting event, equivalent to the Late Variscan event of Arthaud and Matte (1977), for which an age of - at least - 300 - 290 Ma is indicated by recent radiometric data. In its turn, this event was preceded by the regional extensional gravitative collapse of the Hercynian orogen.

I find that many of the characteristics of the Cox Ingersoll and Ross (JF, 1980) solutions extend to this more general non-affine specification. The allowance for mean reversion in the Ahn-Gao specification means that the solutions are hypergeometric rather than power functions, but the properties of these functions are nicely established, facilitating qualitative analysis.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of four essays dealing with issues on the verge of macroeconomics and finance. The first two chapters are joint with Bianca De Paoli. In the first one, we try to analyze factors causing risk premia to vary over time. The second one is an attempt to understand how these factors - manifesting themselves through swings in the desire to save for precautionary reasons - affect monetary policy. We show analytically that in endowment economies, procyclical recession expectations can 'outweigh' countercyclical changes in 'risk-aversion' - generating counterfactual risk-premium behavior. However, allowing shocks or habits to be sufficiently persistent, or explicitly accounting for the impact of habits on consumption, suffices to generate countercyclical recession risks and risk premia. We also show that taking note of precautionary saving motives justifies an accommodative policy bias in the face of persistent, adverse disturbances. Equally, policy should be more restrictive - i. e. 'lean against the wind' - following positive shocks. Both of these essays rely on approximate solutions to a simple, external habit model. In the third chapter, <b>I</b> derive <b>closed</b> <b>form</b> formulae for the model's solution. I then use these formulae to estimate the model and analyze its ability to jointly fit consumption growth and asset price data. I find no specification capable of simultaneously matching these data and argue that 'exotic' shock distributions are an unlikely panacea. In general, however, <b>closed</b> <b>form</b> formulae for asset prices cannot be derived analytically and need to be approximated. The final chapter proposes a method of doing exactly that. In contrast to several alternative approaches, the approximating function is not restricted to be a polynomial in state variables.

Solutions were given for two limiting out-of-plane constraint conditions, plane strain and plane stress. This paper is a continuation of part I, providing similar solutions of mismatch yield loads when the crack is in the interface between the weld and base plate. As in part I, useful guidelines are given for assessing welded structures with heat affected zone (HAZ) cracks, in the form of windows where the plastic yield load solutions of mismatched components can be obtained assuming the component is wholly made of either base material or weld material properties. Such guidelines could be very useful when complex components with weldments are to be assessed, for which the plastic yield load solutions are not available or difficult to find.

40|$|In a large proton {{storage ring}} the {{particles}} circulate on narrowly defined orbits for many ~ hours, and undergo about 1012 interactions with nonlinear magnetic fields. The nonlinear fields [...] include significant high multipoles from inevitable {{errors in the}} fabrication of superconducting magnets. In a first approximation one neglects collective and dissipative effects, and assumes that magnetic fields are constant. The motion is then Hamiltonian, being perturbed harmonic motion in three degrees of freedom. Since the nonlinear perturbation depends periodically on the independent variable (azimuthal location in the ring), the phase space effectively has seven _ dimensions. Thus, we deal with a generic difficulty of nonlinear mechanics in a phase space of _ [...] dimension greater than four: the complement of the set of invariant surfaces is a connected and dense set, associated with nonlinear resonances. [1, 21 A <b>r</b> b’t <b>I</b> rarily <b>close</b> to any initial condition there is an orbit that can visit remote regions of phase space by moving along resonances. The task of a-stability study {{is to show that}} this “diffusion ” along resonances proceeds so slowl...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of discovering, describing and cataloguing poorly known species in herbarium collections is discussed. It is a spur to efforts at rediscovery and consequent conservation efforts. The problems faced in describing species from limited material are discussed and our methods and criteria {{in making a}} decision are described. Prospects for future novelties are briefly assessed. Fifteen new species are described and illustrated with line drawings and distribution maps: Ipomoea attenuata J. <b>R.</b> <b>I.</b> Wood &amp; Scotland, <b>I.</b> cuscoensis J. <b>R.</b> <b>I.</b> Wood &amp; P.
