Managed contracts with customers, i. e., the agreement that certain loads are interruptible following system faults, allows distribution circuits to be loaded beyond the limits presently required for security of supply. This potentially permits load growth but avoids the cost and environmental impact of conventional network reinforcement. This paper provides the results of electrical system modelling to quantify the beneﬁts of the C 2 C operation, using actual circuit data and typical load distributions. Based upon simulations of these circuits, it is shown that increased interconnection generally leads to minor improvements in electrical losses and system voltage.

The imbalance of distribution system, constraints on nodal voltages and thermal loadings of lines and transformers are all taken into account.

It is found that the linear constrained convex quadratic programming model is applicable at each iteration, when the conventional household load is composed of constant power and constant impedance load.

This allows for the numerical simulation of the RK operation. On the basis of the known biomechanical property of the cornea, by means of the finite element method, a series of computerised geometric and biomechanical models for the simulation of refractive surgery have been established.

The greater the four variables are the more correction effects of myopia can be obtained. Because the four variables are interinfluential, the operational variables can be optimised to get the best result in order to meet patients' differing requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDistribution {{networks}} {{will experience}} a deep mutation concerning their planning and operation rules {{due to the}} expected increase of distributed generation (DG) interconnection to the grid. Indeed, {{the opening of the}} electricity market or the growing global concern for environmental issues will lead to a massive development of DGs.

40|$|In {{the riser}} of a gas-solid {{circulating}} fluidised bed (CFB) with Geldart A particles, the multiscale interactions and diverse coherent structures give rise to an important hydrodynamic phenomenon called flow intermittency. In this work, the two-fluid model incorporating the energy minimisation multi-scale (EMMS) drag model is employed to simulate the gas-solid flow in the riser. The predicted fluctuating signals are processed to acquire the intermittency indices, wavelet flatness factors, power spectra of solids volume fraction fluctuation, probability density function (PDF) of wavelet coefficients for solids fluctuating velocity, and PDF of solids volume fraction, based on which the flow intermittency and effects of coherent structures are characterised. The results {{presented in this paper}} reveal that the EMMS-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation in combination with the fluctuating signal analysis provide an in-depth understanding of the intermittent flow behaviours in the riser with Geldart A particles.

40|$|Turbine {{shaft seals}} are {{vulnerable}} to rubs caused by thermal distortion, mis-alignment and rotor dynamic vibration that are often not well understood. When seals rub as a machine is brought up to operating conditions performance is compromised due to increased seal leakage. Much effort has been extended {{in recent years to}} develop seals that mitigate those losses. This paper presents a seal design with segmented film riding runners capable of non-contacting seal operation during rotor transients. Operating differential seal pressure displaces seal leaves and attached runners toward the rotor surface until balanced by hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lift. Sufficient <b>radial</b> range of <b>operation</b> is provided to follow the rotor seal surface during transients while maintaining a small seal clearance.

In the so-called virtual shell (VS) <b>operation,</b> <b>radial</b> field zeroing at the thin shell radius is stationary provided by the feedback-controlled coils. First experiments on RFX-mod proved the capability of the active scheme to steadily reduce the radial magnetic field. Furthermore {{it has been found}} that such edge magnetic field control extends its beneficial effects to the whole plasma. With respect to the old RFX, where magnetohydrodynamic modes amplitude was controlled by the use of a passive thick conductive shell, a stationary 2 - to 3 -fold reduction of the Br field amplitude in the core is obtained. The reduction of field fluctuations positively reflects on confinement. In fact, a strong reduction of the loop voltage is observed and correspondingly a 3 -fold increase in pulse length is achieved by using the same poloidal flux swing. Temperature and particle measurements confirm the improved confinement properties of the VS operation. With a lower ohmic input power, higher electron temperature and lower particle influx are measured. Particle and heat transport have been studied by means of a 1 D code. Local power balance was used to compute the heat conductivity profile: for the VS discharges a lower conductivity over a significant region of the plasma is found. The improved properties of RFX-mod VS operation provide a better confinement scaling in terms of plasma current. The results show that compared with the thick shell configuration, a significant confinement improvement can be obtained under stationary conditions by actively controlling the plasma magnetic boundary...|$|R
40|$|An Electric Sail is {{a revolutionary}} propellant-less {{propulsion}} {{system that is}} ideal for deep space missions to the outer planets, the Heliopause, and beyond. It is revolutionary in that it uses momentum exchange with the hypersonic solar wind to propel a spacecraft within the heliosphere. The momentum exchange {{is affected by the}} deflection of charged solar wind particles by an array of electrically biased wires that extend outward up to 30 km from a slowly rotating spacecraft. A high-voltage, positive bias on the wires, which are oriented normal to the solar wind flow, deflects the streaming protons, resulting in a reaction force on the wires that is also directed radially away from the sun. Over a period of months, this small force can accelerate the spacecraft to enormous speeds-on the order of 100 - 150 km/s (approximately 20 to 30 AU/yr). Unlike solar sails, Electric Sails do not rely on a fixed area to produce thrust. In fact, as they move away from the Sun and solar wind pressure decreases, the area for solar proton momentum transfer becomes larger, increasing system efficiency. As a result, thrust decreases at 1 /r**(7 / 6) instead of the 1 /r** 2 rate typical for solar sails. The net effect is that an increased <b>radial</b> range of <b>operation,</b> together with increased thrust, both contribute to higher velocities and shorter total trip times to distant destinations. The MSFC Advanced Concepts Office (ACO) was awarded a Phase II NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) study to mature the technology for possible future demonstration and implementation.
