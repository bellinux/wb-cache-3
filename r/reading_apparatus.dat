40|$|We propose {{an optical}} {{read-out}} scheme allowing {{a demonstration of}} principle of information extraction below the diffraction limit. This technique, {{which could lead to}} improvement in data read-out density onto optical discs, is independent from the wavelength and numerical aperture of the <b>reading</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and involves a multi-pixel array detector. Furthermore, we show how to use non classical light in order to perform bit discrimination beyond the quantum noise limit. Comment: 9 page...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of optical sensors based on Bloch surface waves propagating at the truncation edge of one-dimensional photonic crystals. The sensors can be simultaneously operated in both a label-free mode, where small refractive index changes at the surface are detected, and a fluorescence mode, where the fluorescence from a novel heptamethyne dye label in {{the proximity of the}} surface is collected. The two modes operate in the near-infrared spectral range with the same configuration of the optical <b>reading</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The limit of detection is shown to be smaller than that of equivalent surface plasmon sensors and the fluorescence collection efficiency is such that it can be efficiently analyzed by the same camera sensor used for label-free operation.

40|$|A barcode <b>reading</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{and method}} {{in which the}} {{spectrum}} of a probe light is first Fourier-transformed into space, directed upon a barcode, and then Fourier-transformed converting the spectrally encoded barcode pattern to a time domain waveform. In one implementation, the Fourier transformation from the spectrum domain into a spatial domain is performed by a dispersive element, while the Fourier transformation from the spectrally encoded barcode pattern to a time domain waveform is performed by group-velocity dispersion (GVD). The temporally encoded barcode pattern is detected by a photodetector, digitized by a digitizer, and analyzed by a digital signal processor.; The invention is applicable {{to a number of}} fields which involve the reading of one- and two-dimensional barcodes, displacement sensing, surface measurements, measurement of width and gap, flow cytometry, reading of optical media, presense or absence detection, and other related fields. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|In {{a program}} {{designed}} to lower exposure to anesthetic gases, nitrous oxide in the breathing zone of anesthesiologists was continuously monitored by means of a direct <b>reading</b> <b>apparatus</b> and a specially designed collar. Initially, the average concentration during anesthesia in intubated patients, determined in 30 operating rooms of seven hospitals, was 68 ppm. During mask anesthesia in children, it was 407 ppm (nine operating rooms, nine hospitals). The main hygienic measures were: a check of the anesthesia apparatus, improvement of the general ventilation in the operating room, and the application of a "double mask. " With a combination of measures, the concentration during anesthesia in intubated patients was reduced from 61 - 90 ppm to 2 - 15 ppm. During mask anesthesia in children, the concentration decreased from 134 - 764 ppm to 9 - 42 ppm. The monitoring system used reveals important differences in the exposure during the separate phases of the anesthesia (induction, maintenance, and extubation). It also indicates which factors determine the exposure of the anesthetist and allows accurate determination of the personal exposur...|$|E

40|$|Pier Paolo Pasolini {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} but also most misunderstood Italian artists and intellectuals of last century, a cultural and artistic myth often understood and used in excessively sectorial or expedient ways. This dissertation defines and explores Pasolini's carefully constructed authorial apparatus, in the sense attributed to this term by Michael Foucault. It argues that Pasolini's authorial apparatus is a labyrinthine subjective construction, which functions within the gigantic interdisciplinary macro-structure of Pasolini's body of work, demanding from its audience a comprehensive <b>reading.</b> Pasolini's authorial <b>apparatus</b> is deconstructed in this dissertation while following the making of Pasolini's incredibly complex body of work, which, crossing medium and disciplinary boundaries, includes poetry, narrative, film, but also theater, essays and even painting...|$|R
40|$|The {{fascinating}} and unexpected syndromes asso-ciated with focal {{insult to the}} brain have led to important advances {{in our understanding of}} human cognition. Cognitive neuroscience builds on such observations to investigate how we can read this sentence and to solve other mental problems that previously seemed so impenetrable. Several engag-ing books have been published recently by world-class experts in the field, and this review samples some of the thinking presented in these superb volumes. Consider the complexity of the mental processes involved in <b>reading.</b> Our visual <b>apparatus</b> interprets a random set of squiggles as symbols representing the letters of a word. The arbitrary pairing of each word with its associated concept is decoded in our mental dictionary, and our grammatical processo...|$|R

A two year study by the National Foundation for Educational Research, of the organisation of reading as a subject in infant schools, and factors influencing children's performance. Main Topics : Reading methods used in infant class (alphabetic, phonic, look and say sentence), whether approach tends to be formal or reading scheme or series used (e. g. 'Janet & John', 'Beacon' etc.), with reasons for use, whether this is supplemented by other readers, whether children are allowed to take home basic readers, whether <b>reading</b> <b>apparatus</b> is used for class or individual purposes, record of tests used in infant department, provision made for 'backward' readers, {{whether there is an}} infant department library and how this is organised. More general information on the school includes: age and description of physical conditions of infant school; organization of classes (i. e. junior, junior with infants); number of teachers in infant school; social class of locality. Information on child's school record includes: absenteeism; attitude towards school; intellectual ability; rate of progress; reading readiness estimate; estimates of child's development (9 groups of statements: e. g. good or adequate oral vocabulary, fluent clear speech, interested in all kinds of books, keen to read, learns quickly etc.); teacher's prediction of future reading ability at 7 years + (3 categories); percentage of pupils able to read at end of infant course; contact between teacher and parents (i. e. whether there is a parent teacher association, whether the teacher visits homes for any reason, the percentage of parents who come to see the teacher). Background information on the child includes: sex; date of birth; parents' occupation; whether child attended a nursery school. Data is also given on home background generally (e. g. does the child come from a home where there is a well ordered routine), the child's personality characteristics (14 categories: e. g. happy, lazy, polite... etc.). Further information recorded includes: the interest shown by parents in the child's school progress and encouragement given, and whether, in the teacher's opinion, these factors influence the child's performance (questions are designed to assess whether teachers differ in their estimates of the child when asked to assess the background of individuals instead of pupils in general). Information on the teacher includes: age; education; teaching experience etc. Attitude and personality scales are also included: e. g. indicating feelings toward parents and children, views on the role and influence of the school and tendencies towards authoritarianism in general outlook...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{identify}} the books used by John Grandisson, by establishing the principal characteristics of his handwriting and the marks he used when annotating texts. Grandisson annotated not only his own books, but also the Cathedral's, and those he borrowed. He used books to educate himself and to prepare himself {{for his role as}} bishop (Chapter II). From his early books, two salient features of his personality appear: his penchant for turning to sources to find truth, which caused him to learn Hebrew; and his predilection to acquire originalia of the Church Fathers, out of which he developed an enduring admiration for Augustine. Chapter III describes Grandisson's activity in Exeter Cathedral books to make them easier to <b>read.</b> He added <b>apparatus</b> for quick-reference: indexes, tables of contents, running titles, chapter and subject headings. His paraph and paragraphus marks indicate beginnings, and his Nota signs, brackets, and excerpt marks identify sententiae. Chapter IV discusses briefly the content of Grandisson's glosses and other annotations, which reveals a wide range of interests, not only in theology and canon law, but also in history and natural science. He assembled the largest extant collection of Anselm's letters. Other interests include Virgil's poetry, Seneca's tragedies, romances of the Grail, and miracles of the Virgin. The Ordinal with Kalendar attributed to Grandisson survives only in s. xv copies which incorporate feasts introduced after Grandisson's time. Chapter V discusses the contemporary evidence (including books he used) for assessing Grandisson's activity in the production of the Ordinal for his Cathedral Church. Grandisson had a lifelong interest in the relative roles of Church and State; thus, he wrote a 'Life of Becket' (Chapter VI), drawing from many contemporary sources. No doubt his study enabled him to take a confident stand in maintaining the liberties of the Church from c. 1340 {{to the end of his}} life. Grandisson's ideal was to be a pastoral bishop. Books helped him in decision-making, in learning his vocation, in educating his clergy. They also sustained him, as man and bishop, through a fruitful career. </p...|$|R
