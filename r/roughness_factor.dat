40|$|This thesis gives a {{suggestion}} of a method for extracting the <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> for estimating the sprayed concrete volume in tunnel applications. The determination of the <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> today is based on experience and is usually done by guessing or based on the <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> used in the previous blasted round. This study includes creating a look-up-chart which could enable the contractor and engineer {{to have a better}} foundation and documentation on why the <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> is chosen as it is. This is performed by using LiDAR scanning system and using the LiDAR data from the rock mass surface from a water cavern close to Lillestr&# 248;m in Norway. A comparison of the LiDAR data and the hand mapped data is performed, regarding special features in the rock mass, such as geometry, major structures and weakness zones. The LiDAR data display the true surface of the rock mass and visualizing geometry is possible with the LiDAR model. Measurements of the generated profiles in the cavern have been performed on selected areas extracting <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> between the rock mass surface and the sprayed concrete surface. Calculating the <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> using profile length is a cumbersome method to use due to the holes in the data. It is recommended that the Lidar model is as watertight as possible and this requires more precise processing of the data. The calculated average roughness factors have been correlated to the corresponding Q-value, the RQD/J_n-quotient, RQD and the joint set number J_n. From the results of the correlation it is suggested to use the Q-value and the joint set number J_n as a basis for the look-up-chart. Generally the results indicate that the <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> increases with decreasing Q-value. In addition it could be seen that the <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> value increased with approximately 0, 2 for every increasing value of the joint set number. It must be emphasized that this is {{a suggestion}} based on only one test site. The method used to find the <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> is recommended evaluated. It may be possible that large scale roughness requires a larger <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> to meet the requirement of minimum sprayed concrete thickness. Further studies are necessary. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Surface {{microrelief}} {{is frequently}} characterized using random <b>roughness</b> <b>factors</b> (RRF) defined by Allmaras et al. (1966). Random <b>roughness</b> <b>factors</b> are usually measured using a pin roughness meter or laser. Saleh (1993) recently proposed the chain method {{as a relatively}} simple, fast, and inexpensive technique for characterizing surface microrelief. The chain method {{is based on the}} principle that as a chain of given length is placed across a surface, the horizontal distance covered by the chain will decrease as surface roughness increases. Reductions in chain length caused by surface roughness are described as Saleh <b>roughness</b> <b>factors</b> (SRF). In this study, RRF and SRF were identified {{for a wide range of}} surface roughness conditions. The standard deviations in SRF obtained on al m 2 area were reported. Regression equations were developed for estimating RRF and SRF. The equations, which include rainfall as a dependent variable, can be used for RRF varying from 2. 59 to 37. 23 mm (0. 10 to 1. 47 in.) and SRF ranging from 2. 65 to 34. 56.

40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze the {{influence}} of process parameters on the morphology of highly porous platinum electrodes, fabricated by co-deposition of platinum-copper alloy and subsequent selective dissolution of the less noble copper during multiple cyclic voltammetry scans. Thereto the Cu 2 + concentration in the deposition electrolyte, the negative scan limit, and the scan rate were varied. Corresponding electrodes were characterized by their surface texture (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry), specific surface area, and elemental compositions (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy). Under conditions enforcing precursor depletion a sphere-dominated structure is observed, whereas oppositional configurations lead to smoother, mud-crack pattern like structures. Electrodes of high specific surface area are obtained particularly when high copper ion concentrations (100 mmol l− 1 CuSO 4, <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> 3740 ± 270), high negative scan limits (− 0. 800 V vs. SCE, <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> 3790 ± 370) and low scan speeds (1 mV s− 1, <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> 3930 ± 370) compared to standard parameters (20 mmol l− 1 CuSO 4, − 0. 600 V vs. SCE negative scan limit, 1 mV s− 1, <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> 3040 ± 300) were applied during fabrication.

The values obtained from the two methods are in excellent agreement. The Rf values, ranging from 848 ± 50 to 4260 ± 60, are within the highest in the open literature. A simulation, of the effect of the oxide loading on the coatings Rf values, was performed using just the experimental values of the <b>roughness</b> <b>factors</b> for oxide free foam and pelleted electrodes.

Identical sets of simulations were carried out with the model starting from the initial state of the atmosphere on June 15, for the years 1979 and 1980.

The <b>roughness</b> <b>factor</b> for TiO 2 /PAA/PTFE membrane decreased greatly to 1.275 compared with 2.132 for PAA/PTFE membrane, which may be attributed to the uniform distribution of TiO 2 and thick TiO 2 coating layer (mass gain rate for TiO 2 /PAA/PTFE is 22  % compared to the mass of PAA/PTFE membrane). It is worth mentioning that the reduction of average pore size (listed in Table  1) arising from coating also contributed to the smoother surface of TiO 2 /PAA/PTFE membranes.|$|E
