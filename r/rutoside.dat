Edema is a relevant aspect of long-haul flights affecting both patients with venous disease and normal subjects. Microcirculatory variations during flights cause a microangiopathy and biochemical and coagulation alterations. This condition may be defined as flight microangiopathy.

In the presented study, raw materials of wild growing P. veris and P. elatior were compared in terms of the content and composition of phenolic compounds using a fast and simple HPLC-DAD method. The study showed that flowers of both species were rich in flavonoids. However, P. veris flowers were characterized with a distinctly higher content of isorhamnetin- 3 -O-glucoside, astragalin, and (+) -catechin, whereas P. elatior occurred to be a richer source of <b>rutoside</b> and isorhamnetin- 3 -O-rutinoside.

40|$|Postthrombotic {{syndrome}} (PTS) is {{a chronic}} complication of {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) that reduces {{quality of life and}} has important socioeconomic consequences. More than one-third of patients with DVT will develop PTS, and 5 % to 10 % of patients will develop severe PTS, which may manifest as venous ulceration. The principal risk factors forPTSarepersistent legsymptoms 1 month after the acute episode of DVT, extensive DVT, recurrent ipsilateral DVT, obesity, and older age. Daily use of elastic compression stockings (ECSs) for 2 years after proximal DVT appears {{to reduce the risk of}} PTS; however, there is uncertainty about optimal duration of use and compression strength of ECSs and the magnitude of their effect.

Res. 14 (1995) 203]; now, {{we describe the}} distribution in the mtDNA from lymphocytes of a heteroplasmic sequence variation that was originally found in the mtDNA from the postmortem brain of a patient with schizophrenia. The variant is m. 12027 T>C and results in the change from isoleucine to threonine at position 423 of the ND 4 subunit of NADH-ubiquinone reductase. Using a PCR-RFLP method, we have determined the heteroplasmy as the ratio of variant to total (variant ratio) at m. 12027 in 184 controls and 181 patients with schizophrenia as well as 24 postmortem brain samples. The distribution of variants is bimodal having peaks at variant ratios of 0. 262 and 0. 732. The variant-rich fraction is very significantly associated with schizophrenia in males (47 %), while there is only 18 % in control males.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} dietary compounds on {{the formation of}} aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and colorectal tumours and on {{the expression of a}} selection of genes were studied in rats. Azoxymethane-treated male F 344 rats were fed either a control diet or a diet containing 10 % wheat bran (WB), 0. 2 % curcumin (CUR), 4 % rutin (RUT) or 0. 04 % benzyl isothiocyanate (BIT) for 8 months. ACF were counted after 7, 15 and 26 weeks. Tumours were scored after 26 weeks and 8 months. We found that the WB and CUR diets inhibited the development of colorectal tumours. In contrast, the RUT and BIT diets rather enhanced (although not statistically significantly) colorectal carcinogenesis. In addition, the various compounds caused different effects on the development of ACF. In most cases the number or size of ACF was not predictive for the ultimate tumour yield. The expression of some tumour-related genes was significantly different in tumours from the control group as compared to tumours from the treated groups. It was concluded that WB and CUR, as opposed to RUT and BIT, protects against colorectal cancer and that ACF are unsuitable as biomarker for colorectal cancer. Effects of the different dietary compounds on metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP- 1) expression correlated well with the effects of the dietary compounds on the ultimate tumour yield. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} the triple combination Phlogenzym (<b>rutoside,</b> bromelain, and trypsin) with double combinations, the single substances, and placebo. Design: Multinational, multicentre, double blind, randomised, parallel group design with eight groups structured according to a factorial design. Setting: Orthopaedic surgery and emergency departments in 27 European hospitals. Participants: A total of 721 patients aged 16 - 53 years presenting with acute unilateral sprain of the lateral ankle joint. Primary efficacy criteria: (a) Pain on walking one or two steps, {{as defined by the}} patient on a visual analogue scale. (b) The range of motion, as measured by the investigator and expressed as a sum of flexion and extension. (c) The volume of the injured ankle measured with a volometer. Results: At the primary end point at seven days, the greatest reduction in pain was in the bromelain/ trypsin group (73. 7 %). The Phlogenzym group showed a median reduction of 60. 3 %, and the placebo group showed a median reduction of 73. 3 %. The largest increase in range of motion (median) was in the placebo group (60 % change from baseline). The Phlogenzym group showed a median increase of 42. 9 %. The biggest decrease in swelling was in the trypsin group (3. 9 % change from baseline). The Phlogenzym group showed a - 2. 30 % change from baseline and the placebo group a - 2. 90 % change. In the subgroup analysis of patients who did not use a Caligamed brace, Phlogenzym was superior to placebo for the summarising directional test of the primary efficacy criteria (MW = 0. 621; LB-CI 0. 496; p = 0. 029; one sided Wei-Lachin procedure). The vast majority of doctors and patients rated the tolerability of all treatments tested as very good or at least good.

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that quercetin promotes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle both in vivo and in vitro. However, Saponara et al. [(2002) Br J Pharmacol 135 : 1819 - 1827] have demonstrated that quercetin is an activator of vascular L-type Ca 2 + channels. Aim of the study: We investigated the mechanical and electrophysiological properties of quercetin and its <b>rutoside,</b> rutin, in an attempt to clarify how Ca 2 + channel activation might be related to the myorelaxing activity. Methods: Aorta ring preparations and single tail artery myocytes were employed for functional and patch-clamp experiments, respectively. Results: Rutin was found to relax intact rat aorta rings, which had been precontracted with phenylephrine (pIC 50 = 5. 65 ± 0. 3 1) but in contrast had no effect on depolarised (60 mM K+) preparations or on those from which the endothelium had been removed. Furthermore, rutin did not affect L-type Ca 2 + current recorded in rat tail artery myocytes. The quercetin-induced relaxation of intact rings precontracted with phenylephrine exhibited two components characterised by 6. 23 ± 0. 38 and 4. 66 ± 0. 09 pIC 50, respectively. Removal of the endothelium abolished the first component, leaving the second unaltered. Moreover, quercetin was found to relax 60 mM K+ depolarised rings with a pIC 50 of 4. 59 ± 0. 03. The application of quercetin in isolated smooth muscle cells brought about a marked increase of L-type Ca 2 + current (pEC 50 = 5. 09 ± 0. 05). Unlike quercetin, Bay K 8644 contracted aorta rings preincubated with 10, 20 or 30 mM K+. The myotonic effect of Bay K 8644 was observed both in the absence or presence of 30 μM quercetin. The application of Bay K 8644 (10 - 100 nM) caused a further significant increase in L-type Ca 2 + current in rat tail artery myocytes stimulated with 30 μM quercetin. Conclusions: Quercetin is a naturally occurring L-type Ca 2 + channel agonist. This effect, however, is overwhelmed by quercetin-induced vasorelaxation taking place via pathways which are more relevant than L-type Ca 2 + influx in the hierarchy of functional competencies...|$|E
