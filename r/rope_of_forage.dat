At {{this point the}} entwined pair purchased Manka's Inverness Lodge in Inverness which was a former 1918 hunting lodge that was converted to a guest lodge with restaurant years prior to their purchase. Alice Waters {{a pioneer in the}} California cuisine movement and the founder of Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley mentored Gradé during this time of new beginnings and they remain good friends. Manka's was one of the 50-best hotel restaurants in the U.S. in 2003 according to Food & Wine magazine. The Zagat survey for 2007 ranked it in the top-5 of their top-30. Manka's is known as a quiet hideaway even for celebrities. Prince Charles of England (the Prince of Wales) and his new wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, previously Camilla Parker Bowles, took over the entire main lodge at Manka's during their West Marin tour of local farmers and ranchers learning the <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> farm-to-table <b>foraging.</b> They were escorted on their tour by Waters and Gradé. A few months later the main lodge that they stayed in and its attached restaurant burned to the ground during a severe winter windstorm.

40|$|Forage fish play {{a pivotal}} role in marine {{ecosystems}} and economies worldwide by sustaining many predators and fisheries directly and indirectly. We estimate global forage fish contributions to marine ecosystems through a synthesis of 72 published Ecopath models from around the world. Three distinct contributions <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> fish were examined: (i) the ecological support service <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> fish to predators in marine ecosystems, (ii) the total catch and value <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> fisheries and (iii) the support service <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> fish to the catch and value of other commercially targeted predators. Forage fish use and value varied and exhibited patterns across latitudes and ecosystem types. Forage fish supported many kinds of predators, including fish, seabirds, marine mammals and squid. Overall, forage fish contribute a total of about $ 16. 9 billion USD to global fisheries values annually, i. e. 20 % of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries combined. While the global catch value <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> fisheries was $ 5. 6 billion, fisheries supported by forage fish were more than twice as valuable ($ 11. 3 billion). These estimates provide important information for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> fish across ecosystem types, latitudes and globally.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to analyze the influence of increasing levels <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> cactus Opuntia in the diet on the nitrogen balance, the concentrations of urea in urine and plasma and microbial protein synthesis in dairy heifers ¾ Holstein-zebu confined. twenty four heifers were used with initial body weight of 163. 00 ± 18 kg, with 8 months old and distributed in a completely randomized design with four treatments and six replications. It was used sorghum silage, concentrate and increasing levels <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> cactus Opuntia in the diet (0, 200, 400 and 600 g kg- 1). The nitrogen intake, feces and urine, digested and retained with the addition <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> cactus in the diet showed decreasing linear effect. Nitrogen balance {{was influenced by the}} inclusion <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> cactus in the diet of dairy heifers through the values observed for the digested and retained nitrogen, which can be related to similar effects found for the consumption of nitrogen and the nitrogen excretion in feces and urine. Nitrogen digested percentage of intake and nitrogen retention as a percentage of ingested and digested showed no difference with the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> cactus in the diet. The concentration of urea nitrogen in the urine of heifers had a quadratic effect point of maximum excretion level of 275. 80 g kg- 1 <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> cactus in the diet.

40|$|To {{indicate}} {{possibilities for}} the use <b>of</b> <b>forages</b> from seminatural grasslands in ruminant production systems, a literature study to describe the nutritive value <b>of</b> those <b>forages</b> was carried out. In species-rich grasslands, the digestibility <b>of</b> <b>forages</b> is usually lower than the digestibility <b>of</b> <b>forages</b> produced by grasslands used for intensive production. There is also more variation within a species-rich sward, because of different stages of maturity of the individual species and because of likely variations in digestibility among <b>forage</b> species independent <b>of</b> stage of maturity. Moreover, the presence of dicotyledonous species may have a positive or negative effect on digestibility. In forages from seminatural grasslands, the relationship between chemical composition and digestibility {{differs from that of}} Lolium perenne, which is often used as a research standard. Therefore, predictions of the digestibility <b>of</b> species-rich <b>forage</b> can be inaccurate. The relationship between in vivo and in vitro digestibility may also be different from the relationship that is common for L. perenne. In some cases, the in vivo digestibility is higher than the in vitro value, as calibrations are based on L. perenne. Therefore, the quality <b>of</b> <b>forages</b> from seminatural grasslands might be higher than predicted, and this may increase the scope for practical use of this kind <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> in ruminant nutrition systems...|$|R

40|$|In the past, {{adoption}} <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> technologies {{has been}} poor. This paper considers {{the reasons for}} this low level of adoption and how the situation has changed in recent years. Experiences, mostly in south-east Asia and some in east Africa, have shown that participatory approaches in the development of technology are the key to integration <b>of</b> <b>forages</b> into smallholder upland farming systems. This paper describes how projects went through the formal and informal stages <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> evaluation. Several key characteristics of communities were identified that determined whether forages could have an impact. A participatory approach was developed, which enhanced both forage technology development and its scaling-out to new areas. Some important data were generated on the environmental adaptation <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> varieties. A model for scaling-out forage technologies was developed. There are several stages <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> adoption, in which grass and legume species play different roles.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we prove that most <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> {{arbitrary}} multiplicity, supported on smooth curves can be smoothed. By a rope being smoothable we mean that the rope is the flat limit {{of a family of}} smooth, irreducible curves. To construct a smoothing, we connect, on the one hand, deformations of a finite morphism to projective space and, on the other hand, morphisms from a rope to projective space. We also prove a general result of independent interest, namely, finite covers onto smooth irreducible curves embedded in projective space can be deformed to a family of 1 : 1 maps. We apply our general theory to prove the smoothing <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> multiplicity 3 on P 1. Even though this article focuses on <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> dimension 1, our method yields a general approach to deal with the smoothing <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> higher dimension. 1...|$|R

Escape <b>of</b> <b>forage</b> can often be observed as forage lying on the ground or on top of equipment surfaces.
