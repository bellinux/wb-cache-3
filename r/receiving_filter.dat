5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the <b>receiving</b> <b>filter</b> completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

Under {{the assumption that}} the channel has a finite memory and that the noise is additive Gaussian, an optimum receiver is sought {{in the form of a}} linear <b>receiving</b> <b>filter</b> followed by a symbol-rate sampler and a memoryless decision device. The <b>receiving</b> <b>filter</b> is chosen so as to minimize the mean-square error between the input to the decision device and the transmitted symbol. It is shown that the structure of the optimum <b>receiving</b> <b>filter</b> corresponds to a bank of matched filters, each followed by a linear transversal filter. The number of matched filters is equal to the number of linearly independent waveforms that can be observed at the channel output in a symbol period.

40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of <b>receive</b> <b>filtering</b> in a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) handset receiver is to attenuate out-of-channel interference to provide channel selectivity. A UMTS handset receiver using a <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> adaptive on out-of-channel interfer- ence level can be more computationally efficient than a handset with a fixed <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> provided that the hand- set operates in low out-of-channel interference conditions often enough. The UMTS Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) test case requires the adaptive <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> to pro- vide a worst case ACS of 33 dB. An adaptive <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> is more computationally efficient than a fixed receive fil- ter when the required ACS is less than 23 dB, because the added complexity of measuring the out-of-channel interfer- ence is compensated for by the reduction in the required number of filter taps to achieve the ACS. Measurements of the out-of-channel interference show that currently the interference levels for which the maximum ACS of 33 dB is required are hardly ever reached in practice. For the currently measured interference levels an adaptive <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> will be computationally more efficient than a fixed <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> 97 % of the time. However, the current out-of-channel interference mea- surements might be on the optimistic side, because the loads of the UMTS networks are low. When these loads in- crease in the future, the out-of-channel interference levels may increase and the advantage in computational efficiency of the adaptive <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> will be reduced...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the design and}} analysis of a filter at the receiver of a source coding system to mitigate the excess distortion caused due to channel errors. The index output by the source encoder is sent over a fading discrete binary symmetric channel and the possibly incorrect received index is mapped to the corresponding codeword by a Vector Quantization (VQ) decoder at the receiver. The output of the VQ decoder is then processed by a <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> to obtain {{an estimate of the}} source instantiation. The distortion performance is analyzed for weighted mean square error (WMSE) and the optimum <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> that minimizes the expected distortion is derived for two different cases of fading. It is shown that the performance of the system with the <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> is strictly better than that of a conventional VQ and the difference becomes more significant as the number of bits transmitted increases. Theoretical expressions for an upper and lower bound on the WMSE performance of the system with the <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> and a Rayleigh flat fading channel are derived. The design of a <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> in the presence of channel mismatch is also studied and it is shown that a minimax solution is the one obtained by designing the <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> for the worst possible channel.

The losses are smaller when a LMMSE <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> (2 %) is applied compared to a MRC filter (5 %). The <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> selection is more important in case of limited CSI. This is expected since the LMMSE filter cancels out the remaining interference at the receiving side.

40|$|This letter proposes the Faster-than-Nyquist {{signaling}} (FTNS) using overlap {{frequency domain}} equalization (FDE), which compensates the inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to band limiting filters of the FTNS at the transmitter and the receiver {{as well as}} the frequency selective fading channel. Since overlap FDE does not require any guard interval (GI) at the transmitter such as cyclic prefix (CP), higher spectral efficiency can be achieved compared to FTNS scheme using the conventional FDE. In the proposed method, the equalizer weight is derived based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion taking the colored noise due to the <b>receiving</b> <b>filter</b> into consideration.

In practical systems, the design of specific interference alignment schemes is subject to various criteria and constraints. In this paper, we propose novel transceiver schemes for the MIMO interference channel based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion. Our objective is to optimize the system performance under a given and feasible degree of freedom. Both the total MSE and the maximum per-user MSE are chosen to be the objective functions to minimize. We show that the joint design of transmit precoding matrices and <b>receiving</b> <b>filter</b> matrices with both objectives can be realized through efficient iterative algorithms. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is proven as well. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed schemes out-perform the existing IA schemes in terms of BER performance.

30|$|Robust {{waveform}} {{design to}} resist uncertainty sets of target or clutter parameters (i.e., Doppler frequency, angle) has received considerable attention {{during the last}} decades [4 – 19]. According {{to the structure of}} radar systems, these works can be classified into two categories. The first one focuses on the robust design for monostatic radar systems. Specifically, in [4], the design of robust radar code under energy and similarity constraints is investigated to improve the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the possible target Doppler frequencies by using semidefinite programming (SDP)-related technique. In [5], the robust approach based on SDP and randomization with respect to the target Doppler is proposed to synthesize the radar waveform accounting for a peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR) and an energy constraint in order to the improvement of the worst-case SNR. For the detection problem of the extended target with the uncertain set on target impulse response (TIR), the robust transmit waveform accounting for constant modulus constraint and <b>receiving</b> <b>filter</b> have been designed jointly. In [6], considering worst-case SINR as the performance measure and assuming an interval of target Doppler shift are available, the robust design of transmit sequence and receive filter under energy and similarity constraints has been considered by exploiting related SDP relaxation. Considering the same criteria, the uncertain set, and waveform constraints, the related generalized Dinkelbach’s procedure [7] is developed to optimize radar waveform and doppler filter bank. For extended targets considering the uncertainties on the TIR and using the PAR and energy as signal constraints, in [8], a design procedure, based on SDP relaxation and randomization technique, is proposed to devise robust transmit code and receive filter aiming to improve the worst-case SINR. Assuming as figure of merit worst-case SINR, in [9], a max-min approach against the uncertainly sets of TIR for extended targets and the second-order statistics of the interference, is exploited to devise the waveform considering energy constraint.|$|E
