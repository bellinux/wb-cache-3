The analysis compared <b>retention</b> <b>rates</b> between those personnel who have been deployed via IA to equivalent cohorts of Navy personnel who have not been on an IA deployment. <b>Retention</b> <b>rates</b> were compared in three different ways: aggregate comparisons, comparisons by individual demographic categories, and comparisons based on standard statistical modeling techniques (logistic regression), in order to simultaneously control for all the demographic and other observable characteristics.
