5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by <b>rheostat,</b> but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E
5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's <b>rheostat</b> was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
25|$|The name {{varistor}} is a portmanteau {{of varying}} resistor. The term is only used for non-ohmic varying resistors. Variable resistors, {{such as the}} potentiometer and the <b>rheostat,</b> have ohmic characteristics.|$|E

25|$|After the Yom Kippur War the United States {{initiated}} Operation Nimbus Moon. The {{amphibious assault}} ship USS Inchon (LPH-12) {{was sent to}} the Canal, carrying 12 RH-53D minesweeping helicopters of HM-12. These partly cleared the canal between May and December 1974. She was relieved by the LST USS Barnstable County (LST1197). The British Royal Navy initiated Operation <b>Rheostat</b> and Task Group 65.2 provided for Operation <b>Rheostat</b> One (six months in 1974), the minehunters HMS Maxton, HMS Bossington, and HMS Wilton, the Fleet Clearance Diving Team (FCDT) and HMS Abdiel, a practice minelayer/MCMV support ship; and for Operation <b>Rheostat</b> Two (six months in 1975) the minehunters HMS Hubberston and HMS Sheraton, and HMS Abdiel. When the Canal Clearance Operations were completed, the canal and its lakes were considered 99% clear of mines. The canal was then reopened by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat aboard an Egyptian destroyer, which led the first convoy northbound to Port Said in 1975. At his side stood the Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, delegated to represent his father, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. The cruiser USS Little Rock was the only American naval ship in the convoy.|$|E
25|$|On simple, usually {{temporary}} layouts, {{power is}} supplied by a power pack consisting of a transformer and rectifier (DC), a <b>rheostat</b> for regulating power to the track (and thus train speed), and reversing to control model direction. On permanent layouts, multiple power supplies are traditionally used, with the trackage divided into electrically isolated sections called blocks; toggle or rotary switches (sometimes relays) are used to select which power supply controls the train in a particular block. With the advent of digital command control, block divisions are largely eliminated, as the computerized controllers can control any train anywhere on the track at any time.|$|E
5000|$|The Azimuth Co-ordinator uses four rotary <b>rheostats</b> {{housed in}} a large box. The <b>rheostats</b> were {{converted}} from their standard 270 degrees rotation to operate over the narrower 90 degree range imposed by the physical constraints of the control lever with the box top aperture. The system was operated by operating two joysticks, which allowed an audio signal to be panned between up to six loudspeakers placed around the hall.|$|R

25|$|When the City & South London Railway (C) was {{authorised}} in 1884, it {{was intended}} to be a cable-hauled line, but during the construction phase, the promotors decided to use electric traction, {{despite the fact that the}} technology was in its infancy. Two prototype locomotives were built by Mather & Platt in 1889, to a design by Dr Edward Hopkinson, with Beyer-Peacock supplying many of the mechanical parts. No. 1 used motors mounted directly on the drive axles, while No. 2 had motors driven through gears. Trials were conducted in December 1889 with No. 1 and two passenger cars. No. 2 was also used for testing, but it is not clear whether it pulled any cars. A production run of 14 locomotives was then built, numbered 1 to 14, duplicating the original numbers 1 and 2. Each had four wheels, with Edison-Hopkinson motors fitted to the axles, which were permanently wired in series. A 26-step <b>rheostat</b> was used to control the speed, and a switch which altered the connections to the armature was used to reverse the direction of travel.|$|E
2500|$|Dimmers {{based on}} rheostats were inefficient since they would {{dissipate}} {{a significant portion}} of the power rating of the load as heat. They were large and required plenty of cooling air. [...] Because their dimming effect depended a great deal on the total load applied to each <b>rheostat,</b> the load needed to be matched fairly carefully to the power rating of the <b>rheostat.</b> Finally, as they relied on mechanical control they were slow and it was difficult to change many channels at a time ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{examples}} of a <b>rheostat</b> dimmer include a salt water dimmer or liquid rheostat; the liquid between a movable and fixed contact provided a variable resistance. [...] The closer the contacts to each other, the [...] more voltage was available for the light. [...] Salt water dimmers [...] required regular addition of water and maintenance due to corrosion; exposed parts were energized during operation, presenting a shock hazard.|$|E
50|$|Early TRF sets had {{typically}} two {{or three}} tuning knobs and tube filament voltage-control <b>rheostats,</b> all of {{which had to be}} set correctly to receive a station. Later (late 1920s) TRF sets had ganged tuning (one knob was used to control all stage tuning capacitors simultaneously), AC house current operation, and eliminated the filament voltage adjustments. All of these changes greatly simplified operation and made radio a household appliance that even a small child could operate, instead of the highly skilled hobbyists of the brief preceding generation. Reaction sets also had the filament adjustment <b>rheostats</b> for each valve, and again settings had to be right to achieve reception.|$|R
25|$|Thyristors {{have been}} used for decades as {{lighting}} dimmers, in television, motion pictures, and theater, where they replaced inferior technologies such as autotransformers and <b>rheostats.</b> They have also been used in photography as a critical part of flashes (strobes).|$|R
50|$|Contactors. They {{are widely}} {{employed}} on Italian electro-mechanic locomotives, including E.636. They {{are used in}} various systems, mainly to insert/exclude the <b>rheostat's</b> resistors; can move only when pressure is greater than 5 bars, and the IR must be closed.|$|R
2500|$|Speed is {{controlled}} by a <b>rheostat,</b> originally mounted on the treadle pad but later as an independent pedal for foot or knee control. [...] The kit includes a dual electrical outlet that mounts alongside the machine in its case: one outlet is for the motor and {{is controlled}} by the foot pedal; the other is for a sewing lamp (see below) and is always energized. [...] A sewing machine thus electrified now fit entirely inside a woman-portable carrying case.|$|E
2500|$|Variable autotransformers (trade name [...] "Variac") {{were then}} introduced. While {{they were still}} nearly as large as <b>rheostat</b> dimmers, they were {{relatively}} efficient devices. Their voltage output, and so their dimming effect, was largely {{independent of the load}} applied so it was far easier to design the lighting that would be attached to each autotransformer channel. Remote control of the dimmers was still impractical, although some dimmers were equipped with motor drives that could slowly and steadily reduce or increase the brightness of the attached lamps. Autotransformers have fallen out of use for lighting [...] but are used for other applications.|$|E
2500|$|Older {{machines}} typically had a 1/3hp 850 or 1140 revolution {{per minute}} motor geared to the main clutch wheel, the inner shaft engaging this wheel while the casting cycle was in operation. [...] An external leather belt on this wheel ran a second jack-shaft, which powered the distributor and keyboard matrix conveyor and escapements through additional belting off this shaft. [...] Gas fired pots, {{such as in the}} illustration below, were most common in the earlier years, with the pot being thermostatically controlled (high flame when under temperature and low flame when up to temperature), and then a second smaller burner for the mouth and throat heating, or else, with the more modern installations running on 1500 watt electric pots with an initially <b>rheostat</b> controlled mouth and throat heaters (several hundred watts on the electric models)(to keep the lead and tin type metal liquified just prior to being cast) to precisely adjust temperature. [...] Newer machines, and the larger machines above 36 EM Matrix size typically used the more standardized 1/2 horsepower motor after v-belts came into common use in the 1930s. [...] The large machines also had the so-called 'double pot', with either larger gas burners, or else 2250 watt pot heaters and larger mouth and throat heaters. [...] The most modern Linotypes had the mouth and throat heaters thermostatically controlled, an improvement over the manual <b>rheostat</b> adjustment, or gas flame adjustment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had 3-axle monomotor bogies {{with each}} set of 3 axles coupled by gears. Speed regulation was by <b>rheostats</b> and series-parallel control.

2500|$|One of E-meter's primary {{components}} is a Wheatstone bridge, {{an electrical}} circuit configuration invented in 1833 {{that enables the}} detection of very small differences between two electrical impedances (in this case, resistance). The E-meter is constructed so that one resistance is the subject's body {{and the other is}} a <b>rheostat</b> controlled by the operator. A small voltage from the battery is applied to electrodes held in the subjects hands. As the electrical properties (electrodermal activity) of the subject's body changes during the counseling, the resulting changes in the small electric current are displayed in needle movements on a large analog panel meter. The dial face is without numbers because the absolute resistance in ohms is relatively unimportant, while the operator watches primarily for characteristic needle motions. [...] The voltage applied to the electrodes is less than 1.5V, and the electric current through the subject's body is less than a half a milliampere.|$|E
60|$|Next morning's Times {{contained}} that curious announcement {{about its}} being {{the intention of}} the Government to appoint an electrician to the Admiralty, and inviting applications from distinguished men of science.

The famous Professor Brusegay himself had described it as a remarkable invention, likely to prove of immense practical importance to telegraphy and electrical science generally. So when Harry saw the announcement that morning, he made up his mind to apply for the appointment at once; and he thought that if he got it, as the salary was a good one, he might before long marry Ethel, and yet manage to keep Edith in the same comfort as before.|$|E

40|$|SummaryProtein kinases may {{function}} {{more like}} variable <b>rheostats</b> rather than two-state switches. However, we lack approaches to properly analyze {{this aspect of}} kinase-dependent regulation. To address this, we develop a strategy in which a kinase inhibitor is identified using genetics-based screens, kinase mutations that confer resistance are characterized, and dose-dependent responses of isogenic drug-sensitive and resistant cells to inhibitor treatments are compared. This approach has the advantage that function of wild-type kinase, rather than mutants, is examined. To develop this approach, we focus on Ark 1, the fission yeast member of the conserved Aurora kinase family. Applying this approach reveals that proper chromosome compaction in fission yeast needs high Ark 1 activity, while other processes depend on significantly lower activity levels. Our strategy is general {{and can be used}} to examine the functions of other molecular <b>rheostats...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most {{bacterial}} secretory proteins destined {{beyond the}} plasma membrane are secreted post-translationally by the Sec translocase. In {{the first step}} of translocation, preproteins are targeted for binding to their 2 -site receptor SecA, the peripheral ATPase subunit of the translocase. We now reveal that secretory preproteins use a dual-key mechanism to bridge the signal peptide and mature domain receptor sites and cooperatively enhance their affinities. Docking of targeting-competent mature domains requires that their extensive disorder is finely tuned. This is achieved through amino-terminal mature domain regions acting as conformational <b>rheostats.</b> By being linked to the <b>rheostats,</b> signal peptides regulate long-range preprotein disorder. Concomitant conformational changes in SecA sterically adapt its two receptor sites to optimally recognize hundreds of dissimilar preproteins. This novel intramolecular conformational crosstalk in the preprotein chains and the dynamic interaction with their receptor are mechanistically coupled to preprotein engagement in the translocase and essential for secretion. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The L pad attenuates {{the signal}} by having two {{separate}} rheostats connected in an [...] "L" [...] configuration (hence the name). One <b>rheostat</b> is connected {{in series with}} the loudspeaker and, as the resistance of this <b>rheostat</b> increases, less power is coupled into the loudspeaker and the loudness of sound produced by the loudspeaker decreases. The second <b>rheostat</b> is connected between the input and ground (earth). As the first <b>rheostat</b> increases in resistance, the second <b>rheostat</b> decreases in resistance, keeping the load impedance (presented at the input of the L pad) constant. The second <b>rheostat</b> usually has a special taper (function of resistance versus rotation) to accommodate the need for constant input impedance.|$|E
