40|$|The {{relatively}} few {{studies of the}} Irish social welfare system have focused mainly on the forces behind the introduction of social welfare schemes rather than the impact which these schemes had in demographic and labour market terms. This note presents a preliminary examination of the issues and evidence concerning the impact of two significant schemes: the widow’s pension and children’s allowance. Its findings are significantly limited by the non-availability of data concerning, for example, the living arrangements of widows and large families in the relevant period. The main findings are as follows: 1. In those areas {{for which there is}} data, albeit imperfect in many cases, there is limited, if any, indication of a significant impact of the introduction of these schemes, for example, in relation to the <b>remarriage</b> <b>rate</b> of widows, the employment rate of married women, the numbers of children in care, levels of fertility or marriage. 2. The one area where there would appear to be an impact is in the employment rate of widows, where the introduction of widow�s pension appears to have accelerated an ongoing decline. 3. In relation to poverty, there is no direct evidence of poverty rates in published data. However, the introduction of widow�s pensions must have improved the financial position of such widows as the introduction of children’s allowance must have improved the financial position of larger families. 4. There is a co-occurrence of the introduction of children’s allowance and the fall in infant mortality. However, despite other studies which suggest a strong link between the two, it is suggested that that the link may be less direct and that it is more likely to reflect concurrent, but as yet, unquantified, improvements in children’s health care staff. This {{is not to say that}} the improvement in the financial position of families had no impact on infant mortality. This preliminary study suggests that the published data provides quite limited information on the impact of social welfare schemes, and that in order to investigate this further, examination of original Census material, such as, for example, housing conditions and employment rates by family size would be required. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to produce up-to-date estimates of race/ethnic/nativity differentials for remarriage and repartnership among women in the United States and to see if these differences are due to across-group differences in demographic characteristics. First, we produce lifetable estimates of remarriage and repartnering for white, black, U. S. born Latina and foreign born Latina women. Next, we estimate race/ethnic/nativity differentials for remarriage and repartnership using event-history analysis with and without controls for demographic characteristics. The results suggest a continued overall decline in <b>remarriage</b> <b>rates,</b> while many women repartner by cohabitating. Whites are more likely than blacks or Latinas to remarry and they {{are also more likely to}} repartner. Race/ethnic/nativity differentials remain even after accounting for variations in demographic characteristics.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{important}} changes over the last 25 years {{in the way in}} which men and women form partnered relationships. David de Vaus, Lixia Qu and Ruth Weston argue that taking a longer-term perspective provides a better understanding of these trends.

One of the most striking changes is in the area of partnering, perhaps the most obvious being the increasing tendency for people to live together without marrying (cohabitation) at some stage in their lives and the fall in first marriage and <b>remarriage</b> <b>rates.</b> This article asks what these trends suggest for the future of marriage.

50|$|Many factors {{influence}} {{the likelihood of}} remarrying after a divorce. Based on the 2006 census, men remarry more often than women. <b>Remarriage</b> <b>rates</b> also differ by ethnicity; remarriage is most common among White women, while Black women have the lowest probability of marrying again. Age is another determining factor; women who are older than 25 {{at the time of}} divorce are less likely to remarry than women who are younger at the time of marital dissolution. Having children is associated with higher <b>rates</b> of <b>remarriage</b> for men and women. Remarriage also differs by community setting. Women from urban areas or areas with a greater proportion of women who never married are less likely to marry again. Some environmental factors do not affect all ethnicities: only non-White women from communities with high unemployment and poverty have reduced likelihood of remarriage.|$|R

40|$|Working Draft. Do not cite without authors consent. ] This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} familial choices in labor supply and investments {{in the quality of}} children in the shadow of evolving child custody legislations, from the perspective of di¤erential fecundity. Relying on biological di¤erences in fertility between men and women, it shows the higher <b>remarriage</b> <b>rates</b> among men allows then to substitute between child quality between di¤erent marriages. The shift to joint custody, and consequent increase in support obligations reduces the value of child quality from a remarriage, hence raising paternal valuation of his children, and child quality from the 8 ̆ 5 rst marriage, while reducing parental labor participation rates. The reduction in weight placed on remarriage, reduces the incidence of remarriage, and consequently raises lifetime welfare of women. As a result of higher support payments commiserating with greater custody, welfare of men falls. Further, endogenizing support payment choices, it is shown that distortions created by remarriage option prevents the realization of optimal intact family outcomes in divorced families under any custody regime.

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in {{standard of living}} of the population, the condition of widows and divorced women remains deplorable in society. The situation is worse in developing nations with their unique social, cultural and economic milieu, which at times ignores the basic human rights of this vulnerable section of society. A gap exists in life expectancies {{of men and women}} in both developing and developed nations. This, coupled with greater <b>remarriage</b> <b>rates</b> in men, ensures that the number of widows continues to exceed that of widowers. Moreover, with women becoming more educated, economically independent and aware of their rights, divorce rates are increasing along with associated psychological ramifications. The fact that widowed/divorced women suffer from varying psychological stressors is often ignored. It has been concluded in various studies that such stressors could be harbingers of psychiatric illnesses (e. g., depression, anxiety, substance dependence), and hence should be taken into account by treating physicians, social workers and others who come to the aid of such women. A change in mindset of the society is required before these women get their rightful place, for which a strong will is needed in the minds of the people, and in law-governing bodies. </i...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this matched case-control study was to {{investigate}} the social correlates of primary infertility among females aged 35 years or less. The study was conducted in the Clinics of Samarkand Medical Institute, Uzbekistan, among 120 infertile and 120 healthy women matched by age, residential area, and occupation from January to June 2009. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Median duration of infertility was 10. 0 months (interquartile range = 6. 0 – 13. 0). The <b>rate</b> of <b>remarriage</b> was 3. 5 times higher among infertile women compared with healthy subjects. Insufficient family income, poor quality of life, life stress, and discontentment with daily routines as well as ‘bad’ relationships with family members (husband, mother- and father-in-law) were significant correlates of female infertility. Infertile women were more likely to underestimate the importance of sexual intimacy, and a negative attitude to sex. Female infertility is associated with various social correlates leading to higher <b>remarriage</b> <b>rates</b> and to further complicating the problem of infertility. Thus, a correction of women’s basic attitudes and their relationships to their surrounding social habitat should be an essential component of any program of infertility management...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the incidence and determinants of remarriage and cohabitation among a sample of 35 widowed parents of school-aged children. Data from a U.

Contrary to previous findings, {{there were no differences}} in <b>remarriage</b> <b>rates</b> between men and women. Other factors expected to influence the likelihood of remarriages, such as number and age of children, did not; income change pre–post death was a determinant for widows, as was widow’s age within this relatively young sample of widows. There was a trend for surviving parents who exhibited fewer symptoms of psychopathology (on the BSI) at the initial Wave I assessment to more likely be remarried or cohabiting at Wave II than those exhibiting higher levels of psychopathology at the initial assessment. Possible interpretations of the divergence between prior reports or assumptions and these data are noted, as is the importance of studying the role of surviving parent remarriage and/or cohabitation(s) intrinsically, and correspondingly, their effects upon parentally bereaved children...|$|R

Findings – The paper notes how the advent of industrialization transformed the family and contributed to rising divorce rates and examines common explanations for the dramatic increase in divorce throughout the 20 th century. In particular, this review highlights how the feminist movement along with numerous legislative and demographic changes brought about the increased labor force participation of women and female economic independence, which allowed both men and women greater freedom to divorce. As divorce has become a more common event, the number of people eligible for remarriage has increased and the majority of those entering second marriages have shifted from widows and widowers to divorcees. Originality/value – Once scholars better understand the historical background for trends in divorce and remarriage, they can more readily recognize and address the implications for marriage in the present day.

40|$|Background : While social {{gradient}} in divorce has been explored in many Western societies, {{this issue has}} received less attention in Asia. Objective : Few existing studies offer evidence for how educational gradient in divorce shift from positive to negative in Asia. This study explores the changing divorce patterns by education for both sexes {{over the past four}} decades in Taiwan. Methods : Vital statistics of divorce since 1975 were used. Divorce rates were calculated and a synthetic cohort life table was also constructed to estimate the proportions of unions that remain intact with the duration-specific divorce rates observed in 2010. A separate life table estimating the actual marriage survivorship for the 1998 marriage cohort was also presented. Results : As Taiwan went through industrialization, the period findings show that a reversal in educational differential in divorce from positive to negative is observed for both sexes. Now the least educated men and women have become more vulnerable to union instability. Finally, synthetic cohort life table estimates indicate substantial educational differences in the proportions of recent marriages ending in divorce. Conclusions : The drastic increase in period divorce rates is accompanied by a reversal of educational gradient and expanding social inequality. Social gap in divorce rates expanded much faster among men than women across years. Given that <b>remarriage</b> <b>rates</b> for the disadvantaged are lower than the better educated, these patterns indicate that the disadvantaged is likely to spend an increasingly large proportion of their lives outside a marital union. Contribution : The divorce patterns revealed have critical implications for single-parent families, as well as family policies and social assistance...|$|R

40|$|Divorce and <b>remarriage</b> <b>rates</b> in {{this country}} are {{among the highest in the}} world, and both {{variations}} in the traditional parental marital status can place children at increased risk for developing social, psychological, behavioral, and academic problems. The existing body of research on the effects of divorce and remarriage on children is inconsistent and limited in focus, in that the climate of the family life generally was not considered in the early literature. Thus, the present study was designed to address the relationship between parental marital status and family rapport on the self-reported psychopathology in adolescents from a predominantly middle to upper middle class suburban town. A sample of 175 high school students (grades 9 - 12) were taken from a larger longitudinal study of adolescent development and depression. Three Parental Marital Status groups were used: Divorced/Not Remarried (N = 38), Divorced/Reconstituted (N = 50), and Married (N = 87). All subjects completed two self-report measures: the Family Rapport Scale of the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory, and the problem scales of the Youth Self Report. Additionally, a demographic sheet was filled out, yielding pertinent information about the students and their parents 2 ̆ 7 marital status. The relationship between the two quasi-independent variables (Parental Marital Status and Family Rapport) and the dependent variable (Self-Reported Externalizing and Internalizing Psychopathology) was examined. Additional variables such as Gender, Chronological Age, Age of the Child at the Time of Divorce, Time Elapsed Since the Divorce, and Remarriage were studied as potential predictors of clinical levels of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Analyses of Variance and Stepwise Discriminant Analysis procedures were used in order to test the research questions for significance. Results of the present study suggest that Family Rapport, rather than Marital Status can account for differences in levels of self-reported psychopathology in the three groups of adolescents. Family functioning is the factor most contributory to adolescent behavior problems, not parental marital status; thus, divorce is not as crippling as it has been suggested to be. No gender differences were noted across the marital status groups, and remarriage did not add to the prediction of behavior problems. Implications for school psychology and suggestions for further research are discussed. ...|$|R

Existing research shows that the main reason for Chinese couples to live apart is their jobs. Censuses in 1982 – 2010 show that the head of a separated nuclear household is usually female. China’s registration system is the main reason behind this phenomenon. Usually, the father of the separated nuclear household works in the city/town, while the mother lives with the children.
