40|$|Gene flow between {{closely related}} species is not always impeded by hybrid inviability or {{sterility}} but may be limited by behavioural or ecological factors. European common <b>redstarts,</b> Phoenicurus phoenicurus, and black <b>redstarts,</b> P. ochruros, are insectivorous passerine bird species which regularly interbreed in the wild and produce viable and fertile progeny. Yet, the isolation barriers, which prevent extensive gene flow between these distinct species, are unknown. I studied prey-handling time and efficiency in both species and the F- 1 - hybrids incaptivity. All birds changed prey-handling mode from a single pick to more complex behaviour with increasing prey length and their handling time was a positive function of prey length. Common <b>redstarts</b> tended to handle their prey quicker than black <b>redstarts.</b> Hybrids appeared to be intermediate. However, individual differences were significant, but group membership was not. Handling efficiency decreased with increasing prey length and was determined by individual and family effects. Hybrid females handled their prey as efficient as hybrid males. Small differences in beak morphology could not explain individual differences in prey-handling behaviour. The {{results of this study}} suggest that prey-handling in F- 1 -hybrids is not a postzygotic barrier which prevent gene flow between common and black <b>redstarts</b> in the wild...|$|R

5|$|As it is {{separated}} from the mainland by 3miles (4.8km) of water, few large mammals inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. Rabbits, fox, raccoons, otters, mink, gray and red squirrels, and chipmunks are all common as is the occasional beaver and coyote. Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as yellow warblers, American <b>redstart,</b> and indigo bunting are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, gulls, herons, geese, and loons are common. Owls, including snowy owls and great grey owls, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined how}} song {{is used to}} transmit information on individual identity in American <b>redstarts</b> (Setophaga ruticilla).

I tested the latter by exposing subjects to identical song types sung by different birds. Each subject's behavior was evaluated according to a variety of response variables. In all trials, for all response variables, subjects responded highly but equally to each of the songs played. A post-hoc analysis revealed that the order in which treatment songs were presented affected the birds' responses. For four of five response variables, subjects successfully distinguished between the songs of neighbors and strangers when played the fourth song in the trial. Thus, it would appear that in <b>redstarts</b> this type of discrimination may be observed only after an initial song-exposure period...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn migratory birds, {{environmental}} conditions during the stationary {{period of the}} non-breeding season are crucial to consider because they ultimately affect the fitness of individuals by influencing their subsequent migration, breeding success and survival. Although {{a few studies have}} investigated the influence of non-breeding habitat on the capacity of individuals to cope with long-term seasonal rainfall fluctuations, it remains unknown how habitat quality and variations in rainfall abundance at a monthly scale interact to affect non-breeding condition of migrating birds. In this study, we examined the influence of monthly changes in rainfall abundance on body condition of non-breeding female <b>redstarts</b> Setophaga ruticilla living either in a high quality habitat (mangrove) or in a low quality habitat (scrub). Body condition of both mangrove and scrub <b>redstarts</b> showed important variations over the study period, demonstrating {{for the first time that}} body condition of non-breeding female <b>redstarts</b> can change rapidly in response to short-term fluctuations in rainfall. Importantly, we found that female <b>redstarts</b> living in mangrove were usually in better condition during periods of low rainfall compared to females living in scrub. However, body condition did not differ between mangrove females and scrub females during an episode of frequent, heavy precipitation. Importantly, our study also demonstrated that the duration of a perturbation is an important determinant of body condition in <b>redstarts</b> since a prolonged drought resulted in similar low body condition for birds from both habitats. Age was not correlated with body condition whatever the habitat and the rainfall conditions. Our results demonstrate that high quality habitat can temporarily reduce the deleterious effect of a short-term drought on body condition, but also, that a habitat of low quality does not constrain individuals when climatic conditions are optimal...|$|R

2500|$|The Painted <b>redstart</b> (Myioborus pictus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} well {{documented}} flush pursuers. When flies, prey for redstarts, are alerted of the presence of predators, they respond by fleeing. Redstarts take advantage of this anti-predator response by spreading and orienting their easily noticeable wings and tails, alerting the flies, but only when they are in a position where the flies' escape path intersects with the redstart's central field of vision. When prey's path are in this field of vision, the redstart's prey capture rate is at it maximum. Once the flies begin to flee, the <b>redstart</b> begins to chase. It has been proposed that redstarts exploit two aspects of the visual sensitivity of their prey: sensitivity to the location of the stimulus in the prey's visual field and sensitivity to the direction of stimulus environment. The effectiveness of this pursuit can also be explained by [...] "rare enemy effect", an evolutionary consequence of multi-species predator-prey interactions.|$|E

I tested the hypothesis that migratory American <b>Redstarts</b> (Redstart; Setophaga ruticilla) and resident Adelaide's Warbler (Adelaide's; Dendroica adelaidae) compete for food in a dry forest of southwest Puerto Rico. Competition will not occur unless food is limiting and the foraging niche of the two species is similar. In dry years, total arthropod biomass declined and body condition of both species decreased. Moreover, these species had a very high degree of overlap in both foraging location and type of attack. Simulated territorial intrusions also indicated that these species are competing. However, Adelaide's did not shift their foraging niche after <b>Redstarts</b> left and these species were not interspecifically territorial. Therefore, neither depletion nor interference competition is occurring. Instead, the evidence suggests that <b>Redstarts</b> listen to the frequent vocalizations of Adelaide's, and forage using temporary competition refuges...|$|R
40|$|Competition elevates plasma {{testosterone}} in a {{wide variety}} of vertebrates, including humans. The ‘challenge hypothesis’ proposes that seasonal peaks in testosterone during breeding are caused by social challenges from other males. However, during experimentally induced male–male conflicts, testosterone increases only in a minority of songbird species tested so far. Why is this so? Comparative evidence suggests that species with a short breeding season may not elevate testosterone levels during territory defence. These species may even be limited in their physiological capability to increase testosterone levels, which can be tested by injecting birds with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). We studied two populations of black <b>redstarts</b> that differ in breeding altitude, morphology and the length of their breeding season. Unexpectedly, males of neither population increased testosterone in response to a simulated territorial intrusion, but injections with GnRH resulted in a major elevation of testosterone. Thus, black <b>redstarts</b> would have been capable of mounting a testosterone response during the male–male challenge. Our data show, for the first time, that the absence of an androgen response to male–male challenges is not owing to physiological limitations to increase testosterone. Furthermore, in contrast to comparative evidence between species, populations of black <b>redstarts</b> with a long breeding season do not show the expected elevation in testosterone during male–male challenges...|$|R

40|$|Testosterone {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to be involved in}} the regulation of male territorial behavior. For example, seasonal peaks in testosterone typically coincide with periods of intense competition between males for territories and mating partners. However, some species also express territorial behavior outside a breeding context when testosterone levels are low and, thus, the degree to which testosterone facilitates territorial behavior in these species is not well understood. We studied territorial behavior and its neuroendocrine correlates in male black <b>redstarts.</b> Black <b>redstarts</b> defend territories in spring during the breeding period, but also in the fall outside a reproductive context when testosterone levels are low. In the present study we assessed if song output and structure remain stable across life-cycle stages. Furthermore, we assessed if brain anatomy may give insight into the role of testosterone in the regulation of territorial behavior in black <b>redstarts.</b> We found that males sang spontaneously at a high rate during the nonbreeding period when testosterone levels were low; however the trill-like components of spontaneously produced song contained less repetitive elements during nonbreeding than during breeding. This higher number of repetitive elements in trills did not, however, correlate with a larger song control nucleus HVC during breeding. However, males expressed more aromatase mRNA in the preoptic area – a brain nucleus important for sexual and aggressive behavior – during breeding than during nonbreeding. In combination with our previous studies on black <b>redstarts</b> our results suggest that territorial behavior in this species only partly depends on sex steroids: spontaneous song output, seasonal variation in trills and non-vocal territorial behavior in response to a simulated territorial intruder seem to be independent of sex steroids. However, context-dependent song during breeding may be facilitated by testosterone – potentially by conversion of testosterone to estradiol in the preoptic area...|$|R
