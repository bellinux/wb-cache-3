40|$|The Hsp 90 molecule, one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} heat shock proteins in mammalian cells, maintains homeostasis and prevents stress-induced cellular damage. Hsp 90 is expressed under normal conditions at a level of about 1 - 2 Percent of total proteins, while its expression increases 2 - 10 fold in cancer cells. The two main constitutively expressed isoforms of Hsp 90 are known as Hsp 90 -alpha and Hsp 90 -beta, and their upregulation is associated with tumor progression, invasion and formation of metastases, as well as development of drug resistance. The Hsp 90 is a key target for many newly established, potent anticancer agents containing Hsp 90 N-terminal ATP binding inhibitors, such as geldanamycin, and its analogues 17 AAG and 17 DMAG. The therapeutic usage of geldanamycin has been limited due to its poor water solubility and severe hepatotoxicity. Therefore, its analogues, including 17 AAG, 17 DMAG, Tanespimycin and <b>Retaspimycin</b> hydrochloride, with improved pharmacokinetic profiles, have been developed...|$|E
40|$|Hsp 90 is an {{abundant}} protein in mammalian cells. It forms several discrete complexes, each containing distinct groups of co-chaperones that assist protein folding and refolding during stress, protein transport and degradation. It interacts {{with a variety}} of proteins that play key roles in breast neoplasia including estrogen receptors, tumor suppressor p 53 protein, angiogenesis transcription factor HIF- 1 alpha, antiapoptotic kinase Akt, Raf- 1 MAP kinase and a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases of the erbB family. Elevated Hsp 90 expression has been documented in breast ductal carcinomas contributing to the proliferative activity of breast cancer cells; whilst a significantly decreased Hsp 90 expression has been shown in infiltrative lobular carcinomas and lobular neoplasia. Hsp 90 overexpression has been proposed as a component of a mechanism through which breast cancer cells become resistant to various stress stimuli. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of HSPs can provide therapeutic opportunities in the field of cancer treatment. 17 -allylamino, 17 -demethoxygeldanamycin is the first Hsp 90 inhibitor that has clinically been investigated in phase II trial, yielding promising results in patients with HER 2 -overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, whilst other Hsp 90 inhibitors (<b>retaspimycin</b> HCL, NVP-AUY 922, NVP-BEP 800, CNF 2024 /BIIB 021, SNX- 5422, STA- 9090, etc.) are currently under evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is crucial for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) growth and survival. Imatinib (IMA) and sunitinib (SUN) are very effective in advanced GIST, but have no curative potential. The observation that heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90) inhibition results in KIT degradation prompted us to assess {{the efficacy of the}} HSP 90 inhibitor <b>retaspimycin</b> hydrochloride (IPI- 504) alone, or in combination with IMA or SUN in two GIST xenografts with distinctive KIT mutations. Nude mice were grafted with human GIST carrying KIT exon 13 (GIST- 882; n= 59) or exon 11 (GIST-PSW; n= 44) mutations, and dosed with IMA (50 mg/kg twice daily), SUN (40 mg/kg once daily), IPI- 504 (100 mg/kg 3 times per week), IPI- 504 +IMA or IPI- 504 +SUN. We evaluated tumor volume, proliferation and apoptosis, KIT expression and activation, as well as treatment adverse events. Treatment with IPI- 504 alone resulted in tumor regression, proliferation arrest, and induction of tumor necrosis. We documented downregulation of KIT and its signaling cascade in IPI- 504 treated animals. Treatment effects were enhanced by combining IPI- 504 with IMA or SUN. On histology, liver damages were frequently observed in animals exposed to combination treatments. In conclusion, IPI- 504 demonstrates consistent anti-tumor activity and induces KIT downregulation in GIST, as a single agent, and is more potent in combination with IMA or SUN. The sequence of drug administration in the combination arms warrants further studies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|HSP 90 inhibitors are {{currently}} undergoing clinical evaluation {{in combination with}} antimitotic drugs in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC), but {{little is known about the}} cellular effects of this novel drug combination. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanism of action of IPI- 504 (<b>retaspimycin</b> HCl), a potent and selective inhibitor of HSP 90, in combination with the microtubule targeting agent (MTA) docetaxel, in preclinical models of NSCLC. We identified a subset of NSCLC cell lines in which these drugs act in synergy to enhance cell death. Xenograft models of NSCLC demonstrated tumor growth inhibition, and in some cases, regression in response to combination treatment. Treatment with IPI- 504 enhanced the antimitotic effects of docetaxel leading to the hypothesis that the mitotic checkpoint is required for the response to drug combination. Supporting this hypothesis, overriding the checkpoint with an Aurora kinase inhibitor diminished the cell death synergy of IPI- 504 and docetaxel. To investigate the molecular basis of synergy, an unbiased stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) proteomic approach was employed. Several mitotic regulators, including components of the ubiquitin ligase, anaphase promoting complex (APC/C), were specifically down-regulated in response to combination treatment. Loss of APC/C by RNAi sensitized cells to docetaxel and enhanced its antimitotic effects. Treatment with a PLK 1 inhibitor (BI 2536) also sensitized cells to IPI- 504, indicating that combination effects may be broadly applicable to other classes of mitotic inhibitors. Our data provide a preclinical rationale for testing the combination of IPI- 504 and docetaxel in NSCLC...|$|E
30|$|Since {{preclinical}} studies {{demonstrated a}} synergistic effect of taxanes {{in combination with}} ganetespib, this combination has been examined in a completed Phase II where PFS in KRAS mutant patients was a co-primary endpoint and an ongoing Phase III trial. The GALAXY- 1 trial looked at ganetespib in combination with docetaxel in pretreated patients with NSCLC. Patients were given docetaxel (at 75  mg/m 2 on day 1) alone or in combination with ganetespib (at 150  mg/m 2 on days 1 and 15) of a 21 -day cycle. Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 fashion between docetaxel and docetaxel and ganetespib therapy. In this trial, 385 patients were initially enrolled but it was found early on that the combination therapy resulted in hemoptysis and lack of efficacy in those {{that did not have}} adenocarcinoma. Subsequently, only patients with adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this trial. There was a trend in favor of the combination therapy in the adenocarcinoma treated arm with respect to progression free survival (n =  253, HR of 0.82, p =  0.0784) and overall survival (HR of 0.84, p =  0.1139). The most common grade 3 adverse events in the combination arm included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia and neutropenic fever. Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea was common in the combination arm about 48  h after the infusion. For the patients with KRAS mutations (89 patients), the combination therapy did not result in improved progression free survival (combination median 3.9  months vs. control of 3.0  months, HR of 1.1) or overall survival (combination median 7.6  months versus control of 6.4  months with HR of 1.23). One explanation regarding the lack of efficacy in the KRAS mutant population is that every 2  weeks dosing of ganetespib was not sufficient to suppress the KRAS pathway. Additionally, it was observed that those with advanced disease defined as advanced disease greater than 6  months before study entry seemed to do better with the ganetespib and docetaxel combination therapy with regards to progression free survival (n =  177, adjusted HR of 0.74, p =  0.0417) and overall survival (adjusted HR =  0.69, p =  0.0191) [49]. Currently, the next phase of the study called GALAXY- 2 is currently enrolling patients and will definitely determine if there is any benefit in the KRAS mutant NSCLC patient population. This Phase III study is looking at patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC (diagnosis greater than 6  months prior) and randomizing in a 1 : 1 fashion with docetaxel and the ganetespib and docetaxel combination (NCT 01798485). Finally, preclinical studies have suggested that KRAS mutant NSCLC may be more sensitive combinations of Hsp 90 i and other pathway inhibitors such as MTOR inhibitors [50, 51]. Results of phase Ib/II trial looking at the combination of the HSP 90 i, <b>Retaspimycin</b> (IPI- 504) and TORC 1 inhibitor, Everolimus is still pending as seen in Table  2.|$|E
