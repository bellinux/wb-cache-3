40|$|Rib tissue {{segments}} excised {{from open}} flowers or buds of Ipomoea tricolor Cav. and floated on aqueous media responded to ethylene treatment by <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> after 2 to 3 hours; a simple method for quantitating the <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> is presented. The <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> response was temperature- and oxygen-dependent and was critically {{affected by the}} pH of the medium. The ethylene concentration giving a half-maximal response was 0. 1 μl/l; continuous ethylene treatment was not required for the response as a 1 -hour ethylene exposure enhanced <b>rolling</b> <b>up...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{researched}} the fluctuating flow characteristics on three types airfoils, NACA 0008, NACA 0015 and NACA 65710 {{in the transition}} Reynolds Numbers (Re= 5450 ～ 120000). The visual technique with the video recorder and the camera was used. It {{was found that the}} Karman Vortex shedding (wake vortex) was generated in all Reynolds numbers at small attack angles. The core of the wake vortex was clear at the low Reynolds number (Re= 5450), but not clear when the Reynolds number increased (Re= 16300 ～ 120000), Because the dissipation on the shear flow occured just before <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> of the wake vortex at high Reynolds number. There were two patterns of <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> of the wake vortex that one was <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> from the separated boundary layer of the airfoil and another was <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> in the wake. At the case of <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> in the wake, the wake voetex was <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> near the trailing edge of the airfoil at high Reynolds number, but it was <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> at far downstream of the airfoil at the low Reynolds number. At the case of <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> from the separeated boundary layer, the wake vortex was always <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> just behind the dead air region which was generated between two separated shear layears at the trailing edge. When the attack angle increased, the separation bubble on the suction side was generated near the leadind edge, then the turbulent boundary layer developed to the trailing edge. In this case the wake vortex was not <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> and the dissipated wake was generated, This phenomenon often occuered when the Reynolds number increased...|$|R

40|$|An excised tissue system {{consisting}} of corolla rib segments {{was developed to}} study the relationship between senescence and ethylene production in morning-glory flowers (Ipomoea tricolor). Such segments, isolated 1 or 2 days (day − 1 or day − 2) before flower opening (day 0) passed through the same developmental phases as did the corresponding tissues of the intact organ. When excised on day − 1 and incubated overnight, the rib segments turned from purple to blue and changed from a slightly curled to a flat configuration. On day 0, these segments rolled up during the afternoon and turned purple again, as did the ribs of an intact corolla; the <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> coincided with an increased rate of ethylene production. Premature <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> and associated ethylene evolution were induced by ethylene or propylene treatment. When segments were excised on day − 2 and incubated overnight, there were no changes in color or shape; during day − 1, no spontaneous <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> and little ethylene evolution occurred. Application of ethylene or propylene to these immature segments elicited <b>rolling</b> <b>up</b> but did not stimulate endogenous ethylene production...|$|R
