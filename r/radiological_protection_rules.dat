Its statutory functions were to conduct research on <b>radiological</b> <b>protection</b> and provide advice and information on the subject to Government Departments and others. It was also authorized to provide technical services and charge for them. Originally NRPB dealt only with ionizing radiation, but its functions were extended in 1974 to non-ionizing radiation.|$|R

The RPII was merged with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in August 2014, as part of the Irish Government's Public Sector Reform Plan.

40|$|To {{inform the}} Commission {{on the staff}} {{comments}} on the “Draft Recommendations of the International Commission on <b>Radiological</b> <b>Protection.</b> ” BACKGROUND: The primary mission of the International Commission on <b>Radiological</b> <b>Protection</b> (ICRP) is to advance the science of <b>radiological</b> <b>protection</b> by providing recommendations and guidance on all aspects of protection against ionizing radiation. Toward that end, ICRP regularly examines the status of its recommendations and reviews scientific information to decide whether new recommendations are needed. The ICRP recommendations form {{one of the principal}} bases for the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations and guidance for <b>radiological</b> <b>protection.</b> NRC participates in the ICRP review and consultation process at an early stage to ensure that the recommendations are supported by scientifically sound technical bases, are implementable in the United States, and provide a sound basis for U. S. regulations. CONTACT: E. Vincent Holahan, RES/DFERR 301 - 415 - 8715 ICRP published the most recent review of its recommendations in 1991 as ICRP Publication 60...|$|R
