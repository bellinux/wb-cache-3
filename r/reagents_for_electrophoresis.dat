Hepatocyte-specific Pten-deficient mice exhibit hepatic lesions analogous to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH). Therefore, we administered EPA to Pten-deficient mice to investigate the mechanisms of NASH. Methods:Pten-deficient mice were assigned to a control group fed with a standard chow or an EPA group fed with a 5 % EPA-supplemented standard chow. At 40 weeks, livers from each group were processed for measuring triglyceride content, gene expression analysis, Western blotting analysis, and histological examination. Level of serum reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also determined. Forty- and 76 -week-old mice were used in tumor burden experiments. Results:EPA ameliorated hepatic steatosis in Pten-deficient mice based on decreased expression of AMPKα 1 -mediated SREBP- 1 c and increased PPARα expression. The EPA group exhibited less severe chronic hepatic inflammation compared to the control group, resulting from decreased ROS formation and a dramatically low ratio of arachidonic acid to EPA. Moreover, EPA inhibited development of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) in Pten-deficient mice based on an inhibition of MAPK activity and a low ratio of oleic to stealic acid, {{and a reduction in}} ROS formation. Conclusions:EPA ameliorated steatohepatitis and development of HCC in Pten-deficient mice...|$|R
