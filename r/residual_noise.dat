Initially, a state-of-the-art speech enhancement algorithm is performed as the first stage to reduce background noise for noisy speech. Hence the enhanced speech is post-processed by a hybrid-mean filter to reduce the musical effect of <b>residual</b> <b>noise.</b> In {{the case of a}} vowel-like spectrum, directional-mean filtering is performed to slightly reduce the musical effect of <b>residual</b> <b>noise,</b> where the harmonic spectrum can be well maintained at an acceptable level. Conversely, block-mean filtering is performed to heavily reduce the spectral variation for noise-dominant spectra, enabling musical tones to be significantly smoothed. The musical effect of <b>residual</b> <b>noise</b> is therefore reduced. Finally, the pre-processed, the directional-mean filtered and the block-mean filtered spectra are fused according to speech-presence probability.

The first is concerned with the modelling, design and implementation of an extremely high quality factor Bragg resonator. This resonator utilises an aperiodic arrangement of non λ/ 4 low loss alumina plates mounted in a cylindrical waveguide. An ABCD parameter waveguide model is developed to simulate and optimise the cavity. The dielectric plates and air waveguide dimensions are optimised using a genetic algorithm to achieve maximum quality factor by redistributing the energy loss within the cavity. An unloaded quality factor (Q_ 0) of 196, 000 was demonstrated at 9. 93 GHz. In the second part the design, implementation and measurement results for an ultra-low noise floor cross correlation <b>residual</b> phase <b>noise</b> measurement system are shown.
