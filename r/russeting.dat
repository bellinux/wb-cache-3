Cases of apples thus affected were recorded by Bradley in the early part of the last century; and other cases are given in old volumes of the 'Philosophical Transactions' (11/145.

It is, however, almost superfluous to adduce these or other cases, after that of the St. Valery apple, the flowers which, from the abortion of the stamens, do not produce pollen, but are fertilised by the girls of the neighbourhood with pollen of many kinds; and they bear fruit, [...] "differing from one another in size, flavour, and colour, but resembling in character the hermaphrodite kinds by which they have been fertilised."

In early harvest trials in the Pacific Northwest, Teton <b>Russet</b> had total yields similar to <b>Russet</b> Norkotah, and higher than Ranger <b>Russet</b> and <b>Russet</b> Burbank. Marketable yield of Teton <b>Russet</b> in the early harvest trials was also comparable to or higher than <b>Russet</b> Norkotah in Washington and Oregon, and higher than Ranger <b>Russet</b> and <b>Russet</b> Burbank at these sites, as well as in Idaho. In full-season trials, while total yield of the earlier-maturing Teton <b>Russet</b> tended to be lower than Ranger <b>Russet</b> and <b>Russet</b> Burbank, marketable yield was generally higher than <b>Russet</b> Burbank across the majority of sites due to its higher percentage of U.

Teton <b>Russet</b> has shown lower levels of the amino acid asparagine relative to Ranger <b>Russet</b> and <b>Russet</b> Burbank which may contribute to lower acrylamide levels in French fries and other processed potato products. Teton <b>Russet</b> is notable for having resistance to common scab (Streptomyces spp.) and Fusarium dry rot, and is moderately resistant to tuber net necrosis.

50|$|There {{were three}} main {{ways in which}} the steel of the armour was coloured: bluing, browning, and <b>russeting.</b> Bluing the steel gave it a deep, {{brilliant}} blue-black finish. Browning, as the name would suggest, coloured the steel a dark brown, which contrasted vividly with gilding as in the harness of George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland. Finally, <b>russeting</b> imparted a dark-red or purple hue to the steel, which was also typically used in conjunction with gilding. All of these base colours would be applied uniformly to the steel of the armour, and then strips of differently coloured steel would be laid across to create patterns, or etched sections of the armour would be gilded. The Earl of Worcester's armour is one striking example of a scalloped design which was originally gilded over dark blued steel.|$|E
