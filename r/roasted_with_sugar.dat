40|$|AbstractExtraction of {{titanium}} and chromium oxides may {{be achieved}} via roasting the respective minerals with alkali at high temperatures, followed by water and organic acid leaching. In this study, sodium and potassium hydroxides {{are used as}} alkali for roasting of chromite ores and ilmenite mineral concentrates. The thermodynamic analysis of the roasting process is {{discussed in terms of}} designing the process. Samples of chromite and titaniferous minerals were <b>roasted</b> <b>with</b> NaOH and KOH in a temperature range of 400 °C– 1000 °C in an oxidising atmosphere. The roasted chromite and ilmenite samples were further processed in order to extract water-soluble Na 2 CrO 4 from the reacted chromite and purify titanium dioxide from titaniferous minerals, respectively. The TiO 2 purity obtained after roasting at 400 °C with NaOH and double leaching was 49. 2 wt. %, whereas when using KOH the purity was 54. 5 wt. %. The highest TiO 2 purity obtained after roasting at 1000 °C for 2 h and double leaching with water and organic acids was 84 wt. %. At low temperature (400 °C) the recovery of chromium was higher for chromite <b>roasted</b> <b>with</b> KOH than for chromite <b>roasted</b> <b>with</b> NaOH. However, at high temperatures (700 °C and 1000 °C) chromium recoveries were similar when <b>roasting</b> <b>with</b> both hydroxides. Around 95 % chromium extraction yield was achieved when chromite was <b>roasted</b> <b>with</b> sodium and potassium hydroxides at 1000 °C for 2 h and water leached...|$|R
