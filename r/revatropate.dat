30|$|One of the chiral alcohols, (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol, is {{a useful}} {{compound}} applicable to the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals, such as talsaclidine and <b>revatropate</b> (Rzeszotarski et al. 1988; Bietti et al. 1990; Cross and Stobie 1993; Takeuchi et al. 1996; Alabaster 1997; Ward et al. 1998; Leusch et al. 2000; Ishihara et al. 2004). So far, chemical and biochemical methods have been applied to produce (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol (Stembach and Kaiser 1952; Rehavi et al. 1977; Muchmore 1993; Bossard 1997; Brieden 1998; Matsuyama and Hamatani 1998; Sato and Enomoto 1999; Nomoto et al. 2003; Yamamoto et al. 2003; Takenaka 2006), {{and most of these}} methods take the approach of resolving a racemic mixture. Recently, for the production of (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol, 3 -quinuclidinone reductase (RrQR) was isolated from Rhodotorula rubra (Uzura et al. 2009). The purified enzyme from R. rubra is specific to NADPH as a coenzyme and stereospecifically produces the (R)-enantiomer of 3 -quinuclidinol from 3 -quinuclidinone. Furthermore, a coexpression system for the 3 -quinuclidinone reductase and glucose dehydrogenase using Escherichia coli as a host was developed for the large-scale production of (R)- 3 -quinuclidinol. The system using the enzyme is superior to former kinetic resolution methods in that it has a higher molar yield, requires no substrate modification, and so on (Uzura et al. 2009).|$|E
