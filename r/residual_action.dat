5000|$|The {{two primary}} ways to control Podosphaera macularis are {{cultural}} and chemical control. The {{most effective way}} to manage hop powdery mildew is through preventative measures. Cultural control of the disease include growing powdery-mildew tolerant/resistant varieties of the host plant. Cultural practices that can help prevent the disease include carefully monitoring water and nutrient, reducing initial inoculum, and removing basal growth. Furthermore, pruning, crowning, and/or scratching will aid in further reduction of the disease. Pruning consists of removing shoots before training. Crowning refers to the process of removing the top 1-2 inches of the crown before budbreak. Scratching is done through disturbing the soil surface to remove the top 1-2 inches of buds. All of these methods disturb the overwintering stage of the life cycle of Podosphaera macularis. Likewise, chemical control primarily consists of spraying fungicides in hopes of preventing the disease through the use of early, continuous spraying during the growing season. Thus, prophylactic fungicide programs can be a very effective way in preventing the disease. Since the fungicides are a preventative measure, they are not very useful to use during a full-blown infection. Therefore, the use of fungicides disturbs release of spores and further infection within the disease cycle of Podosphaera macularis. As there are several fungicides that are effective against powdery mildew, it is important to apply the fungicides at specific times. If it is known that powdery mildew is present, spray programs should be started as soon as the shoots emerge. Due to powdery mildew's ability to quickly develop resistance to fungicides, it is important to rotate the fungicides that are used. However, few or no fungicide applications should be used during burr development as these burrs have increased vulnerability to damage. In this case, removing basal growth before flowering and applying a protectant fungicide with long-term <b>residual</b> <b>action</b> should be employed.|$|E

It is the first inescapable step in the path toward the aware action which in theatre is the “action in perception”, i. e. thinking-in-movement. This aware thought involves the whole background of the person. It is an action that arises only when the person is present {{and at the same}} time dynamically involved entirely in the environment: it is the perceptual consciousness that integrates the planning of the action with the execution of the same action. “Thinking-in-movement” is a dynamic process that is not possible to be codified: it is a language that asks to be experienced in order to be able to be understood and learned. Therefore, what is the Score? Is it a concept, a method of movement, or a digital tool? Perhaps it is each one of these things. The Score is an indispensable algorithm to read the dance that the human writes in order to obtain information, transfer them and so continue in the evolution of the body knowledge.

40|$|A Petrov-Galerkin {{projection}} {{method is}} proposed {{for reducing the}} dimension of a discrete non-linear static or dynamic computational model in view of enabling its processing in real time. The right reduced-order basis is chosen to be invariant and is constructed using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition method. The left reduced-order basis is selected to minimize the two-norm of the residual arising at each Newton iteration. Thus, this basis is iteration-dependent, enables capturing of non-linearities, and leads to the globally convergent Gauss-Newton method. To avoid the significant computational cost of assembling the reduced-order operators, the <b>residual</b> and <b>action</b> of the Jacobian on the right reduced-order basis are each approximated by {{the product of an}} invariant, large-scale matrix, and an iteration-dependent, smaller one. The invariant matrix is computed using a data compression procedure that meets proposed consistency requirements. The iteration-dependent matrix is computed to enable the least-squares reconstruction of some entries of the approximated quantities. The results obtained for the solution of a turbulent flow problem and several non-linear structural dynamics problems highlight the merit of the proposed consistency requirements. They also demonstrate the potential of this method to significantly reduce the computational cost associated with high-dimensional non-linear models while retaining their accuracy. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|We prove cut-elimination for a sequent-style proof {{system which}} is sound and {{complete}} for the equational theory of Kleene algebra, and where proofs are potentially non-wellfounded infinite trees. We extend these results to systems with meets and <b>residuals,</b> capturing 'star-continuous' <b>action</b> lattices {{in a similar}} way. We recover the equational theory of all action lattices by restricting to regular proofs (with cut) —those proofs that are unfoldings of finite graphs. 1 Introduction The axioms of Kleene algebra are sound and complete for the theory of regular expressions under language equivalence [18, 24]. As a consequence, the equational theory of Kleene algebra is decidable (actually PSpace-complete). Models of these axioms of particular interest include formal languages and binary relations. For binary relations, Kleene star is interpreted as reflexive transitive closure, and the axioms of Kleene algebra {{make it possible to}} reason abstractly about program correctness [20, 21, 3, 15, 1]. The aforementioned decidability result moreover makes it possible to design automation tactics in proof assistants [4, 22, 27]. In previous work [8], we briefly discussed a sequent system for Kleene algebra, LKA, where proofs are finitely branching, but possibly infinitely deep (not well-founded). We observed that this system is sound w. r. t. Kleene algebra but that its regular fragment— those proofs which are unfoldings of finite graphs—is incomplete without cut. Our main contribution there was a variant of it based on 'hypersequents', whose regular fragment is sound and complete without cut. In this paper we step back and study the proof theory of LKA, namely proving cut-elimination. This completes the corresponding proof-theoretical account of Kleene algebra and we show how to exploit this method to characterise important extensions of Kleene algebra: action algebra [28], whose language includes <b>residuals,</b> and <b>action</b> lattices [19], whose language further inlcudes meets. Kleene algebra We focus on pure Kleene algebra first, which is easier to handle and enables a simpler presentation. Our key contribution here is that we give a simple validity criterion for proofs with cut, and prove that the corresponding system admits cut-elimination (Thm. 13). The difficulty in the presence of infinitely deep proofs consists in proving that cut-elimination is productive; we do so by using the natural interpretation of regular expressions as data types for parse-trees [11], and by giving an interpretation of proofs as parse-tree transformers. (Such an idea already appears in [14] but for a finitary natural deduction system rather than for a non-wellfounded sequent calculus). Cut-elimination is crucial later to obtai...|$|R

Some 34 % of the potent inhibitory action of adrenaline on PGE 1 -stimulated adenylate cyclase was obliterated in a dose-dependent fashion (concn. giving 50 % inhibition = 12. 5 mM) by benzyl alcohol, with the <b>residual</b> inhibitory <b>action</b> being apparently resistant to the action of benzyl alcohol at concentrations up to 50 mM.

We suggest that (i) alpha 2 -adrenoceptor- and Gi-mediated inhibition of PGE 1 -stimulated adenylate cyclase may have two components, one of which is sensitive to inhibition by benzyl alcohol, and (ii) the Gi-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase exhibits predominantly the benzyl alcohol-insensitive component...|$|R

Only one cell line (HD, melanotic) consistently responded to the hormone analog by increased tyrosinase activity. Three (one melanotic, two amelanotic) of the HMC lines also {{failed to respond to}} the peptide by either increased or decreased enzyme activity when incubated continuously {{in the presence of the}} peptide for longer periods of time (6, 15, 27, 43 days). The HD cell line, however again responded with increasingly enhanced basal enzyme activity the longer the cells were incubated in the presence of the melanotropin. One amelanotic cell line (C 8161) responded with enhanced enzyme activity when grown to confluency in the continuous presence of the peptide. Basal tyrosinase activity of the C 8161 cell line may have increased as cell density in the flasks increased. These results suggest that under conditions of increased cell number, phenotypic expression of tyrosinase activity in so called 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 amelanotic 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 (tyrosinase-negative) cells is increased and can be enhanced further by stimulation with a melanotropic peptide.
