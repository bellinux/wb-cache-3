25|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. The current view, though still {{a matter of some}} debate, asserts that as a consequence, a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is thought to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted. The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate. The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists. One of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movement itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement, as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism. In short, the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement: mantle dynamics related, gravity related (mostly secondary forces), and earth rotation related.|$|E

From the Rayleigh lidar photon-count returns <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> throughout the mesosphere, from 45 to 90 km, were determined. Using these <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> three density climatologies were derived, each using a different density normalization at 45 km. The first normalized the <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> to a constant; the second normalized them to the NRL-MSISe 00 empirical model, which has a strong semiannual component; and the third normalized them to the CPC analyses model, which has a strong annual component. In each case the density profile for every night of a composite year was found by averaging the nighttime density profiles in a 31 -day by 11 -year window centered on that day. Despite the different normalizations, many common features were found in the seasonal behavior of the densities. One is a large seasonal variation maximizing in June at ~ 70 km. Another, above 80 km was a large shift in the maximum to earlier in the year.

2500|$|When Kevlar is spun, the {{resulting}} fiber has a tensile strength of about 3,620 MPa, and a <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> of 1.44. [...] The polymer owes its high strength {{to the many}} inter-chain bonds. These inter-molecular hydrogen bonds form between the carbonyl groups and NH centers. [...] Additional strength is derived from aromatic stacking interactions between adjacent strands. These interactions have a greater influence on Kevlar than the van der Waals interactions and chain length that typically influence the properties of other synthetic polymers and fibers such as Dyneema. The presence of salts and certain other impurities, especially calcium, could interfere with the strand interactions and care is taken to avoid inclusion in its production. Kevlar's structure consists of relatively rigid molecules which tend to form mostly planar sheet-like structures rather like silk protein.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the test is to provide an {{indication}} of the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> of granular deposits, such as sands and gravels from which {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain undisturbed samples. [...] The great merit of the test, and the main reason for its widespread use is that it is simple and inexpensive. The soil strength parameters which can be inferred are approximate, but may give a useful guide in ground conditions where it may not be possible to obtain borehole samples of adequate quality like gravels, sands, silts, clay containing sand or gravel and weak rock. In conditions where the quality of the undisturbed sample is suspect, e.g., very silty or very sandy clays, or hard clays, it is often advantageous to alternate the sampling with standard penetration tests to check the strength. If the samples are found to be unacceptably disturbed, it may be necessary to use a different method for measuring strength like the plate test. [...] When the test is carried out in granular soils below groundwater level, the soil may become loosened. In certain circumstances, it can be useful to continue driving the sampler beyond the distance specified, adding further drilling rods as necessary. Although this is not a standard penetration test, and should not be regarded as such, it may at least give an indication as to whether the deposit is really as loose as the standard test may indicate.|$|E
