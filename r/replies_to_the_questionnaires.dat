40|$|AbstractThe gradual {{growth of}} {{e-learning}} classes within the humanities raises {{a number of}} issues. E-learning is often perceived with distrust by teachers and students of the humanities disciplines: the percentage of e-learning classes is still very low compared to the total; attending students sometimes show a misunderstanding of the teaching methods associated with this approach; the familiarity of teachers and students with specific e-learning tools is limited, often {{at the expense of}} the effectiveness of the class. It is necessary to identify major issues related to communication and the use of learning contents belonging to e-learning classes in the humanities. The focus of key points is a prerequisite in order to develop solution strategies. A series of thematic questionnaires were distributed to teachers and tutors of e-learning classes within various Italian universities. Questions were developed following the experience of offering e-learning classes over the past two academic years at the Faculty of the Preservation of Cultural Heritage of the University of Bologna, located in Ravenna. Multiple choice questions aimed to create statistical data related to problems and generalized issues. Results from the analysis of the <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> allowed the authors to identify a number of recurring problems. Solutions adopted in a given year compared to the previous one have proved only partially effective. It is advisable to develop, on the basis of the identified problems, new programs and communication strategies for future e-learning classes. The test results will hopefully provide a basis for the preparation of a set of shared guidelines through which we can develop formal teaching and content standards able to help strengthen the provision of e-learning classes in the Classics...|$|E
40|$|Information {{regarding}} the carnival traditions {{can be found}} in medieval Moldavian chronicles, travellers’ itinerary notes, whose path ran across the territory of Moldavian Princedom, and Bukovina in particular; in the materials of archival and museum establishments in Ukraine and Moldova Republic (20 th century); in the <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> (end of the 19 th – beginning of the 21 st centuries); in the ethnographic anthologies, periodicals, village studies, studies dedicated to the ethnographic zones of Bukovina (second half of the 19 - 20 th centuries), folklore collections (20 th – beginning of the 21 st centuries) etc. In the present article information on carnival traditions described in the itinerary notes of the German Konrad Giltenbrant, in the chronicles of G. Ureche, M. Costin, I. Neculce, in the “Description of Moldova” by D. Kantemir is analyzed. More substantial material on carnival traditions of the Eastern Romanian Population in Bukovina {{can be found in}} the museum funds: in the scientific archive of the Chernivtsi Museum of People’s Architecture, in the Central Scientific Archive of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova Republic, in the ethnographic museum at the college of history, political science and international relations of the Chernivtsi University. Material on this subject presented in the studies “Moldavian People’s Drama” (1976), “Folk Historically Themed Theater in Moldova” (1980), “People’s Theater” (1981), “In the World of the People’s Theater” (1985) by G. Spataru, “Do you accept the horsey? – People’s Theater” (1983) by Yu. Filip etc. was analyzed. Bukovinian ethnographic material obtained with the help of the questionnaires, which were spread out by the certain researchers or scientific institutions starting from the last quarter of the 19 th until the end of the 20 th century: B. P. Hasdeu (70 - 80 s of the 19 th century), N. Densusanu (90 s of the 19 th century), employees of the Bucharest Ethnography and Folklore Institute named after C. Brăiloiu within the framework of the development program of the “Romanian ethnographic atlas” (material which describes the period from 1900 to 70 - 80 s of the 20 century), by the staff of the Romanian Academy of Sciences (1967 - 1974) is of real scientific value. Works of the Romanian researchers I. G. Sbiera, E. Niculiţă-Voronca, L. Bodnărescu, studies of the whole range of Bukovinian villages dedicated to the ethnographic zones of Bukovina, folklore collections etc. were also analyzed. Summing up the sources review, we should emphasize the existence of the substantial amount of archival and museum materials and periodicals dedicated to the carnival traditions of the Eastern Romanian Population in Bukovina chronologically dated from the 17 th – beginning of the 21 st centuries, which form the basis of the documentary support of the present issue. Further areal study of the phenomena of the Eastern Romanian ethnographic surrounding in Bukovina should be directed to the accumulation of the bigger volume of evidence, quantitative and qualitative increase of the map body which will allow the analytical view representation of the situation in the studied field...|$|E
40|$|Cette étude porte sur la {{situation}} et les pratiques des services de personnel dans les ministères du gouvernement du Québec en 1972 telles que décrites par les responsables eux-mêmes. The {{point of}} departure of this study in the observation that personnel management in government departments receives much less study than do the activities of {{central management and control}} agencies. In Quebec, the history of recent: reforms had dealt above all with the creation of the Civil Service Commission (1965), the Civil Service Department (1969) and the Treasury Board (1970). The Treasury Board acts for the Executive Council (Cabinet) in matters dealing with organization, establishment, working conditions and general administrative policy. The Civil Service Department has two main functions, to negociate contracts with civil servants' associations and to elaborate and coordinate government personnel policy. The Civil Service Commission has the usual role of guardian of the merit system ; it also has responsibility for the classification plan. The working hypothesis {{of this study is that}} government departments retain all personnel management tasks which have not been assumed by central management and control agencies. In order to try to test this hypothesis a questionnaire was sent, in the summer of 1972, to the directors of personnel in all Quebec government departments except the Civil Service Department. In all, written replies covering some fifteen departments were received, as well as some verbal comments in the course of interviews. The results give the impressions of the directors of personnel in the departments concerned. No additional research has yet been con-ducted to test these impressions against actual practice. This would be desirable for it is likely that both the central agencies and the department personnel officers have some impressions which are not supported by the facts. In terms of overall impressions it was found that the Treasury Board and the Department of Finance were viewed by the great majority as countrol agencies. The Civil Service Department and the Civil Service Commission were viewed as agencies of both control and service, a reputation which is somewhat surprising in the case of the Commission. Over the entire range of personnel activities, the personnel directors report considerable initiative which falls to them. The classification framework is prepared by the Civil Service Commission but the classifying of positions is mainly done by the departments. Likewise, the departments must do their own planning for manpower requirements subject to Treasury Board approval. In competitions fornew appointments or for promotions, they provide the majority of the members of examining boards, under Civil Service Commission supervision. The Commission delegates a varying amount of authority to the departments in these matters but it always verifies the application of the law and the classification requirements. Each department alos must develop its own training programme within the general policy established by the Civil Service Department. Over the entire field of staffing procedures and practices, it appears that most departments do not as yet have thorough evaluation procedures to verify the degree of success or failure of these procedures and practices. With respect to labour relations, the departments are mainly involved with the application, not the negociation, of collective bargaining agreements. The main control of this application comes through the grievance procedure. If a grievance cannot be settled within a department, it then goes to arbitration. At this stage the employer's side is represented by the General Directorate of the Civil Service Department (DGRT)  ; the personnel service of the department where the grievance originated acts as adviser to the DGRT. On the subject of occasional and contractual employees, all departments are governed by the regulations issued by the Civil Service Commission (in the case of occasional employees) or by the Treasury Board (in the case of contractual employees). The departments have considerable freedom in these cases because there are no permanent positions involved, no Civil Service Commission competitions and no fixed rules about wages etc., other than the going rates for similar jobs. In conclusion, the <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> support the hypothesis of a considerable residue of departmental responsibility in personnel administration. In fact, the growth of central agency activity requires increased activity and competency at the departmental level. The Quebec Government has recognized the importance of the departmental directors of personnel by the creation of the Advisory Committee of Personnel Managers, which reports to all three central agencies. Another conclusion to the study is that the Civil Service Department, while it has established itself as a service agency in the eyes of the other departments, does not appear to have overcome the problem of the dispersal of decision centers as it was supposed to do. One reason for this is the coexistence of the merit system, with the powers it entails for the Civil Service Commission, and the collective bargaining system, with its own structures for policy making and the arbitration of grievances...|$|E

40|$|Listeriosis, {{caused by}} Listeria monocytogenes, is a {{significant}} public-health concern {{as a result of}} its clinical severity and high mortality. Large foodborne outbreaks of listeriosis have occurred during the last two decades in Europe and the United States, but to date there have been no food-mediated epidemics of the disease and very little information is available on the number of cases of listeriosis in Japan. We performed a nationwide surveillance study of listeriosis. The data were collected between 1980 and 2002, and 95 case reports were identified from 1996 to 2002. We divided 13. 6 (cases per year between 1996 and 2002) by the ratio of the number of beds in hospitals that <b>replied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> <b>to</b> that of all the hospitals in Japan and estimated that there is an average of 83 cases of listeriosis per year and an incidence of 0. 65 cases per million of the population in Japan...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempted}} to clarify yearly activity of school nurses {{and to ask}} them to self-evaluate their jobs in school health. We developed a new self-evaluation method consisting of elements and items. The element means the viewpoint of evaluation and <b>the</b> item belonging <b>to</b> each element means <b>the</b> question <b>to</b> <b>reply.</b> <b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> were distributed <b>to</b> school nurses in primary school, junior high school, senior high school, and school for handicapped children in Akita prefecture. One hundred ninety-eight persons <b>replied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> <b>The</b> results disclosed actual conditions of school nurses, such as their educational backgrounds, ideal goals in the jobs, yearly activity, and so on. School health activity was different among four kinds of schools mentioned above, and also among school sizes {{based on the number of}} children. Self-evaluation resulted in that there were statistically significant differences in mean scores for self-evaluation elements. Especially the mean score of health education element was the lowest of all elements, which may imply that it is difficult to teach children in the class because of some reason. Most of school nurses replied that self-evaluation method devised in this study was useful in improving their jobs <b>to</b> do. <b>The</b> self-evaluation method was a little modified according to comments from school nurses. It is supposed that occupational independence for school nurses might be recognized and established through improving and qualifying school health activity by means of repetitive self-evaluations...|$|R
