5|$|Uniparental {{inheritance}} {{leads to}} little opportunity for genetic <b>recombination</b> between different lineages of mitochondria, although a single mitochondrion can contain 2–10 copies of its DNA. For this reason, mitochondrial DNA is usually thought to reproduce by binary fission. What <b>recombination</b> does take place maintains genetic integrity rather than maintaining diversity. However, there are studies showing evidence of <b>recombination</b> in mitochondrial DNA. It {{is clear that}} the enzymes necessary for <b>recombination</b> are present in mammalian cells. Further, evidence suggests that animal mitochondria can undergo <b>recombination.</b> The data are a bit more controversial in humans, although indirect evidence of <b>recombination</b> exists. If <b>recombination</b> does not occur, the whole mitochondrial DNA sequence represents a single haplotype, which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations.|$|E
5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} <b>recombination</b> is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice <b>recombination)</b> by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of <b>recombination</b> in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that <b>recombination</b> is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that <b>recombination</b> in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E

In orthotopic <b>recombinations,</b> migrating cells originating from the grafted unsegmented or segmented somitic mesoderm adjacent to the wing or leg field end up in the musculature respectively of the wing or the leg, where they express exclusively myogenic properties. Thus, in these heterospecific <b>recombinations,</b> the anatomical muscle has a double origin: muscle bulk of somitic origin; tendons and connective tissues of somatopleural origin. Similar features are observed in heterotopic <b>recombinations</b> with (segmented or unsegmented) somitic mesoderm located cranially or caudally to the limb levels. In the reverse chick-to-quail grafting experiments, the somitic participation to the limb mesoderm can also be observed. But it is less regular than that obtained in the quail-to-chick <b>recombinations,</b> and the muscle bulk is made up in various proportions of graft-originated somitic cells and of host somatopleural cells. The possible existence of juxtaposed and interdigitated myogenic and tendinogenic compartments is discussed in view of the dissimilarity between the results of the two kinds of heterospecific <b>recombinations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Homologous <b>recombination</b> {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} <b>recombination</b> in which {{nucleotide}} sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is most widely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. Homologous <b>recombination</b> also produces new combinations of DNA sequences during meiosis, the process by which eukaryotes make gamete cells, like sperm and egg cells in animals. These new combinations of DNA represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn enables populations to adapt during the course of evolution. Homologous <b>recombination</b> is also used in horizontal gene transfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of bacteria and viruses.|$|E

5|$|<b>Recombination</b> allows {{chromosomes}} {{to exchange}} genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, {{which increases the}} efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.

5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous <b>recombination,</b> where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous <b>recombination</b> can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The <b>recombination</b> reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in <b>recombination</b> is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The <b>recombination</b> reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during <b>recombination.</b> There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during <b>recombination</b> makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E

5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous <b>recombination.</b> Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. Homologous <b>recombination</b> occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, <b>recombination</b> occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous <b>recombination,</b> giving patch products (if in same orientation during double strand break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E

Although a wealth of information was generated, the data are disappointingly complex and do not support simple models of transmission. Several observations have apparently weakened the value and complicated the interpretation of genotyping methods. For several methods, instability of genotype has been demonstrated, due to <b>recombinations</b> with or without transformation. C. jejuni is partly non-clonal, as demonstrated by multilocus sequence typing, which is explained by a natural ability to take up DNA. Plasticity of the genome, allowing for <b>recombinations</b> involving large DNA segments, and <b>recombinations</b> within loci frequently used for typing, further complicates the interpretation of typing data.

5|$|Homologous <b>recombination</b> {{requires}} {{the presence of}} an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by <b>recombination.</b>|$|E
5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction.

In a related process called homologous <b>recombination,</b> sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. <b>Recombination</b> and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles.
