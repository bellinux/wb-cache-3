40|$|Protecting {{pharmaceutical}} products against counterfeiting or the fraudulent importation of donated and discounted drugs {{will remain a}} permanent challenge {{in light of the}} increased frequency of counterfeiting. The increasing complexity of the supply chain in today's global economy complicates certification of each individual supply source. This complexity is a key factor in the rapid increase of counterfeiting attacks, including those in countries where the supply chains are well established and trustworthy. In this article, an innovative solution based on the white-light speckle theory (visible speckle obtained as ultraviolet fluorescence) is applied to an ultraviolet source, which allows drug packages to be linked with a barcode. The basis of the proposed method is the biometric paradigm, applied to nonliving matter, which requires the identification of a unique distinctive matter characteristic for the unique identification of the related object. The identified characteristic is not an inherent characteristic of the object itself; instead, a white-light speckle pattern will be artificially added. This speckle pattern becomes a sort of fingerprint for the drug package. Starting from this pattern, drug packages can be authenticated by a biometric-like approach.

40|$|Background: {{the dose}} {{and the length}} of rehabilitative {{interventions}} for optimal motor recovery after stroke are unknown. Dose optimization studies are required as precursors to efficacy trials, but are rarely conducted in stroke rehabilitation research. Objective: to overcome the knowledge gap on appropriate dose and length of rehabilitative interventions guiding the implementation of novel effective approaches to dose optimization in stroke rehabilitation research. Method: two systematic reviews on dose optimization in exercise-based training and pharmaceutical clinical research guided {{the development of a new}} approach to dose-finding suitable for physical interventions. The feasibility of a novel phase I 3 + 3 rule-based, outcome-adaptive dose-finding design was assessed with stroke survivors with moderate upper limb paresis. Moreover, the feasibility of a repetitive assessment procedure to identify the appropriate length of motor interventions was explored in stroke rehabilitation research. Results: the first literature review showed a lack of reliable approaches to dose optimization in exercise-based training. The <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> research highlighted dose optimization “gold” standard approaches, and helped in devising the dose-finding study for physical intervention. The dose-finding study was feasible using the applied model-task intervention. Preliminary explorations on the dose-response relationship were possible indicating a maximum tolerable dose and a potential recommended dose of 209 and 162 repetitions respectively of the applied intervention-task. The repetitive assessment procedure was found feasible in a clinical efficacy stroke rehabilitative trial. The repetitive assessment procedure provided relevant data on the therapy effect over-time showing that more than six weeks of the applied upper limb intervention may be necessary to reach maximal therapy effects. Whereas, five weeks of intervention appeared enough to exploit therapy effects for the lower limb. Conclusions: results are promising on identifying relevant dose and protocol endpoints implementing dose-finding and repetitive assessments approaches in stroke rehabilitation.

40|$|Background: Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD) {{is the most}} common cause of death in the UK. CHD cost the UK National Health Service (NHS) Lstg 3. 5 billion in 2003. The {{economic}} impact of community pharmacists providing a medicines management service for patients with CHD has not been rigorously evaluated; the full economic costs of such interventions are rarely presented in the literature. Objective: To examine the incremental costs of a 1 -year community pharmacist-led medicines management service for patients with CHD in the UK, from a healthcare system and patient perspective. Methods and participants: A cost-minimisation analysis was conducted alongside a multicentre randomised controlled trial. The primary study participants were patients with CHD identified from general practice computer records. Patients (intervention, n_=_ 980; control, n_=_ 500) from 38 general practices in nine geographical areas in the UK were included in the study. Intervention and outcomes measures: The intervention consisted <b>of</b> a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and lifestyle advice by pharmacists in their premises, with recommendations communicated to the patient's GP. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost per patient in the intervention group compared with the control group. Annual costs (Lstg, 2003 / 4 values) included the costs of the intervention (training and delivery costs), the usual costs of NHS treatment (costs <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> GP and hospital visits) and costs borne by patients. Data were collected in the 12 months before and 12 months after the intervention. Results: The total NHS cost increased between baseline and follow-up in both groups (from Lstg 1243 to Lstg 1286 [3 %] in the control group and from Lstg 1410 to Lstg 1433 [2 %] in the intervention group). The greater cost in the intervention group largely reflects the additional cost of the pharmacist training and the time taken to deliver the intervention; the difference in costs between the intervention and control groups, after controlling for differences in costs at baseline at follow-up, was statistically significant (p_=_ 0. 001). The costs <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> was higher in the intervention group (Lstg 769. 20 vs Lstg 742. 3; p_=_ 0. 04). According to the sensitivity analysis, the intervention cost would need to decrease by 35 % to achieve equivalence between costs in each arm of the trial. Difference to costs of patients and their carers at follow-up were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The introduction of a 1 -year pharmacist-led medicines management service is likely to increase the total cost of CHD treatment and prevention from the healthcare perspective, as the cost of the intervention outweighed the observed reduction in the cost of drugs in the intervention group. No changes in costs from the patient perspective were found. Coronary-disorders, Cost-minimisation, Pharmaceutical-services, Randomised-controlled-trials...|$|R

A growing recognition exists of the influence <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> sponsorship on the reported findings of published clinical trials.

Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} review the most influential literature regarding thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke and document the presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> sponsorship. Methods: A publication-citation analysis was performed to identify the most frequently cited articles pertaining to thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke.
