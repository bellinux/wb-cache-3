5|$|The {{film was}} {{arranged}} by U2 management to showcase the band's live act {{and to promote}} them to American audiences. It depicts the band's performance at <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> on a rain-soaked evening. The concert was almost cancelled because of the inclement weather, but the band had invested in the filming with Island Records and concert promoter Barry Fey and wished {{to proceed with the}} gig. The rain and the torch-lit atmosphere of the surroundings made U2's performance dramatic. Segments of U2 Live at <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> were shown in regular rotation on MTV, and were also broadcast on other television networks.|$|E
5|$|U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky is {{a concert}} film by Irish rock band U2. It was {{recorded}} on 5 June 1983 at <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> Amphitheatre in Colorado, United States, on the group's War Tour. Originally released in 1984 on videocassette, U2 Live at <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> was the band's first video release. It accompanied a 1983 live album entitled Under a Blood Red Sky, on which two tracks {{from the film}} appear. The video was directed by Gavin Taylor and produced by Rick Wurpel and Doug Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade raced {{against his}} stable {{companion}} Dylan Thomas {{again in the}} Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September. He led into the straight before being overtaken by Dylan Thomas, and although he had no chance with the winner he stayed on to take second ahead of notable winners such as <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> (Breeders' Cup Turf), Maraahel (Hardwicke Stakes) and Finsceal Beo (1000 Guineas). O'Brien {{was pleased with the}} run and said that Duke of Marmalade was still improving. On his final start of the year he was brought back to one mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he led until the last quarter mile, setting a strong pace, before finishing third to Ramonti and Excellent Art.|$|E
50|$|The Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare {{or greater}} <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) is {{a species of}} mammal in the family Leporidae. It is found in Mozambique and South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Jameson's <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare {{is not on}} any {{endangered}} {{or threatened}} list. The habitat it uses, as with many other animals' habitats, is endangered because of human encroachment. The continent of Africa, even the region this species is found, is often war-torn and this may affect Jameson's <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare, its habitat, or both. Currently, though, the population of Jameson's <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare appears to be stable.|$|R
500|$|French {{zoologist}} Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{first described}} the Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare in 1832 and classified {{it in the}} genus Lepus, giving it the name Lepus crassicaudatus. American mammalogist Marcus Ward Lyon Jr. later placed the Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare in the genus Pronolagus in 1906, and it was given the name Pronolagus crassicaudatus. [...] It was previously considered a subspecies of the Jameson's <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare (P. randensis).|$|R
5|$|An early road {{following}} the current path {{was established in}} the late 19th century for miners and loggers. As floods ravaged the road along Bear Creek through the early 20th century, measures were taken to prevent further damage. Other sites along Bear Creek, such as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> Park and the Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain Drive, as the section between Idledale and Morrison is called, have given the route a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. An early designation of the route number went further west than its current-day designation; that section was truncated by the late 1930s. Another eastern segment was added from Morrison east toward Denver in the 1940s, but that section too was removed. Newer improvements to the road include widening the Evergreen Parkway segment to four lanes and constructing an interchange with I-70.|$|E
5|$|SH74, {{now known}} as Bear Creek Road, curves east- and northward as it winds out of town. Narrowing to two lanes, the route follows the path of Bear Creek, curving northeasterly toward Kittredge with Pence Park on the east side. In Kittredge, the route meets CR 120 (Myers Gulch Road), which heads {{southeast}} toward Indian Hills. The route again meets Kerr Gulch Road, which bypasses the large curve which SH74 took. From Kittredge, SH74 winds eastward {{on the north side}} of Bear Creek. The roadway passes Idledale north of the Lair O the Bear Park, where it intersects Grapevine Road. East of the town, an abandoned section of SH74 exists, which now serves as a path to private areas. The route heads into Bear Creek Canyon Park, where it curves along the creek in a more rocky terrain. SH74 also passes through <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> Park along the stream. Exiting the park, SH74 enters Morrison, where Bear Creek Road meets SH8 at an intersection. From here, SH8 (Morrison Road) serves as the continuation of the road toward Denver.|$|E
5|$|When {{the boys}} regain consciousness, they are {{backstage}} at the Televised Jonas Brothers' 3D concert spectacular at <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> Amphitheatre. Mickey interrogates them and eventually threatens {{them with a}} chainsaw, refusing to believe they are not working for another company. As Mickey once again rants about his true intentions, this time insulting the Jonas Brothers' fans and Christians, Kyle stealthily turns {{on one of the}} microphones and Cartman raises the curtain, broadcasting Mickey's rant to both the concert-goers and the national television audience. When Mickey realizes that the curtains are raised, the crowd turns on Mickey and the Jonas Brothers leave the stage in a huff. An enraged Mickey grows to an enormous size and begins blowing fire and destroying most of Denver. Tammy and Kenny remove their purity rings, and Tammy suggests they go to T.G.I. Friday's, much to Kenny's excitement. The show immediately cuts to Kenny's funeral, where the audience learns that he contracted syphilis after receiving a blowjob from his girlfriend Tammy Warner and died as a result.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} edition of Mammal Species of the World {{published}} in 2005, R. S. Hoffman and A. T. Smith listed the Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) {{as a separate}} species and included its four taxonomic synonyms: P. c. kariegae (Hewitt, 1927); P. c. lebombo (Roberts, 1936); P. c. lebomboensis (Roberts, 1936); and P. c. ruddi (Thomas and Schwann, 1905). They described the taxonomic relationship between the Natal <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare and Jameson's <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare (P. randensis) as unclear.|$|R
50|$|Jameson's <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare (Pronolagus randensis) is a leporid {{found only}} on the {{continent}} of Africa, mostly in the southern portion of the continent.

Zimbabwe and Namibia are thought to have the largest populations of the <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> hare and it is said to be found throughout both countries.|$|R
5|$|The group's <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks</b> {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} for 5 June 1983, but poor weather that day threatened to cancel the show. Torrential rain soaked the area, and flash flood warnings were issued. The weather {{made it difficult for}} the crew members to transport the band's gear and video equipment through the mountains to the amphitheatre. The conditions also caused many technical problems for the filming and concert crews, which hampered stage construction and endangered the safety of those setting up lighting and sound equipment. Crew members used squeegees to keep rain away from the wires, although the assistant of recording engineer Randy Ezratty still received an electrical shock while setting up a lighting truss. The fans that attended had to hike through the Rocky Mountains in the rain. Between 15 and 20 fans were already camped out in the venue's front rows early in the morning, and lead singer Bono accommodated them by serving coffee and tea. The Alarm and Divinyls cancelled their opening sets for safety reasons, and many fans thought the entire concert had been cancelled. The show {{was scheduled for}} 6:00pm, and the band had until 1:00pm to decide whether to move the concert elsewhere or risk the weather worsening, which could have necessitated a cancellation.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, 2016, it was {{announced}} that the band would be releasing a new live album, BNL Rocks <b>Red</b> <b>Rocks,</b> on May 20, 2016.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Presentation date: 2001 - 06 - 08 In Yaquina Bay, Oregon, I {{observed}} {{very little}} overlap {{in the distribution}} of the invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, and the larger <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> crab, Cancer productus. Red rock crabs dominate the more saline, cooler lower estuary and green crabs, the less saline, warmer upper estuary. Because caged green crabs survive well in the lower estuary, I decided to test the hypothesis that <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> crabs prey on green crabs and thus contribute to their exclusion from the more physically benign lower estuary. A laboratory species interaction experiment was designed to determine whether <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> crabs prey on smaller green crabs at a higher rate than on smaller crabs of their own species. Crabs of both species were collected and sorted by weight into three size classes: small, medium and large. Small and medium crabs of both species were paired with green crabs or <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> crabs of various sizes. Crab pairs were housed in individual arenas and allowed to interact for seven days. When conspecifics were paired, mortality was less than 15...|$|R
