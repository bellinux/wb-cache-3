[...] Trover was not a strictly proprietary remedy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an action for conversion, the plaintiff must {{have an interest in}} the thing converted. [...] He must recover on the strength of his own title, without regard to the weakness of that of his adversary. [...] It is necessary that the plaintiff be the owner of the property claimed to be converted, or that he be in possession or entitled to possession {{at the time of the}} alleged conversion. [...] Absolute and unqualified title is sufficient, but it is not necessary. [...] A mere <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> is generally regarded as an interest sufficient to maintain an action.|$|E
2500|$|An agent {{entrusted}} by {{a principal}} with {{the possession of}} goods is generally recognized as having a sufficient interest in the goods to enable him to maintain an action against a third person for a conversion. [...] Some jurisdictions hold that the agent must {{have more than a}} mere <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession.</b> [...] A similar result has been reached where the servant left the property in the possession of the defendant, who subsequently converted it. [...] Where a sheriff attached chattels and delivered them for safekeeping to a person, the person was merely the sheriff's servant, and having no interest in the chattels, could not maintain an action for their conversion. Causes of action for conversion are generally assignable, so that the action may be instituted by the assignee. An officer in possession of property may ignore a conversion of the same by a wrongdoer and proceed to sell the property on execution, the purchaser then being permitted to sue the wrongdoer for the conversion of the property. A transferee of personal property, or interest therein, who acquires the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> by or through the transfer, may maintain an action for a conversion committed after the transfer, though he has not yet received actual possession of the goods. A creditor, having no interest, generally may not be a plaintiff in an action to retrieve a debtor's converted property. An owner of land may bring an action in conversion, but he must be in material possession of the land and of the property severed from the land {{at the time of the}} conversion.|$|E

2500|$|In Sykes v Walls , a {{claim of}} {{wrongful}} detention by a bailee was upheld as a good claim {{on the ground that}} a refusal to deliver up constituted a [...] "misfeasance". [...] By this case, trover became virtually concurrent with detinue. [...] When a chattel had been found, and there was a subsequent refusal to deliver it to the owner, it was taken as evidence that a conversion had occurred. Trover was a wrong against the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> and not against the possession itself, because possession was prima facie in the wrong-doer. Even when trover was allowed to overlap trespass and replevin, which were concerned with possession, it remained necessary to define conversion, and this extension did not really affect the definition. Conversion became any act {{on the part of the}} defendant inconsistent with the plaintiff's right to possession. [...] This right had parts: [...] it had to be (1) absolute and (2) immediate.|$|E
2500|$|The third quatrain {{sets up the}} {{decision}} to be made about this 'battle'. Line 9-10 explains that deciding this legal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> requires a jury of thoughts and these thoughts are all tenants of the heart. The jury decides the verdict and what share (moiety) the clear eye and dear heart will receive. The rhyming couplet offers the final decision. Author G. Blackmore Evans believes the 'outward part' refers to the external physical beauty; the eyes are granted the exercise of their physical attribute of sight. According to Evans, the 'right' of the heart perhaps suggests the 'natural right' making it a stronger word and emphasizing {{the superiority of the}} heart's claim: [...] "'thy inward love of heart' is the spiritual/mental love of your heart and is a 'part' of you in value far beyond the 'due' accorded to the eyes because it is the 'essential' you, not merely the 'appearance'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The use of or {{intermeddling}} (a term usually {{applicable to}} estate law) with {{the property of}} another has often been held to constitute a conversion, whether the act is done by one who had no authority to use the property, or by one who has authority to use the property but uses it in an unauthorized way. [...] Any unjustified exercise of dominion over property by one who is not the owner nor entitled to possession which interferes with the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> of another who is lawfully entitled thereto constitutes a conversion. [...] According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, one who uses a chattel in a manner which is a serious violation {{of the right of}} another to control its use is subject to liability to the other for conversion. [...] A conversion may be predicated upon destruction of personal property. [...] An action for conversion may lie for killing an animal or rendering a musical instrument useless.|$|E

The taxation system which had been introduced by Empress Jitō in the late 7th century began to malfunction.

2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} may be maintained by persons having the immediate <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> {{of the article}} converted. [...] In order for a plaintiff to recover in a suit for conversion, {{it is necessary that}} the plaintiff establish a right to the property and what is converted. [...] An immediate right to possession at the time of conversion is usually all that is required in the way of title or possession to enable the plaintiff to maintain an action. [...] The possession of personal property carries with it the presumption of title, and enables the possessor to maintain an action for conversion against any person except the rightful owner. [...] As against a stranger with no possession rights, mere possession alone is good enough, and in such a case, the plaintiff need prove no more than possession. Generally, a peaceable possession of land, even though wrongful, is a sufficient interest on which to base an action for conversion against a trespasser upon the land who severs property from the soil as part of the trespass, although neither party has title to the land or the property severed therefrom.|$|E
2500|$|Property law governs {{ownership}} and possession. Real property, sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership {{of land and}} things attached to it. Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A right in rem is {{a right to a}} specific piece of property, contrasting to a right in personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [...] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.|$|E
