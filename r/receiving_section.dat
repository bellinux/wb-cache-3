40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{importance}} of locating people and objects and communicating with them in real time has become a common occurrence in every day life. Nowadays, {{the state of the}} art of location systems for indoor environments has not a dominant technology as instead occurs in location systems for outdoor environments, where GPS is the dominant technology. In fact, each location technology for indoor environments presents a set of features that do not allow their use in the overall application scenarios, but due its characteristics, it can well coexist with other similar technologies, without being dominant and more adopted than the others indoor location systems. In this context, the European project SELECT studies the opportunity of collecting all these different features in an innovative system which can be used in a large number of application scenarios. The goal of this project is to realize a wireless system, where a network of fixed readers able to query one or more tags attached to objects to be located.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} based on bio-signal sensing was used for real time accident avoidance. A wireless embedded system with real time bio-signal processing techniquewas proposed. The bio-signals sensor module consists of ECG, EEG, EOG and alcohol sensor. These bio-signals were first acquired by the sensor module. Then the signal is processed and scheduled in the processor {{with the help of}} the RTOS installed in it. The processed signal is transmitted to the <b>receiving</b> <b>section</b> by using the wireless data communication. The receiver unit can read the sensor data from wireless receiver module using zig-bee protocol. This received real time sensor data is compared with the pre-determined data stored in the processor memory and the decision was taken.

The parking light must be turned on before the engine stops so that the driver’s coming behind can control the vehicle and thereby accident can be avoided...|$|E

The study identified social, environmental, and management characteristics possibly associated with concentrated levels of crime at Section 8 apartment complexes. As previous studies have shown, crime is concentrated at a few apartment complexes {{with a number of}} common characteristics such as a large minority population and a large amount of litter at the complex. In addition, a perspective of the effectiveness of hot-spot policing was obtained from beat officers who are familiar with the neighborhood with the targeted apartment complexes. A community survey was utilized to assess the current perspective of the apartment complex residents toward current policing tactics as well as their perception of safety. It was hypothesized that law-abiding citizens will be supportive of current and future measures to reduce crime in their neighborhood. Apartment complex residents who fear for themselves and their loved ones were at least moderately supportive of hot-spot policing. The multiple methods utilized contribute to the existing literature and lead to promising directions to consider for additional hot-spot research...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the {{advances in the}} development of two innovative flat array antennas for Ku-band mobile satellite terminals. The first antenna is specifically conceived for double-deck trains to allow a bi-directional high data rate satellite link. The available circular surface (diameter 80 &#x 2009;cm) integrates both a transmitting and a <b>receiving</b> <b>section,</b> operating in orthogonal linear polarizations. The TX frequency range is fully covered while the RX bandwidth is around 1 &#x 2009;GHz arbitrarily allocated on the DVB range depending on requirements. The beam is steered in elevation through a phased array architecture not employing costly phase shifters, while the steering in azimuth is mechanical. Active BFNs allow excellent performance in terms of EIRP and G/T, maintaining extremely low profile. High antenna efficiency and low fabrication cost are ensured by the employment of innovative SIW (Substrate Integrated Waveguide) structures. The second antenna, receiving-only, is designed for radio/video streaming services in mobile environment. Full DVB coverage is achieved thanks to cavity-backed patches operating in double linear polarization. Two independent broadband active BFNs allow simultaneous reception of both polarizations with full tracking capabilities and a squintless beam steering from 20 &#x 2218; to 60 &#x 2218; in elevation. A minimum gain of 20 &#x 2009;dBi and G/T &# 62;&#x 2212; 3 &#x 2009;dB/K&#x 2218; are achieved, while maintaining extremely compact size and flat profile. In the design of both antennas fabrication cost is considered as a driving factor, yet providing high performance with a flat profile and thus resulting in a great commercial potentiality...|$|E

Then thermal comfort of the workers was assessed by using ASHRAE thermal sensation scale by using Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Further Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD) was used to estimate the thermal comfort satisfaction of the occupant. Finally the PPD versus PMV were plotted to present the thermal comfort scenario of workers involved in related workstation. Results: The trend of relative humidity curve from the graph also indicated the increasing level of discomfort. The radiant temperature observed seems consistent during the study while there was decreasing of WBGT start from afternoon due to the rain. The study revealed that the PPD value of 54 % of the workers population at the workstation are likely to be satisfied with thermal comfort at this station while the PMV index from ASHRAE indicated the value 1. 07 - 1. 41. Conclusion: The empirical study from the PPD and PMV index indicated that workers working at this were influenced by the heat. The less of PPD value from 80 % of the population satisfied with the thermal comfort showed the environment factors that were not good for worker while the PMV index showed the area of work is slightly warm...|$|E
