De Donis, The Statutes of Uses and of Wills, but gave wider scope to the development by the courts of rules of law to thwart the attempt of the great landowners to tie up their landed estates in their families in perpetuity. One body of rules to this end limited <b>restraints</b> <b>upon</b> <b>alienation,</b> another the creation of future interests vesting at too remote a period. Restriction of <b>restraints</b> <b>upon</b> <b>alienation,</b> and the rule against perpetuities, these two were developed for the same end, have been often confused, but are separate and distinct remedies. The rule against perpetuities seeks its end by forbidding the postponement of the vesting of future interests beyond the period of a life or lives in being and twenty-one years and nine or ten months. The other rule forbids <b>restraints</b> <b>upon</b> the absolute power to convey realty, and of the absolute ownership of personalty, beyond a like period. Only in recent times have the two been clearly distinguished by the courts...|$|R

[...] "The right of alienation {{is one of the}} essential incidents of a right of general property in movables, and <b>restraints</b> <b>upon</b> <b>alienation</b> have been generally regarded as obnoxious to public policy, which is best subserved by great freedom of traffic in such things as pass from hand to hand. General restraint in the alienation of articles, things, chattels, except when a very special kind of property is involved, [...] [...] [...] have been generally held void." ...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{profit is}} {{prevalent}} in contemporary capitalist economies, yet its nature and sources remain unclear. In classical political economy, and for Marx, profit is conceptualised {{either as a}} fresh flow of value (profit from production) or {{as a share of}} existing flows of value (profit <b>upon</b> <b>alienation</b> or expropriation). This distinction is of critical importance in analysing financial profit, since the latter originates in both fresh and existing flows of value. The most complex form of financial profit relates to trading financial assets, and has a dual nature. In immediate terms, it arises from redistributing loanable capital; when mediated, it represents the accrual of future surplus value. If the mediation is incomplete, however, financial profit remains redistributed loanable capital, hence, a part of the existing flows of value. Thus, it is normally profit from production, but retains elements of profit <b>upon</b> <b>alienation</b> or expropriation. ...|$|R
