5|$|Another of Margate's rivals is Dover Athletic. Despite meeting <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> {{competitive}} {{games over}} recent years, both teams {{were in the}} Conference in the 2001–02 season. In that season, the last season the two teams {{were in the same}} division, the two games between Margate and Dover were watched by a combined total of over 6,000 spectators. The game played at Margate's Hartsdown Park stadium drew a crowd of 3,676, and 2,325 were in attendance for the game at Dover's Crabble stadium.|$|E

5|$|As {{he waited}} for the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E
5|$|C. b. banksii {{is found}} in Queensland and, <b>rarely,</b> <b>in</b> far {{northern}} New South Wales; {{it is the largest}} subspecies by overall body size and has a moderate-sized bill. It merges with subspecies macrorhynchus around the Gulf of Carpentaria. It has disappeared from much of its former range in northern New South Wales and southeast Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus impatiens {{is found}} in North America and Europe ({{including}} Germany, Poland, and the Ukraine) including northern Turkey. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, it {{is found in}} Oregon and Idaho. Fruit bodies grow solitarily, or <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> small bundles, on forest litter in deciduous forests, especially ones dominated by beech.|$|E

50|$|From mid 1943 {{the allied}} star was {{used on the}} sides of softskin and AFV vehicles, but <b>rarely</b> on AFV’s <b>in</b> Europe. A painted Union flag was <b>rarely</b> seen <b>in</b> late war.|$|R
5|$|Rodents {{such as the}} California ground squirrel, western gray squirrel, and dusky-footed woodrat live in this region. Birds such as grosbeaks, flycatchers, western tanagers, and lazuli {{buntings}} {{are common}} in the area. Nine species of warblers, three species of vireos, and two species of thrushes can also be found. The pileated woodpecker has been spotted <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> large pine trees.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> animals.|$|E
5|$|Tamazight, {{along with}} other Berber {{languages}} of Morocco, has a low sociolinguistic status, used mainly in the home, and <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> official or formal contexts; {{it is not an}} official language. However, media broadcasts and music are available in it, and there is a policy of teaching it in schools.|$|E

5|$|The corn crake breeds from Britain and Ireland east through Europe {{to central}} Siberia. Although it has {{vanished}} from {{much of its}} historic range, this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41°N and 62°N. There is also a sizable population in western China, but this species nests only <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> northern Spain and in Turkey. Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect, and result from misidentification of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the African rail.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), {{and it may be}} the first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (<b>rarely)</b> <b>in</b> the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Zugzwang, disadvantageous {{since it}} forces {{a player to}} move, is often a factor in endgames but <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> other stages of the game. In the example diagram, either side having the move is in zugzwang: Black to move must play 1...Kb7 {{allowing}} White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7; White to move must permit a draw, either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.|$|E

5|$|After sitar player Ravi Shankar {{successfully}} {{performed in}} Western countries, Narayan followed his example. He recorded solo albums {{and made his}} first international tour in 1964 to America and Europe with his older brother Chatur Lal, a tabla player who had toured with Shankar in the 1950s. The European tour included performances in France, Germany, sponsored by the Goethe-Institut, and at the City of London Festival, England. Beginning in the 1960s, Narayan often taught and gave concerts outside of India. On his Western tours he encountered interest in the sarangi because of its similarity to the cello and violin. The tabla player Suresh Talwalkar became a frequent accompanist for Narayan in the late 1960s. Narayan continued to perform and record in India and abroad for the next decades and his recordings appeared on Indian, American, and European labels. During the early 1980s he typically spent months each year visiting Western nations. Narayan performed less frequently in the 2000s and <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsia {{was coined}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890 to include dinosaurs {{possessing}} certain characteristic features, including horns, a rostral bone, teeth with two roots, fused neck vertebrae, and a forward-oriented pubis. Marsh considered the group distinct {{enough to warrant}} its own suborder within Ornithischia. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek κερας/keras meaning 'horn' and οψις/opsis meaning 'face'. As early as the 1960s, it was noted that the name Ceratopsia is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be Ceratopia. However, this spelling, while technically correct, has been used only <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> the scientific literature, {{and the vast majority of}} paleontologists continue to use Ceratopsia. As the ICZN does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily, this is unlikely to change.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> Canadian territory {{that it is}} impossible to tell whether they are permanent resident. Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), as well as the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Fowler {{featured}} <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> {{his final}} Liverpool season, making only six league starts. Bizarrely, {{all three of}} his League goals were penalties against Sheffield United. One of these was in the away game on {{the opening day of}} the season, and the other two in the reverse fixture at Anfield. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benítez's squad rotation policy. On 25 October 2006 Fowler was named as Liverpool's captain {{for the first time since}} his return in a League Cup tie against Reading, scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|Myxogastria are {{distributed}} worldwide; species were found by early researchers on all continents. However, as {{many parts of}} the world were yet not discovered or explored, the exact distribution is not fully known. Europe and North America are often considered the basic habitat of the Myxogastria species. According to recent research, the majority of species are not widely distributed. The Myxogastria are most commonly found in temperate latitudes, and <b>rarely</b> <b>in</b> the polar regions, the subtropics or tropics. The physical features of the substrate and climatic conditions are the major aspects of the species' presence. Endemism is rare.|$|E
