5000|$|McCafferty {{got a job}} as a solo {{programmer}} at Technitrol, Inc. in Philadelphia programming on an IBM 1130 computer. The company's president {{hired him}} due to his own lack of experience with programming, McCafferty's background with IBM and his understanding of the programming language FORTRAN. After a year employed as programmer and manager of the Data Processing department, he and the President of Technitrol decided to form a company in 1968 called Eastern Data Processing (EDP) as a subsidiary of Technitrol when McCafferty was only 26. The goal of this company was to provide computerized payroll services to businesses. It was intended to compete with a similar business called [...] "Automatic Data Processing". McCafferty was the company's President, and he had a 20% share in the company. In {{the first six months of}} the company's operation, the company saw $400,000 in losses, which was due in part to the fact that much of its business was not related to its intended business structure. As such, the company did not have a product to sell. Nevertheless, the Technitrol President allowed him to continue working with the company, though with a new vision for it. McCafferty then spent the next six years building a profitable business. In spite of these problems that the business faced early on, the combined success of it and other subsidiaries of Technitrol contributed to the parent company's success. The company experienced a 125% increase in sales between 1972 and 1973, an increase from $4.7 million to $10.6 million. Profits increased from $107,000 to $466,000. When his employer, E. Stuart Eichert, died, McCafferty learned that his promised shares in the company were not set in writing, and thus he lost his ownership in the company. He quit immediately.The first prototype for EDP ran on an IBM 360 Model 30 with IBM 2311 <b>disk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>drives</b> and two Tape Drives, and was programmed in COBOL.

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} {{performance and}} decreasing cost of processors and memory are causing system intelligence {{to move from}} the CPU to peripherals such as <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> <b>Storage</b> system designers are using this trend toward excessive computation capability to perform more complex processing and optimizations directly inside the storage devices. Such kind of optimizations have been performed only at low levels of the storage protocol. Another factor to consider is the current trends in storage density, mechanics, and electronics, which are eliminating the bottleneck encountered while moving data off the media, and putting pressure on interconnects and host processors to move data more efficiently. Previous work on active storage has taken advantage of the extra processing power on individual disk drives to run application-level code. This idea of moving portions of an application’s processing to run directly at disk drives can dramatically reduce data traffic and take advantage of the parallel storage already present in large systems today. This paper aims at demonstrating active storage on an iSCSI OSD standards-based object oriented framework. I...|$|R
