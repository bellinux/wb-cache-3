40|$|Questions: What is the {{economic}} value {{for an individual}} to invest in physiotherapy undergraduate education in Australia? How is this affected by increased education costs or decreased wages? Design: A cost-benefit analysis using a net present value (NPV) approach was conducted and reported in Australian dollars. In relation to physiotherapy education, the NPV represents future earnings as a physiotherapist minus the direct and indirect costs in obtaining the degree. Sensitivity {{analyses were conducted to}} consider varying levels of experience, public versus private sector, and domestic versus international student fees. Comparable calculations were made for educational investments in medicine and nursing/midwifery. Results: Assuming an expected discount rate of 9. 675 %, investment in education by domestic students with approximately 34 years of average work experience yields a NPV estimated at $ 784, 000 for public sector physiotherapists and $ 815, 000 for private sector therapists. In relation to international students, the NPV results for an investment and career as a physiotherapist is estimated at $ 705, 000 in the public sector and $ 736, 000 in the private sector. Conclusion: With an approximate payback period of 4 years, coupled with strong and positive NPV values, physiotherapy education in Australia is a financially attractive prospect and a viable value proposition for those considering a career in this field.

Anadromous fish were present at least as far upstream as Mendon, Massachusetts. While it appeared that salmon disappeared sometime in the 1700 <b>s,</b> <b>shad</b> and herring were caught into the 1800 s. The decline of these species has been attributed to the construction of dams along the river. Early laws passed by the Rhode Island General Assembly sought to protect the fisheries by limiting weirs, requiring that dams be opened seasonally, and that bypasses be made for the migrating fish. However, as manufacturing became increasingly important along the river, a gradual shift occurred, and laws were passed favoring factory owners and industrialization over the fisheries. The preexisting laws protecting the fishery were not enforced. Fish bypasses became blocked with dams of their own, the dams were made higher, and the flow of the river was often reduced. Other factors contributing to the decline of anadromous fish were the building of bridges that narrowed the river, the discharge of manufacturing wastes and sewage into the river, and overfishing...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis: The {{quality of}} care for chronic {{patients}} depends on the collaborative skills of the healthcare providers. 1, 2 The literature lacks reports {{of the use of}} simulation to teach collaborative skills in non-acute care settings. We posit that simulation offers benefits for supporting the development of collaborative practice in non-acute settings. We explored the benefits and challenges of using an Interprofessional Team - Objective Structured Clinical Examination (IT-OSCE) as a formative assessment tool. IT-OSCE is an intervention which involves an interprofessional team of trainees interacting with a simulated patient (SP) enabling them to practice collaborative skills in non-acute care settings. 5 A simulated patient are people trained to portray patients in a simulated scenario for educational purposes. 6, 7 Since interprofessional education (IPE) ultimately aims to provide collaborative patient-centered care. 8, 9 We sought to promote patient-centeredness in the learning process. Methods: The IT-OSCE was conducted with four trios of students from different professions. The debriefing was co-facilitated by the SP with a faculty. The participants were final-year students in nursing, physiotherapy and medicine. Our research question focused on the introduction of co-facilitated (SP and faculty) debriefing after an IT-OSCE: 1) What are the benefits and challenges of involving the SP during the debriefing? and 2) To evaluate the IT-OSCE, an exploratory case study was used to provide fine grained data 10, 11. Three focus groups were conducted - two with students (n= 6; n= 5), one with SPs (n= 3) and one with faculty (n= 4). Audiotapes were transcribed for thematic analysis performed by three researchers, who found a consensus on the final set of themes. Results: The thematic analysis showed little differentiation between SPs, student and faculty perspectives. The analysis of transcripts revealed more particularly, that the SP's co-facilitation during the debriefing of an IT-OSCE proved to be feasible. It was appreciated by all the participants and appeared to value and to promote patient-centeredness in the learning process. The main challenge consisted in SPs feedback, more particularly in how they could report accurate observations to a students' group rather than individual students. Conclusion: In conclusion, SP methodology using an IT-OSCE seems to be a useful and promising way to train collaborative skills, aligning IPE, simulation-based team training in a non-acute care setting and patient-centeredness. We acknowledge the limitations of the study, especially the small sample and consider the exploration of SP-based IPE in non-acute care settings as strength. Future studies could consider the preparation of SPs and faculty as co-facilitators. References: 1. Borrill CS, Carletta J, Carter AJ, et al.

40|$|Inter-molecular {{interaction}} {{is at the}} heart of biological function. Proteins can interact with ligands, peptides, small molecules, and other proteins to serve their structural or functional purpose. With advances in combinatorial chemistry and the development of high throughput binding assays, the available inter-molecular interaction data is increasing exponentially. As the space of testable compounds increases, the complexity and cost of finding a suitable inhibitor for a protein interaction increases. Computational drug discovery plays an important role in minimizing the time and cost needed to study the space of testable compounds. This work focuses on the usage of various computational methods in identifying protein interaction inhibitors and demonstrates the ability of computational drug discovery to contribute to the ever growing field of molecular interaction. A program to predict the location of binding surfaces on proteins, STP (Mehio et al., Bioinformatics, 2010, in press), has been created based on calculating the propensity of triplet-patterns of surface protein atoms that occur in binding sites. The use of STP in predicting ligand binding sites, allosteric binding sites, enzyme classification numbers, and binding details in multi-unit complexes is demonstrated. STP has been integrated into the in-house high throughput drug discovery pipeline, allowing the identification of inhibitors for proteins whose binding sites are unknown. Another computational paradigm is introduced, creating a virtual library of -turn peptidomimetics, designed to mimic the interaction of the Baff-Receptor (Baff-R) with the B-Lymphocyte Stimulator (Blys). LIDAEUS (Taylor, et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2008; 153, p. S 55 -S 67) is used to identify chemical groups with favorable binding to Blys. Natural and non-natural sidechains are then used to create a library of synthesizable cyclic hexapeptides that would mimic the Blys:Baff-R interaction. Finally, this work demonstrates the usage and synergy of various in-house computational resources in drug discovery. The ProPep database is a repository used to study trends, motifs, residue pairing frequencies, and aminoacid enrichment propensities in protein-peptide interaction. The LHRLL protein-peptide interaction motif is identified and used with UFSRAT (<b>S.</b> <b>Shave,</b> PhD Thesis, University of Edinburgh, 2010) to conduct ligand-based virtual screening and generate a list of possible antagonists from the EDULISS (K. Hsin, PhD Thesis, University of Edinburgh, 2010) compound repository. A high throughput version of AutoDock (Morris, et al., J Comput Chem, 1998; 19, p. 1639 - 62) was adapted and used for precision virtual screening of these molecules, resulting in a list of compounds that are likely to inhibit the binding of this motif to several Nuclear Receptors...|$|R

40|$|Historians {{have long}} been fascinated with the {{institution}} and institutionalisation of workhouses established after of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. Since the initial work of the Webbs, research has addressed conditions inside these institutions (e. g. Crowther, 1981) and has also been inspired by Foucault’s approach in Discipline and Punish (e. g. Driver, 1993). Whilst recent research has attempted to examine {{the experiences of the}} vulnerable in the post- 1834 workhouse (Shave 2006), nothing has hitherto been published about the welfare setting of the Gilbert’s Union established under Gilbert’s Act of 1782 (22 Geo. 3. c. 83). This Act empowered parishes to group together and provide accommodation for most vulnerable members in the community, the non-able-bodied, including children and the elderly. According to Marshall, the intention of the policy was to offer the defenceless poor separate accommodation away from the ‘dens of horror’ - the parish workhouses (1926 : 159 - 160). Yet regardless of the renewed attention into the experience of the poor in the seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries (e. g. King, 2000; Hindle, 2004), the Gilbert’s Union has been overlooked. In part this is because welfare historians have correctly labelled Gilbert’s Act as ‘enabling’ (i. e. ‘non-compulsory’) and have thus claimed that as few parishes decided adopt the provisions of the act it was relatively insignificant. However, at least 102 Gilbert’s Unions were formed – with significant concentrations in the east Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east. This Act, therefore, dramatically transformed the welfare experiences of a great number of people. * This paper explores the impact of Gilbert’s Unions on individuals’ experiences of welfare both upon formation and subsequently throughout their life-courses. Through the focus of unions established in the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and Wiltshire, it explores changing policies from both formal policy documents (e. g. vestry and union minute books, workhouse and overseers accounts) as well as paupers’ negotiations detailed in the minutes of evidence of the 1844 - 5 Parliamentary Select Committee investigation into the poor laws. Such an approach not only provides an understanding of how poor law policies were lived-out and experienced but will help us better comprehend how policy discourses of care and well-being were translated into practice in ways which ran counter to the initial impulse. Put simply, did Gilbert’s Unions care for the vulnerable – as was Thomas Gilbert’s intention – or did they further harm their vulnerable charges? References M. A.

In 1979, a vertical slot fish passage facility was constructed {{on the west side}} of Fairmount Dam, however, very few anadromous species were utilizing the passage and the fishway was abandoned in 1984. No fish counts were conducted from 1984 to 2004, until Philadelphia Water Department biologists took responsibility for maintenance and operation of the fishway and developed a digital video monitoring system to record fish passage. An underwater viewing room and window allows direct observation of fishes swimming through the fishway and is a primary means for evaluating fish passage. In 2004, there were 6, 438 fish of 23 species that ascended Fairmount fishway, including 91 American shad, 161 striped bass, and 2 river herring. A total of 8, 017 fishes representing 25 species were counted passing through the fishway in 2005, including 41 American shad, 127 striped bass, and 5 river herring. In 2006, a total of 16, 850 fishes representing 26 species were counted passing through the fishway including 345 American shad, 9 hickory shad, 61 striped bass, and 7 river herring, marking an astonishing 279...|$|R
40|$|The {{historic}} and present ranges of anadromous alosids and striped bass were determined {{for three of}} Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> rivers. American <b>shad,</b> blueback herring, and alewives migrated to at least Remington (river mile 188) on the Rappahannock River. They ascended {{the entire length of}} the York River, reaching at least Milford on the Mattaponi and {{the entire length of the}} Pamunkey. The alosids traversed the full length of the James River, reaching above Clifton Forge and Covington. Although striped bass were historically caught in the James as far upstream as Balcony Falls (near Glasgow) and probably as far upstream as shad on the other rivers, it is doubtful that they ever spawned above the fall line on any river. Present ranges for all species are Fredericksburg (Embrey Dam) on the Rappahannock, unchanged on the York, and Richmond (Bosher Dam) on the James. One dam on the Rappahannock River and twelve dams on the James River were identified as actual or potential barriers to the upstream spawning migrations of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s anadromous fishes. Elimination of these barriers by breaching, in the case of unused facilities, or by these construction of fish passage facilities would result in the restoration of 47 miles of mainstem river (a 30...|$|R
