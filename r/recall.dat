At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his <b>recall</b> flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the <b>recall.</b>|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} challenges the widespread truism that <b>recalling</b> a positive self necessarily increases self-esteem, whereas <b>recalling</b> a negative self necessarily decreases self-esteem. Four experiments demonstrate that chronically happy people show a relative increase in self-esteem by <b>recalling</b> either a positive or a negative self. Chronically sad people, however, show a relative decrease in self-esteem by <b>recalling</b> either a positive or a negative self. These effects {{are due to}} divergent perceptions of mood congruence between the <b>recalled</b> self and the current self. Specifically, happy people perceive high mood congruence between a <b>recalled</b> positive self and the current self but low mood congruence between a <b>recalled</b> negative self and the current self. In contrast, sad people perceive high mood congruence between a <b>recalled</b> negative self and the current self but low mood congruence between a <b>recalled</b> positive self and the current self. Independent of chronic mood, mood congruence leads to perceptions of temporal recency, whereas mood incongruence leads to perceptions of temporal distance. In line with the inclusion-exclusion model of social judgment, perceived temporal recency elicits assimilation effects on self-esteem, whereas perceived temporal distance elicits contrast effects on self-esteem...|$|R
