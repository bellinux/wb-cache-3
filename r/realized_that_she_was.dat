25|$|After losing at WrestleMania XX, Kane fell in {{love with}} Lita, but was spurned. This led to him {{kidnapping}} Lita in May and asking her an unknown question, to which she replied in the affirmative later that month. On the same night, Kane won a 20-Man battle royal for a World Heavyweight Championship match against Chris Benoit at Bad Blood. Six days before Bad Blood in a tag team match between Kane and La Resistance against Edge and Benoit, Kane beat Benoit after muscling out of the Crippler Crossface and giving him a huge Chokeslam. Lita later announced that she was pregnant, with Matt Hardy her then-boyfriend both on- and off-screen, assuming that he was the child's father. On the June 21 episode of Raw, Kane claimed that he was the dad. The next week, he explained that he had impregnated Lita in order to continue his legacy and justified a vicious attack on Shawn Michaels several weeks earlier by claiming that Michaels had stood in the way of him winning the World Heavyweight Championship. In order to appease Kane, General Manager Eric Bischoff gave Kane a rematch with Benoit, instructing Benoit that he could only win by submission, whereas Kane could win the title by any means.

Milian was four years old when she showed an interest in show business, and when her family <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a talented actress, she became determined to pursue an entertainment career. As a child, Milian was [...] "very imaginative and very creative", and watching television and listening to the radio became her life. They inspired her to have fun, and she convinced her parents that she [...] "did not want to be inside the TV", although it took some time to convince them. By the time she was nine years old, Milian had begun auditioning with local talent agencies, shot commercials for Wendy's and Honeycomb, and played the lead role in the musical Annie.

He goes to his mother, town doctor Jill Brock (Kathy Baker) and tells her that Kimberly is a [...] "lesbo". A patient overhears and word of the kissing spreads through the town. Kimberly's father, Sheriff Jimmy Brock (Tom Skerritt) and stepmother Jill react poorly to the idea that their daughter might be a lesbian, debating [...] "nature vs. nurture" [...] and [...] "elective lesbianism" [...] and even renting [...] "hunk films" [...] starring Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner. Kimberly turns to her birth mother, Lydia (Cristine Rose), who had had a lesbian relationship in college.

[...] Reaser explained {{that when she was}} cast, there were no definite plans for the development of her character, and that only the intrigue of the ferry accident had been explained to her. She also deemed her character [...] "frustrated and scared". As for the make up process, Reaser stated: [...] "The prosthetic changes your outlook on yourself. It can be very disorienting. It's intense." [...] Beers, however, noted that the focus on Ava was mainly due to her inability to express her feelings through facial expressions, only communicating with her eyes and voice. Executive producer Rob Corn stated that his plan for the original arc was about Jane Doe's inner life, struggling {{to get out of the}} situation she is trapped in. He stated that the main characteristics they had been looking for in the actress for the part were strength and vulnerability. He also called Reaser's performance [...] "heart-wrenching and wonderful". Betsy Beers, the show's supervising executive producer, found Izzie to have been marked for life by Denny's death, which matured her [...] "in a very sobering way", but played a major role in making her feel more confident. She also noted the undeniable connection between Izzie and Alex Karev, whose desire to do honorable things has been compared with his [...] "cutting and sarcastic" [...] personality. After Izzie's continuous efforts to change Alex during their relationship in the previous season, Beers announced the possibility of a relationship between the two of them. She also contrasted the female leads on the show with women in film, explaining how the characters on television are shaped in unique ways.|$|E
