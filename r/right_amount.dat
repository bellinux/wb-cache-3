5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{participated in}} the May 15 GOP debate, where he {{discussed}} his insistence to trim bureaucracy in the federal government, and {{his support for the}} advancements made in stem cell research, lauding the achievements of the his alma mater University of Wisconsin–Madison in the field. He was asked what he would do {{in the event of a}} looming preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti-American nation promoting terrorism. The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month.|$|E
5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E

There have been no timetabled weekday services at the station since October 1993, when they were withdrawn by British Rail.|$|R
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with just the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

25|$|Some {{doctors say}} an {{advantage}} to stereotactic treatments is that they deliver the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit {{the effect of the}} radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.|$|E
25|$|The double-dome mask. This {{was invented}} by HydroOptix. Double-dome masks allow a wider field of view and avoid the {{refraction}} error in perceived distance and size of objects. Underwater the curved mask windows make the diver's vision effectively more hyperopic, or less myopic, and the diver must wear special contact lenses to compensate (unless his eyes are myopic to the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> to compensate exactly for the refraction at the curved mask windows). The diver's vision will become myopic when he puts {{his head out of}} water with the contact lenses in.|$|E

50|$|A {{controlled}} {{ground water}} area (CGWA) is a category {{defined by the}} Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) {{of the state of}} Montana. A CGWA must satisfy a set of criteria, including ground water withdrawals in excess of recharge; excessive declines in ground water levels or pressures; possibility of contaminant migration; or the existence of significant disputes within the area concerning priority of <b>rights,</b> <b>amounts</b> of water being used, or priority of type of use.|$|R
50|$|Infection {{may also}} occur {{directly}} into the stem. This is particularly common at or below soil level where the <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> of moisture {{are more likely to}} persist. Once in the stem, Phoma clematidina destroys the internal tissues causing a distinctive, localised black discolouration. Such stem infections can be hugely destructive as they block the plant's vascular system and will lead to the wilting and death of all plant mass above the site of entry, no matter how substantial.|$|R
25|$|A {{successful}} ramming {{was difficult}} to achieve; just the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of speed and precise maneuvering were required. Fleets {{that did not have}} well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more on boarding with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow towards the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A double-line formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, {{the phase}} lines are {{relatively}} easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See Gibbs' phase rule. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of water and applying heat, the system {{can be brought to}} any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.|$|E
25|$|While {{it is not}} {{normally}} legal to keep these chameleons, {{it is possible to}} obtain special permission from the South African government to do so. These chameleons are better admired than handled. However, taming is possible through gentle and consistent (almost daily) contact, allowing trust to build up. This is typically achieved through careful and slow hand-based feeding of flies, small spiders, grasshoppers, etc. In cold weather, a sensitively handled B. pumilum commonly becomes eager to perch on a human hand for the warmth. To maintain them out of their natural environment requires advanced skills and is a demanding project; they require the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> and type of ultraviolet exposure and large supplies of specific types of live food that are not easy to supply. They also require moisture, even just tap water sprayed gently onto the foliage with a hose.|$|E
5000|$|Extinguishment {{of rights}} can occur only through {{an act that}} showed [...] "clear and plain intention" [...] on the {{government}} to deny those rights. Here, the Court found that the Crown {{was not able to}} prove that the right to fish for food were extinguished prior to 1982. The licensing scheme was merely a means of regulating the fisheries, not removing the underlying right, and no historical government policy towards fishing <b>rights</b> <b>amounted</b> to a clear intention to extinguish.|$|R
50|$|Summer {{is often}} {{characterized}} by hot daily temperatures and warm nights. Summer months remain dry with trace amounts of rainfall. Occasionally, {{moisture from the}} Caspian Sea files through the Alborz mountains; the updraft of warm and moist air up the high mountain sides produces partly cloudy skies dominated by cumulus clouds. With the <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> of heat and moisture, thunderstorms may develop during the afternoon and evening hours. Though the amount of precipitation is light, these thunderstorms often produce strong and gusty winds with frequent lightning strikes.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter {{describes}} the movie as [...] "a fiendishly entertaining Christmas yarn rooted in Northern European legend and lore, {{complete with a}} not-so-jolly old St. Nick informed more by the Brothers Grimm than Norman Rockwell. While the richly atmospheric package has been wrapped with {{a healthy dose of}} wry satire, it's not of the mean-spirited Bad Santa variety. Helander, a successful commercial director in his native Helsinki, shrewdly blends just the <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> of fairy tale wonder and action movie heroics into the oddball mix to highly satisfying effect." ...|$|R
25|$|The combatants {{were very}} close together, but never close enough for grappling, {{probably}} because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in the <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of powder, then putting in the shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant {{the difference between life}} and death. Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.|$|E

50|$|Combustible {{cryogenic}} fuels {{offer much}} more utility than most inert fuels can. Liquefied natural gas, {{as with any}} fuel, will only combust when properly mixed with <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> of air. As for LNG, the bulk majority of efficiency depends on the methane number, which is the gas equivalent of the octane number. This is determined based on the methane content of the liquefied fuel and any other dissolved gas, and varies {{as a result of}} experimental efficiencies. Maximizing efficiency in combustion engines will be a result of determining the proper fuel to air ratio and utilizing the addition other hydrocarbons for added optimal combustion.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the Q-ball decay in the gauge-mediated SUSY breaking. Q balls decay mainly into nucleons, and partially into gravitinos, {{while they are}} kinematically forbidden to decay into sparticles which would be cosmologically harmful. This is achieved by the Q-ball charge small enough to be unstable for the decay, and {{large enough to be}} protected kinematically from unwanted decay channel.
