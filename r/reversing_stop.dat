40|$|The coreceptor {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA- 4) is pivotal {{in regulating}} {{the threshold of}} signals during T cell activation, although the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Using in vitro migration assays and in vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy, we showed that CTLA- 4 increases T cell motility and overrides the T cell receptor (TCR) -induced stop signal required for stable conjugate formation between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. This event led to reduced contact periods between T cells and antigen-presenting cells that in turn decreased cytokine production and proliferation. These results suggest a fundamentally different model of <b>reverse</b> <b>stop</b> signaling, by which CTLA- 4 modulates the threshold for T cell activation and protects against autoimmunity...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{classification}} scheme {{of the genetic}} code, based on a binary representation of purines (A, G = 1) and pyrimidines (U, C = 0). On {{the basis of this}} logical organization we detect codon regularities (strong, mixed and weak codons), patterns of amino acid properties and show symmetry characteristics of the genetic code. We demonstrate the “codon- reverse codon ” pattern and use it to remove the only ambiguity which had remained in our recently proposed new classification scheme of the genetic code. The purine-pyrimidine scheme has now found its final form. We show that the “codon- reverse codon ” pattern is correlated to aspects of the tRNA anticodon distribution in all organisms. It is well known that there is no tRNA with an anticodon for any of the STOP codons; we found that there is also no tRNA containing <b>reverse</b> <b>STOP</b> anticodons. Finally, we show that the new classification scheme also provides hints about the early evolution of the genetic code...|$|R

40|$|For {{at least}} thirty years we have heard {{complaints}} about suburban “sprawl” from some {{in the ranks of}} urban plan-ners, environmentalists, and public tran-sit advocates, among others. These obser-vers have urged government actions to <b>reverse,</b> <b>stop,</b> or at least slow suburban growth. Much of their literature and rhetoric has been provocative; the very use of the term “sprawl ” casts the idea of growing suburbs in an unfavorable light. (The non-pejorative term “suburbaniza-tion ” is used in this discussion.) Academic economists have weighed in on issues relating to suburbanization. Their most important contributions have been in the areas of metropolitan location and spatial analysis, local government tax and expenditure analysis, and the analy-sis of interactions between metropolitan transportation and spatial issues. Yet, remarkably, academic economists have written almost nothing on the general government policy issue of allegedly excessive metropolitan suburbanization. 1 This article presents the case for subur-banization from an academic redoubt. The fact that much of the literature opposing suburbanization is written with-in the Washington beltway is suggestive, but does not make the claims either cor-rect or incorrect.

40|$|Upon {{engagement}} of their cognate class I {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) ligands, receptors containing immunotyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) transduce signals that block cytolytic and inflammatory responses. In this manner, ITIM-coupled receptors {{play a crucial role}} in maintaining natural killer (NK) cell tolerance toward normal, healthy tissue. A number of studies, mostly using immortalized NK cell lines, have demonstrated that ITIM signaling functions by disrupting the cytolytic immunological synapse formed between an NK cell and its target. However, more recent imaging experiments using primary NK cells have suggested that inhibitory receptor engagement does not antagonize contact formation, casting doubt on the hypothesis that ITIM signals destabilize the synapse. To resolve this issue, we analyzed primary NK cell activation and contact formation on supported lipid bilayers containing controlled combinations of activating and inhibitory ligands. Under these conditions, we observed that ITIM signaling clearly inhibited adhesion, cell arrest, and calcium influx, three hallmarks of synapse formation. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that inhibitory receptors deliver a <b>reverse</b> <b>stop</b> signal, and confirm that ITIM signaling functions at least in part by destabilizing cytolytic synapse formation...|$|R

5000|$|... iCLIP (individual nucleotide-resolution {{cross-linking}} and immunoprecipitation) is {{a technique}} used for identifying protein-RNA interactions. The method uses UV light to covalently bind proteins and RNA molecules. As with all CLIP methods, iCLIP allows for the stringent purification of linked protein-RNA complexes, using immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and membrane transfer. The radiolabelled protein-RNA complexes are then excised from the membrane, and treated with proteinase to release the RNA. This leaves one or two amino acids at the RNA cross-link site. The RNA is then reverse transcribed using barcoded primers. Because <b>reverse</b> transcription <b>stops</b> prematurely at the cross-link site, iCLIP allows RNA-protein interaction sites to be identified at high resolution.

40|$|In the {{southern}} Pyrenees, human population and therefore land uses have changed from forests to pastures, then crops, {{and back to}} pastures and secondary forests {{during the last two}} centuries. To understand what such rapid land use changes have meant for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, we used data from two forest sites in the western Pyrenees, combined with regional data on pastures and crop production (potato, cereal), to calibrate the ecosystem-level model FORECAST. Then, we simulated 150 -year of land use for each site, emulating historical changes. Our estimates show that the conversion from forests into pastures and crops created C and N deficits (378 - 427 Mg C ha- 1, 4. 0 - 4. 6 Mg N ha- 1) from which these sites are still recovering. The main ecological process behind the creation of these deficits was the loss of the ecological legacy of soil organic matter (SOM) created by the forest, particularly during conversion to farming. Pastures were able to <b>reverse,</b> <b>stop</b> or at least slow down the loss of such legacy. In conclusion, our work shows the deep impact of historical land use in ecosystem attributes, both in magnitude of removed C and N stocks and in duration of such impact. Also, the usefulness of ecological modelling in absence of historical data to estimate such changes is showcased, providing a framework for potential C and N stocks to be reached by climate change mitigation measures such as forest restoration.
