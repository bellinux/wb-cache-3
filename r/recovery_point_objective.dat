5000|$|Organizations cannot always avoid disasters, {{but with}} careful {{planning}} {{the effects of}} a disaster can be minimized. The objective of a disaster recovery plan is to minimize downtime and data loss. The primary objective is to protect the organization in the event that all or part of its operations and/or computer services are rendered unusable. The plan minimizes the disruption of operations and ensures that some level of organizational stability and an orderly recovery after a disaster will prevail. [...] Minimizing downtime and data loss is measured in terms of two concepts: the recovery time objective (RTO) and the <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objective</b> (RPO). The recovery time objective is the time within which a business process must be restored, after a major incident (MI) has occurred, in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity. The <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objective</b> (RPO) is the age of files that must be recovered from backup storage for normal operations to resume if a computer, system, or network goes down {{as a result of a}} MI. The RPO is expressed backwards in time (that is, into the past) starting from the instant at which the MI occurs, and can be specified in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. The <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objective</b> (RPO) is thus the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. It is the age of the files or data in backup storage required to resume normal operations after the MI.|$|E
5000|$|An often-overlooked {{aspect of}} {{synchronous}} replication {{is the fact}} that failure of remote replica, or even just the interconnection, stops by definition any and all writes (freezing the local storage system). This is the behaviour that guarantees zero data loss. However, many commercial systems at such potentially dangerous point do not freeze, but just proceed with local writes, losing the desired zero <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objective.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In a {{good deal}} of the {{literature}} on this subject, RTO is spoken of as a complement of <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objective</b> (RPO), with the two metrics describing the limits of acceptable or [...] "tolerable" [...] ITSC performance in terms of time lost (RTO) from normal business process functioning, and in terms of data lost or not backed up during that period of time (RPO) respectively.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} {{concern for}} Internet-based service providers is the continued operation {{and availability of}} services {{in the face of}} outages, whether planned or unplanned. In this paper we advocate a cooperative, context-aware approach to data center migration across WANs to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner. We specifically seek to achieve high availability of data center services in the face of both planned and incidental outages of data center facilities. We make use of server virtualization technologies to enable the replication and migration of server functions. We propose new network functions to enable server migration and replication across wide area networks (i. e., the Internet), and finally show the utility of intelligent and dynamic storage replication technology to ensure applications have access to data in the face of outages with very tight <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objectives.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Data {{corruption}} {{is one of}} the key problems that is on top of the radar screen of most CIOs. Continuous Data Protection (CDP) technologies help enterprises deal with data corruption by maintaining multiple versions of data and facilitating recovery by allowing an administrator restore to an earlier clean version of data. The aim of the recovery process after data {{corruption is}} to quickly traverse through the backup copies (old versions), and retrieve a clean copy of data. Currently, data recovery is an ad-hoc, time consuming and frustrating process with sequential brute force approaches, where recovery time is proportional to the number of backup copies examined and the time to check a backup copy for data corruption. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of SWEEPER architecture and backup copy selection algorithms that specifically tackle the problem of quickly and systematically identifying a good <b>recovery</b> <b>point.</b> We monitor various system events and generate checkpoint records that help in quickly identifying a clean backup copy. The SWEEPER methodology dynamically determines the selection algorithm based on user specified recovery time and <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objectives,</b> and thus, allows system administrators to perform trade-offs between recovery time and data currentness. We have implemented our solution as part of a popular Storage Resource Manager product and evaluated SWEEPER under many diverse settings. Our study clearly establishes the effectiveness of SWEEPER as a robust strategy to significantly reduce recovery time. ...|$|R
40|$|Part 2 : Cloud ComputingInternational audienceVirtual {{machines}} (VMs) {{in a cloud}} use standardized ‘golden master’ images, {{standard software}} catalog and management tools. This facilitates quick provisioning of VMs and helps {{reduce the cost of}} managing the cloud by reducing the need for specialized software skills. However, knowledge of this similarity is lost post-provisioning, as VMs could experience different changes and may drift away from one another. In this work, we propose the 12 MAP system, which maintains a mapping between each instance and the golden master image from which it was created, consisting of a record of all changes to the instance since provisioning. We motivate that this mapping can aid several cloud management activities such as disaster recovery, system administration, and troubleshooting. We build a host-based disaster recovery solution based on 12 MAP, which is ideally suited for low cost cloud VMs that {{do not have access to}} dedicated block-based storage recovery solutions. Our solution deduplicates changes across VMs and needs to replicate only the unique changes, significantly reducing replication traffic on end hosts. We demonstrate that 12 MAP is able to deliver on tight recovery time and <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objectives</b> of the order of minutes with low overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art host-based recovery solutions, 12 MAP is able to save 50 - 87 % network bandwidth on the primary data center...|$|R
5000|$|The term {{recovery}} consistency objective (RCO) is used {{in business}} continuity planning in addition to <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objective</b> (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO).

50|$|Prior to {{selecting}} a realtime recovery strategy or a Real-Time Recovery (RTR) solution, a disaster recovery planner should refer to their organization's {{business continuity plan}} which should indicate the key metrics of <b>recovery</b> <b>point</b> <b>objective</b> (RPO) and recovery time objective Recovery time objective for various business processes (such as the process to run payroll, generate an order, e-mail, etc.).

An important note here however is that the business ultimately sets the IT budget and therefore the RTO and RPO metrics need to fit with the available budget. While most business unit heads would like zero data loss and zero time loss, the cost associated with that level of protection historically have made high availability solutions impractical and unaffordable. The benefit of implementing a Real-Time Recovery solution is that the investment is substantially reduced from traditional tape based backup products.|$|E
