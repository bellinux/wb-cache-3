5|$|In United States federal courts, {{a circuit}} split occurs when {{two or more}} {{different}} circuit courts of appeals provide conflicting rulings on the same legal issue. The existence of a circuit split {{is one of the}} factors that the Supreme Court of the United States considers when deciding whether to grant <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> case. Some scholars suggest that the Supreme Court is more likely to grant <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> case to resolve a circuit split than for any other reason.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

25|$|Because Agaricus subrufescens {{contains}} {{a high level}} of beta glucans, compounds known for stimulating the immune system, the fungus is used in oncological therapy in Japan and Brazil. In addition to beta glucans, the mushroom's effect on the immune system is believed to be due to other polysaccharides, such as alpha glucans. In Japan, Agaricus subrufescens is sold under the brand names KingAgaricus 100, Sen-Sei-Ro Gold, and ABMK, and is used by an estimated 500,000 people In Japan, Agaricus subrufescens is also the most popular complementary and alternative medicine used by cancer patients. Although Agaricus subrufescens is cultivated in the United States, the largest exporters are China and Brazil. As noted in a scientific <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> subrufescens research, the range of quality in A. subrufescens cultivation can affect the mushroom's ability to impact cells of the immune system.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{in several}} cases, the Court found the alleged error too insubstantial to {{consider}} via original habeas. In Ex parte Parks (1876), the Court held {{that it had}} no original habeas jurisdiction to free a defendant convicted in a United States district court, even though no appeal was possible from the district court to the circuit court, and even though the petitioner alleged that the district court had been entirely without jurisdiction to try the offense charged. Similarly, in Ex parte Rowland (1881), the Court held {{that it had no}} original habeas jurisdiction to examine a contempt of court conviction arising from the disregard of a writ of mandamus. And, in Ex parte Bigelow (1885), the Court held that there could be no <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double jeopardy determination of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. In Ex parte Harding (1887), the Court held that the composition of a grand jury (i.e. whether an alien sat) could not be so reviewed.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among these}} is the Ninth Circuit's unique rules {{concerning}} the composition of an en banc court. In other circuits, en banc courts are composed of all active circuit judges, plus (depending on {{the rules of the}} particular court) any senior judges {{who took part in the}} original panel decision. By contrast, in the Ninth Circuit it is impractical for 29 or more judges to take part in a single oral argument and deliberate on a decision en masse. The court thus provides for a “limited en banc <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> randomly selected 11 judge panel. This means that en banc reviews may not actually reflect the views of the majority of the court and indeed may not include any of the three judges involved in the decision being reviewed in the first place. The result, according to detractors, is a high risk of intracircuit conflicts of law where different groupings of judges end up delivering contradictory opinions. That is said to cause uncertainty in the district courts and within the bar. However, en banc review is a relatively rare occurrence in all circuits and Ninth Circuit rules provide for full en banc review in limited circumstances.|$|E
