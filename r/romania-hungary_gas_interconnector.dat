50|$|Munitions have {{subsequently}} {{been washed}} up on beaches in the area. In particular, in 1995, incendiary devices were discovered on the Scottish and Northern Irish coasts. This coincided with the laying of the Scotland-Northern Ireland pipeline (SNIP), a 24-inch <b>gas</b> <b>interconnector</b> being constructed by British Gas.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the very real}} problem of congestion at <b>gas</b> <b>interconnectors.</b> Instead of suggesting further incremental change to the European regulation in force to remedy congestion problems, we {{took a step back}} and consider <b>gas</b> <b>interconnectors</b> as a Common-Pool Resource (CPR). We suggest {{to wait and see what}} institutions the shippers let emerge to govern and manage interconnector capacity. To explore this idea, we developed a model to simulate the possible emergence of institutions that would coordinate the shippers and help overcome congestion. We simulate 40 shippers at the Dutch and Belgian interconnectors and allow them to autonomously book capacity. Agents can learn over time to improve their behaviour and coordinate with each other to collectively define a new institution in the system. The main simulator indicators are the observed booking behaviour, agent profits and emerging institutions. We present and discuss preliminary results from a set of simulation runs...|$|R

On 3 March 2009, Plinacro {{signed an agreement}} with FGSZ Zrt, a subsidiary of MOL Group, to build a 294 km [...] natural <b>gas</b> <b>interconnector</b> between Croatia and Hungary, which would allow two-way shipments after the Adria LNG terminal is built on the island of Krk. Plinacro is also invited to the consortium building Adria LNG terminal.|$|R
2500|$|Borisov's {{policies}} were mostly aimed at curbing {{corruption in the}} public administration and building an adequate infrastructure. One of the main goals in this direction was {{the expansion of the}} national motorway network, of which Lyulin was the first motorway to be completed. The government has also approved a strategy {{for the development of the}} energy sector until 2020, which includes the completion of <b>gas</b> <b>interconnectors</b> with Greece, Romania, and Turkey and expanding renewable energy capacities. The Borisov government stopped the Belene Nuclear Power Plant project after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. [...] The acquisition of European funds has also increased from 2.6% to 20%.|$|R
40|$|Auctions {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} {{prominent role in}} the planning and operation of energy markets. Comparing the New Electricity Trading Arrangements to the former electricity Pool in England and Wales requires some analysis of {{the relative merits of}} uniform versus discriminatory pricing rules, and use of the gas network in Britain and electricity interconnectors around Europe is allocated on the basis of auction results. In this paper we discuss the changes in the trading arrangements in the electricity industry in England and Wales {{as well as some of}} the results to date. We also look at the wider issue of using auctions to replace regulation by market solutions for managing the natural monopolies in energy markets. auctions, electricity, <b>gas,</b> <b>interconnectors,</b> networks...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of sealing glasses {{is one of}} the crit. issues concerning the long-term operation of SOFC. Different reasons are responsible for failures of the glass sealings resulting from thermal cycling, stack deformation or chem. degrdn. due to interactions with fuel <b>gas,</b> <b>interconnectors</b> or protective coatings. Different reactions with an interconnector material (Crofer 22) under oxidizing and reducing conditions lead to cryst. product layers, which affect the bonding strength and microstructure of the sealing material at the interfaces. Effects of externally applied elec. voltage on the sealing glass provide insights into mechanisms of reactions at anodically and cathodically polarized interfaces of the interconnector material. Tests of model sealings under elec. voltage in combination with a dual atm. reveal addnl. information about the {{stability of}} sealing glasses...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} current {{diversification}} scenarios {{in the field}} of gas supply the Visegrad Group (V 4) and the Russian Federation relying on the model of asymmetrical interdependence. Russian Federation, the main supplier of natural gas to this region, has lost its status of a reliable partner due to the gas wars with Ukraine in 2006 and 2009, which have negatively affected the supply of natural gas to the EU countries. The research focuses on the current diversification options of V 4 countries related to their suppliers and supply routes with respect to their relationship with the Russian Federation; the diversification options for the purchasing markets of the Russian Federation are also analyzed. The author validates the hypothesis that energy relations among the Visegrad countries and the Russian Federation {{in the field of}} gas supply are largely controlled by the asymmetric interdependence that is currently exacerbating tensions among the set actors. Current diversification scenarios are presented and evaluated, with the aim of assessing the importance of the projects with regard to actors' energy security.

5000|$|The {{interests}} of third {{parties and the}} public are partially represented through provisions on access to infrastructure, tax, and decommissioning. Under the Petroleum Act 1998 sections 17-17H there is a right of companies that are not owners of pipelines or <b>gas</b> <b>interconnectors</b> to use the infrastructure if there is spare capacity. This is not well utilised, and it usually left to commercial negotiation. Under the Energy Act 2011 sections 82-83 the Secretary of State can require a pipeline owner gives access on its own motion, apparently to reduce the problem of companies being too timid to exercise legal rights for fear of commercial repercussions. Taxation on oil and gas outputs have increasingly been reduced. Initially the Oil Taxation Act 1975 section 1 required a special Petroleum Revenue Tax, set as high as 75% of profits in 1983, but this ended for new licences after 1993, and then reduced from 50% in 2010, down to 0% in 2016. Under the Corporation Tax Act 2010 sections 272-279A {{there is still a}} [...] "ring fenced corporation tax", on individual fields that are [...] "ring fenced" [...] from other activities, set at 30%, but just 19% for smaller fields. An additional [...] "supplementary charge" [...] of 10% of profits was introduced in 2002 to ensure a ‘fair return’ to the state, because ‘oil companies were generating excess profits’. Finally, under the Petroleum Act 1998 sections 29-45 require responsible decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure. Under section 29, the Secretary of State can require a written notice of a decommissioning plan, on which stakeholders (e.g. the local community) must be consulted. Under section 30, notice regarding abandonment can be served on anyone who owns or has an interest in an installation. There are fines and offences for failure to comply. Estimates for the cost of decommissioning the UK's offshore platforms have been £16.9bn in the next decade, and £75bn to £100bn in total. A series of objections have been raised against the government's policy of cutting taxes while subsidising BP, Shell and Exxon for these costs.|$|R
5|$|As with electricity, {{the natural}} gas {{distribution}} network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim completed in 2007. Most of Ireland's <b>gas</b> comes through <b>interconnectors</b> between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. A decreasing supply {{is coming from the}} Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast and the Corrib Gas Field off the coast of County Mayo has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.|$|R
50|$|It is a CCGT type {{power station}} {{that runs on}} natural gas. It has one 265MWe General Electric Frame 9 (9001FA+E) gas turbine with the exhaust gas heating a Doosan heat {{recovery}} steam generator, leading to a 150MWe General Electric steam turbine. It has a dedicated pipeline to connect to the <b>Interconnector</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline and the Bacton Gas Terminal a few miles to the north-west. At 420MW, it generates enough electricity for around 350,000 homes. It has a thermal efficiency of 57%. The terminal voltage of the plant is 19kV, which meets the distribution network of EDF Energy via a transformer at 132kV. The steam condenser uses about 9 tonnes of water a second from the River Yare.|$|R
40|$|As {{indigenous}} {{natural gas}} reserves within the European Union (EU) decline, higher gas imports are expected {{in order to}} meet future EU gas demand. Natural gas will be transported across considerable distances from regions of gas reserves to European consumers. This raises security of gas supply concerns especially for EU countries that depend heavily on a single supply source or major transit route. A linear programming model of the European gas supplies was developed and used to investigate the impact of loss of the Ukraine transit capacity on gas supply from Russia to Europe. Two demand scenarios – that is a reference case and a high demand case in the winter of 2014 / 2015 were investigated. The results have shown that <b>gas</b> flows on <b>interconnectors</b> and from storage and liquefied natural gas import terminals compensated for the supply shortfall. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of the supply shortage, the impact of increasing the capacities of selected pipelines within the EU was compared against increasing the maximum storage withdrawal rates in southeast Europe. Higher storage withdrawal rates achieved lower demand curtailment than the additional interconnector capacity in both scenarios...|$|R
