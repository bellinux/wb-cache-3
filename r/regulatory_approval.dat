5|$|United Airlines first {{placed the}} 767 in {{commercial}} service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes, during which it demonstrated {{the reliability of}} its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive <b>regulatory</b> <b>approval</b> for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop service on medium- to long-haul intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading {{to the development of}} the 777, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, the 767 {{spearheaded the}} growth of twinjet flights across the {{northern}} Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could {{be no more than}} 90 minutes away from diversion airports. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>approval</b> spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.|$|E

5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving <b>regulatory</b> <b>approval</b> for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
