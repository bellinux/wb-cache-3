50|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the project was to influence public opinion {{in the direction of a}} less restricted and more free <b>radio</b> <b>climate,</b> which led to 40,000 signatures in support of commercial advertisements on the newly started Radio P4.|$|E
50|$|Faced with a {{changing}} <b>radio</b> <b>climate</b> and fans who {{longed for the}} smoother sounds of Frosting On The Beater, the Posies found less success with Amazing Disgrace in the U.S. than with their previous album. The album fared better in Europe though, and led to it selling better worldwide than any of their previous efforts.|$|E
50|$|Richness, {{comfort and}} attention-to-detail are communicated {{throughout}} the vehicle's interior which features cream and brown-colored leather trim, woven cream leather inserts, satin metal details, and Zebrano wood accents. Both {{front and rear}} passenger compartments are separate and have their own <b>radio,</b> <b>climate</b> controls, luxurious seats, arm rests and center consoles. Speedometer and tachometer gauges are also featured in both compartments which allow rear passengers to monitor vehicle performance at a glance.|$|E
5000|$|The driver has {{full control}} of the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> controls.|$|R
25|$|The dashboard's design {{originated}} {{from a large}} number of complaints from customers that the previous Taurus' <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control modules were cluttered with many small and similar feeling buttons, as well as small graphics, which caused the driver to have to look away from the road to be able to operate them properly. As a result, {{a large portion of the}} third generation's dash was devoted to the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control, with each button on these modules containing a unique design, making it easier for the driver to operate the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control without taking their eyes off the road. This would eventually lead to the creation of the Integrated Control Panel.|$|R
25|$|Interiors {{received}} a redesign for the 1994 model year. New dual airbags moved some instrument panel gauges {{closer to the}} steering wheel, {{at the expense of}} the tachometer; <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> controls were also revised.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Bandyke {{was let go}} from WQKL in February 2009 due {{to budget}} cuts, but, in a {{surprising}} move given the current <b>radio</b> <b>climate,</b> was rehired {{a few weeks later}} due to an outcry from listeners (who even started a protest group on the social networking website Facebook) and advertisers. Bandyke returned to WQKL was March 2, 2009, and has remained in the morning slot ever since. (1) ...|$|E
5000|$|Blake Boldt with Engine 145 {{gave the}} song a [...] "thumbs down" [...] rating, saying that [...] "Shelton convinces as a liquored-up barfly who’s itching {{for his next}} conquest. In a <b>radio</b> <b>climate</b> that favors {{long-term}} love affairs, a song that even suggests a one-night stand is a slightly-bold move. That’s about the only risk taken on “Tonight,” which swings along on a standard modern-country production {{with a touch of}} twang. The nifty slide guitar line in the bridge is a neat twist, but the rest of “Tonight” is a forgettable template plugged into a filler tune." ...|$|E
5000|$|Features (as of 2009) {{include a}} {{navigation}} system with voice recognition, power sunroof, upgraded leather upholstery, rear-view camera, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, 26-speaker premium sound system, 8-disc CD changer, 18-way power front seats, 16-way power rear seats, heated and cooled cup holders, rear-seat tables, outside-temperature indicator, universal garage door opener, power tilt/telescopic heated wood and leather-wrapped steering wheel with <b>radio,</b> <b>climate,</b> and navigation controls, power open/close trunk lid, power closing doors, wireless headphones, iPod adapter, refrigerator, {{and air conditioning}} with 5-zone climate controls. There are extensive options available through the Rolls-Royce [...] "Bespoke" [...] programme through which the factory will create any reasonable option a customer asks for.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the UN <b>Radio</b> {{series on}} <b>Climate</b> Change was a finalist in the Association for International Broadcasting (AIB) Awards.|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned for the 1996 model year. Like {{that of the}} previous two generations, the {{interior was}} designed to be user-friendly. The dashboard wrapped slightly around the driver; all of the main controls were placed within easy reach, and were designed to be recognizable by touch and to be operated by drivers without taking their eyes off the road. The controls for the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control were combined into an oval-shaped [...] "Integrated Control Panel" [...] mounted {{in the center of the}} dash, which was created in response to many complaints from Taurus owners that they couldn't easily operate the main controls of the <b>radios</b> and <b>climate</b> control systems without taking their eyes off the road. Gone was wide and couch-like front row bench seating of previous generations.|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} saw {{a complete}} redesign. [...] To simplify production, all {{versions of the}} Taurus were fitted with bucket seats; six-passenger versions were fitted with a flip-forward center seat cushion also meant {{for use as a}} center console; five-passenger versions were fitted with a floor shifter and center console. [...] To improve ergonomics, <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> controls were centralized on an oval-shaped console on the dashboard.|$|R
5000|$|WQCD's on-air staff {{remained}} unusually {{stable in}} the generally volatile <b>radio</b> <b>climate,</b> led by morning host Dennis Quinn. Midday host Deborah Rath {{had been with}} parent company Emmis since 1988, as a veteran of both WRKS and WQHT's original incarnation [...] "Hot 103.5". Afternoon drive host Paul Cavalconte was a veteran of New York jazz, classical, and rock stations, including WQCD's generational predecessor WNEW-AM. Evening host Sharon Davis called WQCD home for nearly a decade. DJ Rafe Gomez hosted [...] "The Groove Boutique", a #1 PPM-rated groove jazz mix show that aired on Saturday nights beginning in 2003. WQCD was the flagship station for the show, which was syndicated.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 models {{received}} a revised grille and taillight trim and six-window styling on four-door models. The dashboard, <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control graphics were revised; the speedometer read up to , and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour. The Caprice convertible would be discontinued after the 1975 model year {{along with its}} full-size B-body counterparts including the Oldsmobile Delta 88, Buick LeSabre, and Pontiac Grand Ville. Just about 8,350 Caprice Classic convertibles found buyers in 1975.|$|R
50|$|Atwood {{initiated}} {{programs in}} Kokomo {{to turn back}} the foreign invasion of radios with improved products with new features and functions that made the radio more integrated with the vehicle controls (such as integration with steering wheel controls). In Milwaukee, he reinvigorated the commercial Carousel inertial navigation system by selling it to the military. Atwood also laid the groundwork for Delco Electronics' international operations - a move that kept Delco Electronics in the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control businesses.|$|R
50|$|BYD {{says the}} car {{will have a}} 60 mi all-electric range {{as well as a}} {{gasoline}} engine that allows operation in hybrid mode that extend the range for an additional 300 mi. The electric range assumes the car is traveling at a constant speed of 50 km/h, which is not likely to reflect real-world usage. The F3DM has a roof-mounted large solar panel capable of providing electric energy to run vehicle accessories such as the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control.|$|R
50|$|Initially (1988-89), the Reatta {{featured}} a touchscreen computer interface, marketed as the Electronic Control Center (ECC), that included <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control functions, date reminder, trip computer, user-configurable overspeed alarm {{as well as}} diagnostic access to the vehicle's electronic systems and sensors. Later models were equipped with conventional push button stereo and climate controls. The new system eliminated trip computer functionality and the climate control buttons could access diagnostic information, replacing diagnostic scanner capability formerly provided by the touchscreen.|$|R
50|$|The 1975 models {{received}} a revised grille and taillight trim and six-window styling on four-door models. The dashboard, <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control graphics were revised; the speedometer read up to 100 mi/h km/h, and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour. The Caprice convertible would be discontinued after the 1975 model year {{along with its}} full-size B-body counterparts including the Oldsmobile Delta 88, Buick LeSabre, and Pontiac Grand Ville. Just about 8,350 Caprice Classic convertibles found buyers in 1975.|$|R
50|$|As {{with its}} predecessors, the 1998 Lincoln Town Car visibly shares few common {{interior}} parts with its Ford and Mercury counterparts (aside from its steering column, <b>radio,</b> and <b>climate</b> controls). To improve ergonomics, power seat controls on Signature and Cartier models are relocated {{from the seat}} to door panel (Executive Series, in 1999). In a move to improve safety, seat-mounted side airbags become standard on all Town Cars for 1999. In the same year, the Executive Series regains its rear-seat center armrest (initially deleted in a cost-cutting move).|$|R
50|$|The Zephyr {{featured}} a revised interior from the Fusion and Milan. The design featured shapes with real ebony or maple wood inserts (depending on desired trim) in metallic frames. These surfaces were contrasted with chrome-bezeled gauges, circular, chrome-finished vents and a metallic center stack where the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> controls are housed. The Zephyr's steering wheel was leather-wrapped with real wood grips and satin-nickel audio, climate, and cruise control buttons. White LED backlighting {{was used for}} the Zephyr's controls and instrumentation. Leather seating surfaces were standard in all models.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{features}} include Bluetooth, Satellite <b>radio,</b> dual-zone <b>climate</b> control, auxiliary and USB jacks, a CD Player, six-speaker surround system, 16-inch allow wheels, automatic headlights, LED running lights, fog lights, heated mirrors, keyless ignition/entry, push-button start, cruise control, an eight-way power driver seat, tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, heated front seats, and Hyundai’s BlueLink emergency communications system. Additional options include touchscreen navigation, a rearview camera, panoramic sunroof, HD radio, Infinity audio system (nine speakers), 17-inch alloy wheels, leather seating surfaces, leather-wrapped {{steering wheel and}} shift knob, power driver seat with lumbar support, heated rear seat, auto-dimming rearview mirror.|$|R

50|$|DANTE Ltd. {{currently}} {{operates the}} third generation of the GÉANT backbone network that interconnects Europe's National Research and Education Networks (NRENs). Together GÉANT and the NRENs connect 40 million researchers and students across Europe, facilitating collaborative research in a diverse range of disciplines, including high-energy physics, <b>radio</b> astronomy, bio-medicine, <b>climate</b> change, earth observation, and arts and culture.|$|R
25|$|The 1989 Troféo, {{which was}} no longer badged {{externally}} as a Toronado, could be ordered with the Visual Information Center: a dash mounted touch-screen CRT that controlled the vehicle's thermostat and radio and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a trip computer. The following is a link to pictures of various CRT screens. The VIC could also serve as the interface to an in-car hands-free cell phone. Troféo also received standard anti-lock brakes and a new steering wheel that featured buttons for <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> controls. Toronados now had standard bucket seats with console, although the split-bench seat was still offered as an option.|$|R
50|$|The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice model {{carried a}} new front {{end with a}} swept back style header panel with {{recessed}} headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control graphics. Speedometers read up to 100 mph, and added kilometers per hour. 1975 officially debuted a high-energy (HEI) electronic ignition system. Catalytic converters were also introduced as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package, intermittent wipers, and a divided 50-50 bench seat (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim).|$|R
5000|$|For its 2003 redesign, the {{interior}} of the Lincoln Town Car saw extensive changes. In a move to further differentiate the Town Car from the Mercury Grand Marquis, the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> controls were integrated into a single unit with an analog clock; {{the interior}} was given a model-specific wood trim bordered by satin metal. The redesign included new seats, distinguished by taller head restraints. Alongside the Lincoln LS, the 2003 Town Car introduced a DVD-based satellite navigation system designed by Pioneer; it was later paired with THX sound processing. On all Town Cars except for Executive Series, ultrasonic park assist was standard, alongside a power-open/close trunk lid (this was known as [...] "Trunk at a Touch").|$|R
2500|$|After much {{research}} and development, the Aurora went into production on January 24, 1994, {{and was released}} for the 1995 model year. It hosted a number of luxury and technologically advanced standard features including dual-zone climate control, driver and front passenger airbags, leather seating surfaces, genuine burl walnut interior accents, six-speaker sound system with in-dash cd-cassette, and eight-way power adjustable front seats with two-position memory. [...] An onboard computer displaying the date, current gas consumption, and other information was also standard, and was mounted {{in the center of}} the dashboard, above the factory <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> controls. [...] Only a few options were available on the Aurora including power sunroof, Bose Acoustimass premium amplified sound system, heated front seats, and Autobahn package.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, the Thunderbird {{received}} some exterior updates. The front fascia saw substantial stylistic changes with larger air scoops in the bumper cover, new headlamps, and a new, slightly more curvaceous hood. At {{the center of}} this, the silver Thunderbird logo was moved onto the front bumper cover from the front lip of the hood where it was located previously. The Thunderbird's interior was completely redesigned {{with an emphasis on}} optimizing driver comfort and convenience to the utmost. The redesign featured a [...] "wrap around" [...] cockpit-style layout of instrumentation with a new steering wheel, <b>radio,</b> and <b>climate</b> controls and sweeping curves on the door panels and dashboard surfaces. Complementing the changes to the interior came added driver and passenger safety as Ford made dual front-side airbags standard on all 1994 Thunderbird models.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{other changes}} to the Bel Air during its final years were {{identical}} to the more expensive Caprice and Impala lines, {{some of which were}} mandated by government safety regulations in the U.S. that included [...] front bumpers in 1973 and similar-designed rear bumpers in 1974. The 1975 models had a new roofline and (along with the Impala) grille that was a direct copy of the 1974 Caprice front end. Inside, there were new instrument cluster markings, <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control graphics (the speedometer read up to , and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour). Customers could buy their 1975 Bel Air with two new options: an Econominder gauge package (which included a gauge that monitored fuel economy, due in part to growing demands for fuel economy as well as a temperature gauge) and intermittent wipers.|$|R
50|$|The TurboHydramatic {{transmission}} {{was made}} standard on all cars ordered with a V8 engine starting {{midway through the}} 1971 model year. Production of the Biscayne for the United States market ended in 1972. However, the Biscayne name survived in Canada through the 1975 model year, with a 350 cubic-inch V8 engine and TurboHydramatic automatic transmission made standard in 1974. The station wagon model had been sold as the Brookwood, but for 1973 the Biscayne station wagon made a return for the Canadian market only. Like its stablemates, the 1975 Biscayne received new dashboard, <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control graphics (including a 100-mph speedometer with kilometer equivalents) {{and the availability of}} two new options: an Econominder gauge package (with temperature gauge and a gauge that monitored fuel economy, based on the driver's current driving habits) and intermittent windshield wipers.|$|R
50|$|Most {{other changes}} to the Bel Air during its final years were {{identical}} to the more expensive Caprice and Impala lines, {{some of which were}} mandated by government safety regulations in the U.S. that included 5 mph front bumpers in 1973 and similar-designed rear bumpers in 1974. The 1975 models had a new roofline and (along with the Impala) grille that was a direct copy of the 1974 Caprice front end. Inside, there were new instrument cluster markings, <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control graphics (the speedometer read up to 100 mph, and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour). Customers could buy their 1975 Bel Air with two new options: an Econominder gauge package (which included a gauge that monitored fuel economy, due in part to growing demands for fuel economy as well as a temperature gauge) and intermittent wipers.|$|R
2500|$|The second-generation (2001-2003) Oldsmobile Aurora {{was very}} well {{equipped}} from the factory, as was expected of a luxury vehicle. Standard features on the Aurora were as follows: keyless entry, a security alarm, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with power adjustments for the driver's seat, an AM-FM stereo with radio data system (RDS) and cassette and single-disc CD players, a six-speaker sound system, leather door panel inserts, wood interior trim, automatic climate control, OnStar in-vehicle telematics system (later introduction), steering wheel-mounted <b>climate</b> and <b>radio</b> controls, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power trunk release from the keyless entry remote, a multi-function driver's information center mounted above the factory <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> controls, a rear bench seat with fold-down center armrest, luxury-styled alloy wheels, a spare tire and wheel, automatic front head and fog lamps, a 3.5L V6 engine, a 4-speed automatic transmission, front-wheel-drive (FWD), front and side SRS airbags.|$|R
50|$|On the inside, changes {{included}} a new floor mounted automatic transmission shifter, {{in place of}} the old column shifter (Asia-Pacific model only; US-built Tribute gained the floor shifter in 2005). The dash was updated with a brand-new <b>radio</b> and automatic <b>climate</b> control with digital read-out, on certain models. Mechanically, the rear drum brakes were replaced by disc brakes. Engines remain the same, but the V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%, while the 4-cylinder has improved mid-range torque and an electronic throttle. Both engines had been certified to meet Euro III emission regulations.|$|R
5000|$|The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice {{model was}} revised {{with a new}} front end with a swept back style header panel with {{recessed}} headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the <b>radio</b> and <b>climate</b> control graphics. Speedometers read up to 100 mph, and added kilometers per hour. A High Energy Ignition (HEI) system was officially introduced in 1975, although it was installed on some 1974 cars as a clandestine option. Catalytic converters were also introduced, as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package (which also included a coolant temperature gauge), intermittent wipers, and a divided 50/50 bench seat with passenger-side recliner (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim). This was {{the final year of}} the full-size Chevrolet convertible. Four-door models got new rooflines; the hardtop Sport Sedan got a small triangular [...] "opera window" [...] carved out of the wide roof panel.|$|R
50|$|The BMW 750iL Highline was the top-of-the-line {{model of}} the E32, with lots of added luxury for the rear {{passengers}} like full leather, dual <b>radio</b> controls, dual <b>climate</b> control with coolbox mounted in the center console, electrically heated and adjustable rear seats, walnut veneer folding tables, two crystal glasses neatly placed in the coolbox, legrests, and sun shade all around the rear/side windows. Complete with independent heating and ventilation, it also added a second battery in the trunk and a second alternator to provide power for all these luxuries. The 'Highline' option package cost more than 20,000 DM, and was only available on the 750iL, bringing the total price to well over twice that of a base model 730i.|$|R
