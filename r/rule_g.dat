40|$|We {{report in}} this work the {{thermodynamic}} properties of a double-strained DNA molecule by using a tight-binding Hamiltonian, together with a transfer function employed to simplify the algebra, which can be otherwise quite involved. We consider a model in which the DNA molecule is grown in a substrate following a quasi-periodical fashion of Fibonacci (FB) and Rudin-Shapiro (RS) types [1 - 2]. To setup a quasiperiodic chain of Fibonacci type, we consider that the interaction energies Vij take two different values VG and VC. Starting from a G (guanine) nucleotide as seed, the quasiperiodic FB sequence can be built through the inflation <b>rules</b> <b>G</b> → GC and C → G. On the other hand, the Rudin-Shapiro sequence (another substitutional sequence), which displays an absolutely continuous Fourier measure, can be built through the inflation <b>rules</b> <b>G</b> → GC, C → GA, A → TC, and T → TA.

Dasgupta and Maskin consider the case of a continuum of voters as a means of circumventing the issue of parity. Although their analysis provides an approximation for a sufficiently large (but finite) set of individuals, no exact analysis exists for an arbitrary even number of individuals. We are therefore interested in characterizing the family of strategy-proof social choice rules over the Condorcet domain for an even number of individuals.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a ligand with a protein occurs {{at a local}} site (the binding site) and involves only a few residues; however, the effects of that interaction are often propagated to remote locations. The chain of events initiated by binding provides the basis for fundamental biological phenomena such as allosterism, signal transduction, and structural-stability modification. In this paper, a structure-based statistical thermodynamic approach is presented and used to predict the propagation of the stabilization effects triggered by the binding of the monoclonal antibody D 1. 3 to hen egg white lysozyme. Previously, Williams et al. [Williams, D. C., Benjamin, D. C., Poljak, R. J. & <b>Rule,</b> <b>G.</b> S. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 257, 866 – 876] showed that the binding of this antibody affects the stability of hen egg white lysozyme and that the binding effects propagate to a selected number of residues at remote locations from the binding epitope. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon can be predicted from structure. The formalism presented here permits {{the identification of the}} structural path followed by cooperative interactions that originate at the binding site. It is shown that an important condition for the propagation of binding effects to distal regions is the presence of a significant fraction of residues with low structural stability in the uncomplexed binding site. A survey of protein structures indicates that many binding sites have a dual character and are defined by regions of high and low structural stabilities. The low-stability regions might be involved in the transmission of binding information to other regions in the protein...|$|E

This leads him to interesting and on the whole covinncing reconstructions and results. For example, the author concludes that there must have existed extensive addition tables that have not survived. Although the materials available today seem insufficient to explain how the Egyptians happened to use the qlumsy binary method mu multiplication and division, Gillings' discussion throws light on the problem and poses questions for further research. Careful analysis of special tables and solutions of problems and the comparison of sources enable the author in large measure to reveal the methods and ideas of Egyptian mathematicians. How the Egyptians constructed their tables still remains an unsolved problem. Because divisions sometimes began by dividing by 3, Gillings concludes that tables for 3 must have existed and his reconstruction of such a table has great interstt.

40|$|Glossina pallidipes {{salivary gland}} {{hypertrophy}} virus (GpSGHV; family Hytrosaviridae) is a dsDNA virus exclusively pathogenic to tsetse flies (Diptera; Glossinidae). The 190 kb GpSGHV genome contains 160 open reading frames and encodes more than 60 confirmed proteins.

Although the occurrence of SGH is an {{exception rather than the}} <b>rule,</b> <b>G.</b> pallidipes is thought to be the most susceptible to expression of overt SGH symptoms compared to other Glossina species that are largely asymptomatic. Although Glossina salivary glands (SGs) play an essential role in GpSGHV transmission, the functions of the salivary components during the virus infection are poorly understood. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to study SG proteomes of G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans, two Glossina model species that exhibit differential GpSGHV pathologies (high and low incidence of SGH, respectively). A total of 540 host proteins were identified, of which 23 and 9 proteins were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in G. pallidipes compared to G. m. morsitans. Whereas 58 GpSGHV proteins were detected in G. pallidipes F 1 progenies, only 5 viral proteins were detected in G. m. morsitans. Unlike in G. pallidipes, qPCR assay did not show any significant increase in virus titers in G. m. morsitans F 1 progenies, confirming that G. m. morsitans is less susceptible to GpSGHV infection and replication compared to G. pallidipes.

H 577 P LSGI 2015 Qinxii, 128 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmMaps {{are widely}} used {{in a variety of}} fields, such as research, engineering, economy, politics, and education. However, many maps are criticized for their {{inefficiency}} and/or difficulty in understanding (interpretation), especially those designed by GIS users who have not received proper cartographic training. Efforts have been made by researchers on the development of rule-based systems to assist GIS users to design effective maps. However the results are not very satisfactory, mainly due to the difficulty in acquiring proper knowledge and the lack of proper rules. This project aims to develop one type of rules for cartographic design, more specifically rules for the design of effective map legend. From literature, it has been found that no systematic investigations into effective legend design have been carried out although some aspects of legend design have been touched such as design of legend symbols, evaluation of some feature arrangement and design of interactive legend. As a consequence, this project concentrates on a systematic investigation into the building of cartographic rules essential for the effective arrangement (i. e. spacing, alignment, and grouping) of legend features (i. e. symbols + descriptions) upon Gestalt laws a group of famous visual perception principles. The objectives of this project are then, (1) to build sets of cartographic rules essential for arrangement of legend features upon Gestalt laws, (2) to prioritize these rules, and (3) to examine the applicability of these rules to interactive legends. To achieve these objectives, the first strategy is to make full use of the Gestalt laws for the development of rules for legend design. As a result, four of the thirteen Gestalt laws, i. e. similarity, proximity, continuity and common region, have been utilized for the development of spacing, alignment and grouping rules. The second strategy is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the legends designed based these rules developed in this project, by using experimental testing. To conduct such tests, (a) a web-based system is developed to enable all tests on line; (b) accuracy and efficiency of visual search for a series of features are employed as benchmark; (c) statistical tests, i. e. F-test and t-test, were applied to analyse the results in order to examine {{whether or not there is}} any possible significant improvement. The first set of cartographic rules for legend design developed in this project is spacing rules. A total of nine rules have been built upon similarity and proximity laws. Such rules are used to guide the consideration of spacing between letters, between words, between a symbol and its description, between features, and between groups of features. That is, these rules specify the proper use of spacing to enforce the effective visual grouping of symbols and text in the legend. For example, Spacing <b>Rule</b> (<b>g)</b> states: "the spacing between a symbol and its description must be smaller than the spacing between adjacent lines of features (in row or column) ". This rule makes the symbol and its description grouped together as a group instead of two adjacent neighbouring symbols in different rows in a map legend. Evaluation results of the nine spacing rules indicate that (1) the spacing rules do make the efficiency of legend improved significantly; and (2) spacing rules (a), (h), (i) and (g) are more important than the other spacing rules (b), (d), (c), (e) and (f). The second set of cartographic rules for legend design developed in this project is alignment rules. A total of three rules have been built upon the law of continuity. Such rules are used to guide the consideration of alignment between a symbol and its description, between features, and between groups of features. These rules specify the proper determination of the alignment to enforce the effective visual grouping of symbols and text in the legend. For instance, Alignment Rule (a) states: "a symbol and its description must be aligned along the horizontal centre lines". This rule makes the symbol and its description visually grouped effectively. Evaluation results of the three alignment rules indicate that (1) the alignment rules do make a legend significantly more efficient; and (2) The alignment between features is more important than the alignment between symbol and description and the alignment between groups. The third set of cartographic rules for legend design is grouping rules. A total of three rules have been built upon similarity, proximity and common region laws. These rules specify the proper ways of grouping features to enforce the effective visual grouping of symbols and text in the legend. For example, Grouping Rule (a) states: "symbols to be grouped must be relatively similar". This rule makes the features visually grouped effectively. Evaluation results of the three grouping rules indicate that (1) the grouping rules do make a legend efficiency significantly improved; and (2) The grouping of features upon similarity is more important than the grouping upon common region and the grouping upon proximity. Prioritization of these rules have been made with the results of grouping, spacing, and alignment rules in order, through a theoretical analysis of the intensities of grouping (e. g. grouping features). For instance, the intensity of grouping features by the grouping rules is higher than that by the spacing rules as the effect of combined similarity, proximity and common region is stronger than the effect of proximity. Evaluation results indicate that the grouping rules are more important than the spacing rules, which in turn are more important than the alignment rules. It is expected that the spacing, alignment and grouping rules are not only applicable to the legends in static form, but also to the legends in interactive form. Therefore, the applicability of these rules to control-panel legends was studied. The three types of rules were applied one by one to the interactive legend of the GlobeLand 30 China's global land cover map with 30 m resolution. Evaluation results indicate that all the three types of rules are applicable to interactive legend and the improvement in efficiency of interaction is significant.
