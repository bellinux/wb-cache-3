For this purpose, two sets of imported and domestic raw cane sugars were collected and different factors related to the area size, perimeter, squareness and crystal count were determined. The results showed that the mean area for the imported sets of raw sugars was 154. 1994 pixel while for the domestic sets was 220. 6249 pixel. This parameter reflects the size of crystals.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{introduce}} a cost-effective and environmentally friendly production process of open-cell metal foams with a view to manufacture porous materials exhibiting good morphological and structural homogeneity. The work also focuses on optimizing the production process control to produce higher quality materials and to achieve a better reproducibility and predictability of their properties. A space-holder method using crystalline <b>raw</b> <b>cane</b> <b>sugar,</b> as a novel leachable pattern for manufacturing open-cell metal foams is described. The mechanical behavior of the produced Al-foams as well as the deformation mechanisms developed during mechanical testing are investigated experimentally and analytically through a developed Finite Element Method simulation of compression tests using the real porous geometry, obtained via computed tomography. Additionally, the feasibility for carburized foam production in an one step-process using crystalline <b>raw</b> <b>cane</b> <b>sugar</b> and employing the proposed porous production methodology is investigated, whilst the effect of carburisation on the mechanical and anti-corrosive properties of the produced carburized foams is assessed. A low-vacuum furnace was used for the production process of the porous metals. In order to evaluate the effect of sintering atmosphere on the produced foams and to achieve an effective carburization process a high-vacuum apparatus was constructed. The micro and macro-structure of the produced foams are examined through optical and scanning electron microscopy whereas XRD measurements were used to evaluate the crystal structures and phases produced. Static-compression tests were conducted to assess the influence of morphological and production parameters on the mechanical behaviour of the produced foams. A X-ray tomography apparatus with a 5 μm focal spot reflection target X-ray tube source working in the absorption mode, was used to acquire the 3 D images of the foam samples necessary for the creation of the FEM-based foam model and for the 3 D characterization of the porous products. The thermal analysis via ΤG-DTA measurements was applied on the <b>raw</b> <b>cane</b> <b>sugar</b> to deduce its decomposition temperature. The electrochemical behavior of the Al-foam and carburized Al-foam was monitored by polarization measurements. The proposed method is attractive and environmentally friendly, given that it does not lead to any dangerous by-products or emissions and does not employ any toxic, flammable or explosive material. As an additional benefit, the proposed method is capable of producing low-cost, net-shape metal foams with tailored distribution of pore size or relative density presenting excellent reproducibility and predictability of their properties. The advantages of crystalline <b>raw</b> <b>cane</b> <b>sugar</b> as a novel space-holder are that is chemically stable in contact with the parent metal material and can be easily removed from the green product prior to sintering, Also it is cheap, easy to purchase in the market and does not corrode the foam material. The FEM modeling of the compressive properties of the real foam geometry leads not only to an in-depth understanding of the deformation mechanisms developed but also gives insight to the structure-properties correlation, facilitating thus the final design of the foam material. The feasibility for carburized foam production in an one step-process using crystalline <b>raw</b> <b>cane</b> <b>sugar</b> is among the important advantages of the proposed porous production methodology. The considerable control of carburization process conducted at relatively low temperature (400 oC) leads to an homogeneous distributed carbon layer around each pore enhancing thus the corrosion behaviour of the carburized porous materials. ...|$|E

Since the lower heating value of sucrose is 16.5 MJ/kg, and that of the bagasse is 19.2 MJ/kg, the total heating value of a ton of b&c is 4.7 GJ of which 2.2 GJ come from the sucrose and 2.5 from the bagasse.Per hectare per year, the biomass produced corresponds to 0.27 TJ.
