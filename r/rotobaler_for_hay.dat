40|$|Alsike clover is used <b>for</b> <b>hay,</b> pasture, {{and soil}} improvement, and is {{preferred}} where very wet or acid soils are encountered. It is generally out produced by other clover species for particular uses. Alsike clover is seldom grown by itself as it grows well in mixtures with grasses. Grass/alsike clover mixtures {{are easier to}} harvest <b>for</b> <b>hay</b> because the grass holds the clover more upright. Normally only one cutting can be harvested <b>for</b> <b>hay</b> in a season. Many wildlife species use legumes and are attracted to the early green up to help them recover from the stress of winter. Alsike clover is not particularly noted for providing wildlife cover or food. The flowers are especially attractive to bees, especially honey bees for the nectar and pollen...|$|R

50|$|Hand reaping is done {{by various}} means, {{including}} plucking the ears of grains directly by hand, cutting the grain stalks with a sickle, cutting them with a scythe, or a scythe fitted with a grain cradle. Reaping is usually distinguished from mowing, which uses similar implements, but is the traditional term for cutting grass <b>for</b> <b>hay,</b> rather than reaping cereals. The stiffer, dryer straw of the cereal plants and the greener grasses <b>for</b> <b>hay</b> usually demand different blades on the machines.|$|R
