[...] The lawsuit said that the design [...] "...is likely to cause purchasers and prospective purchasers of the product to believe mistakenly {{that it is a}} new Tennessee white whiskey product in the Jack Daniel's line." [...] The suit asked that all current existing bottles be taken off the market and that all profits from the sales of those bottles be handed over to Jack Daniel's. The lawsuit was settled in 2014 with undisclosed terms, and as of May 2016, the Sutton brand's bottle design has been substantially changed.

30|$|Reduced Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO/ZnO {{nanostructures}} {{were prepared}} through green process. Briefly, equimolar amounts of zinc acetate and copper acetate (8  g - (0.4  mol L− 1)) were added into a 250  mL <b>round</b> <b>bottle</b> containing yellow peel extract of Punica granatum L or punicalagin-polyphenol (at 80  °C)—which acted as both reducing and capping/chelating agent help form radicals which {{aid in the}} formation of nanoscaled materials. A dark brown precipitate of copper oxide (CuO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs), pH 5)) was formed. The precipitate was washed (with distilled water) and collected via a combination of sonication (10  min) and centrifugation (10  min, 1000  rpm). Seventy percent yield of the nanopowder was achieved and was dried in an oven at 65  °C, 1  h. After crashing the prepared Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO/ZnO nanocomposite into a fine powder using mortar and pestle, the nanomaterials were annealed at different temperature (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 500 and 600  °C) after which they were characterised by different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques.|$|E
40|$|When the flat-bottomed, glass-stoppered, <b>round</b> <b>bottle</b> {{traditionally}} {{used to make}} VDRL antigen was discontinued, {{an appropriate}} substitute was needed. Although many laboratories have switched {{to one of the}} other nontreponemal tests for syphilis serology screening, the VDRL test remains the only approved procedure for testing spinal fluids of patients with possible neurosyphilis. We tested 25 -ml glass-stoppered, convex-bottomed Erlenmeyer flasks to determine if these could be used as appropriate substitutes. We tested 52 reactive sera and 54 nonreactive sera by using one reference antigen prepared in the traditional flat-bottomed bottles and five antigens prepared in the Erlenmeyer flasks. Results with all serum samples were comparable. We also tested two lots of a commercial antigen plus an additional lot of reference antigen. Again {{there was no difference in}} the reactivity of the antigens. Therefore, we conclude that 25 -ml glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flasks can be used as an appropriate substitute for glass-stoppered, flat-bottomed, round glass bottles in the making of VDRL antigen...|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of non-invasive NIR and Raman spectrometries for determination of % ethanol content has been investigated. Samples of whisky, vodka and sugary alcoholic drinks were analysed in 200 mL (flat) and 700 mL (<b>round)</b> glass <b>bottles.</b> The NIR spectrometer used double transmission measurements and was limited mainly to {{analysis of the}} signal produced at about 10, 000 cm− 1 by water and ethanol in the samples. The Raman measurements, produced using a 785 nm laser, {{were based on a}} sharp signal from ethanol at 880 cm− 1. A multivariate calibration model, based on a combined PCA–PLS algorithm, was required for analysis by NIR spectrometry, whereas a univariate calibration model was suitable for Raman spectrometry. Both techniques were limited to measurements in clear glass bottles as strong absorption/fluorescence occurred with coloured glass bottles. Bottle-to-bottle variations contributed the largest uncertainty to the measurements obtained for a 20 % (v/v) ethanol solution in flat bottles: 2. 3 % R. S. D. for NIR spectrometry and 2. 2 % R. S. D. for Raman spectrometry. For 700 mL <b>round</b> <b>bottles,</b> which have stricter manufacturing tolerances on glass thickness, the bottle-to-bottle variability for Raman spectrometry was 1. 4 % R. S. D. When spirit samples with ethanol concentrations in the range 19. 9 – 61. 7 % (v/v) were analysed, the precision (average R. S. D.) was 0. 4 and 0. 5 % for NIR (flat <b>bottles)</b> and Raman (<b>round</b> <b>bottles)</b> spectrometries, respectively, and the average accuracy was 2. 1 and 2. 9 %, respectively.

Many wealthy colonists had little to no glass in their households.

It is true that they had not much in common, but that is sometimes an aid rather than a bar to friendship. Each had been an enthusiast in his profession, and had retained all his interest in it. The Doctor still read from cover to cover his Lancet and his Medical Journal, attended all professional gatherings, worked himself into an alternate state of exaltation and depression over the results of the election of officers, and reserved for himself a den of his own, in which before rows of little <b>round</b> <b>bottles</b> full of glycerine, Canadian balsam, and staining agents, he still cut sections with a microtome, and peeped through his long, brass, old-fashioned microscope at the arcana of nature.
