Powered by a 1989cc I6 S20 engine, the second generation GT-R delivered power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox. This car also had both front and rear disk brakes. The suspension was a semi-trailing <b>ring</b> <b>arm</b> setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added.|$|E
50|$|The last {{operating}} park ride, {{and one of}} {{the highlights}} of the park today, is a 1921 Dentzel menagerie carousel with 38 horses, 2 chariots, 4 rabbits, 4 ostriches, a lion, a tiger, a giraffe, and a prancing deer. In its heyday the carousel sported an operating brass ring, in which daring riders could reach out and pull a ring out of a holder next to the carousel. Grabbing a brass ring would win the lucky rider a free ride. The brass <b>ring</b> <b>arm</b> is still visible today, although it no longer operates.|$|E
40|$|In this paper,a filter was {{designed}} basing on the phase shift grating and Sagnac loop. The theoretical {{model of the}} filter using Jones Matrix has been established,and {{the expression of the}} transmission spectrum has been deduced. The numerical simulations and analysis for the transmission spectrum have been carried out. The effect of the parameters of the phase shift grating and optical fiber <b>ring</b> <b>arm</b> length difference on the transmission spectra have been mainly discussed. Through the numerical simulations,the transmission spectra of comb filter characteristics with dual band-pass have been obtained,and they can be applied in the fiber grating sensing and communication systems...|$|E

40|$|We {{theoretically}} study {{a current}} switch that exploits the phase acquired by a charge carrier as it tunnels through a potential barrier in graphene. The system {{acts as an}} interferometer based on an armchair graphene quantum ring, where the phase difference between interfering electronic wave functions for each path can be controlled by tuning either the height or {{the width of a}} potential barrier in the <b>ring</b> <b>arms.</b> By varying the parameters of the potential barriers the interference can become completely destructive. We demonstrate how this interference effect can be used for developing a simple graphene-based logic gate with high on/off ratioComment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5000|$|R.C. MacLeod noted another {{tradition}} {{concerning a}} bull and motto of the clan's chiefs (though not the drinking horn).

During his visit, the MacLeod chief learned {{that one of his}} clansmen was a convicted criminal who had condemned to be gored to death by a bull. The MacLeod chief appealed to Argyll, but the Campbell chief replied that it was too late and that nothing could save the MacLeod clansman. The MacLeod chief then sprang into the <b>ring,</b> <b>armed</b> with only his dirk, and attacked the bull. He grabbed hold of the bull's horns and cried out [...] "hold fast!"

40|$|The Aharonov-Casher (AC) {{oscillations}} of spin current {{through a}} 2 D ballistic {{ring in the}} presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction and external magnetic field has been calculated using the semiclassical path integral method. For classically chaotic trajectories the Fokker-Planck equation determining dynamics of the particle spin polarization has been derived. On the basis of this equation an analytic expression for the spin conductance has been obtained taking into account a finite width of the <b>ring</b> <b>arms</b> carrying large number of conducting channels. It was shown that the finite width results in a broadening and damping of spin current AC oscillations. We found that an external magnetic field leads to appearance of new nondiagonal components of the spin conductance, allowing thus by applying a rather weak magnetic field to change a direction of the transmitted spin current polarization.

40|$|Simulating quantum {{transport}} through mesoscopic, ring-shaped graphene structures, {{we address}} various quantum coherence and interference phenomena. First, a perpendicular magnetic field, penetrating the graphene ring, {{gives rise to}} Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the conductance {{as a function of}} the magnetic flux, on top of the universal conductance fluctuations. At very high fluxes the interference gets suppressed and quantum Hall edge channels develop. Second, applying an electrostatic potential to one of the <b>ring</b> <b>arms,</b> $nn'n$- or $npn$-junctions can be realized with particle transmission due to normal tunneling or Klein tunneling. In the latter case the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations weaken for smooth barriers. Third, if potential disorder comes in to play, both Aharonov-Bohm and Klein tunneling effects rate down, up to the point where particle localization sets in.

In OVW Doug took credit for The Basham Brothers gimmick as his way of getting back at Danny a.k.a. Damaja. The two took part in an epic final encounter which saw Revolution members (including Johnny Spade, Mark Magnus, and Rob Conway) handcuffed to Damaja's allies (including Nick Dinsmore and Johnny Jeter) with Matt Morgan on the entrance ramp to prevent any more run-ins. Damaja was victorious leading to Doug being forced out of OVW. After the match, Doug disbanded Revolution causing the members to attack him and Damaja running back into the <b>ring</b> <b>armed</b> with a Louisville Slugger to make the save.
