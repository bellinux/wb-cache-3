40|$|We report {{experiments}} {{on the production}} of ultracold neutrons (UCN) in a converter of superfluid helium coated with fluorinated grease. We employed our technique of window-free extraction of accumulated UCN from the helium, {{in which they were}} produced by downscattering neutrons of a cold beam from the Munich research <b>reactor.</b> The <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> for UCN passage through the same extraction aperture as in a previous experiment was a factor two shorter, despite a lower mean velocity of the accumulated UCN in the present experiments. A time-of-flight measurement of the cold neutron spectrum incident on the converter allowed us to estimate the multi-phonon contribution to the UCN production. The UCN production rate inferred from two methods agrees with the theoretical expectation. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Objective. In {{mechanically}} ventilated {{patients the}} expiratorytime constant provides information about respiratory mechanics. In thepresent study a new method, fuzzy clustering, is proposed to determine expiratory <b>time</b> <b>constants.</b> Fuzzy clustering differs from other methods since it neither interferes with expiration nor presumes any functional {{relationship between the}} variables analysed. Furthermore, time constantbehaviour during expiration can be assessed, instead of an average timeconstant. The <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> obtained with fuzzy clustering are comparedto <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> conventionally calculated from the same expirations. Methods. 20 mechanically ventilated patients, including 10 patients with COPD, were studied. The data of flow, volume and pressure were sampled. From these data, four local linear models were detected by fuzzy clustering. The <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> (τ) of the local linear models (clusters) were calculated by a least-squares technique. <b>Time</b> <b>constant</b> behaviour was analysed. <b>Time</b> <b>constants</b> obtained with fuzzy clustering were compared to <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> calculated from flow-volume curves usinga conventional method. Results. Fuzzy clustering revealed twopatterns of expiratory <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> behaviour. In the patients with COPD an initial low <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> was found (mean τ 1 : 0. 33 s, SD 0. 21) followed by higher time constants; mean τ 2 : 2. 00 s (SD 0. 91 s), mean τ 3 : 3. 45 s (SD 1. 44) and mean τ 4 : 5. 47 s (SD 2. 93). In the other patients only minor changes in <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> werefound; mean τ 1 : 0. 74 s (SD 0. 30), mean τ 2 : 0. 90 s (SD 0. 23),mean τ 3 : 1. 04 s (SD 0. 42) and mean τ 4 : 1. 74 s (SD 0. 78). Both the pattern of expiratory <b>time</b> <b>constants,</b> {{as well as the}} <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> calculated from the separate clusters, were significantly different between the patients with and without COPD. <b>Time</b> <b>constants</b> obtained with fuzzy clustering for cluster 2, 3 and 4 correlated well with timeconstants obtained from the flow-volume curves. Conclusions. In mechanically ventilated patients, expiratory <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> behaviour can be accurately assessed by fuzzy clustering. A good correlation was found between <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> obtained with fuzzy clustering and <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> obtained by conventional analysis. On the basis of the <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> obtained with fuzzy clustering, a clear distinction was made between patients with and without COPD...|$|R

The <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> was negatively correlated with changes in EtCO(2) (R(partial)  = - 0. 68, p < 0. 000001). This was associated with a decrease in CVR when EtCO(2) increased (R(partial)  = - 0. 80, p < 0. 000001) and C(a) remained independent of changes in EtCO(2). C(a) was negatively correlated with mean ABP (R(partial)  = - 0. 68, p < 0. 000001). In summary, the <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> shortens with increasing EtCO(2).

For clarification purposes the inset shows the same data plotted against the fluences on a linear scale. The first key observation from these data is the value of the <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> (~ 600 fs) at the lowest fluences. The <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> determined from transient differential absorption measurements for the long probing wavelength 980 nm provide a direct measure of the decay <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> for the photogenerated carriers following their energy relaxation to the optical absorption edge. This appears to be very fast and most likely a non-radiative decay into defect/surface-related states in the NWs.

50|$|After {{coherence}} {{is created}} {{in a sample}} by light, the sample emits a polarization wave, the frequency of which is equal to and the phase of which is inverted from the incident light. In addition, the sample is excited by the incident light and a population of molecules in the excited state is generated. The light passing through the sample is absorbed because of these two processes, and it is expressed by an absorption spectrum. The coherence decays with the <b>time</b> <b>constant,</b> T2, {{and the intensity of}} the polarization wave is reduced. The population of the excited state also decays with the <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> of the longitudinal relaxation, T1. The <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> T2 is usually much smaller than T1, and the bandwidth of the absorption spectrum is related to these <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> by the Fourier transform, so the <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> T2 is a main contributor to the bandwidth.
