5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E

5|$|Six {{years after}} the {{creation}} of the Sheffield Rules the Football Association <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> created. These were influenced by the Sheffield game but ongoing disputes meant that the Sheffield rules continued to be used. During this time many of the elements of the <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into the association game. Regular games were played between Sheffield and London using both sets of rules. This led to an agreement on a single set of laws administered by the Football Association in 1877.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the length of the election, during which three of the twenty cardinal-electors died and one resigned, Gregory X promulgated the apostolic {{constitution}} Ubi periculum on July 7 (or 16), 1274, during the Second Council of Lyon, establishing the papal conclave, whose <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> based on the tactics employed against the cardinals in Viterbo.

5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race.

5|$|By the 1850s {{there were}} several {{versions}} of football played in public schools and clubs throughout England.

There the football tended to be unorganised and fairly lawless games known as mob football. Although there are matches between small, equal numbered teams it remained a minority sport until the 1860s.|$|E

5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules {{to be followed by}} all. The <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys.

Harvard won the first game, in which its <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> used, 3–0. The second game, which was played under rugby regulations, did not have a winner as neither team managed to score.|$|E
